PART I


ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

Westmoreland Coal Company's (the "Company") principal business is the 
production and sale of coal in the United States and until recently 
the marketing of coal on a worldwide basis.  Marketed coal has in the 
past included significant amounts produced by unaffiliated producers.   
Beginning in 1992, the Company commenced a strategic review of 
operations as part of a plan to improve cash flows, eliminate
non-strategic or underperforming assets and to reposition itself to 
achieve meaningful and sustainable profitability.   Pursuant to this 
plan, the Company has sold or shut down a number of assets and 
operations, paid off the majority of its principal debt obligations, 
withdrawn from the export market and substantially reduced its 
representation of unaffiliated producers.  As part of this effort the 
Company successfully filed and completed a pre-packaged plan of 
reorganization (the "Plan of Reorganization") under Chapter 11 of the 
Federal Bankruptcy Code in the fourth quarter of 1994.

The Company is also engaged in the business of developing and owning 
interests in cogeneration and other non-regulated independent power 
plants, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Westmoreland Energy, 
Inc.("WEI").  The Company's investment in WEI has grown over the past 
several years and increased substantially in 1994.



COAL OPERATIONS


Coal Production

The Company produces coal in the Eastern and Western United States.  
Eastern operations are conducted on 60,000 acres of reserves located 
in Virginia through the Virginia Division and a wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Pine Branch Mining Incorporated ("Pine Branch").  A 
portion of the reserves in Virginia extend underground into eastern 
Kentucky.  Powder River Basin coal is produced by Westmoreland 
Resources, Inc. ("WRI") from reserves owned by the Crow Indians in 
Montana. 

The following sections describe the Company's current production 
facilities, as well as certain mining operations closed or sold.


Virginia Division.  The Company's Virginia Division consists of eight 
mines of which five are underground mines operated by the Company and 
three are underground mines operated by independent contractors.  
After closing the Wentz mine and reducing employment at the Wentz 
preparation plant at the end of 1994, the Company continues to operate 
two preparation plants and one transloading facility.   The Virginia 
Division shipped 4,512,000 tons, 4,878,000 tons and 4,708,000 tons of 
coal in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, including coal produced by 
independent contractors, coal purchased from Pine Branch and coal 
purchased from off-property locations.  As of December 31, 1994, the 
Virginia Division properties employed 664 people. 

The Company is continuing its efforts to improve the 
competitiveness and profitability of its Virginia Division 
through cost control, productivity improvement and closure of 
non-essential high cost operations.  By July 1996, the Virginia 
Division will lose the benefit of two coal supply contracts 
having sales prices substantially above the current market price 
for similar types of coal.  The Georgia Power Company coal supply 
contract, with shipments of 942,000 tons in 1994, expires in 
April 1995.  The above market price of the Duke Power Company 
coal supply contract, with shipments of 2,792,000 tons in 1994, 
expires in July 1996; however, the contract can be extended 
through December 31, 2000 provided the parties can reach an 
agreement on the sales price after July 1996.   It is likely that 
the new sales price would be at current market prices.  In 1994, 
shipments to these two customers accounted for approximately 83% 
of the Virginia Division's sales tons.  In 1994, the Company's 
Virginia Division experienced an operating loss of $3,726,000, 
including approximately $18,000,000 of non-cash expenses for 
depreciation and postretirement medical costs.   The Virginia 
Division will not be able to operate profitably or generate 
positive cash flow from operations after July 1996, even after 
excluding the ongoing fixed cash costs of idled operations 
(estimated to be in excess of $10,000,000 annually), which 
primarily consist of postretirement medical and workers' 
compensation benefits, unless market prices for eastern coals 
increase significantly and/or the Company is able to 
substantially reduce the cost per ton of the coal produced.  The 
projected cash flows during the next two years, including 
anticipated cash shutdown costs but excluding postretirement 
medical costs, exceed the carrying value of the assets at 
December 31, 1994.  Therefore, the Virginia Division's assets are 
not deemed to be impaired at this time.

The Company is reviewing its options, which include the possible 
future sale, downsizing or shutdown of all or a portion of the 
Virginia Division, at which time the Company may be required to 
recognize, for accounting purposes, a significant portion of its 
postretirement medical liabilities.  The total amount of the 
postretirement medical liabilities which would be expensed at the 
time the Virginia Division's shutdown, downsizing or sale occurs 
is not known at this time, however the impact of this non-cash 
expense on shareholders' equity could affect the Company's 
ability to pay preferred stock dividends.  Refer to Note 10 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information 
regarding the actuarially estimated net present value of 
postretirement medical benefits related to the Company's self-
insured single employer plans and the UMWA Benefit Trust Funds 
which are multiemployer plans.  Refer to Note 12 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding dividend restrictions under Delaware law.

Pine Branch Mining Incorporated.  Pine Branch is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company with surface mining operations on reserves 
subleased from the Virginia Division.  Pine Branch began operations in 
1992 and consists of one mine.  Pine Branch also performs reclamation 
work for the Virginia Division at certain sites that were previously 
abandoned by independent contractors.  Pine Branch shipped 270,000 
tons, 215,000 tons, and 117,000 tons of coal in 1994, 1993 and 1992 
respectively. The majority of Pine Branch's production (188,000 tons, 
174,000 tons and 73,000 tons in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively) is 
sold to the Virginia Division where it is processed and loaded into 
railcars for shipment to customers.


Westmoreland Resources, Inc.  WRI is 60% owned by the Company.  
Morrison Knudsen Corporation owns 24% and Penn Virginia Equities 
Corporation owns 16%.  WRI operates one large surface mine on 
approximately 15,000 acres of subbituminous coal reserves in eastern 
Montana.  WRI shipped 4,364,000 tons, 3,224,000 tons and 3,491,000 
tons of coal in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Morrison Knudsen 
Corporation currently mines WRI's coal reserves under a contract with 
WRI.  The Company received cash dividends from WRI of $1,500,000 and 
$540,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively, however, WRI did not pay a 
cash dividend in 1992.  


Criterion Coal Company.  The Company sold the assets of Criterion Coal 
Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and its affiliated companies,  
("Criterion") on December 22, 1994 to CONSOL of Kentucky, 
Inc.("CONSOL"). Criterion consisted of six mines, including two 
surface mines and four underground mines, and a preparation plant.  
All of the mining operations were conducted by independent contractors 
on Criterion's properties.  Refer to Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 
regarding the sale of Criterion.


Hampton Division.    From January 1994 through April 1994, the Hampton 
Division operations consisted of two underground mines, a large 
surface mine, a central machine shop and a preparation plant.  It 
operated on approximately 14,000 acres in West Virginia and employed 
130 people.  The Hampton Division, except for a contractor-operated 
surface mine with an annual production capacity of approximately 
840,000 tons and the loadout portion of the preparation plant, was 
closed down in May 1994.  This action was necessitated by high 
production costs and market conditions, including the termination of 
an above-market coal sales contract.  The Company sold the assets of 
its Hampton Division in January 1995 and concurrently sold the related 
mining lease back to the lessor, Penn Virginia Resources Corporation.  
Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional discussion related to the sale of the 
Hampton Division.



Coal Marketing

The Company markets coal primarily through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, Westmoreland Coal Sales Company, Inc. ("WCSC"), 
headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Most of the coal now sold by WCSC is processed at and shipped from 
Company properties to electric utilities within the United States.  

Historically, WCSC has also sold steam and metallurgical coal into the 
domestic and export markets.  A significant portion of this coal was 
produced by unaffiliated producers.  These markets and affiliations 
have increasingly suffered from decreasing prices, declining demand 
and/or higher costs and limited supply.  Activities related to 
unaffiliated producers tied up a substantial amount of the Company's 
working capital.  During the five year period from 1990 through 1994, 
the Company established $4,801,000 in reserves for potentially 
uncollectible accounts receivable related to coal sold for 
unaffiliated producers.  Additionally, in 1992 the Company fully 
reserved $20,489,000 of loans, a debt guarantee and other related 
items on behalf of Adventure Resources, Inc. ("Adventure"), an 
unaffiliated producer.  Refer to the Adventure Resources, Inc. section 
of Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details 
related to the establishment of this reserve. 

During 1994 the Company withdrew from the export market and severed 
most of its relationships with remaining unaffiliated producers.  The 
Company's retrenchment in these areas helped conserve capital for 
Company coal production and independent power activities in the face 
of significantly reduced debt resources available to the Company.  

The following tables show, for each of the past five years, tons sold 
and revenues derived from Company and unaffiliated production as well 
as revenues from domestic and export activities. Included in Company 
tonnage below are amounts of produced tonnage purchased from non-
Company properties, but processed through Company facilities.

Curtailment of the representation of unaffiliated producers reduced 
substantially the requirements for capital by the Company.   WCSC was 
the exclusive sales agent for Adventure, whose other affiliated 
companies include M.A.E. Services, Inc. and Maben Energy Corporation.  
As sales agent for Adventure, the Company purchased all of Adventure's 
clean coal production at the time it was produced and carried all 
inventory and accounts receivable related to the sale of Adventure's 
coal production.  Adventure supplied 1,664,000 tons of the total sales 
tons purchased by the Company from unaffiliated producers in 1994.  On 
December 2, 1992 Adventure, and certain of its affiliated companies, 
filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the 
Bankruptcy Code with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the 
Southern District of West Virginia.  In 1992, the Company fully 
reserved the $20,489,000 of loans, a debt guarantee and other related 
items on behalf of Adventure.  Pursuant to a plan, whose terms were 
fully discussed and negotiated with Adventure and related customers, 
the Company terminated its obligation to buy coal from Adventure and 
to provide financial support as of November 8, 1994.  

In January 1993, another large coal operation for which the Company 
acted as sales agent stopped producing coal.  The Company sold 
2,178,000 tons for this producer in 1992.  

As a result of its asset dispositions, withdrawal from the export 
market and reduction in activities related to unaffiliated producers 
during 1994, the Company closed related sales and field offices 
located in Banner, Kentucky; Beckley, West Virginia; and Charlotte, 
North Carolina.  

Criterion and the Hampton Division were responsible for 26% of the 
tons sold and 31% of the coal revenues derived from Company production 
in 1994.  The following tables show, for each of the past five years, 
tons sold and revenue derived from coal produced at Criterion and the 
Hampton Division.

Approximately 81% of the tonnage sold by the Company in 1994 was sold 
under contracts calling for deliveries over a period longer than one 
year ("long-term contracts").  The table below presents total sales 
tonnage and the amount of coal tonnage sold under long-term contracts 
for the last five years:

The decrease in future long-term contract sales tonnage is due to: (1) 
the expiration in April 1995 of the Georgia Power Company contract, 
with shipments of 942,000 tons in 1994, and; (2) the assumed July 1996 
expiration of the Duke Power Company contract, with shipments of 
2,792,000 tons in 1994.  However, although not reflected in the above 
table, the Duke Power Company contract can be extended through 
December 31, 2000, provided the parties can reach agreement on the 
sales price after July 1996.  It is likely that the new sales price 
would be at current market prices.  

The majority of the coal produced by WRI is sold under long-term 
contracts.  The long-term contract with its largest customer expires 
in 2005 and accounted for 60% of the tons sold by WRI in 1994.  

WRI has entered into an option agreement whereby it agreed to sell up 
to an additional 200,000,000 tons of coal through December 31, 2050 to 
a current customer under a long-term contract.  As compensation for 
the option granted, WRI receives 1 1/4 cents, payable quarterly (with 
applicable price adjustments) for each optioned ton.  The option may 
be exercised at any time in whole or in part through  December 31, 
2007. If exercised, the sales price will be based on the market price 
at the time the option is exercised.  WRI recorded income totalling 
$2,961,000 (net of a negotiated $300,000 reduction) and $3,202,000 
during 1994 and 1993, respectively, relative to the option agreement.  
No coal has been delivered under the option agreement.

In 1994, the 10 largest customers of the Company accounted for 70% of 
its coal revenues.  Its two largest customers, Duke Power Company and 
Georgia Power Company, accounted for 28% and 12%, respectively, of the 
Company's coal revenues in 1994 and are expected to account for 
approximately 65% and 8%, respectively, of the Company's coal revenues 
in 1995.  No other customer accounted for as much as 10% of the 
Company's 1994 coal revenues.  WRI's customers accounted for 
$30,728,000 in coal revenues in 1994 from the sale of 4,364,000 tons 
of coal, which represent 8% of the Company's total 1994 coal revenues 
and 29% of the Company's total tons sold in 1994.

Cleancoal Terminal Company ("Cleancoal"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the Company, is a rail-to-barge transloading and storage facility on 
the Ohio River in Kentucky between Louisville, Kentucky and 
Cincinnati, Ohio.  The terminal ceased operations in January 1995 as a 
result of continuing operating losses and an agreement to sell 
Cleancoal's assets in 1995 to an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of 
the CSX Corporation.    Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for more details related to the Cleancoal sale.  The 
majority of Cleancoal's employees were laid off on January 31, 1995.  
The terminal was utilized by the Company to blend and transport coal 
from producers in Kentucky for shipments to midwestern, southern and 
foreign markets.    Cleancoal has an annual transloading capacity of 
6,000,000 tons.  In a highly competitive market, Cleancoal transloaded 
1,304,000 tons, 2,511,000 tons and 2,144,000 tons in 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.  

Westmoreland Terminal Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Company, has a 20% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates ("DTA"), 
the owner of a coal storage and vessel-loading facility in Newport 
News, Virginia.  DTA's annual throughput capacity is 22,000,000 tons, 
and its ground storage capacity is 1,700,000 tons.  In 1994, DTA 
loaded 12,340,000 tons, including 1,250,000 tons for the Company.  The 
terminal was utilized by the Company for most of its coal exporting 
and intracoastal business.  Presently, the Company utilizes the 
terminal to supply domestic customers via intracoastal waterways and 
leases ground storage space and vessel-loading capacity and facilities 
to others.  Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for further information regarding DTA.




INDEPENDENT POWER OPERATIONS

WEI is engaged in the business of developing and owning interests in 
cogeneration and other non-regulated independent power plants.  
Cogeneration is a power production process that provides for the 
sequential generation of two or more useful forms of energy (e.g., 
electricity and steam) from a single primary fuel source (e.g., coal).  
The key elements of a cogeneration project are a long-term contract 
for the sale of electricity, another long-term contract for the sale 
of the steam or other thermal energy, long-term contracts for the fuel 
supply, a suitable site, required permits and project financing.  The 
economic benefits of cogeneration can be substantial because, in 
addition to generating electricity, a significant portion of the 
energy is used to produce steam or high temperature water (thermal 
energy) for industrial processes.  Electricity is sold to utilities 
and in certain situations to end-users of electrical power, including 
large industrial facilities.  Thermal energy from the cogeneration 
plant is sold to commercial enterprises and other institutions.  Large 
industrial users of thermal energy include plants in the chemical 
processing, petroleum refining, food processing, pharmaceutical, pulp 
and paper industries.

A significant market has developed in the United States for power 
generated by cogeneration and other independent power plants.  This 
development was fostered by the energy crises of the 1970's, which led 
to the enactment of legislation that encouraged companies to enter the 
cogeneration and independent power generation industry by reducing 
regulatory requirements and facilitating the sale of electricity by 
such companies to utilities.  WEI is currently pursuing development 
opportunities within the United States.

Opportunities are also available in many foreign countries for  
independent power companies to develop, own and operate electrical 
power facilities.  Using its experience in the United States, WEI has 
pursued opportunities in China, Western Europe and Mexico.  

WEI, through various subsidiaries, currently has interests in eight 
independent power projects which are summarized in the table filed as  
Exhibit 99 to this report.  The Roanoke Valley I ("ROVA I" or  "ROVA I 
Project"), the Rensselaer and the Ft. Lupton projects became 
operational during 1994, bringing the number of projects in commercial 
service to seven.  WEI has a 50% interest in both the ROVA I and 
Rensselaer projects and made equity funding investments for them 
totalling $23,178,000 in 1994.  The Ft. Lupton project did not require 
equity funding by WEI.  Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional information concerning WEI.

As part of its plan to raise cash to address short-term liquidity 
requirements, the Company offered WEI for sale in 1993.  During the 
third quarter of 1994, the Company announced that WEI was no longer 
being offered for sale.


GENERAL


Employees and Labor Relations

The Company, including subsidiaries, employed 829 people on December 
31, 1994 compared with 1,090 on December 31, 1993. Included in these 
figures are 576 and 758 employees represented by the United Mine 
Workers of America ("UMWA"), at December 31, 1994 and December 31, 
1993, respectively.  

The Independent Bituminous Coal Bargaining Alliance ("IBCBA"), an 
alliance of four coal companies, including Westmoreland Coal 
Company, was formed in 1992 to negotiate a wage agreement with the 
UMWA.  The IBCBA and the UMWA successfully reached an interim 
agreement on July 1, 1993.   A successor five year agreement between 
the Company and the UMWA, which retained the major features of the 
interim agreement, became effective as of December 16, 1993 (the 
"1993 Agreement").  The 1993 Agreement provides for the Company and 
the UMWA at the local level to work together to reduce health care 
costs, maximize the utilization of the Company's investments, 
recognize special local operating and competitive conditions, 
provide flexibility in work and scheduling, create incentive 
programs, recognize employees' skills and performance, involve and 
integrate employees and the UMWA in the success of their mines and 
the Company, and improve overall labor management relations.  
Pursuant to the interim agreement and the 1993 Agreement, the 
Company implemented a managed care network in southwest Virginia, 
where most of its active employees are located, and in West 
Virginia, where most of its retired employees are located, in an 
effort to control health care costs.  Participation for retired 
employees covered by the Coal Industry Health Benefit Act of 1992 is 
voluntary.  The 1993 Agreement provided for a wage increase of $.50 
per hour, retroactive to February 1, 1993, the date on which the 
prior five-year agreement expired.  The 1993 Agreement also provides 
for additional wage increases of $.40 per hour on December 16, 1994 
and December 16, 1995, and for additional wage reopeners in 1996 and 
1997.


Competition

The coal industry is highly competitive, and the Company competes 
(principally on price and quality of coal) with many other coal 
producers of all sizes.  The Company, including the production of WRI, 
accounted for an estimated 1% of coal production in the United States 
in 1994.  The nation's largest coal producer accounted for an 
estimated 9% of coal production in the United States in 1994. Coal 
production in the United States reached a record level in 1994. Coal 
usage by electric utilities reached record levels in 1994. Coal fired 
generation was responsible for 56% of all electricity generated within 
the United States.

The Company's steam coal production also competes with other energy 
sources in the production of electricity.  For example, a significant, 
but indirect, cause of lower coal demand in the future in the electric 
utility sector could be low gas prices which could encourage utilities 
to meet a substantial portion of future electricity growth with 
natural gas-fired capacity additions.  Such a strategy would displace 
some potential new coal-fired capacity.  

WEI is subject to increasing competition with respect to the 
development of new cogeneration projects from unregulated affiliates 
of utility companies, affiliates of fuel and equipment suppliers and 
other independent developers.  WEI ranks approximately fortieth in 
size in the independent power industry with net ownership of 233 
megawatts of generation capacity, including 25 megawatts for a project 
under construction, as compared to its largest competitor which has 
net ownership of approximately 5,700 megawatts of generation capacity.

Mining Safety and Health Legislation

The Company is subject to state and federal legislation prescribing 
mining health and safety standards, including the Federal Coal Mine 
Safety and Health Act of 1969 and the 1977 Amendments thereto.  In 
addition to authorizing fines and other penalties for violations, the 
Act empowers the Mine Safety and Health Administration to suspend or 
halt offending operations.

Energy Regulation

WEI's cogeneration operations are subject to the provisions of various 
laws and regulations, including the federal Public Utilities 
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ("PURPA").  PURPA provides qualifying 
cogeneration facility status ("QF") to operations such as WEI's which 
allows those facilities to operate with certain exemptions from 
substantial federal and state regulation, including regulation of the 
rates at which electricity can be sold.  

The most significant recent change in energy regulation was the 
passage of the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 ("EP Act").  
Companies can now apply for Exempt Wholesale Generator ("EWG") status 
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC").   An EWG 
project can provide electrical energy without the requirement to sell 
thermal energy to a user.  The EP Act permits an EWG project to also 
be a QF project.  An EWG that is not a QF project must have its power 
rates approved.  An EWG project that is a QF project can receive 
avoided cost rates that are not subject to approval by FERC.  WEI 
received EWG status and power rate approval for its ROVA I project in 
December 1993 as permitted in its power purchase agreement.  In order 
to provide additional flexibility, in March 1995 WEI received EWG 
status for all of its other projects except Ft. Lupton and Fort Drum.  
WEI intends to maintain the QF status for all its current projects 
except ROVA I.  For projects developed in the future, a case-by-case 
determination of QF and/or EWG status will be completed to optimize 
project returns.  Refer to the 'Recent Developments Relating to 
Independent Power Projects' section of Note 6 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for further information regarding QF issues and 
ROVA I's "forced outage" issue.


Protection of the Environment

Mining Operations.  The Company believes its mining operations are 
substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local 
environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to 
surface mining and reclamation, and it is the policy of the Company to 
operate in compliance with such standards.  Present compliance is 
largely a result of capital expenditures and maintenance and 
monitoring activities.  In 1994 the Company invested approximately 
$597,000 for capital additions and accrued approximately $1,245,000 
against earnings in order to comply with environmental regulations 
applicable to its mining operations.  The $1,245,000 accrual does not 
include a $3,135,000 credit to earnings resulting from a reversal of 
reclamation accruals in connection with the sales of inactive 
properties in West Virginia and the assets of Criterion in Kentucky.  
Actual cash paid to perform reclamation in 1994 amounted to 
$1,000,000.  In 1993 the Company invested approximately $413,000 for 
capital additions and charged $7,247,000 to earnings  which included a 
$4,235,000 accrual as part of the Company's mine closure costs.  In 
addition, reclamation fees imposed by the Federal Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the "Surface Mining Act") 
amounted to approximately $2,414,000 in 1994.

The Company projects that in 1995 it will spend approximately $100,000 
for capital additions and it will expense approximately $930,000 for 
maintenance and monitoring activities to meet environmental 
requirements for operations it continues to own.  The reduction in 
overall expenditures for environmental purposes is largely due to the 
asset dispositions that took place in 1994 and early 1995, pursuant to 
which the buyers assumed reclamation and environmental liabilities.  
Expenditures could change either to reflect the impact of new 
regulations or because presently unforeseeable conditions may be 
imposed on future mining permits.

The Surface Mining Act regulations set forth standards, limitations 
and requirements for surface mining operations and for the surface 
effects of underground mining operations. Under the regulatory scheme 
contemplated by the Surface Mining Act, the Federal Office of Surface 
Mining ("OSM") issued regulations which set the minimum standards to 
which State agencies concerned with the regulation of coal mining must 
adhere.  States that wish to regulate such coal mining must present 
their regulatory plans to OSM for approval.  Once a State plan 
receives final approval, the State agency has primary regulatory 
authority over mining within the State, and OSM acts principally in a 
supervisory role.  State agencies may impose standards more stringent 
than those required by OSM.  The three states in which the Company 
currently mines coal, Virginia, Kentucky and Montana, have all 
submitted regulatory plans to OSM, and these plans have received final 
approval.  There would be potential risk to the Company in the event 
it, or any of its independent contractors, fails to satisfy the 
obligations created by the Surface Mining Act.  Independent 
contractors mining on Company properties,  pursuant to their 
agreements with the Company, are primarily responsible for compliance 
with environmental laws relating to those properties.  In the event, 
however, that any of its independent contractors fail to satisfy their 
obligations under the Surface Mining Act, the Company, depending upon 
the circumstances, might have, and has had, to carry out such 
obligations in order to avoid having its existing permits revoked or 
applications for new permits or permit modifications blocked. 
Compliance with the Surface Mining Act regulations has been costly for 
the Company and the coal mining industry in general.

In 1990 certain amendments were enacted to the Clean Air Act ("1990 
Amendments").  As the first major revisions to the Clean Air Act since 
1977, the 1990 Amendments vastly expanded the scope of federal 
regulations and enforcement in several significant respects.  In 
particular, the 1990 Amendments require that the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency issue new regulations related to ozone 
non-attainment, air toxics and acid rain.  Phase I of the acid rain 
provisions required, among other things, that electric utilities 
reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions to less than 2.5 lbs per million 
Btu by January 1, 1995.  Phase II requires an additional reduction in 
emissions to less than 1.2 lbs per million Btu by January 1, 2000.

The 1990 Amendments allow utilities the freedom to choose the manner 
in which they will effect compliance with the required emission 
standards, including switching to lower sulfur coal, scrubbing and 
using SO2 credit allowances.  The Company currently anticipates little 
or no impact from the ozone non-attainment and air toxic provisions of 
the 1990 Amendments.  


Independent Power.  The environmental laws and regulations applicable 
to the projects in which WEI participates primarily involve the 
discharge of emissions into the water and air, but can also include 
wetlands preservation and noise regulation.  These laws and 
regulations in many cases require a lengthy and complex process of 
obtaining licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state and 
local agencies.  Meeting the requirements of each jurisdiction with 
authority over a project can delay or sometimes prevent the completion 
of a proposed project, as well as require extensive modifications to 
existing projects.  The partnership owners of the projects in which 
WEI has its interests have the primary responsibility for obtaining 
the required permits and complying with the relevant environmental 
laws.

The Clean Air Act and the 1990 Amendments contain provisions that 
regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that may be 
emitted by a project.  Most of the projects in which WEI has 
investments are fueled by low sulfur coal and are not expected to be 
significantly affected by the acid rain provisions of the 1990 
Amendments.  New domestic projects will be required to obtain 
allowance offsets for SO2 emissions if they do not meet emission 
standards.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES


As of December 31, 1994, the Company owned or leased coal properties 
located in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Montana.  The 
Company's estimated demonstrated reserves (excluding reserves deemed 
by the Company to be uneconomic to mine) in owned or leased property 
on December 31, 1994 in the three eastern states were 36,552,000 tons 
and in Montana were 664,495,000 tons.  In the three eastern states the 
Company also owned or leased 320,467,000 tons currently classified by 
the Company as Unassigned Uneconomic.  Unassigned Uneconomic tonnages 
are legally recoverable with current technology, but require 
significant capital expenditures and construction of new mine openings 
and  are not in the Company's mining plans today, because they cannot 
be mined profitably based on current projected economic conditions.  
Nearly all of the Company's eastern reserves are leased from others 
including 334,848,000 tons under lease from Penn Virginia Resources 
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn Virginia Corporation, 
("Penn Virginia") which controlled an 18.95% and 18.96% voting 
interest in the Company at December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993, 
respectively.  All leases with Penn Virginia run to exhaustion of the 
coal reserves.  Properties located in Montana are leased by WRI from 
the Crow Tribe of Indians and run to exhaustion.  The balance of the 
Company's leases are for varying terms, including to exhaustion.  In 
January 1995, as part of its sale of the Hampton Division, the Company 
sold back coal reserve leases in West Virginia (the Hampton Division) 
of 62,875,000 tons to the lessor, Penn Virginia.  These reserves 
consisted of 8,091,000 tons of demonstrated reserves and the balance 
were Unassigned Uneconomic reserves.  Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion about this 
sale.

The following table shows the Company's estimated demonstrated coal 
reserve base and production in 1994. The term "demonstrated coal 
reserve base" is as defined in the "Coal Resource Classification 
System of the U.S. Geological Survey" (Circular 891).  This 
represents the sum of the measured and indicated reserve bases and 
includes assigned and unassigned economic reserves.

</FN>
</TABLE>
Estimates of reserves in the eastern states are based mainly upon 
yearly evaluations made by the Company's professional engineers and 
geologists.  The Company periodically modifies estimates of reserves 
under lease which may increase or decrease previously reported 
amounts.  The reserve evaluations are based on new information 
developed by bore-hole drilling, examination of outcrops, 
acquisitions, dispositions, production, changes in mining methods, 
abandonments and other information.



Coal reserves in Montana represent recoverable tonnage held under the 
terms of the Crow Tribe Lease, as amended in 1982, and other minor 
leases.  These reserves were estimated to be 799,803,000 tons as of 
January 1, 1980 based principally upon a report by independent 
consulting geologists, prepared in February 1980.  The reserves 
consist of two main seams and a stray seam between the upper and lower 
main seams.  Currently, the upper seam, with estimated assigned 
reserves of 250,000,000 tons, is the only seam being mined in response 
to a quality modification currently required by a significant 
customer.  Annually, estimated remaining recoverable reserves are 
reduced by production in the upper main seam and by the amount of 
reserves in the lower and stray seams bypassed after mining the upper 
main seam.
 
In addition to the coal reserves mentioned above, as of December 31, 
1994 the Company owns several coal preparation and loading facilities 
in Virginia and West Virginia.  WRI owns and operates a dragline and 
coal crushing and loading facilities at its mine in Montana.

Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a 
description of the properties in which WEI has an interest.









ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


Bankruptcy Proceedings

On November 8, 1994, the Company filed a petition under Chapter 11 of 
the Federal Bankruptcy Code seeking the confirmation of a so-called 
"pre-packaged" Plan of Reorganization.  This measure was taken to 
obtain protection from the Company's principal lenders pending the 
closing of the sale of the assets of Criterion which closing was also 
facilitated by the filing.  The Federal Bankruptcy Court approved the 
Company's Plan of Reorganization on December 16, 1994.  As approved in 
the Plan of Reorganization, the Company proceeded to complete its sale 
of the assets of Criterion on December 22, 1994 and paid in full its 
maturing debt obligations, at which time it emerged from bankruptcy.  
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
additional information concerning the Company's Plan of 
Reorganization.

Westmoreland Energy, Inc.

WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E Partners (the 
"ROVA Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's principal customer 
contracted to purchase the electricity generated by ROVA I under a 
long-term contract.  In the second quarter of 1994, that customer 
disputed the ROVA Partnership's interpretation of the provisions of 
the contract dealing with the payment of the capacity purchase price 
when the facility experiences a forced outage day.  A forced outage 
day is a day when ROVA I is not able to generate a specified level of 
electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the customer is 
required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full capacity purchase price 
unless forced outage days exceed a contractually stated annual number.  
The customer asserts that it is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1994, the customer withheld approximately 
$5,856,000 of capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA Partnership 
because of this dispute.  On October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership 
filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, 
Virginia to recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments 
may not be withheld in the future.  On December 12, 1994 the customer 
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and on March 17, 1995 the 
Court granted this motion.  The ROVA Partnership is evaluating its 
legal options which include the possibility of an appeal of this 
ruling.  The capacity purchase price withheld had been included in the 
revenues and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve was 
recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount withheld by the 
customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share of the withheld payments 
in earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1994.  In the 
fourth quarter of 1994, WEI's revenues were reduced by $2,928,000, 
representing its 50% share of the disputed amount.  The customer has 
withheld an additional $872,000 from the ROVA Partnership through 
March 24, 1995.  No earnings are being recognized by WEI in 1995 for 
payments withheld by the customer relating to forced outage days.  The 
Company believes that the ROVA Partnership's position is correct.  
However, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of this 
proceeding, or the amount, if any, that the customer may be ordered to 
pay related to this matter.  Additionally, WEI has been evaluating 
ways to minimize the number of forced outage days in the future.  
Regardless of the outcome, the Company believes ROVA I will continue 
to operate profitably and generate positive cash flows.  Refer to the 
Recent Developments Relating to Independent Power Projects' section of 
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of 
other legal issues involving WEI.

		6.  Action Prior to the Closing Date.
		The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to 
take the following actions between the date hereof and the 
Closing Date:
		6.1.  Investigation of the Purchased Assets by Buyer. 
WCC and Seller shall afford to the officers, employees and 
authorized representatives of Buyer (including, without 
limitation, independent public accountants, engineering and

Seller to the extent Buyer shall deem necessary or desirable and 
shall furnish to Buyer or its authorized representatives such 
additional information concerning the Purchased Assets as shall

be reasonably necessary to enable Buyer or its representatives to 
verify the accuracy of the representations and warranties 
contained in this Agreement, to verify that the covenants of 
Seller contained in this Agreement have been complied with and to 
determine whether the conditions set forth in paragraph 9.2 
hereof have been satisfied.  Buyer agrees that such investigation 
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere 
unreasonably with the operations of WCC or Seller.  No 
investigation made by Buyer or its representatives hereunder 
shall affect the representations and warranties of WCC or Seller 
hereunder.
		6.2.  Preserve Accuracy of Representations and 
Warranties.  Each of the parties hereto shall refrain from taking 
any action which would render any representation or warranty 
contained in paragraph 5.1 or 5.2 of this Agreement inaccurate as 
of the Closing Date.  Each party shall promptly notify the other 
of any action, suit or proceeding that shall be instituted or 
threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise 
challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this 
Agreement.  WCC and Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any 
lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation that may be 
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against WCC or Seller

claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date

of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise 
satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 9.1.4 and 9.2.5 
hereof; provided that WCC and Seller shall not have any 
obligation to offer or pay any consideration in order to obtain 
any such consents or approvals; and provided, further, that WCC 
and Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding 
affecting the Purchased Assets as a condition for obtaining any 
such consents or waivers except with the prior written consent of 
Buyer.  During the period prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall 
act diligently and reasonably to cooperate with WCC and Seller to 
obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this 
paragraph 6.3(a).
		(b)  During the period prior to the Closing Date, WCC, 
Seller and Buyer shall act diligently and reasonably, and shall

this Agreement, or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth 
in paragraphs 9.1.3 and 9.2.4 hereof; provided that WCC and 
Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting 
the Purchased Assets as a condition for obtaining any such 
consents or approvals except with the prior written consent of 
Buyer.
		6.4.  Operations Prior to the Closing Date.  (a)  WCC

operating condition and repair.  Prior to the Closing Date,

contract mining of any Owned Real Property or exercise any 
option to extend an In Lease or an Out Lease;  
		(ii)	sell, lease (as lessor), transfer or otherwise 
dispose of (including any transfers from Seller to any of

		(iii)	without the prior written consent of Buyer, 
terminate, modify or amend in any material respect any 
Seller Contract, except as contemplated by this Agreement.

cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice the notifications 
and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act, or 
any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to 
the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each party shall make its 
best efforts to assure that all such filings will be done in a 
professional manner and in accordance with the HSR Act and any 
such rules and regulations.  Each of Buyer and WCC agrees to make 
available to the other such information as each of them may 
reasonably request relative to the business, assets and property 
of Buyer or WCC, as the case may be, as may be required of each 
of them to file any additional information requested by such 
agencies under the HSR Act and any such rules and regulations.  
Each of WCC and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its 
Affiliates to, provide such additional information and 
documentary materials and take all reasonable actions necessary, 
and will cooperate with each other, to obtain approval of the 
transactions contemplated hereunder by the Federal Trade 
Commission and the Department of Justice.
		7.  Additional Agreements.
		7.1.  Discharge of Seller's Liabilities.  WCC and 
Seller covenant and agree that they will pay and discharge, and 
hold Buyer harmless from, each and every liability and obligation 
of WCC and Seller in respect of the Purchased Assets arising from 
events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, excepting only 
those liabilities and obligations expressly assumed by Buyer at 
the Closing pursuant to instruments of assumption delivered to 
WCC and Seller at the Closing, it being understood and agreed 
that Buyer is assuming no liabilities or obligations of WCC or 
Seller other than liabilities and obligations so expressly 
assumed by Buyer.
		7.2.  Expenses.  Each of the parties shall be 
responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by 
it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees, 
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and accountants and 
other expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of 
this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all 
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be 
performed or complied with.  In all events, Buyer shall be solely 
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in any 
examination or investigation regarding Seller, which Buyer 
elected to carry out, including, without limitation, the cost of 
any examination of title to the Real Property.
		7.3.  Further Assurances.  On the Closing Date WCC and 
Seller shall (i) deliver to Buyer such other bills of sale, 
deeds, endorsements, assignments and other good and sufficient 
instruments of conveyance and transfer, in form reasonably 
satisfactory to Buyer and its counsel, as Buyer may reasonably 
request or as may be otherwise reasonably necessary to vest in 
Buyer all the right, title and interest of Seller in, to or under 
any or all of the Purchased Assets, and (ii) take all steps as 
may be reasonably necessary to put Buyer in actual possession and 
control of all the Purchased Assets.  From time to time following 
the Closing, WCC and Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause 
to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of 
conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may 
be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and transfer 
to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any part 
of the Purchased Assets, and, in the case of licenses, 
certificates, approvals, authorizations, agreements, contracts, 
leases, easements and other commitments included in the Purchased 
Assets (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned effectively 
without the consent of third parties which consent has not been 
obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate with Buyer at its 
request in endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if 
any such consent is unobtainable, to use its best efforts to 
secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (b) 
which are otherwise not transferable or assignable, to use its 
best efforts jointly with Buyer to secure to Buyer the benefits 
thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the 
rights of Seller thereunder); provided, however, that nothing 
herein shall relieve WCC or Seller of its obligations under 
paragraph 6.3.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to 
assign any license, certificate, approval, authorization, 
agreement, contract, lease, easement or other commitment included 
in the Purchased Assets if an attempted assignment thereof 
without the consent of a third party thereto would constitute a 
breach thereof.  Should title to any real property located within 
the outer boundary of or abutting the Owned Real Property or 
Leased Real Property be owned by WCC or Seller on the Closing 
Date and not transferred to Buyer at the Closing Date, then WCC 
or Seller shall transfer same to Buyer without additional 
consideration.
		7.4.  Prorations.  (a)  The income, expenses and 
liabilities attributable to the Purchased Assets through the 
Valuation Date shall be for the account of Seller.  Seller shall 
be responsible for all Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets 
and the business operations of Seller for the period including 
and prior to the Valuation Date.  Buyer shall be responsible for 
all Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets for the period 
beginning after the Valuation Date.  Seller and Buyer shall each 
pay half of any recording, transfer, sales and similar taxes 
required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Purchased 
Assets.  All royalties, rentals and other payments due under the 
Seller Contracts shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of 
the Valuation Date, with Seller paying to Buyer all amounts 
received by Seller prior to the Closing Date under the Out Leases 
in respect of the period after the Valuation Date and Buyer 
reimbursing Seller for all amounts paid by Seller prior to the 
Closing Date under the Seller Contracts in respect of the period 
after the Valuation Date (including all unrecouped advance or 
minimum royalties under the In Leases paid by Seller prior to the 
Closing Date in respect of the period after the Closing Date).
		(b)	Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within 75 days 
after the Closing Date, a statement setting forth in reasonable 
detail the calculation of amounts due Seller or Buyer under 
paragraph 7.4(a).  Buyer shall have 60 days after receipt thereof 
to review the details thereof.  If Buyer does not object thereto 
in writing during such review period, then such calculations 
shall be final and binding.  If Buyer objects thereto in writing 
within such review period, then the parties shall use their 
reasonable efforts to resolve their differences and, in the event 
Seller and Buyer so resolve any such differences, the 
calculations, as adjusted by the adjustments agreed to by the 
parties, shall be final and binding.  If Seller and Buyer are 
unable to resolve such differences within the next 30 days

matters.  The calculations, after giving effect to any

disputed matters by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and 
binding.  Any payments required to be made by Buyer or Seller in 
respect of such calculations shall be made promptly (but not

employ legal counsel if necessary to its resolution and all costs 
of such Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and 
Buyer.

proceeding, pending or threatened, which relates to the Purchased 
Assets and in connection therewith each party shall, without 
limitation, make available to the other party during normal 
business hours (i) all books and records relating thereto in its 
possession, and (ii) all employees of such party or its 
Affiliates having knowledge of the matters in controversy.  Such 
access shall be afforded upon receipt of reasonable advance 
notice and shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations 
of the party being requested to furnish the information.  The 
party requesting the information shall be responsible for any 
significant costs or expenses incurred by the party furnishing 
the information pursuant to this paragraph 7.5.
		7.6.  Post-Closing Remittances.  If, after the Closing 
Date, WCC or Seller shall receive any remittance with respect to 
a Seller Contract which relates to the period after the Valuation 
Date, WCC or Seller shall endorse such remittance to the order of 
Buyer and forward it to Buyer promptly following receipt thereof.  
Conversely, if, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall receive any

corporations to maintain their corporate existence, and to keep 
itself and such other corporations in good standing (or to cause 
such other corporations to remain in good standing) and properly 
qualified to do business in the applicable jurisdiction of 
incorporation; provided, however, that this covenant by WCC shall 
be subject to the following exceptions and qualifications:
		(i)  WCC may consolidate with, or merge with or into 
any other corporation (whether or not WCC shall be the 
surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer or lease 
all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an 
entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person or 
group of affiliated Persons, in one transaction or a series 
of related transactions, if either:  (A) WCC shall be the 
surviving corporation or surviving Person; or (B) the 
surviving corporation or surviving Person (if other than 
WCC) formed by such consolidation or with which or into 
which WCC is merged or the Person (or group of affiliated 
Persons) to which all or substantially all the properties or 
assets of WCC as an entirety or substantially as an entirety 
are sold, assigned, transferred or leased shall be a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the 
United States of America or any state thereof or the 
District of Columbia and shall expressly assume all the 
obligations of WCC under this Agreement, including but not 
limited to paragraph 8.1(iv) and (v) hereof.
		(ii)  WCC may dissolve voluntarily under applicable 
state law if, prior to such dissolution, WCC has provided 
for all liabilities it may then have under the Act.  WCC 
shall be deemed to have provided for such liabilities under 
the Act only if:  (A) the trustees under the Act shall agree 
in writing that they will release all claims against WCC and 
any Related Persons or "successors in interest" (as such 
terms are used and defined in the Act) if WCC pays to the 
trustees the amounts so provided for in the dissolution 
proposal to be submitted to the stockholders of WCC for 
approval; and (B) WCC pays, or deposits funds with a third 
party that will provide for payment of, such amounts to the 
trustees.
	   (iii)  This paragraph 7.7 shall have no further force and 
effect if (A) the Act in its entirety, or the provisions 
thereof imposing liability on any "successor in interest," 
shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to 
be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, provided that, in 
such case, the ruling of such court is not subject to 
further appeal, and such Act is not, with sixty months 
thereafter, amended or replaced by legislation which would 
impose a liability upon any Buyer Group Member for health or 
death benefits of former employees of WCC or Seller, or (B) 
Congress repeals the Act or the provision thereof that 
imposes liability on "successors in interest" and Congress 
does not, within sixty months after such repeal, enact new 
legislation the effect of which is to impose liability upon 
any Buyer Group Member for the health or death benefits of 
former employees of WCC or Seller.
		(iv)  Capitalized terms used in this paragraph but not 
defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned 
thereto in the Act.

promptly submit an "Operator Change Application" with the 
Kentucky Environmental Cabinet on Form MPA-08 (or any successor

of the change be the Closing Date.  With respect to each of the 
Governmental Permits and each of the bonds listed on Schedule 
5.1.14, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify 
and hold WCC and Seller harmless from and against any Losses or 
Expenses WCC or Seller may incur under any such permit or bond by

Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold 
harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and all 
Loss and Expense imposed upon or incurred by such Buyer Group 
Member as a result of, in connection with or arising from:

performance by WCC or Seller of, any covenant, agreement or 
obligation to be performed by WCC or Seller pursuant to this

eligible beneficiaries assigned to Seller or WCC under the 
Act to unassigned beneficiaries or from the transfer of any 
beneficiaries from any employer funds of WCC or Seller to 
any fund under the Act, provided that such transfer is 
caused by a breach by WCC or Seller of this Agreement or is 
caused by actions taken by WCC or Seller pursuant to clause

provided, however, that WCC and Seller shall be required to

incurred by Buyer Group Members under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) 
of this paragraph 8.1 (other than Loss and Expense incurred as a

proviso shall have no effect) only to the extent that the 
aggregate amount of such Loss and Expense exceeds $1,000,000 and 
is no greater than $15,000,000.  The indemnification provided for 
in this paragraph 8.1 shall terminate two years after the Closing 
Date (and no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under 
this paragraph 8.1 thereafter), except that the indemnification 
by WCC and Seller shall continue as to:

Member has notified WCC or Seller in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph 8.3 hereof on or prior to the date

with this paragraph 8.1, as to which the obligation of WCC 
and Seller shall continue until the liability of WCC and 
Seller shall have been determined pursuant to this paragraph 
8.1, and WCC or Seller shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group

any representation of Buyer contained or referred to in this 
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of

Agreement, or any act or omission by Buyer occurring on or 
after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Assumed 
Liabilities; and  
		(iv)	any and all debts, obligations and liabilities 
(other than Excluded Liabilities) resulting from or in 
connection with Buyer's ownership of the Purchased Assets 
arising or occurring after the Closing;
provided, however, that Buyer shall be required to indemnify and 
hold harmless under clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph 8.2 
with respect to Loss and Expense incurred by Seller Group Members 
only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Loss and 
Expense exceeds $1,000,000 (except with respect to Loss or 
Expense under paragraph 7.9, as to which this limitation shall 
not apply) but is not greater than $15,000,000.  The 
indemnification provided for in this paragraph 8.2 shall 
terminate two years after the Closing Date (and no claims shall 
be made by any Seller Group Member under this paragraph 8.2 
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall 
continue as to:

notified Buyer in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph 8.3 hereof on or prior to the date such 
indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with 
this paragraph 8.2, as to which the obligation of Buyer 
shall continue until the liability of Buyer shall have been 
determined pursuant to this paragraph 8.2, and Buyer shall 
have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount 
of such Loss and Expense in accordance with this paragraph 
8.2.
		8.3.  Notice of Indemnity Claims.  (a) Any Buyer Group 
Member or Seller Group Member (the "Indemnified Party") seeking 
indemnification hereunder shall give to the party obligated to 
provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the 
"Indemnitor") a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in 
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for 
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice 
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the 
amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this 
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed 
hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is 
based; provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at 
law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which 
indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the 
action or suit is commenced; and provided, further, that failure 
to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its 
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been 
prejudiced by such failure.
		(b)	After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant 
hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified 
Party shall be entitled under this paragraph 8 shall be 
determined:  (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified 
Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of 
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means 
to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. 
The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the 
time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall 
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally 
determined.  The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof 
in establishing the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by it.
		8.4.  Third Person Claims.  (a) Subject to paragraph 
8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and 
control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise 
or settlement of any third Person claim, action or suit against 
such Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought 
by any Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in 
any such case the Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection 
therewith and shall furnish such records, information and 
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, 
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by 
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; provided, that the 
Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at 
its own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit 
as to which the Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and 
control the defense thereof; and provided, further, that the 
Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the 
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), pay, compromise or settle any such claim, action or 
suit, except that no such consent shall be required if, following 
a written request from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor 
shall fail, within 14 days after the making of such request, to 
acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such claim, action or 
suit shall be adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an 
obligation to provide indemnification hereunder to such 
Indemnified Party.
		(b)	If any third Person claim, action or suit against 
any Indemnified Party is solely for money damages or, where WCC 
or Seller is the Indemnitor, will have no continuing effect in 
any material respects on the Purchased Assets, then the 
Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and control, through 
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of 
any such third Person claim, action or suit against such 
Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by 
any Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor hereunder if the 
Indemnitor has acknowledged and agreed in writing that, if the 
same is adversely determined, the Indemnitor has an obligation to 
provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party in respect 
thereof, and in any such case the Indemnified Party shall 
cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such records, 
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery 
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably 
requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith; provided, 
that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel 
chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such 
claim, action or suit as to which the Indemnitor has so elected 
to conduct and control the defense thereof.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, 
settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit; provided, 
that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to 
indemnity therefor hereunder.

		11.13.  Severability of Provisions.  Wherever possible, 
each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to 
be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision 
of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstances shall, to any extent and for any reason, be held in 
any proceeding to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such 
provision, or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstance, shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the 
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability 
without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provision or any other provisions hereof or the 
application of such provision to persons or circumstances other

unenforceable, but only if and to the extent such construction

essential objectives as expressed herein.
		11.14.  Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waivers.  This 
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules referred to 
herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto) constitutes

of the parties hereto, including without limitation the 
Confidentiality Agreement.  This Agreement shall not be amended, 
modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by 
an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.  Any 
term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time 
for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties 
entitled to the benefit thereof.  Any such waiver shall be 
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this 
Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an 
authorized representative of such party.  The failure of any 
party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this 
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such 
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this 
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter 
to enforce each and every such provision.  No waiver of any 
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of 
any other or subsequent breach.
		11.15.  Confidential Nature of Information.  Each party 
agrees that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials 
and other information which it shall have obtained regarding the 
other party during the course of the negotiations leading to the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether 
obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the 
investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this 
Agreement and other related documents, and, in the event the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated, each 
party will return to the other party all copies of nonpublic 
documents and materials which have been furnished in connection 
therewith.  Such documents, materials and information shall not 
be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of 
Buyer, to its counsel, accountants, financial advisors or 
lenders, and in the case of Seller, to its counsel, accountants 
or financial advisors).  No other party shall use any 
confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely 
for the purpose of evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of 
the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that after the Closing 
Buyer may use or disclose any confidential information related to 
the Purchased Assets.  The obligation of each party to treat such 
documents, materials and other information in confidence shall 
not apply to any information which (i) is or becomes available to 
such party from a source other than such party, (ii) is or 
becomes available to the public other than as a result of 
disclosure by such party or its agents, (iii) is required to be 
disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, but only to 
the extent it must be disclosed, or (iv) such party reasonably 
deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or 
approvals contemplated hereby.

any action which would render any representation or warranty 
contained in paragraph 5.1 or 5.2 of this Agreement inaccurate as 
of the Closing Date.  Each party shall promptly notify the other 
of any action, suit or proceeding that shall be instituted or 
threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise 
challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this 
Agreement.  WCC and Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any 
lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation that may be 
threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against WCC or Seller 
which would have been listed in Schedule 5.1.12 if such lawsuit, 
claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date 
hereof.
		6.3.  Consents of Third Parties; Governmental 
Approvals.  (a)  WCC and Seller will act diligently and 
reasonably to secure, before the Closing Date, the consent, 
approval or waiver, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory 
to Buyer, from any party to any Seller Contract required to be 
obtained by the terms thereof or otherwise for the consummation 
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise 
satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraphs 9.1.4 and 9.2.5 
hereof; provided that WCC and Seller shall not have any 
obligation to offer or pay any consideration in order to obtain 
any such consents or approvals; and provided, further, that WCC 
and Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding 
affecting the Purchased Assets as a condition for obtaining any 
such consents or waivers except with the prior written consent of 
Buyer.  During the period prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall 
act diligently and reasonably to cooperate with WCC and Seller to 
obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this 
paragraph 6.3(a).
		(b)  During the period prior to the Closing Date, WCC, 
Seller and Buyer shall act diligently and reasonably, and shall 
cooperate with each other, to secure any consents and approvals 
of any Governmental Body required to be obtained by them in order 
to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by 
this Agreement, or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth 
in paragraphs 9.1.3 and 9.2.4 hereof; provided that WCC and 
Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting 
the Purchased Assets as a condition for obtaining any such 
consents or approvals except with the prior written consent of 
Buyer.
		6.4.  Operations Prior to the Closing Date.  (a)  WCC 
and Seller shall keep and maintain the Purchased Assets in good 
operating condition and repair.  Prior to the Closing Date, 
Seller shall operate the Purchased Assets in the same general 
manner and procedure as it operated such Purchased Assets prior 
to execution of this Agreement, maintaining a normal supply of 
spare parts and producing a reasonably like quantity and quality 
of coal as is adequate to meet then-existing requirements of Coal 
Supply Contracts.  
		(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph 6.4(a) hereof, except as 
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or except with the 
express written approval of Buyer, WCC and Seller shall not:  
		(i)	enter into any contract for the sale, lease or 
contract mining of any Owned Real Property or exercise any 
option to extend an In Lease or an Out Lease;  
		(ii)	sell, lease (as lessor), transfer or otherwise 
dispose of (including any transfers from Seller to any of 
its Affiliates), or mortgage or pledge, or impose or suffer 
to be imposed any Encumbrance on, any of the Purchased 
Assets except for Permitted Encumbrances; or  
		(iii)	without the prior written consent of Buyer, 
terminate, modify or amend in any material respect any 
Seller Contract, except as contemplated by this Agreement.
		6.5.  Antitrust Law Compliance.  As promptly as 
practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and WCC shall file or 
cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice the notifications 
and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act, or 
any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to 
the transactions contemplated hereby.  Each party shall make its 
best efforts to assure that all such filings will be done in a 
professional manner and in accordance with the HSR Act and any 
such rules and regulations.  Each of Buyer and WCC agrees to make 
available to the other such information as each of them may 
reasonably request relative to the business, assets and property 
of Buyer or WCC, as the case may be, as may be required of each 
of them to file any additional information requested by such 
agencies under the HSR Act and any such rules and regulations.  
Each of WCC and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its 
Affiliates to, provide such additional information and 
documentary materials and take all reasonable actions necessary, 
and will cooperate with each other, to obtain approval of the 
transactions contemplated hereunder by the Federal Trade 
Commission and the Department of Justice.
		7.  Additional Agreements.
		7.1.  Discharge of Seller's Liabilities.  WCC and 
Seller covenant and agree that they will pay and discharge, and 
hold Buyer harmless from, each and every liability and obligation 
of WCC and Seller in respect of the Purchased Assets arising from 
events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, excepting only 
those liabilities and obligations expressly assumed by Buyer at 
the Closing pursuant to instruments of assumption delivered to 
WCC and Seller at the Closing, it being understood and agreed 
that Buyer is assuming no liabilities or obligations of WCC or 
Seller other than liabilities and obligations so expressly 
assumed by Buyer.
		7.2.  Expenses.  Each of the parties shall be 
responsible for and shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by 
it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, all fees, 
expenses and disbursements of its counsel and accountants and 
other expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of 
this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all 
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be 
performed or complied with.  In all events, Buyer shall be solely 
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in any 
examination or investigation regarding Seller, which Buyer 
elected to carry out, including, without limitation, the cost of 
any examination of title to the Real Property.
		7.3.  Further Assurances.  On the Closing Date WCC and 
Seller shall (i) deliver to Buyer such other bills of sale, 
deeds, endorsements, assignments and other good and sufficient 
instruments of conveyance and transfer, in form reasonably 
satisfactory to Buyer and its counsel, as Buyer may reasonably 
request or as may be otherwise reasonably necessary to vest in 
Buyer all the right, title and interest of Seller in, to or under 
any or all of the Purchased Assets, and (ii) take all steps as 
may be reasonably necessary to put Buyer in actual possession and 
control of all the Purchased Assets.  From time to time following 
the Closing, WCC and Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause 
to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of 
conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may 
be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and transfer 
to, and vest in, Buyer and put Buyer in possession of, any part 
of the Purchased Assets, and, in the case of licenses, 
certificates, approvals, authorizations, agreements, contracts, 
leases, easements and other commitments included in the Purchased 
Assets (a) which cannot be transferred or assigned effectively 
without the consent of third parties which consent has not been 
obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate with Buyer at its 
request in endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if 
any such consent is unobtainable, to use its best efforts to 
secure to Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (b) 
which are otherwise not transferable or assignable, to use its 
best efforts jointly with Buyer to secure to Buyer the benefits 
thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the 
rights of Seller thereunder); provided, however, that nothing 
herein shall relieve WCC or Seller of its obligations under 
paragraph 6.3.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to 
assign any license, certificate, approval, authorization, 
agreement, contract, lease, easement or other commitment included 
in the Purchased Assets if an attempted assignment thereof 
without the consent of a third party thereto would constitute a 
breach thereof.  Should title to any real property located within 
the outer boundary of or abutting the Owned Real Property or 
Leased Real Property be owned by WCC or Seller on the Closing 
Date and not transferred to Buyer at the Closing Date, then WCC 
or Seller shall transfer same to Buyer without additional 
consideration.
		7.4.  Prorations.  (a)  The income, expenses and 
liabilities attributable to the Purchased Assets through the 
Valuation Date shall be for the account of Seller.  Seller shall 
be responsible for all Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets 
and the business operations of Seller for the period including 
and prior to the Valuation Date.  Buyer shall be responsible for 
all Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets for the period 
beginning after the Valuation Date.  Seller and Buyer shall each 
pay half of any recording, transfer, sales and similar taxes 
required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Purchased 
Assets.  All royalties, rentals and other payments due under the 
Seller Contracts shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of 
the Valuation Date, with Seller paying to Buyer all amounts 
received by Seller prior to the Closing Date under the Out Leases 
in respect of the period after the Valuation Date and Buyer 
reimbursing Seller for all amounts paid by Seller prior to the 
Closing Date under the Seller Contracts in respect of the period 
after the Valuation Date (including all unrecouped advance or 
minimum royalties under the In Leases paid by Seller prior to the 
Closing Date in respect of the period after the Closing Date).
		(b)	Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within 75 days 
after the Closing Date, a statement setting forth in reasonable 
detail the calculation of amounts due Seller or Buyer under 
paragraph 7.4(a).  Buyer shall have 60 days after receipt thereof 
to review the details thereof.  If Buyer does not object thereto 
in writing during such review period, then such calculations 
shall be final and binding.  If Buyer objects thereto in writing 
within such review period, then the parties shall use their 
reasonable efforts to resolve their differences and, in the event 
Seller and Buyer so resolve any such differences, the 
calculations, as adjusted by the adjustments agreed to by the 
parties, shall be final and binding.  If Seller and Buyer are 
unable to resolve such differences within the next 30 days 
following such review period, then Buyer and Seller shall submit 
the objections that are unresolved to the Accounting Firm, which 
shall be instructed to resolve the unresolved objections as 
promptly as reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice 
to Buyer and Seller setting forth its resolution of the disputed 
matters.  The calculations, after giving effect to any 
adjustments agreed to by the parties and to the resolution of 
disputed matters by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and 
binding.  Any payments required to be made by Buyer or Seller in 
respect of such calculations shall be made promptly (but not 
later than five days) after the determination of such 
calculations that is final and binding.  The Accounting Firm may 
employ legal counsel if necessary to its resolution and all costs 
of such Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and 
Buyer.
		7.5.  Litigation Assistance.  Following the Closing, 
Buyer shall provide to WCC, and WCC and Seller shall provide to 
Buyer, such information and documents as may be reasonably 
requested in connection with any suit, claim, investigation or 
proceeding, pending or threatened, which relates to the Purchased 
Assets and in connection therewith each party shall, without 
limitation, make available to the other party during normal 
business hours (i) all books and records relating thereto in its 
possession, and (ii) all employees of such party or its 
Affiliates having knowledge of the matters in controversy.  Such 
access shall be afforded upon receipt of reasonable advance 
notice and shall not unreasonably interfere with the operations 
of the party being requested to furnish the information.  The 
party requesting the information shall be responsible for any 
significant costs or expenses incurred by the party furnishing 
the information pursuant to this paragraph 7.5.
		7.6.  Post-Closing Remittances.  If, after the Closing 
Date, WCC or Seller shall receive any remittance with respect to 
a Seller Contract which relates to the period after the Valuation 
Date, WCC or Seller shall endorse such remittance to the order of 
Buyer and forward it to Buyer promptly following receipt thereof.  
Conversely, if, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall receive any 
remittance with respect to a Seller Contract which relates to the 
period on or prior to the Valuation Date, then Buyer shall 
endorse such remittance to the order of Seller and forward it to 
Seller promptly following receipt thereof.
		7.7.  Maintenance of Corporate Existence.   WCC 
covenants and agrees that it will, for a period of not less than 
fifteen years from and after the closing, take all necessary 
action to maintain its corporate existence, and to maintain the 
corporate existence of KCC, CCC and DPC, or to cause such 
corporations to maintain their corporate existence, and to keep 
itself and such other corporations in good standing (or to cause 
such other corporations to remain in good standing) and properly 
qualified to do business in the applicable jurisdiction of 
incorporation; provided, however, that this covenant by WCC shall 
be subject to the following exceptions and qualifications:
		(i)  WCC may consolidate with, or merge with or into 
any other corporation (whether or not WCC shall be the 
surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer or lease 
all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an 
entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person or 
group of affiliated Persons, in one transaction or a series 
of related transactions, if either:  (A) WCC shall be the 
surviving corporation or surviving Person; or (B) the 
surviving corporation or surviving Person (if other than 
WCC) formed by such consolidation or with which or into 
which WCC is merged or the Person (or group of affiliated 
Persons) to which all or substantially all the properties or 
assets of WCC as an entirety or substantially as an entirety 
are sold, assigned, transferred or leased shall be a 
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the 
United States of America or any state thereof or the 
District of Columbia and shall expressly assume all the 
obligations of WCC under this Agreement, including but not 
limited to paragraph 8.1(iv) and (v) hereof.
		(ii)  WCC may dissolve voluntarily under applicable 
state law if, prior to such dissolution, WCC has provided 
for all liabilities it may then have under the Act.  WCC 
shall be deemed to have provided for such liabilities under 
the Act only if:  (A) the trustees under the Act shall agree 
in writing that they will release all claims against WCC and 
any Related Persons or "successors in interest" (as such 
terms are used and defined in the Act) if WCC pays to the 
trustees the amounts so provided for in the dissolution 
proposal to be submitted to the stockholders of WCC for 
approval; and (B) WCC pays, or deposits funds with a third 
party that will provide for payment of, such amounts to the 
trustees.
	   (iii)  This paragraph 7.7 shall have no further force and 
effect if (A) the Act in its entirety, or the provisions 
thereof imposing liability on any "successor in interest," 
shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to 
be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, provided that, in 
such case, the ruling of such court is not subject to 
further appeal, and such Act is not, with sixty months 
thereafter, amended or replaced by legislation which would 
impose a liability upon any Buyer Group Member for health or 
death benefits of former employees of WCC or Seller, or (B) 
Congress repeals the Act or the provision thereof that 
imposes liability on "successors in interest" and Congress 
does not, within sixty months after such repeal, enact new 
legislation the effect of which is to impose liability upon 
any Buyer Group Member for the health or death benefits of 
former employees of WCC or Seller.
		(iv)  Capitalized terms used in this paragraph but not 
defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned 
thereto in the Act.
		7.8.  [Intentionally omitted].
		7.9.  Permits and Bonds.  Buyer and Seller shall 
promptly submit an "Operator Change Application" with the 
Kentucky Environmental Cabinet on Form MPA-08 (or any successor 
thereto) with a cover letter requesting that the effective date 
of the change be the Closing Date.  With respect to each of the 
Governmental Permits and each of the bonds listed on Schedule 
5.1.14, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify 
and hold WCC and Seller harmless from and against any Losses or 
Expenses WCC or Seller may incur under any such permit or bond by 
reason of Buyer's operations on and after the Closing Date.  
Promptly after the Closing Date, Buyer shall submit permit 
transfer applications to the Kentucky Environmental Cabinet on 
Form MPA-07 (or any successor thereto) for each such Governmental 
Permit and provide a replacement for each such bond.
		7.10.  Transfer of Certain Interests of WCSC.  WCC 
agrees that, at the Closing and upon the satisfaction of all 
conditions precedent to the obligations of WCC under this 
Agreement, WCC shall, on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiary 
WCSC, cause WCSC to transfer to Buyer all of WCSC's interest in 
(a) each of the contracts listed on Schedule 1.1.7 other than the 
agreement listed on such schedule under the heading "Boise 
Cascade" and (b) the Rail Transportation Agreement dated May 17, 
1991, between CSX Transportation, Inc. and WCSC, as amended.
		8.  Indemnification.
		8.1.  Indemnification by WCC and Seller.  WCC and 
Seller, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold 
harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and all 
Loss and Expense imposed upon or incurred by such Buyer Group 
Member as a result of, in connection with or arising from:
		(i)	any breach by WCC or Seller of, or default in the 
performance by WCC or Seller of, any covenant, agreement or 
obligation to be performed by WCC or Seller pursuant to this 
Agreement or any Westmoreland Ancillary Agreement;  
		(ii)	any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of 
any representation of WCC or Seller contained or referred to

to the Closing any consent required for the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Westmoreland 
Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, those

		(iv)	the failure of WCC or Seller to satisfy or perform 
any of the liabilities or obligations not assumed by Buyer 
pursuant to this Agreement; and

unassigned beneficiaries premium or costs paid by any Buyer 
Group Member under Section 9704(d) of the Act or increase in 
any Buyer Group Member's "applicable percentage" under 
Section 9704(f) of the Act resulting from the transfer of 
eligible beneficiaries assigned to Seller or WCC under the 
Act to unassigned beneficiaries or from the transfer of any 
beneficiaries from any employer funds of WCC or Seller to 
any fund under the Act, provided that such transfer is 
caused by a breach by WCC or Seller of this Agreement or is 
caused by actions taken by WCC or Seller pursuant to clause 
(i) or (ii) of paragraph 7.7 of this Agreement;
provided, however, that WCC and Seller shall be required to 
indemnify and hold harmless with respect to Loss and Expense 
incurred by Buyer Group Members under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) 
of this paragraph 8.1 (other than Loss and Expense incurred as a 
result of inaccuracies of the representations and warranties 
contained in paragraphs 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 5.1.11, as to which this 
proviso shall have no effect) only to the extent that the 
aggregate amount of such Loss and Expense exceeds $1,000,000 and 
is no greater than $15,000,000.  The indemnification provided for 
in this paragraph 8.1 shall terminate two years after the Closing 
Date (and no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under 
this paragraph 8.1 thereafter), except that the indemnification 
by WCC and Seller shall continue as to:  
		(A)	the obligations and representations of Seller 
under the Instrument of Assignment, as to which no time 
limitation shall apply;
		(B)	the representations and warranties set forth in 
paragraphs 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 and the covenants and agreements 
of WCC and Seller set forth in paragraphs 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 
7.5, 7.7, 8.1(iv), 8.1(v), 11.1 and 11.15 hereof, as to all 
of which no time limitation shall apply; 
		(C)  the representations and warranties set forth in 
paragraph 5.1.11, as to which the indemnification provided 
for in this paragraph 8.1 shall terminate ten years after 
the Closing Date; and 
		(D)	any Loss or Expense of which any Buyer Group 
Member has notified WCC or Seller in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph 8.3 hereof on or prior to the date 
such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance 
with this paragraph 8.1, as to which the obligation of WCC 
and Seller shall continue until the liability of WCC and 
Seller shall have been determined pursuant to this paragraph 
8.1, and WCC or Seller shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group 
Members for the full amount of such Loss and Expense in 
accordance with this paragraph 8.1.
		8.2.  Indemnification by Buyer.  Buyer agrees to 
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and 
against any and all Loss and Expense imposed upon or incurred by 
such Seller Group Member as a result of, in connection with or 
arising from:
		(i)	any breach by Buyer, or default in the performance 
by Buyer of, any covenant, agreement or obligation to be 
performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any Buyer 
Ancillary Agreement; or  
		(ii)	any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of 
any representation of Buyer contained or referred to in this 
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of 
Buyer pursuant hereto;
		(iii)	any and all claims by any third Person 
arising from the failure to pay, perform or discharge any of 
the Assumed Liabilities after the Closing Date, including, 
without limitation, any lease, sublease or agreement 
expressly assumed by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement, or any act or omission by Buyer occurring on or 
after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Assumed 
Liabilities; and  
		(iv)	any and all debts, obligations and liabilities 
(other than Excluded Liabilities) resulting from or in 
connection with Buyer's ownership of the Purchased Assets 
arising or occurring after the Closing;
provided, however, that Buyer shall be required to indemnify and 
hold harmless under clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph 8.2 
with respect to Loss and Expense incurred by Seller Group Members 
only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Loss and 
Expense exceeds $1,000,000 (except with respect to Loss or 
Expense under paragraph 7.9, as to which this limitation shall 
not apply) but is not greater than $15,000,000.  The 
indemnification provided for in this paragraph 8.2 shall 
terminate two years after the Closing Date (and no claims shall 
be made by any Seller Group Member under this paragraph 8.2 
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall 
continue as to:  
		(a)  the covenants and agreements of Buyer set forth in 
paragraphs 7.2, 7.5, 7.9, 11.1 and 11.15 hereof, as to all 
of which no time limitation shall apply; and
		(b)	any Loss or Expense of which WCC or Seller has 
notified Buyer in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph 8.3 hereof on or prior to the date such 
indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with 
this paragraph 8.2, as to which the obligation of Buyer 
shall continue until the liability of Buyer shall have been 
determined pursuant to this paragraph 8.2, and Buyer shall 
have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount 
of such Loss and Expense in accordance with this paragraph 
8.2.
		8.3.  Notice of Indemnity Claims.  (a) Any Buyer Group 
Member or Seller Group Member (the "Indemnified Party") seeking 
indemnification hereunder shall give to the party obligated to 
provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the 
"Indemnitor") a notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in 
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for 
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice 
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the 
amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this 
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed 
hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is 
based; provided, that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at 
law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which 
indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the 
action or suit is commenced; and provided, further, that failure 
to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its 
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been 
prejudiced by such failure.
		(b)	After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant 
hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified 
Party shall be entitled under this paragraph 8 shall be 
determined:  (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified 
Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of 
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means 
to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. 
The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the 
time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall 
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally 
determined.  The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof 
in establishing the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by it.
		8.4.  Third Person Claims.  (a) Subject to paragraph 
8.4(b), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and 
control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise 
or settlement of any third Person claim, action or suit against 
such Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought 
by any Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in 
any such case the Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection 
therewith and shall furnish such records, information and 
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, 
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by 
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; provided, that the 
Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at 
its own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit 
as to which the Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and 
control the defense thereof; and provided, further, that the 
Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the 
Indemnitor (which written consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), pay, compromise or settle any such claim, action or 
suit, except that no such consent shall be required if, following 
a written request from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor 
shall fail, within 14 days after the making of such request, to 
acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such claim, action or 
suit shall be adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an 
obligation to provide indemnification hereunder to such 
Indemnified Party.
		(b)	If any third Person claim, action or suit against 
any Indemnified Party is solely for money damages or, where WCC 
or Seller is the Indemnitor, will have no continuing effect in 
any material respects on the Purchased Assets, then the 
Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and control, through 
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of 
any such third Person claim, action or suit against such 
Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by 
any Indemnified Party from any Indemnitor hereunder if the 
Indemnitor has acknowledged and agreed in writing that, if the 
same is adversely determined, the Indemnitor has an obligation to 
provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party in respect 
thereof, and in any such case the Indemnified Party shall 
cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such records, 
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery 
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably 
requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith; provided, 
that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel 
chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such 
claim, action or suit as to which the Indemnitor has so elected 
to conduct and control the defense thereof.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, 
settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit; provided, 
that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to 
indemnity therefor hereunder.

Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable 
advance notice and during normal business hours.  WCC and Seller 
shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by 
either of them pursuant to this paragraph 11.1(a).  If Buyer

the expiration of such three-year period, Buyer shall, prior to 
such disposition, give WCC a reasonable opportunity, at WCC's 
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as WCC 
may select.
		(b)	For a period of three years after the Closing 
Date, Buyer and its representatives shall have reasonable access

its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and 
during normal business hours.  Buyer shall be solely responsible

to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the 
expiration of such three-year period, WCC shall, prior to such 
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyer's 
expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer 
may select.

Schedules referred to in this Agreement shall be deemed to be 
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as if set

this Agreement.
		11.4.  Assignment.  The rights of Buyer and Seller

written consent of the other, which consent may be withheld for 
any reason.  Following the Closing, either party may assign any 
of its rights hereunder, but no such assignment shall relieve it 
of its obligations hereunder.
		11.5.  Survival of Provisions.  The representations, 
warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement 
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement but solely for the purpose of creating rights

		11.9.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by 
the parties in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be 
considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding 
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the 
parties hereto and delivered to each of Seller and Buyer.
		11.10.  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall 
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties 
hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
		11.11.  Subrogation.  Nothing in this Agreement, 
express or implied, including, without limitation, the 
indemnities of paragraph 8 hereof, shall be deemed to create in 
any Person other than the parties signatory hereto and successors 
and assigns permitted by paragraph 11.10 hereof (i) any right, 
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or (ii) any 
rights of subrogation from, through or under any indemnified

		11.12.  Recording.  This Agreement shall not be filed 
or recorded in any office for the recording of deeds or 
documents.
		11.13.  Severability of Provisions.  Wherever possible, 
each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to 
be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision 
of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstances shall, to any extent and for any reason, be held in 
any proceeding to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such 
provision, or the application thereof to any person or 
circumstance, shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the 
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability 
without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable provision or any other provisions hereof or the 
application of such provision to persons or circumstances other 
than those to which it was held to be invalid, illegal or 
unenforceable, but only if and to the extent such construction 
would not materially and adversely frustrate the parties' 
essential objectives as expressed herein.
		11.14.  Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waivers.  This 
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules referred to 
herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto) constitutes 
the entire agreement of the parties here to pertaining to the 
subject matter contained hereof, and supersedes all prior 
agreements, representations, understandings or letters of intent 
of the parties hereto, including without limitation the 
Confidentiality Agreement.  This Agreement shall not be amended, 
modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by 
an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.  Any 
term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time 
for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties 
entitled to the benefit thereof.  Any such waiver shall be 
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this 
Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an 
authorized representative of such party.  The failure of any 
party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this 
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such 
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this 
Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter 
to enforce each and every such provision.  No waiver of any 
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of 
any other or subsequent breach.
		11.15.  Confidential Nature of Information.  Each party 
agrees that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials 
and other information which it shall have obtained regarding the 
other party during the course of the negotiations leading to the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether 
obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the 
investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this 
Agreement and other related documents, and, in the event the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated, each 
party will return to the other party all copies of nonpublic 
documents and materials which have been furnished in connection 
therewith.  Such documents, materials and information shall not 
be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of 
Buyer, to its counsel, accountants, financial advisors or 
lenders, and in the case of Seller, to its counsel, accountants 
or financial advisors).  No other party shall use any 
confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely 
for the purpose of evaluating the proposed purchase and sale of 
the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that after the Closing 
Buyer may use or disclose any confidential information related to 
the Purchased Assets.  The obligation of each party to treat such 
documents, materials and other information in confidence shall 
not apply to any information which (i) is or becomes available to 
such party from a source other than such party, (ii) is or 
becomes available to the public other than as a result of 
disclosure by such party or its agents, (iii) is required to be 
disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, but only to 
the extent it must be disclosed, or (iv) such party reasonably 
deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or 
approvals contemplated hereby.

Price the amount of $1,750,000 (see Attachment 1) to pay unmined 
mineral tax liabilities, including any interest or penalties 
relating thereto, due to various taxing authorities in Kentucky 
applicable to the years 1988 through 1994.  In the event the 
amount withheld exceeds the payments made to satisfy the 
aforementioned tax liabilities, such excess shall be returned to 
WCC plus interest thereon from the Closing Date at the 3-month 
commercial paper as shown in the Federal Reserve Statistical 
Release H. 15 (519), which shall be determined by averaging such 
rate on the first and last day of each 6-month period commencing 
on the Closing Date, compounded semi-annually.  Alternatively, in 
the event the payments made to satisfy the aforementioned tax 
liabilities exceed the amount withheld, WCC remains liable for 
such excess and agrees to pay such excess to Buyer on demand.

		Prior to making payments of unmined mineral tax 
liabilities from the amount withheld, Buyer shall notify WCC.  
Buyer agrees that it will not pay any aforementioned tax 
liability if such liability is contested in good faith by WCC, 
unless (i) Buyer is made a party to any court proceeding or (ii) 
a tax lien is imposed on any assets of Buyer or an affiliated 
company.  If an event described in clause (i) or (ii) occurs, 
Buyer shall notify WCC, and WCC shall have the right at its own 
expense to contest such event.  If any claim against Buyer or any 
tax lien on property owned by Buyer or an affiliated company 
becomes final, enforceable or unappealable, Buyer may satisfy the 
unpaid tax liability relating to such claim or lien without 
further notice to WCC.

		WCC may from time to time request that the amount 
withheld be reduced for the reason that the amount withheld 
exceeds the amount of unpaid mineral taxes for any of the 
aforesaid years.  Buyer agrees that it will not unreasonably 
withhold its cooperation when WCC makes such a request for a 
reduction in the withheld amount.  If the withheld amount is 
reduced, the amount of such reduction shall be delivered to WCC 
along with any applicable interest due thereon.

		6.	All amounts being withheld from payment of the 
purchase price pursuant to Paragraphs 4 and 5 hereof, shall 
remain the property of Buyer until the matters set forth in 
Paragraphs 4 and 5 are resolved.  It is the intention of Seller, 
WCC and Buyer that said funds shall remain the property of Buyer 
and, to the extent WCC and Seller may be entitled to payment from 
Buyer, said claim is only a chose in action and shall be asserted 
in the same manner as a chose in action and not asserted as a 
property right in the funds being withheld pursuant to Paragraphs 
4 and 5 hereof.

		7.	Buyer and WCC acknowledge that, at the time of 
execution of this Amendment, TECO has not granted its consent to 
the assignment by WCC to Buyer of WCC's rights under the ROVA 
Subcontracts.  

			a.	In the event that TECO consents prior to 
Closing to the assignment by WCC to Buyer of WCC's rights under 
the ROVA Subcontracts but (i) TECO retains the right to supply 
20.5% of the coal purchased by the ROVA I facility during the 
Post-Three-Year Portion and (ii) TECO remains the contracting 
party under the ROVA Agreements, then the Purchase Price shall be 
reduced by an additional $4,000,000.00.

			b.	Alternatively, in the event that TECO 
consents prior to Closing to the assignment by WCC to Buyer of 
WCC's rights under the ROVA Subcontracts but (i) TECO retains the 
right to supply 20.5% of the coal purchased by the ROVA I 
facility during the Post-Three-Year Portion and (ii) TECO becomes 
a subcontractor to Buyer for the delivery of such 20.5% [(or 
alternatively, Buyer and TECO each have contracts directly with 
the ROVA I and ROVA II facilities for their respective 
obligations)], then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by 
$3,500,000.00.

			c.	In the event that WCC's rights under the ROVA 
Subcontracts are transferred to Buyer at Closing without TECO's 
consent, as provided in subparagraph d. below, Buyer will 
withhold from payment of the Purchase Price the amount of 
$4,000,000 and will hold such amount in escrow until Buyer's 
right to deliver 100% of the coal to the ROVA I facility during 
the Post-Three-Year Portion has been confirmed by means of either 
(i) a settlement agreement between WCC and TECO or (ii) an order 
of a court of competent jurisdiction that is final and 
unappealable.  WCC agrees that it will seek to have the ROVA I 
lenders and the ROVA II lenders take the actions necessary to 
cause the ROVA I and ROVA II facilities to enter into coal supply 
contracts directly with Buyer that will replace the existing coal 
supply agreements between TECO and the ROVA I and ROVA II 
facilities.  If a new coal supply contract between Buyer and the 
ROVA I facility is entered into which states that it shall become 
effective on the third anniversary of the commercial operations 
date of the ROVA I facility, the amount of $4,000,000 held in 
escrow shall be returned to WCC at the time the new coal supply 
agreement is executed, provided that the new coal supply 
agreement cannot be challenged by TECO because either (i) it is 
the result of a settlement between WCC and TECO or (ii) the right 
of the parties to enter into such an arrangement have been 
established by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction that 
is final and unappealable.  The escrowed amount shall be returned 
with interest determined in the manner described in paragraph 5 
above.  If a new coal supply contract between Buyer and the ROVA 
I facility is executed by such parties but does not become 
effective until a date which is subsequent to the third 
anniversary of the commercial operations date of the ROVA I 
facility, Buyer shall return to WCC an amount determined by (i) 
multiplying $4,000,000.00 by the fraction described in Attachment 
2 to this Amendment, and (ii) adding interest to the amount 
calculated pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, such interest 
to be determined in the manner described in paragraph 5 above.  
Buyer agrees to cooperate to the fullest extent reasonable to 
cause the ROVA I and ROVA II facilities to enter into the new 
coal supply contracts referred to in this paragraph.

			d.	It is agreed by the parties that (i) Buyer 
shall not be required to purchase any of the Purchased Assets 
unless WCC's rights under the ROVA Subcontracts are transferred 
to Buyer or other arrangements with respect to the ROVA 
Subcontract are entered into that are satisfactory to Buyer and 
(ii) Buyer shall not be required to accept a transfer of the ROVA 
Subcontracts to Buyer unless such transfer has been approved by a 
court of competent jurisdiction or TECO has consented to the 
transfer.

		8.	Buyer and Seller agree that WCSC has in place 
certain coal supply arrangements with the purchasers identified 
in subparagraphs a, b, and c, below, which are requirements 
arrangements based on purchase orders received from the 
purchasers and which WCSC supplies with coal provided by Seller.  
The following coal supply arrangements will be effective after 
the Closing Date, and will be further documented by appropriate 
purchase orders:

			a.	C.H. Sprague--Champion International.  WCSC 
will purchase four to five 14,500 ton barge loads of coal, for 
resale to C.H. Sprague & Son Company for delivery to Champion 
International (depending upon the requirements of Champion 
International), with the quality specifications shown on 
Attachment 3, at a purchase price of $27.99 per ton, FOB railcar 
at Rapidloader 1, Deane, Ky.  One barge load is presently 
scheduled in January 1995, and second barge is presently 
scheduled in March, 1995.  An additional two to three barges are 
expected to be shipped in late 1995 or early 1996.  The parties 
recognize, however, that these dates are tentative and may be 
changed.  WCSC and Seller shall have no liability to Buyer if 
these dates are changed, and shall have no liability to Buyer if 
the coal is not taken by Champion International or its purchasing 
representative, C.H. Sprague.  Buyer can cancel this purchase 
order arrangement on 60 days notice, but such cancellation shall 
then apply to all remaining shipments after such 60-day period 
under the arrangement described in this paragraph.  At the end of 
this purchase order arrangement, Buyer may negotiate directly 
with C.H. Sprague & Son for future shipments provided that WCSC 
may bid competitively for these orders.

			b.	C.H. Sprague--S.D. Warren.  WCSC will 
purchase approximately five 14,500 ton barge loads of coal, for 
resale to C.H. Sprague & Son Company for delivery to S.D. Warren 
(depending upon the requirements of S.D. Warren), with the 
quality specifications shown on Attachment 4, at a purchase price 
of $27.50 per ton, FOB railcar at Rapidloader 1, Deane, Ky.  The 
first barge load is anticipated to be required in late February 
1995.  The parties recognize, however, that this date is 
tentative and may be changed.  WCSC and Seller shall have no 
liability to Buyer if this date in changed, and shall have no 
liability to Buyer if the coal is not taken by S.D. Warren or its 
purchasing representative, C.H. Sprague.  Buyer can cancel this 
purchase order arrangement on 60 days notice, but such 
cancellation shall then apply to all remaining shipments after 
such 60-day period under the arrangement described in this 
paragraph.  At the end of this purchase order arrangement, Buyer 
may negotiate directly with C.H. Sprague & Son for future 
shipments provided that WCSC may bid competitively for these 
orders.

			c.	C.H. Sprague-Boise Cascade.  WCSC will 
purchase approximately 10,000 tons of coal per month on a unit 
train basis through May, 1995, for resale to C.H. Sprague & Son 
Company for delivery to Boise Cascade (depending upon the 
requirements of Boise Cascade), with the quality specifications 
shown on Attachment 5, at a purchase price of $25.75 per ton, FOB 
railcar at Rapidloader 1, Deane, Ky.  The parties recognize, 
however, that this shipment schedule is tentative and may be 
changed.  WCSC and Seller shall have no liability to Buyer if the 
shipping schedule is changed, and shall have no liability to 
Buyer if the coal is not taken by Boise Cascade or its purchasing 
representative, C.H. Sprague.  WCSC agrees to extend this 
arrangement beyond May, 1995 if Buyer and Boise Cascade can agree 
upon mutually acceptable terms.  At the written request of Buyer, 
such request to be sent to Seller within 5 business days of this 
Amendment No. 2,  WCSC will attempt to find another source of 
coal for this arrangement and within 30 days of this Amendment 


No. 2 will advise Buyer if it has found another source of coal, 
in which case, this arrangement will be terminated.  If no such 
notice is given, Buyer will continue to supply coal under this 
arrangement.

		9.	Phillip Morris.  WCSC will purchase approximately 
4,000 tons of coal per month through June 1995 for resale to 
Phillip Morris, (depending upon the requirements of Phillip 
Morris), with quality specifications shown on Attachment 6, at a 
purchase price of $25.65 per ton, FOB railcar at Rapidloader 1, 
Deane, Ky.  The parties recognize, however, that this shipment 
schedule is tentative and may be changed.  WCSC and Seller shall 
have no liability to Buyer if this shipment schedule is changed, 
and shall have no liability to Buyer if the coal is not taken by 
Phillip Morris.  Buyer can cancel this purchase order arrangement 
on 60 days notice, but such cancellation shall then apply to all 
remaining shipments after such 60-day period under the 
arrangement described in this paragraph.  At the end of this 
purchase order arrangement, Buyer may negotiate directly with 
Phillip Morris for future shipments provided that WCSC may bid 
competitively for these orders.

		10.	Georgia Power.  The parties agree that all 
carryover tons under the original Georgia Power contract, dated 
July 1, 1988 shall be shipped from WCC's Virginia Division and 
Buyer shall have no interest in this contract or the coal to be 
shipped thereunder.

		All terms and provisions of the Asset Purchase 
Agreement not amended by this Amendment shall remain in full 
force and effect.

		All capitalized terms used herein but not defined 
herein shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Asset 
Purchase Agreement.

		This Amendment may be executed in any number of 
counterparts, each of which shall be considered part of one and 
the same instrument, and which together shall create a binding 
instrument when all counterparts have been delivered by the 
respective signing parties.

	WITNESSETH:
		WHEREAS, the parties hereto have entered into an Asset 
Purchase Agreement dated July 28, 1994, as heretofore amended 
(the "Asset Purchase Agreement"); and
		WHEREAS, each of the parties has the right to terminate 
the Asset Purchase Agreement if the Closing (as defined therein) 
shall not have occurred on or before November 8, 1994; and
		WHEREAS, WCC and Seller have informed Buyer that 
(i) certain conditions precedent to the Closing may not occur on 
or before November 8, 1994, and (ii) in order to satisfy such 
conditions, and thus to consummate the transactions contemplated 
in the Asset Purchase Agreement, it may be necessary for WCC and 
Seller to initiate a reorganization proceeding under title 11, 
United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"); and
		WHEREAS, WCC and Seller have requested that Buyer 
extend the Terminal Date (as defined in the Asset Purchase 
Agreement) to accommodate the delay in consummating such 
transactions occasioned by such a proceeding; and
		WHEREAS, Buyer has agreed to such an extension subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Supplemental 
Agreement.
		NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and 
the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto, with 
the intent to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:
		1.	Defined Terms.  (a)  Terms used in this 
Supplemental Agreement that are defined in the Asset Purchase 
Agreement shall have the meanings set forth therein.
		(b)  As used herein, (i) the term "Claim Period" shall 
mean the period from November 1, 1994 to and including the later 
of (A) October 31, 1995, and (B) thirty (30) days after 
confirmation of a plan of reorganization for WCC or Seller under

limitation, the so-called "Three-Party Agreement" executed in 
connection with each such subcontract); and (iv) the term 
"20%/17-Year Issue" shall mean, collectively, all issues relating 
to the right of WCC, Seller or Buyer under the TECO Agreements to 
supplant TECO as sole coal supplier to the Roanoke Valley I and 
II cogeneration projects after three years of commercial 
operation.
		2.	Terminal Date.  Subparagraph 10.1(b) of the Asset 
Purchase Agreement is deleted in its entirety, and the following 
subparagraph is inserted in lieu thereof:
			(b)  by Buyer or WCC if the Closing shall not 
have occurred on or before December 30, 1994 (or 
such later date as may be mutually agreed to by 
Buyer and WCC) (the "Terminal Date"); provided, 
however, that notwithstanding anything contained 
herein or any action by WCC, Buyer shall have the 
unilateral right to extend the Terminal Date to a 
date not later than March 30, 1995 by written 
notice to WCC or Seller prior to December 30, 
1994;

		3.	Chapter 11.  In a reorganization proceeding for 
WCC and Seller under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code:
			(a)  Not later than November 8, 1994, petitions 
shall be filed for WCC, CCC, KCC and DPC, and for such other 
entities as WCC in its sole discretion shall determine.
			(b)  Not later than November 8, 1994, a joint plan 
of reorganization incorporating the terms of the Asset 
Purchase Agreement and providing for the payment in full or 
nonimpairment of all claims and interests (the "Plan"), with 
accompanying disclosure statement, shall be filed; provided, 
however, that financial information associated with the 
disclosure statement may be filed as late as November 15, 
1994.
			(c)  If considered advisable by both WCC and 
Buyer, a separate motion to assume the Asset Purchase 
Agreement pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  365 (an "Assumption 
Motion") shall be filed and shall be scheduled for hearing 
on the same date as the confirmation hearing for the Plan.
			(d)  Buyer shall have the right (i) to add parties 
to the list of parties to be notified individually of the 
hearing on the disclosure statement, the confirmation 
hearing, and the hearing on an Assumption Motion (if any); 
and (ii) to approve, in form and substance, the terms of the 
Plan and the order confirming the Plan, but such right of 
approval shall yield to WCC's reasonable judgment concerning 
the effect of any provision of the Plan or such order on 
(A) confirmation of the Plan, (B) consummation of the sale 
of the Purchased Assets, (C) the success of any appeal from 
such order, or (D) the success of any attempt to obtain a 
stay of such order pending appeal.
			(e)  The sale of the Purchased Assets shall have 
the benefit of 11 U.S.C.  1146(c) to the extent permitted 
by law.
			(f)  To the extent permitted by law, the Plan will 
provide that the court (including the district court if the 
reference is withdrawn) will retain jurisdiction (among 
other purposes) (i) to determine whether Seller has 
satisfied the conditions imposed by the Asset Purchase 
Agreement for its receipt of the holdback of the portion of 
the purchase price associated with the 20%/17-Year Issue, 
and (ii) incident thereto, to determine the meaning and 
effect of the TECO Agreements (as assigned to Buyer) 
relating to 20%/17-Year Issue and the rights and obligations 
of the parties with respect thereto (which parties shall 
include, to the extent jurisdictionally and procedurally 
feasible, WCC, Seller, Buyer, TECO, each of the Project 
Owners (as defined in the TECO Agreements), and the lenders 
to such Project Owners).  Westmoreland will cooperate with 
and support Buyer in any litigation with respect to the 
20%/17-year Issue, including litigation pursuant to such 
retention of jurisdiction.
			(g)  WCC and Seller acknowledge that Buyer is not 
obligated to extend the Terminal Date as set forth in 
paragraph 2 hereof, and that such an extension in the face 
of the imminent filing of Chapter 11 petitions by WCC and 
Seller, and of the uncertainty to consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement 
introduced by such filings, constitutes an assumption by 
Buyer of material additional risk to its investment of time, 
effort, expense and committed capital with respect to such 
transactions.  WCC and Seller further acknowledge that if 
Buyer is prepared to meet all conditions imposed upon Buyer 
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset 
Purchase Agreement, the failure of WCC and Seller to 
consummate such transactions (including compliance with 
every obligation of WCC and Seller under the Asset Purchase 
Agreement) will be a breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement 
as amended hereby.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the 
damages flowing from such a breach by WCC and Seller, 
including direct expenditures, loss of profits, etc., are 
difficult or impossible to calculate and, therefore, Buyer 
will be entitled to a claim for liquidated damages.  
Accordingly, until the Terminal Date, and subject to 
subparagraph (k) of this paragraph 3, (i) neither WCC nor 
Seller shall solicit, accept, assist in the formulation of, 
or provide information with respect to a competing bid for 
the Purchased Assets or any portion thereof, and (ii) WCC 
shall give Buyer prompt written notice of any expressions of 
interest in purchasing the Purchased Assets received by 
senior executives of WCC, and of the identity of the persons 
expressing such interest, and shall provide Buyer with 
copies of documents, if any, accompanying such expressions 
of interest.
			(h)  In further recognition of the facts 
acknowledged by WCC and Seller in the first three sentences 
of subparagraph (g) of this paragraph 3, and to compensate 
Buyer for the financial loss suffered by Buyer should the 
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement 
not be consummated prior to or on the Terminal Date, WCC and 
Seller agree that if Seller shall fail to consummate a sale 
of substantially all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer 
pursuant to an agreement entered into during the Claim 
Period, then Buyer shall have a pre-petition, unsecured 
liquidated damage claim against WCC and Seller, jointly and 
severally, in the amount of Ten Million Dollars 
($10,000,000), which claim shall not be subject to dispute 
by WCC, Seller or any affiliate of WCC or Seller.
			(i)  Buyer agrees that if Seller shall not 
consummate a sale of a material portion of the Purchased 
Assets to a buyer other than Buyer pursuant to an agreement 
entered into during the Claim Period, then the liquidated 
damage claim allowed pursuant to subparagraph (h) of this 
paragraph 3 shall be reduced to Five Million Dollars 
($5,000,000).
			(j)  The claim described in subparagraphs (h) and 
(i) of this paragraph 3 shall be the only claim of Buyer 
arising from a failure to consummate a sale pursuant to the 
Asset Purchase Agreement, whether (i) the Asset Purchase 
Agreement is allowed to lapse in accordance with its terms, 
is terminated, or is rejected pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  365, 
and (ii) such claims, or either one of them, shall be 
disallowed in whole or in part.  In the event that a plan is 
confirmed or there is any distribution in a bankruptcy 
proceeding of WCC or Seller, whether under Chapter 11 or 
Chapter 7, WCC and Seller agree that to the extent that any 
portion of the claim of Buyer pursuant to subparagraph 
(h) or (i) of this paragraph 3 has not been fixed or 
liquidated, then an adequate reserve for the contingent or 
unliquidated portion of such claim will be established in 
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.
			(k)  Neither WCC nor Seller shall breach any 
obligation imposed upon it by this paragraph 3 by taking any 
action, or by omitting to take any action, which act or 
omission is authorized or ordered by the court, and WCC and 
Seller shall have the right to seek such authorization or 
order on an expedited basis in the event that WCC concludes 
that it is necessary or required in order for WCC, Seller 
and their respective officers and directors to comply with 
their duties to the creditors or stockholders of WCC, Seller 
or any other affiliate of WCC.
			(l)  In making determinations pursuant to this 
paragraph 3, and in particular pursuant to subparagraph (d), 
(f) or (k) hereof, WCC, Seller and their respective officers 
and directors shall be entitled to rely on the advice of 
counsel.

		IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed 
this Supplemental Agreement as of the date first above written.

		2.	Creation of Series.  The Board of Directors shall have 
authority by resolution to divide the Preferred Stock into one or more series 
and to determine and fix with respect to each series, at any time prior to the 
issuance of any shares of such series, the designations, preferences and 
rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, which may 
vary as to shares of different series, subject to limitations provided by law 
and herein.  All series of Preferred Stock may have voting rights on such 
terms as the Board of Directors shall determine, as shall be permitted by 
applicable law.  The authority of the Board of Directors shall include, but not 
be limited to, the determination or fixing of the following:

		(a)	The designation of and the number of shares which shall 
constitute the series, which number may be increased or decreased (but not 
below the number of shares then outstanding) from time to time by action of 
the Board of Directors; 

		(b)	The dividend rate and time of payment of dividends on 
the shares of the series, whether dividends shall be cumulative, and, if so, 
from what date or dates, and whether and to what extent the shares of the 
series shall have participation rights;

		(c)	The price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions 
on which, the shares of the series may be redeemed at the option of the 
corporation;

		(d)	Whether or not the shares of the series shall be entitled to 
the benefit of a retirement or sinking fund to be applied to the purchase or 
redemption of such shares, and, if so entitled, the annual amount of such  
fund and the terms and provisions relative to the operation thereof;

		(e)	Whether or not the shares of the series shall be 
convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or
of any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the 
corporation, and if so convertible or exchangeable, the conversion price or 
prices, or the rates of exchange, and any adjustments thereof, if any, at 
which such conversion or exchange may be  made, and any other terms and 
conditions of such conversion or exchange;

		(f)	The rights of the shares of the series in the event of 
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the 
corporation;

		(g)	Whether or not the shares of the series shall be entitled to 
the benefit of limitations restricting the payment of dividends on, or the 
making of other distributions in respect of stock of any class ranking junior 
to the shares of the series as to dividends or assets, or restricting the 
purchase or redemption of the shares of any such junior class, and the terms 
of any such restrictions;

		(h)	The terms, as applicable, of the voting rights, in addition 
to the voting rights provided by law, of any series issued on or after the 
effective date of this amendment; and

		(i)	Any other relative rights, preferences and limitations of 
that series.

COMMON STOCK

		3.	Dividends.  Holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to 
receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors except 
that the corporation will not declare, pay or set apart for payment any 
dividend on shares of Common Stock (other than dividends payable in 
Common Stock), or directly or indirectly make any distribution on, redeem, 
purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares, if at the time of such action 
the corporation is in default with respect to any dividend payable on or any 
sinking fund or purchase fund requirement relative to shares of Preferred 
Stock.

		4.	Distribution of Assets.  In the event of the voluntary or 
involuntary liquidation of the corporation, holders of Common Stock shall be 
entitled to receive pro rata all of the remaining assets of the corporation 
available for distribution to its stockholders after all amounts to which the 
holders of Preferred Stock are entitled have been paid or set aside in cash for 
payment.

GENERAL

	5.		Voting Rights.  Except as otherwise required by law, the 
holders of Common Stock and the holders of each series of Preferred Stock 
shall exclusively possess voting power in the election of directors and for all 
other purposes.


DESIGNATION OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE
EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK

		Section 1.	Designation of Amount.  The shares of such series 
shall be designated as "Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock" 
(the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the authorized number of shares consti-
tuting such series shall be 575,000.  The par value of the Series A Preferred 
Stock shall be $1.00 per share.

		Section 2.	Dividends.

		(a)	The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will 
be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out 
of funds of the Corporation legally available therefor, cumulative cash 
dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of $8.50 
per annum per share of Series A Preferred Stock, and no more, payable in 
equal quarterly installments on April 1, July 1, October 1, and January 1 in 
each year, commencing October 1, 1992.  Such dividends shall be cumulative 
from the date of original issue of each share of the Series A Preferred Stock.  
Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of the shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock as they appear on the stock records of the 
Corporation on such record date, not more than 30 days nor less than 10 days 
preceding the dividend payment date thereof, as shall be fixed by  the Board 
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.  If a holder converts a 
share or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock after the close of business on 
the record date for a dividend and before the opening of business on the 
payment date for such dividend, then, pursuant to Section 6 hereof, the 
holder will be required to pay to the Corporation at the time of such 
conversion the amount of such dividend.

		(b)	If dividends are not paid in full, or declared in full and 
sums set apart for the payment thereof, upon the shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock and shares of any other preferred stock ranking on a parity 
as to dividends with the Series A Preferred Stock, all dividends declared 
upon shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and of any other preferred stock 
ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be paid or declared pro rata so that 
in all cases the amount of dividends paid or declared per share on the Series 
A Preferred Stock and such other shares of preferred stock shall bear to each 
other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share, including 
dividends accrued or in arrears, if any, on the shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock and such other shares of preferred stock bear to each other.  
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, unless full cumulative 
dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid or 
declared in full and sums set aside for the payment thereof, no dividends 
(other than dividends in shares of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe 
for or purchase shares of the Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) or in 
shares of any other capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the 
Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and distribution of assets upon 
liquidation) shall be paid or declared and set aside for payment or other 
distribution made upon the Corporation's Common Stock, par value $2.50 per 
share (the "Common Stock"), or any other capital stock of the Corporation 
ranking junior to or  on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to 
dividends, nor shall any shares of the Common Stock or shares of any other 
capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with the 
Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends be redeemed, purchased or 
otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any payment made to or 
available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) by the 
Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation (except by conversion into 
or exchange for shares of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to 
the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and distribution of assets upon 
liquidation).  Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be 
entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or shares of 
capital stock, in excess of full accrued and cumulative dividends as herein 
provided.  No interest or sum of money in lieu of interest shall be payable in 
respect of any dividend payment or payments on the shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.

		The terms "accrued dividends, " "dividends accrued" and 
"dividends in arrears," whenever used herein with reference to shares of 
preferred stock shall be deemed to mean an amount which shall be equal to 
dividends thereon at the annual dividend rates per share for the respective 
series from the date or dates on which such dividends commence to accrue to 
the end of the then current quarterly dividend period for such preferred stock 
(or, in the case of redemption, to the date of redemption), less the amount of 
all dividends paid, or declared in full and sums set aside for the payment 
thereof, upon such shares of preferred stock.

		(c)	Dividends payable on the shares of the Series A Preferred 
Stock for any period less than a full quarterly dividend period shall be 
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and the 
actual number of days elapsed in the period for which payable.

		Section 3.	Optional Redemption.

		(a)	The shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will be 
redeemable at the option of the Corporation by resolution of its Board of 
Directors, in whole or from time to time in part, at any time on or after July 
1, 1995, subject to the limitations set forth below, at the following redemp-
tion prices per share plus, in each case, all dividends accrued and unpaid on
the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock up to the date fixed for redemption, 
upon giving notice as provided hereinbelow:

2002 and thereafter.  .  .  .  .  .  .  	$100.00

		(b)	If less than all of the outstanding shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed 
shall be determined by the Board of Directors and the shares to be redeemed 
shall be determined pro rata or by lot or in such other manner and subject to 
such regulations as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion shall 
prescribe.

		(c)	At least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the 
date fixed for the redemption of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, a 
written notice shall be mailed to each holder  of record of shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed in a postage prepaid envelope addressed 
to such holder at his post office address as shown on the records of the 
Corporation, notifying such holder of the election of the Corporation to 
redeem such shares, stating the date fixed for redemption thereof (the 
"Redemption Date"), and calling upon such holder to surrender to the 
Corporation on the Redemption Date at the place designated in such notice 
his certificate or certificates representing the number of shares specified in 
such notice of redemption.  On or after the Redemption Date each holder of 
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall present and 
surrender his certificate or certificates for such shares to the Corporation at 
the place designated in such notice and thereupon the redemption price of 
such shares shall be paid to or on the order of the person whose name 
appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each  
surrendered certificate shall be cancelled.  In case less than all the shares 
represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be 
issued representing the unredeemed shares.  From and after the Redemption 
Date (unless default shall be made by the Corporation in payment of the 
redemption price), all dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock 
designated for redemption in such notice shall cease to accrue, and all rights 
of the holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation, except the right to 
receive the redemption price of such shares (including all accrued and unpaid 
dividends up to the Redemption Date) upon the surrender of certificates 
representing the same, shall cease and terminate and such shares shall not 
thereafter be transferred (except with the consent of the Corporation) on the 
books of the Corporation, and such shares shall not be deemed to be 
outstanding for any purpose whatsoever.  At its election, the Corporation 
prior to the Redemption Date may deposit the redemption price (including all 
accrued and unpaid dividends up to the Redemption Date) of shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption in trust for the holders 
thereof with a bank or trust company (having a capital surplus and 
undivided profits aggregating not less than $50,000,000) in the Borough of 
Manhattan, City and State of New York, or in any other city in which the 
Corporation at the time shall maintain a transfer agency with respect to such 
shares, in which case the aforesaid notice to holders of shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall state the date of such deposit, shall 
specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of 
the redemption price, and shall call upon such holders to surrender the 
certificates representing such shares at such place on or after the date fixed 
in such redemption notice (which shall not be later than the Redemption 
Date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accrued and 
unpaid dividends up to the Redemption Date).  Any interest accrued on such 
funds shall be paid to the Corporation from time to time.  Any moneys so 
deposited which shall remain unclaimed by the holders of such shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the Redemption Date 
shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the Corporation.

		If a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to this Section 
3 and any holder of shares of this Series A Preferred Stock shall, prior to the 
close of business on the last business day preceding the Redemption Date, 
give written notice to the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 below of the 
conversion of any or all of the shares to be redeemed held by such holder 
(accompanied by a certificate or certificates for such shares, duly endorsed or 
assigned to the Corporation, and any necessary transfer tax payment, as 
required by Section 6 below), then such redemption shall not become effective 
as to such shares to be converted, such conversion shall become effective as 
provided in Section 6 below and any moneys set aside by the Corporation for 
the redemption of such shares of converted Series A Preferred Stock shall 
revert to the general funds of the Corporation.

		(d)	Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock redeemed, 
repurchased or retired pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3 or 
surrendered to the Corporation upon conversion or exchange shall thereupon 
be retired and may not be reissued as shares of the Series A Preferred Stock 
but shall thereafter have the status of authorized but unissued shares of the 
Preferred Stock, without designation as to series until such shares are once 
more designated as part of a particular series of the Preferred Stock.

		Section 4.	Voting Rights.

		(a)	In addition to the voting rights provided in Section 4(b), 
7(b) or 9, and as required by law, the holders of shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on any matter on which the holders 
of the Common Stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to vote, and when 
voting on matters on which the holders of Common Stock of the Corporation 
are entitled to vote, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle 
the holder thereof to four votes.  In the event the Corporation shall at any 
time (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common 
Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the 
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each 
such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series 
A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be 
adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (which in the case of (i) 
above shall include such shares of Common Stock payable pursuant to such 
dividend) immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the 
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior 
to such event.  An adjustment made pursuant to the immediately preceding 
sentence shall become effective immediately after such event.  When the 
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock vote on any matter as members of a 
class which does not include the holders of Common Stock, the holders of 
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to an aggregate number of votes 
which is in the same proportion to the total number of class votes as the 
aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series A 
Preferred Stock bears to the aggregate liquidation preference of all shares of 
capital stock in the class; and each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to his or her proportionate share of the aggregate number of votes
to which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled.

		(b)	In the event that the Corporation shall have failed to 
declare and pay or set apart for payment in full the dividends accumulated 
on the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for any six 
quarterly dividend payment periods, whether or not consecutive (a 
"Preferential Dividend Non-Payment"), the number of directors of the 
Corporation shall be increased by two and the holders of outstanding shares 
of the Series A Preferred Stock , voting together as a class with all other 
classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity 
with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends and distribution 
of assets upon liquidation and then entitled to vote on the election of such 
additional directors, shall be entitled to elect such additional directors
until the full dividends accumulated on all outstanding shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.  Upon 
the occurrence of a Preferential Dividend Non-Payment, the Board of 
Directors shall within a reasonable period call a special meeting of the 
holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of other 
classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity 
with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends 
and distribution of assets upon liquidation who are then entitled to vote on 
the election of such additional directors for the purpose of electing the 
additional directors provided by the foregoing provisions.  If and when all 
accumulated dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have 
been declared and paid or set aside for payment in full, the holders of shares 
of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the special voting rights 
provided by this Section 4(b), subject to revesting in the event of each and 
every subsequent Preferential Dividend Non-Payment.  Upon termination of 
such special voting rights attributable to all holders of  shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock and shares of any other class or series of preferred stock of
the Corporation ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with 
respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, 
the term of office of each director elected by the holders of shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock and such parity Preferred Stock (a "Preferred Stock 
Director") pursuant to such special voting rights shall forthwith terminate 
and the number of voting rights shall forthwith terminate and the number of 
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be reduced by the 
number of Preferred Stock Directors.  Any Preferred Stock Director may be 
removed by, and shall not be removed otherwise than by, the vote of the 
holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock and all other series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity 
with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends 
who were entitled to vote in such Preferred Stock Director's election, voting 
as a separate class, at a meeting called for such purpose.

		(c)	So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, the 
By-Laws of the Corporation shall contain provisions ensuring that the 
number of Directors constituting the entire Board of Directors of the 
Corporation shall at all times be such that the exercise, by the holders of 
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of parity Preferred 
Stock, of the right to elect Directors under the circumstances provided for in 
subclause (a) of this Section 4 will not contravene any provision of this 
Certificate of Incorporation restricting the number of Directors which may 
constitute the entire Board of Directors of the Corporation.

		(d)	Directors elected pursuant to subclause (a) of this Section 
4 shall serve until the earlier of (x) the next annual meeting of the 
stockholders of the Corporation and the election (by the holders of shares of 
the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of parity Preferred Stock) and 
qualification of their respective successors or (y) the next annual meeting of 
the stockholders of the Corporation following the date upon which all 
dividends in default on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have 
been paid in full.

		(e)	So long as a Preferential Dividend Non-Payment shall 
continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled 
by written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office or, if 
none remains in office, by vote of the holders of record of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other series of 
Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with 
respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon 
liquidation who are then entitled to vote in the election of such Preferred 
Stock Directors as provided above.  As long as the Preferential Dividend Non-
Payment shall continue, holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock 
shall not, as such stockholders, be entitled to vote on the election or removal 
of directors other than Preferred Stock Directors, but shall not be divested of 
any other voting rights provided to such stockholders by law with respect to 
any other matter to be acted upon by the stockholders of the Corporation.

		Section 5.	Liquidation Rights.

		(a)	In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up 
of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or otherwise, after 
payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the 
Corporation, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 
entitled to receive, in cash, out of the remaining net assets of the 
Corporation, the amount of One-Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each share of 
the Series A Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued 
and unpaid on each such share up to the date fixed for distribution, before 
any distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of the Common Stock 
or any other capital stock of the Corporation ranking (as to any such 
distribution) junior to the Series A Preferred Stock.  If upon any liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets distributable among 
the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other classes and 
series of preferred stock ranking (as to any such distribution) on a parity 
with the Series A Preferred Stock are insufficient to permit the payment in 
full to the holders of all such shares of all preferential amounts payable to
all such holders, then the entire assets of the Corporation thus distributable 
shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock and such other classes and series of preferred stock ranking 
(as to any such distribution) on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in 
proportion to the respective amounts that would be payable per share if such 
assets were sufficient to permit payment in full.

		(b)	For purposes of this Section 5, a distribution of assets in 
any dissolution, winding up or liquidation shall not include (i) any consoli-
dation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation, (ii) 
any dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation 
immediately followed by reincorporation of another corporation or (iii) a sale 
of other disposition of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets to 
another corporation; provided, however, that, in each case, effective provision 
is made in the certificate of incorporation of the resulting and surviving 
corporation or otherwise for the protection of the rights of the holders of 
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.

		(c)	After the payment of the full preferential amounts 
provided for herein to the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or 
funds necessary for such payment have been set aside in trust for the holders 
thereof, such holders shall be entitled to no other or further participation in 
the distribution of the assets of the Corporation.

		Section 6.	Conversion.

		(a)	Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall 
have the right, exercisable at any time and from time to time, except in the 
case of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption or to be 
exchanged for Debentures (as described in Section 7 hereof), to convert all or 
any such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Common 
Stock (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share) at 
the conversion price of $14.64 per share of the Common Stock (equivalent to 
a conversion rate of 6.8306 shares of the Common Stock for each share of the 
Series A Preferred Stock so converted), subject to adjustment as described 
below.  In the case of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock called for 
redemption or to be exchanged for Debentures (as described in Section 7 
hereof), conversion rights will expire at the close of business on the last 
business day preceding the Redemption Date or the last business day 
preceding the Exchange Date (as hereinafter defined), as the case may be.  
Notice of an optional redemption or exchange must be mailed not less than 
30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date or 
Exchange Date, as the case may be.  Upon conversion or exchange, no 
adjustment or payment will be made for dividends or interest, but if any 
holder surrenders a share of the Series A Preferred Stock for conversion after 
the close of business on the record date for the payment of a dividend and 
prior to the opening of business on the next dividend payment date, then, 
notwithstanding such conversion, the dividend payable on such dividend 
payment date will be paid to the registered holder of such share on such 
record date.  In such event, such share, when surrendered for conversion 
during the period between the close of business on any dividend payment 
record date and the opening of business on the corresponding dividend 
payment date, must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the 
dividend payable on such dividend payment date on the share so converted.

		(b)	Any holder of a share or shares of the Series A Preferred 
Stock electing to convert such share or shares thereof shall deliver the 
certificate or certificates therefor to the principal office of any transfer
agent for the Common Stock, with the form of notice of election to convert as
the Corporation shall prescribe fully completed and duly executed and (if so 
required by the Corporation or any conversion agent) accompanied by 
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and to any 
conversion agent, duly executed by the registered holder or his duly 
authorized attorney, and transfer taxes, stamps or funds therefor or evidence 
of payment thereof if required pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(d) hereof.  The 
conversion right with respect to any such shares shall be deemed to have 
been exercised at the date upon which the certificates therefor accompanied 
by such duly executed notice of election and instruments of transfer and such 
taxes, stamps, funds, or evidence of payment shall have been so delivered, 
and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of the Common Stock 
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record 
holder or holders of such shares of the Common Stock upon said date.

		(c)	No fractional shares of the Common Stock or scrip 
representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of shares of 
the Series A Preferred Stock.  If more than one share of the Series A 
Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same 
holder, the number of full shares of the Common Stock which shall be 
issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the 
aggregate number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered.  
Instead of any fractional shares of the Common Stock which would otherwise 
be issuable upon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, 
the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction in an 
amount equal to the same fraction of the closing price for the Common Stock 
on the last business day preceding the date of conversion.  The closing price 
for such day shall be the last reported sales price regular way or, in case no 
such reported sale takes place on such date, the average of the reported 
closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the New York 
Stock Exchange, or if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading 
on such Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the 
Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to 
trading on any national securities exchange, the closing sale price of the 
Common Stock or in case no reported sale takes place, the average of the 
closing bid and asked prices, on NASDAQ or any comparable system.  If the 
Common Stock is not quoted on NASDAQ or any comparable system, the 
Board of Directors shall in good faith determine the current market price on 
the basis of such quotation as it considers appropriate.

		(d)	If a holder converts a share or shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay any documentary, stamp or 
similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of Common Stock upon the 
conversion.  The holder, however, shall pay to the Corporation the amount of 
any tax which is due (or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Corporation 
payment thereof) if the shares are to be issued in name other than the name 
of such holder and shall pay to the Corporation any amount required by the 
last sentence of Section 6(a) hereof.

		(e)	The Corporation shall reserve and shall at all times have 
reserved out of its authorized but unissued shares of the Common Stock 
enough shares of the Common Stock to permit the conversion of the then 
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.  All shares of Common 
Stock which may be issued upon conversion of shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.  In 
order that the Corporation may issue shares of the Common Stock upon 
conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will 
endeavor to comply with all applicable Federal and State securities laws and 
will endeavor to list such shares of the Common Stock to be issued upon 
conversion on each securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed.

		(f)	The conversion rate in effect at any time shall be subject 
to adjustment from time to time as follows:

	(i)	In case the Corporation shall (1) pay a dividend in 
shares of the Common Stock to holders of the Common Stock, (2) 
make a distribution in shares of the Common Stock to holders of 
the Common Stock, (3) subdivide the outstanding shares of the 
Common Stock into a greater number of shares of the Common 
Stock or (4) combine the outstanding shares of the Common 
Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, the 
conversion rate immediately prior to such action shall be 
adjusted so that the holder of any shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be 
entitled to receive the number of shares of the Common Stock 
which he would have owned immediately following such action 
had such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock been converted 
immediately prior thereto.  An adjustment made pursuant to 
this Section 6(f)(i) shall become effective immediately after the 
record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall 
become effective immediately after the effective date in the case 
of a subdivision or combination.

	(ii)	In case the Corporation shall issue rights or 
warrants to substantially all holders of the Common Stock 
entitling them (for a period commencing no earlier than the 
record date for the determination of holders of the Common 
Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants and expiring 
not more than 45 days after such record date) to subscribe for or 
purchase shares of the Common Stock (or securities convertible 
into shares of the Common Stock) at a price per share less than 
the current market price (as determined pursuant to Section 
6(f)(iv) ) of the Common Stock on such record date, the number 
of shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the 
Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be adjusted 
so that the same shall be equal to the number determined by 
multiplying the number of shares of the Common Stock into 
which such share of the Series A Preferred Stock was 
convertible immediately prior to such record date by a fraction 
of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of the 
Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the 
number of additional shares of the Common Stock offered (or 
into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible), 
and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of 
the Common Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the 
number of shares of the Common Stock which the aggregate 
offering price of the offered shares of the Common Stock (or the 
aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so 
offered) would purchase at such current market price.  Such 
adjustments shall become effective immediately after such 
record date.

	(iii)	In case the Corporation shall distribute to all 
holders of the Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock 
other than the Common Stock, evidences of indebtedness or 
other assets (other than cash dividends out of current or 
retained earnings), or shall distribute to substantially all 
holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for 
securities (other than those referred to in Section 6(f)(ii)), then 
in each such case the number of shares of the Common Stock 
into which each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 
convertible shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the 
number determined by multiplying the number of shares of the 
Common Stock into which such share of the Series A Preferred 
Stock was convertible immediately prior to the date of such 
distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the 
current market price (determined as provided in Section 6(f)(iv)) 
of the Common Stock on the record date mentioned below, and 
of which the denominator shall be such current market price of 
the Common Stock, less the then fair market value (as 
determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination 
shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) of the 
portion of the assets so distributed or of such subscription rights 
or warrants applicable to one share of the Common Stock.  Such 
adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record 
date for the determination of the holders of the Common Stock 
entitled to receive such distribution.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, in the event that the Corporation shall distribute 
rights or warrants (other than those referred to in Section 
6(f)(ii)) ("Rights") pro rata to holders of the Common Stock, the 
Corporation may, in lieu of making any adjustment pursuant to 
this Section 6(f)(iii), make proper provision so that each holder 
of a share of Series A Preferred Stock who converts such share 
after the record date for such distribution and prior to the 
expiration or redemption of the Rights shall be entitled to 
receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of the 
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion (the "Conversion 
Shares"), a number of Rights to be determined as follows: (i) if 
such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the 
distribution to the holders of Rights of separate certificates 
evidencing such Rights (the "Distribution Date"), the same 
number of Rights to which a holder of a number of shares of the 
Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares is 
entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the 
terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights; and (ii) if 
such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same 
number of Rights to which a holder of a number of shares of the 
Common Stock into which a share of the Series A Preferred 
Stock so converted was convertible immediately prior to the 
Distribution Date would have been entitled on the Distribution 
Date in accordance with the terms and provisions of and 
applicable to the Rights.

	(iv)	The current market price per share of the Common 
Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily 
closing prices for thirty consecutive trading days commencing 
forty-five trading days before the day in question.  The closing 
price for each day shall be the last reported sales price regular 
way or, in case no such reported sale takes place on such date, 
the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices regular 
way, in either case on the New York Stock Exchange, or if the 
Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on such 
Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on 
which the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading or, if 
not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities 
exchange, the closing sale price of the Common Stock, or in case 
no reported sale takes place, the average of the closing bid and 
asked prices, on NASDAQ or any comparable system, or if the 
Common Stock is not quoted on NASDAQ or any comparable 
system, the closing sale price or, in case no reported sale takes 
place, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, as 
furnished by any two members of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by the 
Corporation for that purpose.

	(v)	In any case in which this Section 6 shall require 
that an adjustment be made immediately following a record 
date, the Corporation may elect to defer (but only until five 
business days following the mailing of the notice described in 
Section 6(j)) issuing to the holder of any share of the Series A 
Preferred Stock converted after such record date the shares of 
the Common Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation 
issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of the 
Common Stock and other capital stock of the Corporation 
issuable upon such conversion only on the basis of the 
conversion rate prior to adjustment; and, in lieu of the shares 
the issuance of which is so deferred, the Corporation shall issue 
or cause its transfer agents to issue due bills or other 
appropriate evidence of the right to receive such shares.

		(g)	No adjustment in the conversion rate shall be required 
until cumulative adjustments result in a concomitant change of 1% or more 
of the conversion price as existed prior to the last adjustment of the con-
version rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of 
this Section 6(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and 
taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under 
this Section 6 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-
hundredth of a share, as the case may be.  No adjustment to the conversion 
rate shall be made for cash dividends.

		(h)	In the event that, as a result of an adjustment made 
pursuant to Section 6(f), the holder of any share of the Series A Preferred 
Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive 
any shares of capital stock of the Corporation other than shares of the 
Common Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable 
upon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject 
to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly 
equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock 
contained in this Section 6.

		(i)	The Corporation may make such increases in the 
conversion rate, in addition to those required by Sections 6(f)(i), (ii) and
(iii), as it considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for
Federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not
be taxable to the recipients thereof.

		(j)	Whenever the conversion rate is adjusted, the 
Corporation shall promptly mail to all holders of record of shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock a notice of the adjustment and shall cause to be 
prepared a certificate signed by a principal financial officer of the corpora-
tion setting forth the adjusted conversion rate and a brief statement of the
facts requiring such adjustment and the computation thereof; such certificate
shall forthwith be filed with each transfer agent for the shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock.

		(k)	In the event that:

(1)	the Corporation takes any action which would
	require an adjustment in the conversion rate,

(2)	the Corporation consolidates or merges with, or
	transfers all or substantially all of its assets to,
	another corporation and stockholders of the Cor-
	poration must approve the transaction, or 

(3)	there is a dissolution or liquidation of the Cor-
	poration,

a holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may wish to convert some 
or all of such shares into shares of the Common Stock prior to the record date 
for, or the effective date of, the transaction so that he may receive the
rights, warrants, securities or assets which a holder of shares of the Common
Stock on that date may receive.  Therefore, the Corporation shall mail to
holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock a notice stating the proposed
record or effective date of the transaction, as the case may be.  The Corpora-
tion shall mail the notice at least 10 days before such date; however, failure
to mail such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any 
transaction referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section 6(k).

		(l)	If any of the following shall occur, namely: (i) any 
reclassification or change of outstanding shares of the Common Stock 
issuable upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (other 
than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par 
value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (ii) any 
consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party other than a 
merger in which the Corporation is the continuing corporation and which 
does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in 
name, or par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to 
par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding 
shares of the Common Stock or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or 
substantially all of the property or business of the Corporation as an
entirety, then the Corporation, or such successor or purchasing corporation,
as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification,
change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance provide in its certificate of
incorporation or other charter document that each share of the Series A 
Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of 
capital stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable 
upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance 
by a holder of the number of shares of the Common Stock deliverable upon 
conversion of such share of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to 
such reclassification,  change, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance.  
Such certificate of incorporation or other charter document shall provide for 
adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the 
adjustments provided for in this Section 6.  The foregoing, however, shall not 
in any way affect the right a holder of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock 
may otherwise have, pursuant to clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 
6(f)(iii), to receive Rights upon conversion of a share of the Series A Pre-
ferred Stock.  If, in the case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or 
conveyance, the stock or other securities and property (including cash)
receivable thereupon by a holder of the Common Stock includes shares of
capital stock or other securities and property of a corporation other than 
the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such consoli-
dation, merger, sale or conveyance, then the certificate of incorporation or
other charter document of such other corporation shall contain such addi-
tional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider 
necessary by reason of the foregoing.  The provision of this Section 6(l) 
shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or 
conveyances.

		Section 7.	Exchange.

		(a)	Requirements of Exchange.  At the Corporation's option, 
all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock may be exchanged on any dividend payment date 
commencing July 1, 1996, subject to certain conditions stated in the 
immediately following sentence, for the Corporation's 8 1/2% Convertible 
Subordinated Exchange Debentures due July 1, 2012 (the "Debentures") to 
be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") dated as of July 9, 1992 
between the Company and Fidelity Bank, National Association in the form of 
Exhibit 4.1 to the Corporation's Registration Statement on Form S-2 
(Registration No. 33-47872), as amended, declared effective by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission on July 1, 1992, at an exchange rate of $100.00 
principal amount of the Debentures for each share of the Series A Preferred 
Stock.  Such exchange may be made only if, at the time of exchange (i) the 
Indenture shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 
as amended, (ii) there shall be no dividend arrearage (including the dividend 
payable on the date of exchange) on the shares of the Series A Preferred 
Stock, and (iii) no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) under 
Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing.  In the event that such 
exchange would result in the issuance of a Debenture in a principal amount 
which is not an integral multiple of $25, the difference between such  
principal amount and the highest integral multiple of $25 (which may be 
zero) which is less than such principal amount shall be paid to the holder in 
cash.

		(b)	Notice of Exchange.  The Corporation will mail to each 
holder of record of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock written notice of 
its intention to exchange not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the 
date fixed for the exchange (the "Exchange Date").  Each such notice shall 
state: (i) the Exchange Date, (ii) the place or places where certificates for 
such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for 
exchange into Debentures, (iii) that dividends on the shares of the Series A 
Preferred Stock to be exchanged will cease to accrue on such Exchange Date 
and (iv) that conversion rights in respect thereof will terminate at the close 
of business on the last business day proceeding such Exchange Date.  Except as 
may be otherwise required by applicable law, the form of the Indenture may 
not be amended or supplemented before the Exchange Date without the 
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the 
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, except that those changes 
which pursuant to Section 11.02 of the Indenture require the consent of each 
holder affected thereby shall require the consent of all the holders of the 
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  The Corporation will cause 
the Debentures to be authenticated on the dividend payment date on which 
the exchange is effective, and the Corporation will pay interest on the 
Debentures at the rate and on the dates specified in such Indenture from and 
after the Exchange Date.

		(c)	Rights After Exchange Date.  If notice has been mailed as 
aforesaid, from and after the close of business on the Exchange Date (unless 
default shall be made by the Corporation in issuing Debentures in exchange 
for, or in making the final dividend payment on, the outstanding shares of 
the Series A Preferred Stock on the Exchange Date), dividends on the shares 
of the Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue, and such shares shall 
no longer be deemed to be issued and outstanding, and all rights of the 
holders thereof as stockholders of the Corporation (except the right to receive 
from the Corporation the Debentures) shall cease and terminate.  Upon 
surrender in accordance with said notice of the certificates for any shares of 
the Series A Preferred  Stock so exchanged (properly endorsed or assigned for 
transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state), 
such shares shall be exchanged by the Corporation into Debentures as 
aforesaid.  Dividends due on the quarterly dividend payment date on which 
the exchange is effected will be mailed to holders in the regular course.

		Section 8.	Ranking.  With regard to rights to receive 
dividends and distributions upon dissolution of the Corporation, the Series A 
Preferred Stock shall rank prior to the Common Stock and on a parity with 
any other Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation, unless the terms of such 
other Preferred Stock provide otherwise and, if applicable, the requirements 
of Section 9 hereof have been complied with.

		Section 9.	Limitations.  In addition to any other rights 
provided by applicable law, so long as any shares of the Series A Preferred 
Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not, without the affirmative 
vote, or the written consent as provided by law, of the holders of at least two-
thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting 
separately,

		(a)	create, authorize or issue any class or series of capital 
stock or rights to subscribe to or acquire any class or series of capital stock 
ranking as to payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation 
prior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock; or

		(b)	amend, alter or appeal, whether by merger, consolidation 
or otherwise, any of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation 
(including this Certificate of Designation) that would change the  
preferences, rights or powers with respect to the  Series A Preferred Stock so 
as to affect the Series A Preferred Stock adversely;

but (except as otherwise required by applicable law) nothing herein 
contained shall require such a vote or consent (i) in connection with any 
increase in the total number of authorized shares of the Common Stock, or 
(ii) in connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of 
shares ranking, as to dividends and distribution of assets  upon liquidation, 
junior to the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that no such vote 
or written consent of the holders of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock 
shall be required if, at or prior to the time when the issuance of any such 
shares ranking prior to the Series A Preferred Stock is to be made or any 
such change is to take effect, as the case may be, provision is made for the 
redemption of all the then outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred 
Stock.

		Section 10.	No Preemptive Rights.  No holder of shares of the 
Series A Preferred Stock will possess any preemptive rights to subscribe for 
or acquire any unissued shares of capital stock of the Corporation (whether 
now or hereafter authorized) or securities of the Corporation convertible into 
or carrying a right to subscribe to or acquire shares of capital stock of the 
Corporation.






DESIGNATIONS OF
SERIES B JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK


		Section 1.	Designation and Amount.  The shares of such 
series shall be designated as "Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock" 
(the "Series B Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting the 
Series B Preferred Stock shall be 200,000.  Such number of shares may be 
increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that 
no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to 
a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number 
of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of  outstanding options, 
rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities 
issued by the Corporation convertible into Series B Preferred Stock.

		Section 2.	Dividends and Distributions.

		(A)	Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of Series 
A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock of the Corporation or of any 
other series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and 
superior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the 
holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of 
shares of common stock, par value $2.50 per share of the Corporation (the 
"Common Stock"), and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, 
when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally 
available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first 
day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date 
being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), 
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first 
issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, in an 
amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 
or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times 
the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the 
aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or 
other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common 
Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by 
reclassification or otherwise), declared on the shares of Common Stock since 
the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with 
respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance 
of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock.  In the event 
the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the shares 
of Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision 
or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock 
(by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of 
Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, 
then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under  clause 
(b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount 
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common 
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of 
which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding 
immediately prior to such event.

		(B)	The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution 
on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section 
immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the shares of 
Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); 
provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been 
declared on the shares of Common Stock during the period between any 
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series B Preferred 
Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend 
Payment Date.

		(C)	Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on 
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend 
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the 
date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first 
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall 
begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of
issueis a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date
for determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to 
receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment 
Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be 
cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but 
unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of 
Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such 
dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated 
pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time 
outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the 
determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to 
receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record 
date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment 
thereof.

		Section 3.	Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

		(A)	Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set 
forth, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof 
to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the 
Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay 
any dividend on the shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common 
Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than 
by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser 
number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of 
votes per share to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were 
entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying 
such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of 
Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the 
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were 
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

		(B)	Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other 
Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar 
stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the 
holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the 
Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on 
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

		(C)	Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by 
law, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights 
and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled 
to vote with holders of shares of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking 
any corporate action.

		Section 4.	Certain Restrictions.

		(A)	Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or 
distributions payable on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in Section 
2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and 
distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

(i)	declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, 
on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B 
Preferred Stock;

(ii)	declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, 
on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to 
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with 
the Series B Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on 
the Series B Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which 
dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total 
amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then 
entitled;

(iii)	redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration 
shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B 
Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time 
redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior 
stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation 
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, 
liquidation or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock; or

(iv)	redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration 
any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock 
ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock, except in 
accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by 
publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all 
holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of 
Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend 
rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective 
series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in 
fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or 
classes.

		(B)	The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the 
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of 
stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) 
of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and 
in such manner.

		Section 5.	Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any 
manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the 
acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation become 
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be  reissued as 
part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and 
restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation, 
or in any other Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred 
Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.

		Section 6.	Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution 
shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B 
Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to 
accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not 
declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of 
Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per 
share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 
100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of 
shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a 
parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) 
with the Series B Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the 
Series B Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total 
amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  In the event the Corporation shall at 
any time declare or pay any dividend on the shares of Common Stock payable 
in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or 
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification 
or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into 
a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such 
case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred 
Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in 
clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such 
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of 
Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the 
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were 
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

		Section 7.	Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the Corporation 
shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction 
in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into 
other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such 
case each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the same time be 
similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the 
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the 
aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property 
(payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of 
Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall 
at any time declare or pay any dividend on the shares of Common Stock 
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or 
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification 
or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into 
a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such 
case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the 
exchange or change of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by

supervisor or manager of the corporation or a constituent corporation 
absorbed in a consolidation or merger, or while a director, officer or 
supervisor or manager of the corporation is or was serving at the request 
of the corporation or a constituent corporation absorbed in a consolidated 
or merger, as a director, officer or supervisor or manager of another 
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against 
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid 
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with 
such action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the indemnified liability

control of the corporation between the time of the action or failure to act

indemnification shall be determined by independent legal counsel selected

in another capacity while holding such office, and shall inure to the 
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any such person.

SECTION  6.	Insurance and Other Indemnification

	The Board of Directors shall have the power to (i) authorize the 
corporation to purchase and maintain, at the corporation's expense, 
insurance on behalf of the corporation and on behalf of others to the 
extent that power to do so has not been prohibited by applicable law, and 
(ii) give other indemnification to the extent permitted by law.

	SECTION 3.  Administration.

	3.01.  Authority of the Committee.  The Plan shall be 
administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall have full and 
final authority to take the following actions and any other 
necessary actions in administering the Plan, unless precluded in 
this document:

		(i)  to select and designate persons to whom Awards shall 
be granted;

		(ii)  to designate Subsidiaries;

		(iii)  to determine the type or types of Awards to be 
granted to each person eligible under Section 5; 

		(iv)  to determine the number of Awards to be granted, 
the number of Shares to which an Award will relate, the terms 
and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan 
(including, but not limited to, any exercise price, grant 
price, or purchase price, any restriction or condition, any 
schedule for lapse of restrictions or conditions relating to 
transferability or forfeiture, exercisability, or settlement 
of an Award, and waivers or accelerations thereof, and waiver 
of performance or other conditions relating to an Award, 
based in each case on such considerations as the Committee 
shall determine), and all other matters to be determined in 
connection with an Award;

		(v)  to determine whether, to what extent, and under what 
circumstances an Award may be settled, or the exercise price 
of an Award may be paid, in cash, Shares, other Awards, or 
other property, or an Award may be canceled, forfeited, or 
surrendered;

		(vi)  to prescribe the form of each Award Agreement, 
which need not be identical for each Participant;

		(vii)  to adopt, amend, suspend, waive, and rescind rules 
and regulations relating to the Plan and appoint such agents 
as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable to 
administer the Plan;

		(viii)  to correct any defect or supply any omission or 
reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan and to construe and 
interpret the Plan and any Award, rules and regulations, 
Award Agreement, or other instrument hereunder; and

		(ix)  to make all other decisions and determinations as 
may be required under the terms of the Plan or as the 
Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the 
administration of the Plan.



	3.02.  Manner of Exercise of Committee Authority.  Unless 
authority is specifically reserved to the Board under the terms 
of the Plan, or applicable law, the Committee shall have sole 
discretion in exercising such authority under the Plan.  Any 
action of the Committee with respect to the Plan shall be final, 
conclusive, and binding on all persons, including the Company, 
Subsidiaries, Participants, any person claiming any rights under 
the Plan from or through any Participant, and shareholders.  The 
express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the 
taking of any action by the Committee, shall not be construed as 
limiting any power or authority of the Committee.  A memorandum 
signed by all members of the Committee shall constitute the act 
of the Committee without the necessity, in such event, to hold a 
meeting.  The Committee may delegate to officers or managers of 
the Company the authority, subject to such terms as the Committee 
shall determine, to perform administrative functions under the 
Plan.

	3.03.  Limitation of Liability.  Each member of the Committee 
shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report 
or other information furnished to him by any officer or other 
employee of the Company or by a professional retained by the 
Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.  No member 
of the Committee, nor any officer or employee of the Company 
acting on behalf of the Committee, shall be personally liable for 
any action, determination, or interpretation taken or made in 
good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the 
Committee and any officer or employee of the Company acting on 
their behalf, shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully 
indemnified and protected by the Company with respect to any such 
action, determination, or interpretation.

	SECTION 4.  Shares Subject to the Plan.  Subject to 
adjustment as provided in Section 10, the total number of Shares 
reserved and available for Awards under the Plan shall be 
350,000, but no more than 100,000 can be granted in the form of 
Restricted Stock.  If any Shares to which an Award relates are 
forfeited or the Award is terminated without a distribution of 
Shares, any Shares counted against the number of Shares reserved 
and available under the Plan with respect to such Award shall, to 
the extent of any such forfeiture or termination, again be 
available for Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that such 
Shares shall be available for issuance only to the extent 
permitted under Rule 16b-3.

	SECTION 5.  Eligibility.  Awards may be granted only to 
individuals who are officers or other salaried employees 
(including employees who are also directors) of the Company.  No 
Award shall be granted to any non-employee director.  An 
Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to a Ten Percent 
Shareholder except on such terms concerning the option price and 
conditions of exercise as described in Section 6.03. with respect 
to such person. 

	SECTION 6.  Specific Terms of Awards.

	6.01.  General.  Awards may be granted on the terms and 
conditions set forth in this Section 6.  In addition, the 
Committee may impose on any Award or the exercise thereof, at the 
date of grant or thereafter, such additional terms and 
conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as 
the Committee shall determine, including without limitation the 
acceleration of vesting of any Awards or terms requiring 
forfeiture of Awards in the event of termination of employment by 
the Participant.  



	6.02.  Restricted Stock.  The Committee is authorized to 
grant Restricted Stock to persons eligible under Section 5 on the 
following terms and conditions:

		(i)  Issuance and Restrictions.  Restricted Stock shall 
be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose, 
which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at 
such times, under such circumstances, in such installments, 
or otherwise as the Committee shall determine.

		(ii)  Vesting Conditions.  Restricted Stock shall cease 
to be subject to forfeiture at the end of the restriction 
period if the Participant remains an employee of the Company 
throughout the restriction period, and if applicable, any 
performance criteria specified by the Committee are met 
during the restriction period (or, if the Committee so 
provides, vesting could occur at an earlier date than 
otherwise established if the preestablished performance 
criteria are met at an earlier date).  Notwithstanding the 
aforesaid, the Committee may determine in any individual 
case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions relating to 
Restricted Stock will be waived in whole or in part in the 
event of terminations resulting from specified causes.

		(iii)  Certificates of Shares.  Restricted Stock granted 
under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the 
Committee shall determine.  As soon as reasonably possible 
after vesting has occurred, the Company will cause a 
certificate of shares registered in the name of the 
Participant to be issued and delivered to the Participant.

		(iv)  Rights of Shareholders.  A Participant shall have 
no rights as a shareholder (including the right to vote, or 
to receive dividends) until the Restricted Stock has vested 
and certificates of shares are registered in his or her name.

	6.03  Options.  The Committee is authorized to grant Options 
to persons eligible under Section 5 on the following terms and 
conditions:

		(i)  Exercise Price.  The exercise price per Share 
purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the 
Committee; provided, however, that such exercise price shall 
be not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date 
of Grant of such Option.  Additionally, the exercise price 
per Share of any Incentive Stock Options granted to a Ten 
Percent Shareholder shall not be less than 110 percent of the 
Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant of such 
Option.



		(ii)  Time and Method of Exercise.  The Committee shall 
determine the time or times at which an Option may be 
exercised in whole or in part, the methods by which such 
exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of 
such payment, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, 
other Awards or awards issued under other Company plans, or 
other property (including notes or other contractual 
obligations of Participants to make payment on a deferred 
basis, such as through "cashless exercise" arrangements), and 
the methods by which Shares will be delivered or deemed to be 
delivered to Participants.  Options shall expire not later 
than ten years after the date of grant.  Incentive Stock 
Options granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder shall expire not 
later than five years after the Date of Grant.

		(iii)  Incentive Stock Options.  The terms of any 
Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall comply in 
all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code, 
including but not limited to the requirements that no 
Incentive Stock Option shall be granted more than ten years 
after the effective date of the Plan.  Anything in the Plan 
to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of the Plan relating 
to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended, or 
altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under 
the Plan be exercised, so as to disqualify either the Plan or 
any Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code.  

	SECTION 7.  Certain Provisions Applicable to Awards.

	7.01.  Maximum Individual Option Grants.  For purposes of 
qualifying for Section 162(m) of the Code, no Participant may 
receive Options during the life of the Plan covering or 
representing more than 90,000 Shares.

	7.02.  Term of Awards.  The term of each Award shall be for 
such period as may be determined by the Committee; provided, 
however, that in no event shall the term of any Award granted 
exceed a period of ten years from the Date of Grant.

	SECTION 8.  General Restrictions Applicable to Awards.

	8.01.  Restrictions Under Rule 16b-3.

		8.01.1.  Nontransferability.  Awards which constitute 
derivative securities (including any  option or other award 
in the nature of a right) shall not be transferable by a 
Participant except by will or the laws of descent and 
distribution or, if then permitted under Rule 16b-3, pursuant 
to a qualified domestic relations order as defined under the 
Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974, as amended, or the rules thereunder.  Incentive 
Stock Options and, if then required by Rule 16b-3, any other 
derivative security granted under the Plan, shall be 
exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only by such 
Participant or his guardian or legal representative.

		8.01.2.  Compliance with Rule 16b-3.  It is the intent of 
the Company that this Plan comply in all respects with Rule 
16b-3 in connection with any Award granted to a person who is 
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Accordingly, if 
any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement does not 
comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 as then applicable 
to any such person, such provision shall be construed or 
deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such 
requirements with respect to such person.

	8.02.  Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares 
delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise 
thereof shall be subject to such stop-transfer order and other 
restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under applicable 
federal or state laws, rules and regulations thereunder, and the 
rules of any national securities exchange on which Shares are 
listed.  The Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed 
on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such 
restrictions or any other restrictions that may be applicable to 
Shares, including under the terms of the Plan or any Award 
Agreement.  In addition, during any period in which Awards or 
Shares are subject to restrictions under the terms of the Plan or 
any Award Agreement, the Committee may require the Participant to 
enter into an agreement providing that certificates representing 
Shares issuable or issued pursuant to an Award shall remain in 
the physical custody of the Company or such other person as the 
Committee may designate.

	SECTION 9.  Change of Control Provisions.  Notwithstanding 
any other provision of the Plan, the following acceleration and 
valuation provisions shall apply in the event of a "Change in 
Control" as defined in this Section 9:

	9.01.  Acceleration and Cash-Out Rights.  In the event of a 
"Change in Control," as defined in Section 9.02, automatically in 
the case of Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange 
Act, and unless otherwise determined by the Board in writing at 
or after grant but prior to the occurrence of the Change of 
Control in the case of Participants not subject to Section 16 of 
the Exchange Act.

		(i)  All Restricted Stock shall be deemed fully vested; 
and

		(ii)  Any Option that was not previously exercisable and 
vested shall become fully exercisable 	and vested.

	9.02.  Change of Control.  For purposes of Section 9.01, a 
"Change of Control" shall mean:

		(a)  The acquisition by any individual, entity or group 
(within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the 
Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of 
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20 percent 
or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of Common 
Stock of the Company (the "Outstanding Company Common Stock") 
or (ii) combined voting power of the then outstanding voting 
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the 
election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting 
Securities"); provided, however, that the following 
acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control; (i) 
any acquisition by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, 
(ii) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related 
trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries or (iii) any acquisition by any corporation with 
respect to which, following such acquisition, more than 75 
percent of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of 
common stock of such corporation and the combined voting 
power of the then outstanding voting securities of such 
corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of 
directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, 
by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities 
who were the beneficial owners; respectively, of the 
Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company 
Voting Securities immediately prior to such acquisition in 
substantially the same proportions as their ownership, 
immediately prior to such acquisition, of the Outstanding 
Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company Voting 
Securities, as the case may be; or

		(b)  Individuals who, as of the effective date of the 
Plan, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for 
any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; 
provided, however, that any individual becoming a director 
subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination 
for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a 
vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising 
the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such 
individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but 
excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose 
initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an 
actual or threatened solicitation to which Rule 14a-11 of 
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act applies or 
other actual threatened solicitation of proxies or consents; 
or

		(c)  Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a 
reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, with 
respect to which all or substantially all of the individuals 
and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of 
the Outstanding Company Common Stock and Outstanding Company 
Voting Securities immediately prior to such reorganization, 
merger or consolidation do not, following such 
reorganization, merger or consolidation, beneficially own, 
directly or indirectly, more than 75 percent of, 
respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock and 
the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting 
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of 
directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting 
from such reorganization, merger or consolidation in 
substantially the same proportions as their ownership, 
immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or 
consolidation of the Outstanding Company Common Stock and 
Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be.

		SECTION 10.  Adjustment Provisions.  In the event that 
the Committee shall determine that any dividend or other 
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, or other 
property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, 
reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, 
repurchase, or share exchange, or other similar corporate 
transaction or event, affects the Shares such that an adjustment 
is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to 
prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants 
under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it 
may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind 
of Shares which may thereafter be issued in connection with 
Awards, (ii) the limit on the number of Shares subject to Option 
Grants for any Participant, (iii) the number and kind of Shares 
issued or issuable in respect of outstanding Awards, and (iv) the 
exercise price, grant price, or purchase price relating to any 
Award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash 
payment with respect to any outstanding Award; provided, however, 
in each case, that, with respect to Incentive Stock Options, no 
such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such 
authority would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of 
the Code.  In addition, the Committee is authorized to make 
adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria 
included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring 
events (including, without limitation, events described in the 
preceding sentence) affecting the Company or the financial 
statements of the Company, or in response to changes in 
applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles.

	SECTION 11.  Changes to the Plan and Awards.

	11.01.  Changes to the Plan.  The Board may amend, alter, 
suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan; provided, however, 
that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no 
amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or 
termination of the Plan may impair the rights of such Participant 
under any Award theretofore granted to him.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, without the approval of the shareholders of 
Westmoreland Coal Company, no amendment may be made that would 
(i) materially increase the aggregate number of Shares that may 
be issued under the Plan, except by operation of section 10, (ii) 
materially modify the requirements for eligibility to participate 
in the Plan, or (iii) materially increase the benefits accruing 
to Participants.


	SECTION 12.  General Provisions.

	12.01.  No Rights to Awards.  No Participant or employee 
shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and 
there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of 
Participants and employees.

	12.02.  No Shareholder Rights.  No Award shall confer on any 
Participant any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company 
unless and until Shares are duly issued or transferred to the 
Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award.

	12.03.  Tax Withholding.  The Company is authorized to 
withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award 
under the Plan, including from a distribution of Shares, or any 
payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts for 
withholding and other taxes due with respect thereto, its 
exercise, or any payment thereunder, and to take such other 
action as the Committee may deem necessary or advisable to enable 
the Company and Participants to satisfy obligations for the 
payment of withholding taxes and other tax liabilities relating 
to any Award.  This authority shall include authority to withhold 
or receive Shares or other property and to make cash payments in 
respect thereof in satisfaction of Participant's tax obligations.

	12.04.  No Right to Employment.  Nothing contained in the 
Plan or any Award Agreement shall confer, and no grant of an 
Award shall be construed as conferring, upon any employee any 
right to continue in the employ of the Company or to interfere in 
any way with the right of the Company to terminate his employment 
at any time or increase or decrease his compensation from the 
rate in existence at the time of granting of an Award.

	12.05.  Unfunded Status of Awards.  The Plan is intended to 
constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred 
compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a 
Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan 
or any Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are 
greater than those of a general creditor of the Company; 
provided, however, that the Committee may authorize the creation 
of trusts or make other arrangements to meet the Company's 
obligations under the Plan to deliver cash, Shares, other Awards, 
or other property pursuant to any award, which trusts or other 
arrangements shall be consistent with the "unfunded" status of 
the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the 
consent of each affected Participant.

	12.06.  Other Compensatory Arrangements.  The Company shall 
be permitted to adopt other or additional compensation 
arrangements (which may include arrangements which relate to 
Awards), and such arrangements may be either generally applicable 
or applicable only in specific cases.

	12.07.  Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be 
issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award.  The 
Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other 
property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or 
whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be 
forfeited or otherwise eliminated.


	12.08.  Governing Law.  The validity, construction, and 
effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the 
Plan, and any Award Agreement shall be determined in accordance 
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to 
principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.
	
	SECTION 13.  Effective Date.  The Plan shall become effective 
on February 1, 1995; provided, however, that within one year 
after such date, the Plan shall have been approved by the 
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Shares 
present or represented and entitled to vote (and the affirmative 
vote of a majority of the Shares voting) at a meeting of the 
Company's shareholders, or any adjournment thereof.  The 
termination date of the Plan shall be February 1, 2005.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Plan of Reorganization

On November 8, 1994, the Company filed a petition under Chapter 
11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code seeking the confirmation of a 
so-called "pre-packaged" plan of reorganization (the "Plan of 
Reorganization").  This measure was taken to obtain protection 
from the Company's principal lenders pending the closing of the 
sale of the assets of Criterion which closing was also 
facilitated by the filing.  The Federal Bankruptcy Court approved 
the Company's Plan of Reorganization on December 16, 1994.  As 
provided in the Plan of Reorganization, the Company proceeded to 
complete its sale of the assets of Criterion Coal Company 
("Criterion") on December 22, 1994 and paid in full its maturing 
debt obligations at which time it emerged from bankruptcy.  Refer 
to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional 
information concerning the Company's Plan of Reorganization.


Years Ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992
Liquidity and Capital Resources


Cash provided from operating activities totalled 
$13,622,000, $32,600,000 and $1,758,000 in 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.  The Company's withdrawal from the 
export market and its related decreased participation in the 
brokered coal business provided $19,208,000 of cash in 1994.  
This amount resulted from reductions since December 31, 1993 
of $17,940,000 related to export receivables, $6,000,000 
related to domestic receivables for coal sold on behalf of 
unaffiliated producers and $3,553,000 related to coal export 
inventory, all of which was partially offset by an 
$8,285,000 reduction in accounts payables related to 
unaffiliated producers.  Cash provided from operating 
activities in 1993 was due principally to an aggressive 
working capital management effort as the Company initiated 
its withdrawal from the export market in 1993. The Company 
reduced trade receivable balances by $17,199,000 and coal 
inventory levels by $5,596,000 in 1993.

Cash provided from investing activities in 1994 was 
$43,886,000 and cash used in investing activities totalled 
$7,223,000 and $40,514,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  
The Company realized net proceeds from the sale of the assets 
of Criterion and other assets totalling $78,273,000 in 1994. 
Cash used for investment purposes at Westmoreland Energy, Inc. 
("WEI") was $27,928,000 during 1994 of which $23,178,000 was 
used for equity funding commitments for Independent Power 
Operations.  The Company invested $5,892,000 in capital 
additions in 1994,  consisting primarily of $3,200,000 for 
underground equipment at Virginia Division and $1,544,000 at 
Westmoreland Resources, Inc.("WRI").  1993 capital additions 
of $8,190,000 consisted primarily of $5,230,000 at Criterion 
and $2,357,000 at the Virginia Division.  The 1993 capital 
additions at Criterion were comprised of $3,883,000 for mining 
equipment, which was sold and leased back, $800,000 for mine 
development and $547,000 for expansion of Criterion's 
preparation plant.  The 1993 capital additions at the Virginia 
Division consisted of $1,800,000 to sustain operations and 
$557,000 for mine development.  The Company invested 
$33,694,000 in capital additions in Coal Operations and 
$9,641,000 in equity funding commitments for Independent Power 
Operations in 1992. 1992 capital additions included $9,344,000 
for infrastructure construction to support a new longwall 
mining system at the Pierrepont Mine in Virginia and 
$11,521,000 for a new coal preparation plant at Criterion.  
The Company plans to invest approximately $4,600,000 for 
equity funding commitments in its Roanoke Valley II ("ROVA 
II") project during the second half of 1995 and $1,700,000 in 
sustaining capital in coal operations during 1995 which will 
be funded through existing cash balances.  Refer to Note 6  
for further details related to the ROVA II equity funding 
commitment.

Cash used in financing activities in 1994 and 1993 totalled 
$66,317,000 and $11,864,000, respectively.  Cash provided 
from financing activities in 1992 totalled $35,656,000.  
Cash used in 1994 included the repayment of the Company's 
Revolving Credit Loan of $12,000,000, its 10% Senior 
Unsecured Notes of $12,825,000, the payment of the 
Reimbursement Obligation related to the Dominion Terminal 
Associates ("DTA") bonds of $26,560,000 (refer to Notes 5 
and 7) and other debt repayments of $3,281,000.  The Company 
also transferred $8,210,000 during 1994 to a cash deposit 
account to collateralize the Company's outstanding surety 
bonds for its workers' compensation self-insurance programs.   
The Company paid preferred stock dividends of $2,444,000 in 
1994.  Cash used in 1993 included debt repayments of 
$9,346,000 of which $2,500,000 related to the Company's 
Revolving Credit Loan, $2,475,000 related to the 10% Senior 
Unsecured Notes and the remainder was primarily related to 
capital lease obligations.  Preferred stock dividends of 
$4,888,000 were paid in 1993.  Cash provided in 1992 was 
$54,528,000 from the issuance of preferred stock and 
$14,500,000 from the Company's Revolving Credit Loan.  
Repayments of debt in 1992 totalled $8,479,000 and 
$18,496,000 was used to purchase and retire common stock of 
the Company.   Preferred stock dividends of $1,140,000, and 
common stock dividends of $2,433,000 were paid in 1992.


The Company's total debt to capitalization ratio (total debt, 
divided by the sum of total debt, minority interest and 
shareholders' equity) was 21% at December 31, 1994 and 51% at 
December 31, 1993.  This substantial improvement is due to the 
repayment of debt out of the proceeds from the sale of the assets 
of Criterion and the impact on shareholders' equity of the 
related gain.  

The Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 
31, 1994 totalled $15,453,000 (including $2,445,000 at WRI).  At 
December 31, 1993, cash and cash equivalents totalled $24,262,000 
(including $2,772,000 at WRI).  None of the Company's cash and 
cash equivalents was or is restricted as to use or disposition.   
The cash at WRI, a 60%-owned subsidiary, is available to the 
Company only through dividends.   The Company's current ratio was 
.97 at December 31, 1994, up from .93 at December 31, 1993.  

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid 
quarterly from the third quarter of 1992 through the first 
quarter of 1994.  The declaration and payment of preferred stock 
dividends was suspended in the second quarter of 1994 in 
connection with extension agreements with the Company's principal 
lenders.  The last quarterly preferred stock dividend paid in 
1994 was on April 1, 1994.  Common stock dividend payments were 
not permitted under covenants contained in the Company's loan 
agreements from January 1993 through December 22, 1994.  Further 
payment of common stock dividends is not permitted until the 
preferred stock dividends that are in arrears are made current.  
On February 1, 1995 the Board of Directors declared a first 
quarter 1995 preferred stock dividend to be paid April 1, 1995 to 
holders of record as of March 10, 1995.  The three quarterly 
dividends which are in arrears at December 31, 1994 (those 
dividends whose payment dates would have been July 1, 1994, 
October 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995) amount to $3,666,000 in the 
aggregate ($6.38 per preferred share).  The Company's Board of 
Directors will continue to review the payment of quarterly 
preferred stock dividends as well as the three preferred stock 
dividends which are in arrears, in light of the Company's ongoing 
business circumstances.

There are also statutory restrictions limiting the payment of 
preferred stock dividends under Delaware law, the state in which 
the Company is incorporated.  Under Delaware law, the Company is 
permitted to pay preferred stock dividends only:  (1) out of 
surplus, surplus being the amount of shareholders' equity in 
excess of the par value of the Company's two classes of stock; or 
(2) in the event there is no surplus, out of net profits for the 
fiscal year in which a preferred stock dividend is declared 
(and/or out of net profits from the preceding fiscal year), but 
only to the extent that shareholders equity exceeds par value of 
preferred stock ($575,000).  The combined par value of the 
Company's preferred and common stocks is $17,965,000.  The 
Company's shareholders' equity at December 31, 1994 was 
$50,724,000.  



Liquidity Outlook

The Company continues its strategic review of operations as part 
of its plan to improve cash flow, eliminate non-strategic or 
underperforming assets and reposition the Company so that it can 
achieve meaningful and sustainable profitability.  

As a result of these efforts the Company has shutdown and/or sold 
the assets of several operations and has withdrawn from certain 
markets in which it once participated.  In 1994, these measures 
have allowed the Company to pay off its principal debt 
obligations, fund $23,178,000 of equity commitments for its 
independent power projects and conserve working capital.  The 
Company believes it now has sufficient cash resources to meet its 
current obligations and working capital needs, including the 
remaining equity funding commitments of an estimated $4,600,000 
for current WEI projects.  

The Company is continuing its efforts to improve the 
competitiveness and profitability of its Virginia Division 
through cost control, productivity improvement and closure of 
non-essential high cost operations.  By July 1996, the Virginia 
Division will lose the benefit of two coal supply contracts 
having sales prices substantially above the current market price 
for similar types of coal.  The Georgia Power Company coal supply 
contract, with shipments of 942,000 tons in 1994, terminates in 
April 1995.  The above market price of the Duke Power Company 
coal supply contract, with shipments of 2,792,000 tons in 1994, 
expires in July 1996; however, the contract can be extended 
through December 31, 2000 provided the parties can reach an 
agreement on the sales price after July 1996.   It is likely that 
the new sales price would be at current market prices.  In 1994, 
shipments to these two customers accounted for approximately 83% 
of the Virginia Division's sales tons.  In 1994, the Company's 
Virginia Division experienced an operating loss of $3,726,000, 
including approximately $18,000,000 of non-cash expenses for 
depreciation and postretirement medical costs.   The Virginia 
Division will not be able to operate profitably or generate 
positive cash flow from operations after July 1996, even after 
excluding the ongoing fixed cash costs of idled 
operations(estimated to be in excess of $10,000,000 annually), 
which primarily consist of postretirement medical and workers' 
compensation benefits, unless market prices for eastern coals 
increase significantly and/or the Company is able to 
substantially reduce the cost per ton of the coal produced.  The 
projected cash flows during the next two years, including 
anticipated cash shutdown costs but excluding postretirement 
medical costs, exceed the carrying value of the assets at 
December 31, 1994.  Therefore, the Virginia Division's assets are 
not deemed to be impaired at this time.

The Company is reviewing its options, which include the possible 
future sale, downsizing or shutdown of all or a portion of the 
Virginia Division, at which time the Company may be required to 
recognize, for accounting purposes, a significant portion of its 
postretirement medical liabilities.  The total amount of the 
postretirement medical liabilities which would be expensed at the 
time the Virginia Division's shutdown, downsizing or sale occurs 
is not known at this time, however the impact of this non-cash 
expense on shareholders' equity could affect the Company's 
ability to pay preferred stock dividends.  Refer to Note 10 for 
further information regarding the actuarially estimated net 
present value of postretirement medical benefits related to the 
Company's self-insured single employer plans and the UMWA Benefit 
Trust Funds which are multi-employer plans.  Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information regarding dividend restrictions under 
Delaware law.


The major factor hampering the Company's long-term liquidity 
outlook is the significant "heritage costs" of the Company.  
These heritage costs primarily consist of cash payments for 
postretirement medical benefits and for workers' 
compensation.  The Company has ongoing cash expenditures in 
excess of $12,000,000 per year for postretirement medical 
benefits and over $6,000,000 per year for workers' 
compensation benefits.

The Company expects to fund its near-term heritage costs out of 
current cash balances and from positive operating cash flow of 
the Virginia Division, regular cash distributions from the 
Company's independent power projects and WRI, continued 
divestment or improvement of underperforming assets and cost 
reductions and productivity improvements.  In 1995 the Company 
sold its Hampton Division and has an agreement to sell the assets 
of its subsidiary Cleancoal Terminal Company("Cleancoal").  Refer 
to Note 3 for further details regarding the sale of Cleancoal and 
Note 2 for further details regarding the sale of the Hampton 
Division.  The Company will attempt to address its long-term 
liquidity requirements through investments in profitable 
acquisitions as well as the cash sources indicated above.  Refer 
to Note 6 for a discussion of a potential reduction in future 
cash distributions to the Company from the Roanoke Valley I 
("ROVA I") project.

Summary


The Company incurred operating losses of $15,218,000 
(excluding $41,130,000 of gains on the sales of assets) and 
$95,230,000 (including unusual charges of $79,250,000) in 
1994 and 1993, respectively. 

The most significant item affecting results of operations 
for 1993 was $79,250,000 of unusual charges related to the 
write-off of the carrying value of certain mining operations 
and coal reserves along with provisions for the termination 
of certain operations and personnel.  These charges resulted 
from the Company's continuing strategic review of its mining 
operations in light of projected costs, prices and demand.  
Refer to Note 4 for details related to the unusual charges.  

The most significant items affecting 1994's net income were 
gains of $34,142,000 on the sale of the assets of Criterion 
and $6,988,000 on the sale of several inactive properties in 
West Virginia.  Refer to Note 2 for details related to asset 
sales.

The following sections compare the results of 1994 to 1993.

Virginia Division

Virginia Division incurred operating losses of $3,726,000 in 
1994 compared to operating losses of $24,309,000 in 1993.  

-  Included in 1993's results were unusual charges totalling 
$16,092,000.  Refer to Note 4 for further details.

-  The Virginia Division recognized $7,574,000 of workers' 
compensation expense in 1994 compared to $14,725,000 in 
1993.  The amount recorded in 1993 reflects a $9,250,000 
adjustment based upon management's reassessment of the 
workers' compensation liability. In 1994 the Company refined 
its methodology for estimating the Company's workers' 
compensation liabilities by engaging an independent actuary  
and as a result accrued an additional $3,200,000 expense in 
1994 related to prior years' claims for the Virginia 
Division.  The Company will continue to utilize an actuarial 
analysis in the future as it is a more reliable method of 
estimating this liability.  

-  Due to reduced production from Company mines, the 
Virginia Division purchased an additional 139,000 tons from 
unaffiliated producers during 1994 compared to 1993.   This 
production shortfall added approximately $3,000,000 in 
additional costs over the 1993 levels.

-  Depreciation expense in 1994 decreased $2,553,000 over 
the 1993 amount due to the write-down of certain plant and 
equipment in the fourth quarter of 1993.


Hampton Division

Hampton Division recorded operating income of $4,490,000 and 
operating losses of $42,238,000 in 1994 and 1993, 
respectively.  

-  Hampton's results improved due to the elimination of 
losses related to that portion of the Hampton Division that 
was closed in the second quarter of 1994.  Reserves for 
these operating losses and shutdown costs were accrued in 
the fourth quarter of 1993.  The operating profit in 1994 
relates to a large surface mine which was operated by a 
contractor on the Hampton property and a $2,100,000 reversal 
of a workers' compensation liability recorded in December 
1993 in connection with the anticipated Hampton shutdown.  


-  The Hampton Division incurred unusual charges in 1993 
totalling $43,158,000 related to the planned discontinuation of 
most of the Hampton Division's operations in the second quarter 
of 1994.  This action was necessitated by the loss of an above-
market coal supply contract in December 1993.  Based on market 
conditions and cost structures, it was unlikely that there were 
operational scenarios which would have resulted in future 
positive cash flow had the Company continued to operate the 
deep mine, the preparation plant and the support facilities.  
The other major above-market coal supply contract associated 
with the Hampton Division continued to be supplied by the 
production from a contractor-operated surface mine on the 
property.  The components of the shutdown costs were $8,247,000 
for fixed asset writedowns, $25,653,000 related to the accrual 
of postretirement medical liabilities, $3,900,000 in 
termination costs for approximately 130 employees, $1,800,000 
for reclamation and $3,558,000 for anticipated operating losses 
and other shutdown reserves.



Criterion Coal Company 

Criterion recorded operating income of $8,094,000 and 
$10,289,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Criterion's 
operating income in the second half of 1994 was hampered by a 
temporary deterioration in geological conditions at certain 
mines.   


Pine Branch Mining Incorporated ("Pine Branch")

Pine Branch had operating losses of $1,778,000 and  
$1,356,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Pine Branch 
experienced unusually severe weather conditions in the first 
quarter of 1994 adversely impacting production and operating 
costs which led to an operating loss for the first quarter 
of 1994 of $1,180,000.  Productivity increased during the 
second half of 1994 as a result of a new operating plan.

 
Westmoreland Resources, Inc.

WRI had operating income of  $2,592,000 and $3,152,000 in 
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The decrease in earnings was 
due to lower "take or pay" payments received in 1994 
compared to 1993 from contracts whose terms have since ended 
and increased legal costs of $390,000 in 1994 related to a 
dispute with the Crow Indian Tribe.  Also, the price 
received from WRI's second largest customer was reduced as 
part of the renegotiation of its contract.  This 
deterioration was partially offset by earnings on higher 
levels of shipments in 1994.  The Company received cash 
dividends from WRI of $1,500,000 and $540,000 in 1994 and 
1993, respectively.  


Westmoreland Coal Sales Company ("WCSC")

WCSC had operating income of approximately $1,900,000 in 
both 1994 and 1993.  Included in the 1994 results was 
$2,833,000 in income generated from the reversal of bad debt 
allowances related to a contract assigned to CONSOL of 
Kentucky, Inc. ("CONSOL").   Excluding this benefit, the 
decrease in 1994's operating income was primarily due to the 
absence of profits from sales to the export market and the 
related brokering business.  WCSC reduced its selling and 
administrative expenses by $1,000,000 in 1994.




Net Corporate Expenses

Net corporate expenses increased $3,685,000 in 1994 over 
1993.  The increase was due to $4,382,000 of expenses 
related to the Company's bankruptcy proceedings.  $1,050,000 
of the bankruptcy cost was related to legal fees, $2,332,000 
was related to the settlement of non-Criterion related 
claims and $1,000,000 was accrued for the buyout of the 
Company's building lease in Philadelphia under a settlement 
negotiated during the bankruptcy proceedings.  The Company 
plans to move to less costly office facilities during 1995.  
The Company also experienced higher legal costs prior to the 
bankruptcy proceedings, primarily related to debt 
restructuring negotiations.  Other corporate expenses were 
reduced in 1994 as a result of the August 1993 workforce 
reduction.

West Virginia - Idled Operations

The Company had operating losses of $8,657,000 in 1994 and 
$29,779,000 (including $20,000,000 of unusual charges) in 
1993. The unusual charges in 1993 represented the write-off 
of the partially developed Triangle Mine Complex 
("Triangle").  Refer to Note 4 for details related to the 
write-off of Triangle in 1993 and refer to Note 2 for the 
subsequent sale of Triangle in 1994.  Excluding the unusual 
charges in 1993, West Virginia - Idled Operations are made 
up of costs (principally postretirement and workers' 
compensation costs) associated with mining operations in 
West Virginia which had been closed in prior years.  In 1994 
the Company refined its methodology for estimating the 
Company's workers' compensation liabilities by engaging an 
independent actuary and as a result reduced the workers' 
compensation liability by $622,000 in 1994 for the idled 
operations in West Virginia.  The Company will continue to 
utilize an actuarial analysis in the future as it is a more 
reliable method of estimating this liability.  




Cleancoal Terminal Company

The Company announced, during the fourth quarter of 1994, 
that it had reached agreement with an indirect wholly-owned 
subsidiary of CSX Corporation  ("CSX") to release the 
Company from an $8,864,000 loan guarantee reflected in Long-
Term Debt in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet in 
exchange for the transfer of the assets of Cleancoal and the 
payment of $2,500,000 to CSX.  The Company will also be 
released from related interest payments to CSX of 
approximately $70,000 per month when this transaction 
closes.  The transaction is expected to be completed in 
1995.  The anticipated loss of $1,882,000 related to this 
transaction was recognized in 1994.  The Cleancoal terminal 
was shut down in January 1995 and the majority of its 
employees were laid off on January 31, 1995.

Cleancoal incurred operating losses in 1994 of $3,446,000, 
including the anticipated loss of $1,882,000 on the pending 
sale of its assets, and $126,000 in 1993.  Cleancoal has an 
annual transloading capacity of 6,000,000 tons.  In a highly 
competitive market, Cleancoal transloaded 1,304,000 tons, 
2,511,000 tons and 2,144,000 tons in 1994, 1993 and 1992, 
respectively.

Independent Power Operations

The Company's Independent Power Operations, through its 
wholly-owned subsidiary WEI, recorded operating income of 
$548,000 in 1994 and incurred operating losses of $1,195,000 
in 1993.    WEI has interests in eight projects, of which 
seven were operational as of December 31, 1994 and the 
eighth is scheduled to become operational in the second 
quarter of 1995.  The Company expects WEI to remain 
profitable with increased earnings and cash distributions in 
1995 as a result of a full year's operation of the 
facilities which began commercial operations in 1994.


WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E 
Partners (the "ROVA Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's 
principal customer contracted to purchase the electricity 
generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  In the 
second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA 
Partnership's interpretation of the provisions of the 
contract dealing with the payment of the capacity purchase 
price when the facility experiences a forced outage day.  A 
forced outage day is a day when ROVA I is not able to 
generate a specified level of electrical output.  The ROVA 
Partnership believes that the customer is required to pay 
the ROVA Partnership the full capacity purchase price unless 
forced outage days exceed a contractually stated annual 
number.  The customer asserts that it is not required to do 
so.

Through December 31, 1994, the customer withheld 
approximately $5,856,000 of capacity purchase price payments 
to the ROVA Partnership because of this dispute.  On 
October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership filed a complaint in 
the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to 
recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments may 
not be withheld in the future.  On December 12, 1994 the 
customer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and on 
March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  The ROVA 
Partnership is evaluating its legal options which include 
the possibility of an appeal of this ruling.  The capacity 
purchase price withheld had been included in the revenues 
and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve was 
recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount 
withheld by the customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share 
of the withheld payments in earnings in the second, third 
and fourth quarters of 1994.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, 
WEI's revenues were reduced by $2,928,000, representing its 
50% share of the disputed amount.  The customer has withheld 
an additional $872,000 from the ROVA Partnership through 
March 24, 1995.  No earnings are being recognized by WEI in 
1995 for payments withheld by the customer relating to 
forced outage days.  The Company believes that the ROVA 
Partnership's position is correct.  However, the Company is 
unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding, or the 
amount, if any, that the customer may be ordered to pay 
related to this matter.  Additionally, WEI has been 
evaluating ways to minimize the number of forced outage days 
in the future.   Regardless of the outcome, the Company 
believes ROVA I will continue to operate profitably and 
generate positive cash flows.  



Gains on the sales of assets

The Company realized gains in 1994 of $34,142,000 on the 
sale of the assets of Criterion and $6,988,000 on the sale 
of several inactive properties in West Virginia.  The 
Company realized a $2,000,000 gain in 1993 from the sale of 
a portion of its interest in the Ft. Lupton independent 
power project.  Refer to Note 2 for details related to asset 
sales.


Other

Coal revenues in 1994 decreased $95,090,000 (20%) from 1993 
due principally to the Company's decision to withdraw from 
the export market ($70,150,000 decline in revenues) and the 
partial shutdown of the Hampton Division in May of 1994 
($18,326,000 decline in revenues).

Income tax expense in 1994 and 1993 included the provision 
for WRI, which is not consolidated with the Company for 
Federal income tax purposes, and state taxes related to the 
Company's other operations.  Also included in 1993 was a 
$683,000 benefit related to the settlement of a state income 
tax dispute.


Inflation did not have a material impact on the Company's 
operations in 1994.


Trends and Uncertainties

There are a number of factors that may impact the future 
earnings of the Company.  Based on information available to 
the Company at this time, the following factors or future 
actions have been identified for which the impact is 
uncertain but could be substantial:

-  The Company entered into a five-year agreement with the 
United Mine Workers' of America ("UMWA") effective December 
16, 1993 (the "1993 Agreement").  This agreement provides  
mechanisms for flexibility which can contribute to those 
operations becoming more competitive.  

-  The 1993 Agreement provides for wage increases of $.40 
per hour on December 16, 1994 and December 16, 1995 and for 
additional wage "reopeners" in 1996 and 1997.

-  The Company is continuing its efforts to improve the 
competitiveness and profitability of its Virginia Division 
through cost control, productivity improvement and closure 
of non-essential high cost operations.  By July 1996, the 
Virginia Division will lose the benefit of two coal supply 
contracts having sales prices substantially above the 
current market price for similar types of coal.  The Georgia 
Power Company coal supply contract, with shipments of 
942,000 tons in 1994, expires in April 1995.  The above 
market price of the Duke Power Company coal supply contract, 
with shipments of 2,792,000 tons in 1994, expires in July 
1996; however, the contract can be extended through December 
31, 2000 provided the parties can reach an agreement on the 
sales price after July 1996. It is likely that the new sales 
price would be at current market prices.  In 1994, shipments 
to these two customers accounted for approximately 83% of 
the Virginia Division's sales tons.  In 1994, the Company's 
Virginia Division experienced an operating loss of 
$3,726,000, including approximately $18,000,000 of non-cash 
expenses for depreciation and postretirement medical costs.   
The Virginia Division will not be able to operate profitably 
or generate positive cash flow from operations after July 
1996, even after excluding the ongoing fixed cash costs of 
idled operations (estimated to be in excess of $10,000,000 
annually), which primarily consist of postretirement medical 
and workers' compensation benefits, unless market prices for 
eastern coals increase significantly and/or the Company is 
able to substantially reduce the cost per ton of the coal 
produced.  The projected cash flows during the next two 
years, including anticipated cash shutdown costs but 
excluding postretirement medical costs, exceed the carrying 
value of the assets at December 31, 1994.  Therefore, the 
Virginia Division's assets are not deemed to be impaired at 
this time.

The Company is reviewing its options, which include the 
possible future sale, downsizing or shutdown of all or a 
portion of the Virginia Division, at which time the Company 
may be required to recognize, for accounting purposes, a 
significant portion of its postretirement medical 
liabilities.  The total amount of the postretirement medical 
liabilities which would be expensed at the time the Virginia 
Division's shutdown, downsizing or sale occurs is not known 
at this time, however the impact of this non-cash expense on 
shareholders' equity could affect the Company's ability to 
pay preferred stock dividends.  Refer to Note 10 for further 
information related to the actuarially estimated net present 
value of postretirement medical benefits related to the 
Company's self-insured single employer plans and the UMWA 
Benefit Trust Funds, which are multiemployer plans.  Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information regarding dividend 
restrictions under Delaware law.


-  The major factor hampering the Company's long-term 
liquidity outlook is the significant "heritage costs" of the 
Company.  These heritage costs primarily consist of cash 
payments for postretirement medical benefits and for 
workers' compensation.  The Company has ongoing cash 
expenditures in excess of $12,000,000 per year for 
postretirement medical benefits and over $6,000,000 per year 
for workers' compensation benefits.

The Company expects to fund its near-term heritage costs, out of 
current cash balances and from positive operating cash flow of 
the Virginia Division, regular cash distributions from the 
Company's independent power projects and WRI, continued 
divestment or improvement of underperforming assets and cost 
reductions and productivity improvements.  In 1995 the Company 
sold its Hampton Division and has an agreement to sell the assets 
of its subsidiary Cleancoal.  Refer to Note 3 for further details 
regarding the sale of Cleancoal and Note 2 for further details 
regarding the sale of the Hampton Division.  The Company will 
attempt to address its long-term liquidity requirements through 
investments in profitable acquisitions as well as the cash 
sources indicated above.  Refer to Note 6 for a discussion of a 
potential reduction in future cash distributions to the Company 
from the ROVA I project.



- WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in the ROVA Partnership.  
The ROVA Partnership's principal customer contracted to purchase 
the electricity generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  
In the second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA 
Partnership's interpretation of the provisions of the contract 
dealing with the payment of the capacity purchase price when the 
facility experiences a forced outage day.  A forced outage day is 
a day when ROVA I is not able to generate a specified level of 
electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the 
customer is required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full 
capacity purchase price unless forced outage days exceed a 
contractually stated annual number.  The customer asserts that it 
is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1994, the customer withheld approximately 
$5,856,000 of capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA 
Partnership because of this dispute.  On October 31, 1994, the 
ROVA Partnership filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the 
City of Richmond, Virginia to recover these amounts and to 
confirm that such payments may not be withheld in the future.  On 
December 12, 1994 the customer filed a motion to dismiss the 
complaint and on March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  
The ROVA Partnership is evaluating its legal options which 
include the possibility of an appeal of this ruling.  The 
capacity purchase price withheld had been included in the 
revenues and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve was 
recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount withheld by 
the customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share of the withheld 
payments in earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of 
1994.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, WEI's revenues were reduced 
by $2,928,000, representing its 50% share of the disputed amount.  
The customer has withheld an additional $872,000 from the ROVA 
Partnership through March 24, 1995.  No earnings are being 
recognized by WEI in 1995 for payments withheld by the customer 
relating to forced outage days.  The Company believes that the 
ROVA Partnership's position is correct.  However, the Company is 
unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding, or the amount, 
if any, that the customer may be ordered to pay related to this 
matter.  Additionally, WEI has been evaluating ways to minimize 
the number of forced outage days in the future.  Regardless of 
the outcome, the Company believes ROVA I will continue to operate 
profitably and generate positive cash flows.  Refer to the Recent 
Developments Relating to Independent Power Projects' section of 
Note 6 for a discussion of other issues involving WEI.

Summary

The Company reported operating losses of $95,230,000 and 
$33,646,000 for 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The most 
significant item in 1993 was $79,250,000 of unusual charges 
related to the write-off of the carrying value of certain 
mining operations and coal reserves along with provisions 
for the termination of certain operations.  These charges 
resulted from the Company's strategic review of its mining 
operations in light of projected costs, prices and demand.  
The $79,250,000 was comprised of $43,158,000 for the planned 
shut-down in 1994 of most of the Hampton Division's 
operations, $20,000,000 for the write-off of the Triangle 
mine complex idled since 1980 and classified within West 
Virginia - Idled Operations and $16,092,000 for the planned 
closedown in 1994 of the Wentz mine complex and the write-
off of certain other assets within the Virginia Division.  
Refer to Note 4 for information concerning these unusual 
charges.

Also impacting 1993 results was an additional $9,250,000 
accrual for Virginia Division workers' compensation 
liabilities. 

The final major variance in 1993 was the impact of SFAS 106 
which was adopted effective January 1993.  As a result of 
adopting SFAS 106, and electing the option which permits 
recognition of these postretirement medical benefits over a 
twenty year period, the Company incurred an increase of 
$10,527,000 of non-cash charges in 1993 as compared to 1992.

Operating losses from operations for 1992 included a number 
of charges totalling $34,610,000.
  
-	$20,489,000 was related to loans and a guarantee 
obligation and other related items on behalf of Adventure, 
a coal supplier, that filed for bankruptcy.
  
-	The Company also increased reserves for potentially 
uncollectible trade receivables and additional reclamation 
costs by $7,747,000 and $2,074,000 respectively. 
 
-	An additional $3,900,000 was accrued for a change in 
estimates of previously established workers' compensation 
obligations 

-	$400,000 valuation adjustment was made to its mining 
supplies inventories.


Virginia Division
The Virginia Division incurred operating losses of 
$24,309,000 and $8,786,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  

Included in 1993's results were unusual charges totalling 
$16,092,000.  Refer to Note 4 for further details.

The adoption of SFAS 106 increased expenses in the Virginia 
Division by $6,173,000 in 1993 compared to 1992.  

The Duke Power Company contract price was reduced in 1993 
under a market reopener, which resulted in decreased 
revenues and earnings of $7,100,000.

Total workers' compensation expense for the Virginia 
Division  was $14,725,000 and $11,100,000 in 1993 and 1992, 
respectively. 

Offsetting these increased costs and decreased revenues was 
an improvement in operating efficiency over 1992.  This 
improvement is mainly attributable to increased productivity 
levels and better mining conditions.  Also, the Pierrepont 
mine had its longwall mining system in place for the entire 
year of 1993 compared to 1992 when it was only operational 
in the fourth quarter.

Hampton Division
The Hampton Division had operating losses of $42,238,000 and 
$967,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Included in 1993 were unusual charges of $43,158,000.  Refer 
to Note 4 for further details.

Included in 1993 was the increased expense related to SFAS 
106 totalling $652,000.  

1992's losses were mainly attributable to environmental 
costs of $946,000 related to the treatment of water being 
discharged from a closed mine.

Criterion Coal Company

Criterion had operating income of $10,289,000 and $6,492,000 
in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Operating costs at Criterion 
were reduced as a result of its preparation plant becoming 
operational in the first quarter of 1993.  The increased 
profitability was also attributable to a higher average 
revenue per ton, due to tons sold under contract that were 
previously sold on the spot market.



Westmoreland Resources, Inc.

WRI had operating income of $3,152,000 and $5,911,000 in 1993 and 
1992, respectively.  Included in 1993 was the settlement of a 
coal severance tax dispute between WRI and the state of Montana 
which decreased earnings by $900,000.  Included in 1992's 
earnings was income from a settlement of a dispute with a 
customer totalling $3,000,000.  Net of the above non-recurring 
items, operating income for 1993 improved by $1,141,000.  The 
Company received a cash dividend of $540,000 in 1993.  The 
Company did not receive a cash dividend from WRI in 1992.

West Virginia - Idled Operations

West Virginia - Idled Operations consists of costs associated 
with mining operations in West Virginia which have been idled or 
disposed.  In 1993 these operations had costs totalling 
$29,779,000 versus costs of $4,310,000 in 1992. Impacting West 
Virginia - Idled Operations in 1993 was $20,000,000 for the 
write-off of the Triangle mine complex, $2,730,000 of non-cash 
postretirement medical expense resulting from the adoption of 
SFAS 106 in 1993 and $2,400,000 of charges related to retirees, 
which in previous years had been allocated to the Company's 
active mining operations.

Pine Branch Mining Inc.

Pine Branch, the strip mining operation in Virginia, 
incurred operating losses of $1,356,000 and $485,000 in 1993 
and 1992, respectively.  The increase in the operating 
losses were primarily due to the areas being mined during 
1993.  Pine Branch was mining in a much steeper area, with a 
higher ratio of overburden that needed to be removed during 
1993.  This resulted in a significant increase in the cost 
in 1993.

Westmoreland Coal Sales Company 

WCSC had operating profits of $1,877,000 in 1993 and 
operating losses of $6,608,000 in 1992.  In 1992, WCSC 
recorded bad debt expense of $5,578,000 related to Adventure 
and $8,299,000 related to trade receivables from customers.  
Operating income in 1993 diminished primarily as a result of 
decling profits relating to the export market and 
transactions with unaffiliated producers.



Net Corporate Expenses

Net corporate expenses were $11,545,000 and $25,718,000 in 
1993 and 1992, respectively.  1992 included $14,911,000 of 
charges related to loans and guarantees related to 
Adventure.


Cleancoal Terminal Company

Cleancoal the rail-to-barge transloading and ground storage 
facility located on the Ohio River in Kentucky reported 
operating losses of $126,000 and $854,000 in 1993 and 1992, 
respectively.  Cleancoal experienced a 17% increase in tons 
transloaded over 1992, which decreased Cleancoal's operating 
losses in 1993.


Independent Power Operations

WEI incurred an operating loss of $1,195,000 in 1993 and had 
operating income of $1,679,000 in 1992.  WEI incurred an 
expense of $2,459,000 in 1993 relating to the amortization of 
fees paid as consideration for guarantees of equity funding 
Commitments, which is further discussed in Note 6. WEI's 
income from operations in 1992 included $2,300,000 in 
development fees partially offset by a $1,500,000 reduction 
in the carrying value of an investment in a plant under 
development.


Gain on the sales of assets

The Company realized a $2,000,000 gain in 1993 from the sale 
of a portion of its interest in the Ft. Lupton independent 
power project.


Other 

Interest expense increased $772,000 or 19% in 1993 due to 
interest payments being made on a $8,864,000 loan being 
guaranteed by the Company on behalf of Adventure, which 
guarantee will be eliminated when the Cleancoal transaction 
with CSX is completed.  Refer to Note 3 for details 
regarding this transaction.

Interest income increased $180,000, or 30%, due to higher 
overall investments.

Other income in 1993 reflects increased income from scrap 
sales and royalties.

Income taxes in 1993 and 1992 principally reflected the 
provision for WRI, which is not consolidated with the 
Company for Federal income tax, and state taxes related to 
the Company's other operations.  Also included in 1993 was a 
$683,000 benefit related to the settlement of a state income 
tax dispute.

Inflation did not have a material impact on the Company's 
operations in 1993.

 <1>	In 1994 and 1993, the Company significantly reduced the 
level of activity related to selling coal in the export 
market and coal sourced from unaffiliated producers 
thus reducing revenues and costs and expenses.  Coal 
revenues include the revenues of Cleancoal Terminal 
Company.


 <2> 	In 1992, the Company established a provision for 
doubtful accounts totalling $29,055,000; $20,489,000 
was related to loans and a guarantee obligation on 
behalf of Adventure, a coal supplier that filed for 
bankruptcy, and $7,747,000 was established for 
potentially uncollectible trade receivables.  In 1994 
the Company reversed $2,833,000 of the trade receivable 
reserve into income.

 <3>	In 1994, the Company recognized a $34,142,000 gain on 
the sale of the assets of Criterion  to CONSOL and a 
gain of $6,988,000 on the sale of several inactive 
properties in West Virginia.  Refer to Note 2 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details 
on the sales of assets.

 <4> 	In 1993, the Company recorded unusual charges related 
to the write-off of the carrying value of certain 
mining operations and coal reserves along with 
provisions for the termination of certain coal 
operations and personnel.  Refer to Note 4 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

 <5> 	Reflects the 40% interest in Westmoreland Resources, 
Inc. not owned by the Company.


 <6> 	On July 1, 1992, the Company issued 575,000 shares of 
Preferred Stock previously authorized.  Two quarterly 
dividends at (8.5% per annum) were declared in 1992, 
four quarterly dividends were declared in 1993 and one 
quarterly dividend was declared in 1994.  As of 
December 31, 1994, there were three cumulative 
undeclared quarterly preferred stock dividends in 
arrears.  Cumulative undeclared preferred dividends are 
deducted from net income (loss) in determining net 
income (loss) applicable to common shareholders.  Refer 
to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
further information on the Company's Capital Stock.

 <7>	In 1992, the Company purchased 1,295,589 of its own 
shares from Penn Virginia and in December 1992 retired 
the shares.

 <8>	The increase in working capital from 1993 to 1994 
resulted from the Company's sale of the assets of 
Criterion and the subsequent repayment of the majority 
of its debt obligations, then classified as current 
liabilities.  See Notes 2 and 5 for additional 
information.

  	The decrease in working capital from 1992 to 1993 
resulted from the reclassification of long-term debt to 
current, the adoption of SFAS 106 and the accruals for 
mine closure costs, all in 1993.

 <9>	Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for information regarding the Company's debt 
structure.

<10> 	1992 capital additions included $9,344,000 for 
infrastructure construction to support a new longwall 
mining system at the Pierrepont Mine in Virginia and 
$11,521,000 for a new coal preparation plant at 
Criterion.

Westmoreland Coal Company and Subsidiaries
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	
Consolidation Policy

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts 
of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of 
intercompany balances and transactions.  To the extent that 
Westmoreland Coal Company (the "Company") owns 20% or more 
in any subsidiary, corporate joint venture or partnership, 
but less than a majority interest, it accounts for such 
investments using the equity method.  The excess of the cost 
of the Company's investment in Westmoreland Resources, Inc. 
("WRI"), a 60%-owned subsidiary, over the portion of net 
assets acquired in 1979, equal to $11,600,000, has been 
allocated to coal reserves.  Such excess is being amortized 
at a fixed rate per ton based on estimated recoverable coal 
reserves.

	
Independent Power Development

In connection with the development of independent power 
projects, certain costs are incurred during the development 
process.  These costs are expensed in the period incurred 
until certain events have taken place, including the 
execution of certain contracts which are critical to a 
project's construction and operation.  After these events 
have taken place all subsequent costs are capitalized as 
part of a project's investment basis.  At the time when non-
recourse bank financing has been obtained, costs previously 
expensed by the Company, to the extent reimbursed, are 
reported as income.  All other income in connection with a 
project's development is deferred until the project achieves 
commercial operation, the required equity funding commitment 
is made and the conversion of the loan from a construction 
loan to a term loan is completed.
	
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consists of Eurodollar time deposits, money 
market funds and bank repurchase agreements.  

All are carried at cost and have maturities of not longer 
than ninety days.  The Company considers all highly liquid 
debt instruments purchased with maturities of three months 
or less to be cash equivalents.
	
Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or 
market.
	
Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and 
include expenditures for new facilities and those 
expenditures that substantially increase the productive 
lives of existing plant and equipment.  Maintenance and 
repair costs are expensed as incurred.  Mineral rights are 
depleted at a rate based upon the cost of the mineral 
properties and estimated recoverable tonnage therein.  The 
Company uses the straight-line depreciation method over the 
assets' estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 40 years, 
which conforms to prevalent industry practice.  When an 
asset is retired or sold, its cost and related accumulated 
depreciation are removed from the accounts.  The difference 
between undepreciated cost and proceeds of disposition is 
recorded as a gain or loss.  Fully depreciated plant and 
equipment remaining in use are not eliminated from the 
accounts.  The development costs of mines in the pre-
operating stage are capitalized and amortized over the 
assets' estimated useful lives after commercial operations 
commence.

	
Financial Instruments

Financial instruments are presented at the lower of cost or 
fair value as required by generally accepted accounting 
principles.  The fair value of the Company's financial 
instruments approximate carrying value.

	
Coal Revenues

Coal revenues include the sale of coal loaded at Company 
operations and sales of coal produced by unaffiliated mining 
companies where the Company, through a subsidiary, is a 
sales agent or acts as a broker.  The Company recognizes the 
full sales revenue of the coal sold for unaffiliated 
companies since the Company assumes the credit risk for the 
sale, performs other services such as invoicing, quality 
control and shipment monitoring, and in most cases takes 
title to the coal.  Coal revenues pertaining to coal sold 
for other companies amounted to $83,196,000, $157,788,000 
and $227,046,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  For 
all coal sales the Company recognizes revenue at the time 
title passes to the customer.  The Company also records as 
coal revenues, the revenues received from coal related 
activities, such as the buy-out of coal contracts, coal 
option payments and revenues related to Cleancoal Terminal 
Company.
	
Reclamation

Reclamation costs at active sites are accrued over the 
expected mine life using the units of production method 
based on recoverable reserves and environmental and 
regulatory requirements.  If a mine shuts down prior to the 
expected mine life, the Company accrues the remaining 
reclamation obligation at the time of the shutdown.  

Estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments are made 
in accruals to provide for future costs, as needed.
	
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106) on 
January 1, 1993.   The Company elected to amortize its 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the time of 
adoption ("the transition obligation"), over 20 years.  
Under SFAS 106 the cost of postretirement benefits other 
than pensions which are currently being earned must be 
recognized on an accrual basis. 

The Company is subject to the Coal Industry Retiree Health 
Benefit Act of 1992.  The Company pays a premium each month 
to multiemployer plans based upon the number of 
beneficiaries assigned to it.  This amount is expensed at 
the time it is paid by the Company.
	
Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109").  SFAS 109 requires a company to 
recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the 
expected future tax consequences of events that have been 
recognized in a company's financial statements or tax 
returns.  Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and 
assets are determined based on the difference between the 
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets 
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the 
years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  
	
	
Net Income (Loss) Per Share Applicable to Common 
Shareholders

Declared and undeclared cumulative preferred dividends are 
deducted from net income in determining net income (loss) 
applicable to common shareholders.

Net income (loss) per share applicable to common 
shareholders was computed by dividing net income (loss) 
applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average 
number of shares of common stock and common stock 
equivalents outstanding during the year.  Common stock 
equivalents are not included when they would have an anti-
dilutive effect on income (loss) per share.





Westmoreland Coal Company and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992				

1. Plan of Reorganization


In order to satisfy its maturing debt obligations, 
Westmoreland and several of its subsidiaries filed petitions 
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on November 
8, 1994 seeking the confirmation of a so-called 
"prepackaged" plan of reorganization (the "Plan of 
Reorganization").  The subsidiaries involved in the filing 
were Westmoreland Coal Sales Company ("WCSC"), Criterion 
Coal Company, Kentucky Criterion Coal Company and Deane 
Processing Company.  

The Plan of Reorganization was premised on the necessity of 
consummating the sale of the assets of Criterion Coal 
Company and its affiliates ("Criterion") in order to realize 
sufficient funds to satisfy $39,250,000 of the Company's 
debt obligations which matured on November 8, 1994 and to 
satisfy $23,178,000 of equity funding commitments of 
Westmoreland Energy, Inc.("WEI") which were due December 30, 
1994.  

The sale of Criterion, which had been announced on July 28, 
1994, was subject to numerous third party consents, all of 
which were obtained except those related to TECO Coal 
Corporation ("TECO"), an affiliate of TECO Energy, Inc.  
Westmoreland announced on November 8, 1994 that it had not 
been able to obtain the consent of TECO to the assignment of 
two coal supply subcontracts.

On December 16, 1994 the Company announced that it had reached 
agreement with TECO whereby TECO consented to the assignment of 
the two coal supply subcontracts.  The resolution of this dispute 
was approved by the Bankruptcy Court as part of the Court's 
approval of the Company's Plan of Reorganization.  The Company 
proceeded to complete its sale of the assets of Criterion on 
December 22, 1994 and paid in full its maturing debt obligations 
of $39,250,000, at which time it emerged from bankruptcy.  The 
Company incurred $1,050,000 in legal fees related to the 
bankruptcy and $2,332,000 to settle other claims that were not 
related to the Criterion sale and accrued $1,000,000 for the 
buyout of its building lease in Philadelphia under a settlement 
negotiated during the bankruptcy proceedings.  Refer to Note 2 
for expenses related to the Criterion sale which were not related 
to the cost of bankruptcy.


2.  Gains on the Sales of Assets

In 1994, the Company reported gains on the sales of assets 
amounting to $41,130,000. 
 
Criterion

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold the assets 
of Criterion to CONSOL of Kentucky Inc. ("CONSOL") for cash 
proceeds of $74,375,000 (net of related cash expenses of 
$4,165,000), resulting in a gain of $34,142,000.  With the 
net proceeds from the sale of the Criterion assets, maturing 
debt obligations of $39,250,000 were repaid  and equity 
funding of $23,178,000 was made for independent power 
projects of WEI.

The revenues, costs and earnings of Criterion for 1994, 1993 
and 1992 are summarized below:

                                1994       1993       1992
                                      (in thousands)
     Revenues               $ 55,800   $ 51,837   $ 48,940
     Costs and expense        47,706     41,548     42,448
     Operating income       $  8,094   $ 10,289   $  6,492


West Virginia-Idled Operations

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold several 
inactive properties located in Raleigh County, West Virginia 
to Pine Valley Coal Company for $3,800,000 in cash proceeds 
resulting in a gain of $6,988,000.  The assets had no book 
value at the time of the sale and the Company reversed 
reserves related to reclamation liabilities, which were also 
transferred as part of the sales transaction.  The sale 
included the Company's Eccles and Triangle complexes and the 
Gallagher Research facility.  The Eccles complex was last 
operated in 1986.  Development of the Triangle complex began 
in the late 1970's but ceased in 1980.  The proceeds from 
the sale were transferred to a cash deposit account to 
collateralize the Company's outstanding surety bonds for its 
workers' compensation self-insurance programs.

Independent Power Operations

In the second quarter of 1993, the Company recognized a 
$2,000,000 gain on the sale of a portion of its interest in 
the Ft. Lupton independent power project.  WEI retains a 
limited partnership interest of 4.49%.  Cash flows 
distributable to WEI from the Ft. Lupton project are limited 
to $500,000 (escalatable) annually.

Hampton Division

In January of 1995 the Company sold the assets of its Hampton 
Division located in Boone and Logan Counties, West Virginia to 
the Anker Group and sold its Hampton Division mineral lease to 
the lessor, Penn Virginia Resources Corporation("Penn Virginia"), 
for $9,045,000 in cash.  The Company wrote off a substantial 
portion of the Hampton Division's assets in 1993. Refer to Note 4 
for further details related to the shutdown of the Hampton 
Division. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately 
$7,376,000 after the buy out of a related capital lease.  The buy 
out of this capital lease resulted in a further reduction of the 
Company's long-term debt.  The gain on the sale, to be recognized 
in the Company's financial statements in 1995, is estimated to be 
$9,200,000 after the reversal of certain liabilities.  The 
purchasers assumed the reclamation and environmental liabilities 
associated with the Hampton Division as part of the sales 
transaction.

The revenues, costs and earnings of the Hampton Division for 
1994, 1993 and 1992 are summarized below:

3.  Cleancoal Terminal Company

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company recognized a loss 
of $1,882,000 related to the pending sale of Cleancoal 
Terminal Company ("Cleancoal") to an indirect wholly-owned 
subsidiary of CSX Corporation ("CSX"). The provision for the 
loss included $1,556,000 for the write-down of property, 
plant and equipment.  This loss is included in Cost of coal 
sold in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income.  In 
exchange for the assets of Cleancoal and payment of 
$2,500,000, CSX has agreed to release the Company from its 
$8,864,000 loan guarantee obligation.  The loan guarantee 
obligation was made to CSX in 1987 in connection with a loan 
from CSX to affiliates of Adventure Resources, 
Inc.("Adventure").  The Company will also be released from 
related interest payments to CSX for this guarantee of 
approximately $70,000 per month when this transaction 
closes.  Cleancoal was closed in January 1995 and the 
majority of its employees were laid off on January 31, 1995.  
The Company expects to complete the Cleancoal transaction 
with CSX in 1995.

4. Unusual Charges

In 1993, the Company incurred unusual charges totalling 
$79,250,000 related to the write-off in the carrying value 
of certain mining operations and coal reserves along with 
provisions for the termination of certain operations and 
personnel.  These charges resulted from the Company's 
continuing strategic review of its mining operations in 
light of projected costs, prices and demand.  Of the 
$79,250,000 of charges, $43,158,000 was for the shutdown of 
most of the Hampton Division's operations in 1994; 
$20,000,000 related to the write-off of the Triangle mine 
complex, on which the Company ceased development in 1980; 
and $16,092,000 was for the shutdown in 1994 of the Wentz 
mine complex and the write-off of certain other assets 
within the Virginia Division.


Accruals for the above unusual charges as they relate to the 
Hampton Division, West Virginia - Idled Operations and the 
Virginia Division, included in the balance sheet of the 
Company as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 respectively, are 
as follows:


	                                                   December 31,
                                                   1994      1993
                                                   (in thousands)

Accrual for postretirement medical costs 
  at Hampton                                   $ 26,004  $ 25,653
Other liabilities (long-term)                     2,963     5,224
Accounts payable and accrued expenses             4,624     6,601
Workers' compensation	                              200     2,300
Total                                          $ 33,791  $ 39,778



Hampton Division

In 1994, $2,100,000 of the reserves established in 1993 for 
workers' compensation were reversed based upon the results of 
an actuarial study of the Company's Hampton Division liability.

The Hampton Division incurred unusual charges in 1993 
totaling $43,158,000 related to the shutdown of most of the 
Hampton Division's operations in the second quarter of 1994.  
This action was necessitated by the loss of an above-market 
coal supply contract in December 1993.  The other major 
above-market coal supply contract associated with the 
Hampton Division continued to be supplied by the production 
from a contractor operated surface mine on the property.  
The components of the shutdown costs were: 

- $8,247,000 for fixed asset writedowns.

- $25,653,000 related to the accrual of postretirement  
  medical liabilities.

- $3,900,000 in termination costs for approximately 130
  employees.

- $1,800,000 for reclamation.

- $3,558,000 for anticipated operating losses and other   
  shutdown reserves. 

The entire Hampton Division was subsequently sold in January 
1995, which is explained in Note 2. 



West Virginia - Idled Operations

The Company incurred unusual charges in 1993 of $20,000,000 
for the write-off of the partially developed Triangle Mine 
Complex ("Triangle"), which had been idled since 1980.  As a 
result of management's continued review during 1993 it 
believed Triangle would neither be developed nor sold for 
the then book value in the foreseeable future.  The Company 
was unable to attract any interest to develop the reserve by 
a third party and the Company did not have the capital to 
develop the reserve on its own.  The latest extension of the 
mining permits for this property expired in 1994 and could 
not be renewed with the state of West Virginia, unless it 
was put back on active status and development resumed.  If 
the Company elected not to resume development, it would have 
been required to begin final reclamation in 1994.  Based on 
these facts, the Company wrote off the remaining $18,000,000 
book value of Triangle and accrued $2,000,000 for the final 
reclamation of the complex, which was scheduled to begin in 
the second half of 1994.  The Company sold Triangle in the 
fourth quarter of 1994 and the buyer assumed the reclamation 
liabilities as part of the sale transaction.   


Virginia Division

The Virginia Division incurred unusual charges in 1993 
totalling $16,092,000 relating to the following:  

- $7,761,000 related to the planned closure of the Wentz 
mine and preparation plant complex.  The total charge 
related to the Wentz complex included $4,967,000 for the 
writedown of the book value of impaired assets, $2,141,000 
in termination costs for approximately 90 employees, 
$363,000 for reclamation and $290,000 for anticipated future 
operating losses.  The decision to close this complex was 
based on the continuing high cost of production and the 
scheduled expiration of a coal supply contract. 

- $7,636,000 for the write-off of an undeveloped block of 
reserves which is owned in fee and which the Company has 
determined will not be economically mineable based on 
current and anticipated production costs and market 
conditions.  

- $695,000 related to the write-off of certain other assets.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company was not in compliance with 
certain of the financial covenants contained in the Amended 
Revolver maturing July 1994, the 10% Senior Unsecured Notes due 
July 1994 and the Company's DTA guaranty in connection with a 
$26,560,000 letter of credit expiring July 1994.    

On June 9, 1994 the $26,560,000 letter of credit issued to 
support Westmoreland's share of the bonds sold to finance the 
DTA export terminal was drawn (the "Reimbursement Obligation").  
The Company recorded the Reimbursement Obligation as a current 
liability in June 1994.  


The Company's three principal credit facilities, summarized 
below, with an aggregate outstanding balance of $39,250,000 on 
December 22, 1994, were repaid on December 22, 1994 from the 
proceeds of the sale of the assets of Criterion.  Refer to Note 
2 for a discussion of the sale transaction.

  - The Company's Revolving Credit Agreement with a then 
outstanding balance of $2,102,000.   The Company had repaid 
$9,898,000 from working capital in 1994 prior to the 
Criterion sale.  

	-	10% Senior Unsecured Notes with an outstanding balance of 
$12,088,000, including prepayment penalties of $763,000.  
The Company had repaid $1,500,000 from working capital in 
1994 prior to the Criterion sale.

	-	The Reimbursement Obligation with an outstanding balance of 
$25,060,000.  The Company had repaid $1,500,000 on July 1, 
1994.

The contracts for deed and mortgage notes payable of WRI are 
secured by land and surface rights with an aggregate cost, net 
of amortization, of approximately $12,300,000 at December 
31,1994.




6.  Westmoreland Energy, Inc.

WEI, through subsidiaries and 100%-owned partnerships, holds 
general and limited equity interests in partnerships which 
were formed to develop and own cogeneration and other non-
regulated independent power plants.  Equity interests in 
these partnerships range from 1.25 percent to 50 percent.  
Refer to the Project Status Summary table filed as Exhibit 
99 for a summary of these projects.  Generally, the lenders 
to these partnerships have recourse only against these 
projects and the income and revenues therefrom.  The debt 
agreements contain various restrictive covenants including 
restrictions on making cash distributions to the partners, 
of which the partnerships are in compliance. 


In 1993, the Company offered WEI for sale in an effort to 
raise cash to meet its maturing debt obligations and WEI was 
reclassified as a discontinued operation in the financial 
statements.  On August 25, 1994 the Company announced that 
negotiations had terminated for the sale of the assets of 
WEI and that the Company was no longer offering WEI for 
sale.  It had been reclassified  as a continuing operation 
in the financial statements since the third quarter of 1994.


The following is a summary of aggregated financial 
information for all investments owned by WEI and accounted 
for under the equity method:

WEI performs project development and venture and asset   
management services for the partnerships and has recognized 
related revenues and income of $712,000 and $363,000 for the 
years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.    
These management fees are recorded as revenues when the 
service is performed.  WEI receives development fees from 
certain projects.  Income recognition of these fees is 
deferred until the related project achieves commercial 
operation, the required equity funding commitment is made 
and the conversion of the loan from a construction loan to a 
term loan is completed.  WEI had deferred $4,000,000 and 
$3,913,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Of 
the amount deferred as of the end of 1994, $1,750,000 was 
recognized in January 1995 and $2,250,000 is expected to be 
recognized in the second half of 1995.   

WEI's capitalized acquisition cost balances for the 
Rensselaer project were $1,147,000 and $1,160,000 at 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Such costs are 
being amortized over the term of the power contract of the 
project.  Amortization for the year ended December 31, 1994 
was not material to the financial statements.

WEI had subordinated loans receivable from project 
partnerships of $2,424,000 and $997,000 at December 31, 1994 
and 1993, respectively.  In January 1995 WEI collected 
$1,229,000 of the receivables outstanding as of December 31, 
1994.

Prior to May 1994 WEI had interests in four operating 
projects.  Since that time three additional projects became 
operational.  The Rensselaer, Roanoke Valley I ("ROVA I") 
and Ft. Lupton Projects achieved commercial operations in 
April, May and June 1994, respectively.  The equity 
commitment was funded for Rensselaer of $8,557,000 and ROVA 
I of $14,621,000 was made on December 30, 1994. The Ft. 
Lupton project did not require equity funding.

Effective July 1, 1994 the Company elected to record project 
equity earnings on a current basis.  Prior to July 1994, 
WEI's equity earnings were reported on a one month lag.  As 
a result of this reporting adjustment, the Company 
recognized four months of equity earnings in the third 
quarter of 1994.  The impact increased third quarter 1994 
earnings by approximately $600,000.  The ongoing annual 
impact is expected to be immaterial.

WEI has one remaining equity funding commitment estimated to 
be $4,600,000 for the Roanoke Valley II ("ROVA II") project 
which is expected to be paid in the second half of 1995.  In 
the event that after the start-up of this project the 
conversion of the project construction loan to a term loan 
is delayed beyond December 31, 1995, WEI's required equity 
funding commitment could be up to $14,600,000.  The 
conversion from a construction loan to a term loan is 
expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 1995.  
Additionally, if the total cost of this project exceeds 
$91,700,000, WEI's equity funding commitment would increase 
by 50% of the amount of such overrun.  The project is 
scheduled to commence commercial operation in the second 
quarter of 1995 with a total expected cost of less than 
$91,700,000.
                                   

Equity Support Agreement

On April 15, 1993, the Company entered into an equity 
support agreement with LG&E Power Inc. ("LG&E") whereby 
WEI's equity funding commitments of the ROVA I, Rensselaer 
and ROVA II projects were guaranteed by LG&E.  The 
anticipated $4,600,000 equity funding commitment of the ROVA 
II project is a portion of the amount guaranteed by LG&E.  
As consideration for these guarantees, the Company had 
pledged its interest in all three of these projects as 
security to LG&E.  WEI's ownership interest in the 
Rensselaer, ROVA I and ROVA II projects will continue to be 
pledged to LG&E until the ROVA II project equity funding 
commitments are satisfied.  The Company paid fees of 1.25 
percent per annum on the aggregate amount of the guarantees 
and a fee of $4,750,000.  These fees are being amortized 
over the period beginning on April 15, 1993 through the 
required equity funding dates of the respective projects.  A 
total of $5,416,000 was amortized from April 15, 1993 
through December 31, 1994.  Of this amount, $2,957,000 was 
expensed in 1994 and $2,459,000 was expensed in 1993.

Recent Developments Relating to Independent Power Projects


Southampton Project  WEI owns a 30% general partnership 
interest in LG&E-Westmoreland Southampton ("Southampton 
Partnership"), which owns the Southampton Project.  The 
Southampton Project, which was engaged in start-up and 
testing operations from September 1991 through March 1992, 
failed to meet Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") 
operating standards for a qualifying facility ("QF") in 
1992.  The failure was due to three factors: (i) the 
facility was not dispatched by its power customer, Virginia 
Electric and Power Company ("Virginia Power"), on a baseload 
schedule as anticipated, (ii) the facility was engaged in 
start-up and testing operations during a portion of that 
year, and (iii) the facility operator mistakenly delivered 
non-sequential steam to the host over a significant period 
of time.  On February 23, 1994, the Southampton Partnership 
filed a request with the FERC for a waiver of the FERC's QF 
operating standard for 1992.  Virginia Power intervened in 
the FERC proceeding, opposed the granting of a waiver, and 
alleged that its power contract with the Southampton 
Partnership had been breached due to the failure of the 
facility to maintain QF status in 1992.  

On July 7, 1994, the FERC issued an order (1) denying the 
application of the Southampton Partnership for a waiver of 
the FERC's QF operating standard in 1992 with respect to the 
Southampton Project and (2) directing the Southampton 
Partnership to show cause why it should not be required to 
file rate schedules with the FERC governing its 1992 
electricity sales for resale to Virginia Power.  In 1994 the 
Southampton Project established a reserve for the 
anticipated refund obligations relating to this issue. On 
August 9, 1994, the Southampton Partnership filed a request 
for rehearing of FERC's order or, alternatively, a motion 
for reconsideration.  If the FERC were to deny the requested 
waiver on rehearing and to determine that the Southampton 
Partnership had been a "public utility" in 1992, then the 
Southampton Partnership's 1992 actions could be subject to 
regulation under the Federal Power Act and state laws and 
regulations; two other cogeneration projects in which the 
Company holds ownership interests could also be subject to 
such regulation; the Company and certain of its subsidiaries 
could become subject to regulation for 1992 under the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act; and defaults might be created 
under certain existing agreements.  No assurance can be 
provided as to the timing of the FERC's decision or the 
outcome.  The Company believes that a denial by FERC of a 
waiver for the Southampton facility would not have a 
material adverse effect on the financial condition of the 
Company.

Rensselaer Project  WEI owns a 50% general partnership 
interest in LG&E-Westmoreland Rensselaer (the "Rensselaer 
Partnership"), which owns the Rensselaer Project.  The 
Rensselaer Project failed to meet the FERC's QF operating 
and efficiency standards in 1993 and did not meet the QF 
efficiency standard in 1994 as a result of a single start-up 
and testing period that overlapped both years and was 
prolonged due to a delay in the construction of necessary 
gas pipeline facilities and unexpected equipment problems.  
On October 17, 1994, the Rensselaer Partnership filed a 
request with the FERC for waivers of the applicable QF 
standards in 1993 and 1994.  Its power customer, Niagara 
Mohawk Power Corporation, filed an intervention to the 
waiver request on November 21, 1994.  This intervention was 
anticipated as the Power Purchase Agreement with the utility 
will be significantly impacted should the waiver be denied.  
No assurance can be provided as to the timing of the FERC's 
decision or the outcome, although recently several projects 
owned by other companies have received a waiver based on 
similar circumstances.  The Company believes the risk is 
remote that FERC will deny a waiver for the Rensselaer 
facility.

- WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E 
Partners (the "ROVA Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's 
principal customer contracted to purchase the electricity 
generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  In the second 
quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA Partnership's 
interpretation of the provisions of the contract dealing with the 
payment of the capacity purchase price when the facility 
experiences a forced outage day.  A forced outage day is a day 
when ROVA I is not able to generate a specified level of 
electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the 
customer is required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full 
capacity purchase price unless forced outage days exceed a 
contractually stated annual number.  The customer asserts that it 
is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1994, the customer withheld 
approximately $5,856,000 of capacity purchase price payments 
to the ROVA Partnership because of this dispute.  On 
October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership filed a complaint in 
the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to 
recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments may 
not be withheld in the future.  On December 12, 1994 the 
customer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and on 
March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  The ROVA 
Partnership is evaluating its legal options which include 
the possibility of an appeal of this ruling.  The capacity 
purchase price withheld had been included in the revenues 
and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve was 
recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount 
withheld by the customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share 
of the withheld payments in earnings in the second, third 
and fourth quarters of 1994.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, 
WEI's revenues were reduced by $2,928,000, representing its 
50% share of the disputed amount.  The customer has withheld 
an additional $872,000 from the ROVA Partnership through 
March 24, 1995.  No earnings are being recognized by WEI in 
1995 for payments withheld by the customer relating to 
forced outage days.  The Company believes that the ROVA 
Partnership's position is correct.  However, the Company is 
unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding, or the 
amount, if any, that the customer may be ordered to pay 
related to this matter.  Additionally, WEI has been 
evaluating ways to minimize the number of forced outage days 
in the future.  Regardless of the outcome, the Company 
believes ROVA I will continue to operate profitably and 
generate positive cash flows.  


 7.	Commitments and Contingencies

Westmoreland Terminal Company

Westmoreland Terminal Company ("WTC"), a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of the Company, has a 20% interest in Dominion 
Terminal Associates ("DTA"), a partnership formed for the 
construction and operation of a coal-storage and vessel-
loading facility in Newport News, Virginia.  DTA's annual 
throughput capacity is 22 million tons, and its ground 
storage capacity is 1.7 million tons. 

The Company currently utilizes the terminal's facilities for 
supplying coal to domestic customers via coastal waterways.  
The Company also leases the ground storage space and the 
vessel-loading facilities  to certain unaffiliated parties.  
Historically, the Company utilized the terminal for most of 
its coal exporting business.  In 1994, the Company 
disengaged from the export sales market due to poor margins 
and the amount of working capital needed to participate in 
that market.  The Company has conducted studies to evaluate 
the future of the export coal market and believes the export 
sales market is a cyclical business that will recover. The 
Company will continue to market the use of its share of DTA, 
aggressively manage related costs, and monitor the 
performance and value of this asset.

Although WTC is not currently generating sufficient revenues 
to cover its share of DTA's fixed cash costs, the Company 
fully expects to recover its investment in DTA.


The facility began operations in March 1984.  Financing was 
provided through $132,800,000 of refunding 30-year, non-
amortizing, tax-exempt bonds (the "DTA Bonds").  The 
Company's portion of the DTA Bonds was supported by a 
$26,560,000, 7-year direct-pay letter of credit, which was 
scheduled to expire in July 1994 (the "DTA Letter of 
Credit"). As a 20% owner, WTC and the Company have a joint 
and several obligation for interest and principal 
obligations with respect to its share of the DTA Bonds 
($26,560,000 principal balance).  These obligations were 
supported by the DTA Letter of Credit on which the Company 
was the ultimate obligor. 


In 1994, the Company was in violation of certain covenant 
requirements in connection with the DTA Letter of Credit.  
As a result, on June 9, 1994 the DTA Letter of Credit was 
drawn.    The proceeds of the draw were used to purchase 
$26,560,000 (par value) of DTA Bonds.  The Company repaid 
the amounts drawn under the DTA Letter of Credit on December 
22, 1994.  The $26,560,000 of DTA Bonds are now owned by 
WTC.

The DTA partners have a Throughput and Handling Agreement 
whereby WTC is committed to fund its proportionate share of 
DTA's operating expenses.  WTC's total cash funding 
obligations, including interest on the bonds, were 
$2,991,000, $3,129,000, and $3,784,000 for 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.




The following is a summary of financial information for DTA:

The Company's investment in DTA at December 31, 1994 was 
$20,375,000, including $1,430,000 of goodwill, and was 
classified separately on the Company's Consolidated Balance 
Sheet.  The Company had a net negative investment in DTA at 
December 31, 1993 of $5,912,000.  The negative investment at 
December 31, 1993 was classified on the Company's 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as two separate line items.  
$1,489,000 was classified as an Investment in DTA, and a 
negative investment of $7,401,000 was classified in Other 
long-term liabilities.  The increase in the Company's 
Investment in DTA was due to the purchase of $26,560,000 in 
bonds which were primarily supported by letters of credit, 
which is further explained in Note 5.


Adventure Resources, Inc.

WCSC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had been 
acting as the exclusive sales agent for Adventure Resources, 
Inc. ("Adventure"), whose other affiliated companies include 
M.A.E. Services Inc. and Maben Energy Corporation, since the 
mid-1980's.  On December 2, 1992 Adventure and certain of 
its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for reorganization 
under Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the 
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of 
West Virginia.  The Company continued as sales agent and 
became a debtor-in-possession financier.

The Company announced on November 8, 1994 that it had 
reached agreement with AMCI Coal Sales, Inc. ("AMCI") and 
Adventure for AMCI to replace WCSC as sales agent and 
financier for Adventure.  AMCI will provide inventory and 
receivable financing to Adventure.  This substitution was 
approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the 
Southern District of West Virginia.


Upon transfer of its interest in Adventure's clean coal 
stockpile to AMCI, the Company received a note from AMCI for 
$1,000,000 payable over 18 months.  As a part of this 
arrangement, the Company agreed that its secured claims in 
the Adventure bankruptcy would be limited to $10,000,000, 
payable pursuant to two $5,000,000 interest bearing notes.  
The first $5,000,000 note will be repaid to the Company on a 
monthly basis starting in December 1994 through January 1998 
and requires two balloon payments of $1,000,000 each in 1995 
and in 1996.  The required balloon payments are tied to 
anticipated asset sales by Adventure.  If these balloon 
payments are not made, the Company has the right to 
foreclose on certain assets.  The second $5,000,000 note 
will be paid monthly at five cents per ton for coal sold to 
current customers plus additional monthly payments based on 
a percentage of future coal sales price increases received 
by Adventure.  Payments on this second note will cease after 
June 2002 regardless of the amount paid.  The Company has 
agreed that the secured portion of its pre-petition claims, 
all of which were fully reserved by the Company in 1992, 
will be satisfied by these two notes.  These notes are 
collateralized by first and subordinated liens on certain 
assets of Adventure.  The income recognition of these 
payments will be recorded as the cash is received.  The 
Company's remaining pre-petition claims will be unsecured 
claims in the Adventure bankruptcy.  

Other

The Company is responsible for certain costs related to the 
eventual closing of its mines.  The Company accrues 
estimated liabilities while each mine operates in order to 
absorb these costs over the life of each mine.  These costs 
are related to reclamation and other environmentally related 
items.  The total cost to perform these activities  as of 
December 31, 1994 is estimated to be $15,500,000.  The 
Company has accrued $11,266,000 of these costs as of 
December 31, 1994.  Of the total amount accrued as of 
December 31, 1994, $2,318,000 is classified as current in 
Accounts payable and accrued expenses and the balance is 
classified as long-term in Other liabilities on the 
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company may also 
become responsible for similar costs associated with its 
mines operated by contractors if the contractor fails to 
perform.  This amount is estimated to be $11,060,000 and 
$16,500,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  
The Company's contractors held bonds for these costs 
totalling $2,174,000 and $8,200,000 at December 31, 1994 and 
1993, respectively.  The change in the Company's exposure in 
this area was primarily due to the Criterion sale as all of 
the Criterion mines were operated by contractors.  The 
Company's exposure to reclamation liabilities decreased even 
further in January of 1995 when the Company sold the assets 
of the Hampton Division and the purchasers assumed the 
related reclamation liabilities.  The Company reversed 
$3,370,000 of accrued reclamation liabilities in 1995 as a 
result of this transaction.

The Company also has certain project equity funding 
obligations and claims associated with its subsidiary, WEI.  
Refer to Note 6 for further information.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the Company's 
retiree medical obligations.

In addition to the above, the Company and its subsidiaries 
had various claims and suits pending at December 31, 1994, 
all in the ordinary course of business.


 8. Workers' Compensation and Pneumoconiosis Benefits

The Company is self-insured for workers' compensation 
benefits.  The cash payments for workers' compensation were 
$6,266,000, $6,193,000 and $5,393,000 in 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.  The amounts charged to expense for 
workers' compensation were $5,108,000, $17,204,000 and 
$11,033,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  In 1994 
the Company refined its methodology for estimating its 
workers' compensation liability by engaging an independent 
actuary.  The Company will continue to utilize an actuarial 
analysis in the future as it is a more reliable method of 
estimating this liability. 

The Company is also self-insured for Federal and state 
pneumoconiosis benefits.  The Company has created a trust 
with an independent trustee to fund liabilities for payments 
of these benefits and uses an actuarial method of providing 
for the cost of projected benefits to current and former 
employees based on existing and estimated future claims.  
The projected benefit costs are accrued as a percentage of 
coal operations' payroll cost over a period of twenty-five 
years.  This actuarial method is the most common method 
being used in the industry to accrue for such costs.  Based 
on actuarial data the Company did not make a contribution to 
the trust in 1994 or 1993 and does not anticipate making a 
contribution in 1995.
  

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status:

December 31,                                     1994      1993

Actuarial present value of benefit obligation:
   Terminated employees                       $ 5,600   $ 3,200       
   Claimants                                   17,400    26,700       
   Active employees                            11,600    16,300        

Total present value of benefit obligation      34,600    46,200 

Plan assets at fair value                      39,099    43,403        

Plan assets in excess of (less than)                     
 projected benefit obligation                 $ 4,499   $(2,797)      


The decrease in the present value of the benefit obligation 
is primarily due to favorable changes in discount rates and 
other favorable changes in medical experience assumptions.  
The decrease in the fair value of the Plan assets is due to 
a lower actual return than expected.

In addition, the Company has liabilities on its books 
totalling $15,004,000 and $17,475,000 as of December 31, 
1994 and 1993, respectively in relation to pneumoconiosis 
benefits.  The Company's management believes the entire 
recorded liability will ultimately be credited to earnings 
in future periods due to the Trust Fund being fully funded 
at December 31, 1994.  Based on actuarial data, the Company 
credited to earnings $2,471,000, $2,047,000, and $1,979,000 
in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The credits were 
primarily due to the status of the plan's funding as a 
result of a decrease in the Company's disability experience 
and a significant decrease in its workforce.


The Company is required to arrange for surety bonds in 
connection with its self-insured workers' compensation plan.  
The Company's surety bond underwriter required cash 
collateral for such bonding.  As of December 31, 1994, 
$9,210,000 was deposited in the cash collateral account 
which is classified in Other assets (long-term) in the 
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  No additional 
deposits are required at this time.  



 9. Retirement Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have a non-contributory 
defined benefit pension plan covering non-union employees.  
Benefits are based on years of service and the employee's 
average annual compensation for the highest five continuous 
years of employment.  The Company's funding practice is to 
make the minimum annual contribution required by applicable 
regulations.  Prior service costs and actuarial gains are 
amortized over the future service period of plan 
participants on a straight-line basis.  Pension income 
amounted to $1,862,000, $1,682,000 and $956,000 in 1994, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.  The increase in pension income 
in 1993 was primarily the result of the actual return on 
plan assets in excess of the estimated return. 






The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and 
amounts recognized in the Company's financial statements:

The 1994 discount rate and rate of increase in future 
compensation levels for the plan were 8.5% and 5.0%, 
respectively.  The 1993 discount rate and rate of increase 
in future compensation levels for the plan were 7.25% and 
5.5%, respectively.  The expected long-term rate of return 
on assets was 9.0% for both years 1994 and 1993.


Effective January 1, 1992 the Company adopted the 
Westmoreland Coal Company Supplemental Executive Retirement 
Plan ("SERP").  The SERP is an unfunded non-qualified 
deferred compensation plan whose purpose is to provide 
benefits to certain employees that could not be paid under 
the Company's defined benefit pension plan due to maximum 
limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code.  SERP expense 
amounted to $232,000 and $199,000 in 1994 and 1993 
respectively.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and 
amounts recognized in the Company's financial statements.

With respect to unionized employees, the Company is required 
under the national contract with the United Mine Workers' of 
America (the "UMWA") to pay amounts based on hours worked or 
tons processed (depending on the source of the coal) to the 
UMWA Retirement Funds.  These are multiemployer pension 
plans which are not controlled or administered by the 
Company.  The amounts charged to expense, including payments 
made by the Company on behalf of certain contract miners, 
were $1,021,000, $1,190,000 and $1,073,000 for the years 
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Under 
ERISA, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan 
Amendment Act of 1980, a contributor to a multiemployer plan 
is liable, upon termination of the plan or its withdrawal 
from the plan, for its share of the multiemployer plan's 
unfunded vested liabilities.  The Company estimates that its 
share of the unfunded vested liabilities amounted to 
approximately $19,800,000 at June 30, 1994 and $17,100,000 
at June 30, 1993.  The increase over the prior year is due 
to lower investment interest rates, additional benefits 
granted under the plan and the Company's increased share of 
retirees whose companies have gone out of business.

As part of Westmoreland's continued restructuring efforts, 
the Board of Directors at its March 16, 1995 meeting 
approved the establishment of a voluntary Early Retirement 
Incentive Program (the "Program").  No determination has 
been made as to how long this Program will remain in place.  
The Program has not yet been implemented.  Senior Management 
and employees of WEI and WRI are not eligible to participate 
in this program.  Participating employees who receive 
benefits under the Program would not then be eligible for 
benefits under the severance policies of the Company or its 
subsidiaries.  The Company will benefit from this Program 
because most of the benefits can be paid out of excess 
pension assets rather than from the Company's operating 
cash.  Under ERISA, pension assets are only available to 
plan participants.




10. Postretirement Medical and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company has single-employer plans and multiemployer 
plans.

Single-Employer Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care 
and life insurance benefits for retired employees and their 
dependents.  Should the current plans remain in effect, 
substantially all of the Company's current employees 
(unionized and non-unionized) may become eligible for these 
benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements 
at the time of termination or retirement.  These benefits 
are provided through self-insured programs.

In 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
than Pensions" ("SFAS 106").  Under this new standard the 
cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions must be 
recognized on an accrual basis as employees perform services 
rather than the "pay-as-you-go" basis.

The Company adopted SFAS 106 on January 1, 1993 and elected 
to amortize its unrecognized, unfunded accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation over a 20-year period.  
This increased the Company's 1993 expense by $10,527,000 
over the 1992 expense.  The Company expensed $16,726,000 and 
$18,138,000 for SFAS 106 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  
Additionally, Hampton Division in 1993 accrued $18,552,000 
as a curtailment charge, including $16,162,000 of the 
Company's total transition obligation as of December 31, 
1993 in connection with the planned shutdown of this 
Division's Company operated mines in 1994.  This accounting 
standard does not change the cash requirements for funding 
these benefits.  Cash paid for retirees (not including 
payments the Company makes into the UMWA Benefit Trust 
Funds) was $7,775,000, $7,604,000 and $7,866,000 in 1994, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.


The following table sets forth the amounts recognized in the 
Company's financial statements: 

                                                     December 31

1993
Actuarial present value of benefit obligation:
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
  Current retirees                            $ (91,766) $(101,901)
  Fully eligible actives                        (30,816)   (15,533)
  Other actives                                  (8,374)   (19,891)

Accrued postretirement benefit cost           $ (38,014) $ (29,079) 

The health care cost trend rate assumed ranges from 8.0% in 
1995 to 5% by the year 2001.  Increasing the assumed health 
care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year 
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 1994 by $16,900,000 and the 
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net 
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 by $1,500,000.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated 
postretirement benefit at December 31, 1994, and December 
31, 1993 was 8.5% and 7.25% respectively.

The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
are as follows:
				                
                                                     December 31,

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost         16,726    18,138  

Multiemployer Plans

Additionally, the Company makes payments into the UMWA 
Benefit Trust Funds (the "Funds").  These Funds are 
multiemployer health plans which are not controlled or 
administered by the Company.  These Funds are designed to 
pay benefits to the Company's UMWA employees who retired 
prior to 1976 and to the Company's pro-rata share of those 
UMWA retirees whose companies are no longer in business.  
Prior to February 1993, the amount paid by the Company was 
based on hours worked or tons processed (depending on the 
source of the coal) in accordance with the National Contract 
with the UMWA.  Beginning February 1993 the Company is 
required by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 
1992 to make monthly premium payments into the Funds.  These 
payments are based on the number of beneficiaries assigned 
to the Company.  The Company is challenging the number of 
beneficiaries it was assigned.  The net present value of the 
Company's future cash payments is estimated to be 
$56,700,000.  The amounts of the cash payments into the 
Funds were $6,072,000, $3,827,000 and $5,582,000 in 1994, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.  Included in the 1994 amount 
were cash payments of $635,000 that were charged against an 
accrual established in 1993 for the Hampton Division 
shutdown.  In 1993 the Hampton Division accrued an 
additional $7,101,000 for its share of this liability as 
part of its mine closure costs.  Exclusive of the Hampton 
shutdown accrual the amounts expensed by the Company 
amounted to $4,327,000, $4,937,000 and $5,582,000 in 1994, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.  Refer to Note 4 for further 
information regarding the Hampton shutdown.

In addition, employees terminated due to layoffs may be 
eligible for health care, life insurance and certain other 
benefits for a period of up to 24 months.  The Company 
charges against earnings an estimate of all these future 
costs associated with such employees in the month of layoff.



11. Lease Obligations

The Company and its subsidiaries lease coal lands from Penn 
Virginia Resources Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Penn Virginia Corporation (controlling an 18.95% voting 
interest in the Company at December 31, 1994) and other 
lessors.  The leases provide for minimum annual royalties of 
$606,000 plus real estate taxes.

The coal leases with Penn Virginia Resources Corporation are 
in effect until all economically mineable reserves are 
exhausted.  These coal leases were renegotiated effective 
July 1, 1988 at rates comparable to royalty rates charged by 
other lessors at the time.  Under the agreement, the royalty 
rates for most deep-mined coal range from 6.5% to 7.0% of 
the sales price during the 10-year period beginning July 1, 
1988.  Beginning July 1, 1992 either party to this lease may 
call for negotiation to set new rates for these particular 
seams.  During the 10-year period beginning July 1, 1988, 
the rates for surface-mined coal range from 8.5% to 9.0% and 
the rates for highwall-mined coal range from 7.5% to 8.0%.

In January 1995, the Company sold its Hampton Division 
mineral lease to the lessor, Penn Virginia Resources 
Corporation.  See Note 2.

WRI has an agreement to lease coal reserves from the Crow 
Tribe of Indians and which is in effect until exhaustion.  
This lease requires annual rentals, recoupable minimum 
royalties and production royalties.  The royalty rate varies 
from the greater of $.30 per ton or 6% of the F.O.B. mine 
price to a 12.5% rate net of all production-based taxes.  

Royalties and rentals charged to expense under all lease 
agreements, including those in effect for WRI, amounted to 
$17,262,000, $17,761,000 and $17,292,000 in 1994, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.

The Company has operating lease commitments expiring at 
various dates, primarily for real property and equipment.  
Minimum rental obligations existing under these leases at 
December 31, 1994 are as follows:

                       (in thousands)
                1995               $2,638
                1996                2,166
                1997                1,454
                1998                  999
                1999                  702
                After 1999             -

 


 12. Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 
20,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 4,800,000 shares of 
Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock and 
200,000 shares of Series B Junior Participating Preferred 
Stock.

As of December 31, 1994, the Company had outstanding 
6,957,084 shares of Common Stock and 575,000 shares of 
Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock.  The 
Common Stock and the Preferred Stock constitute all of the 
Company's voting securities.

In July 1992, the Company sold 2,300,000 Depository Shares, 
each representing one quarter of a share of Series A 
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Preferred 
Stock") for a total public offering price of $57,500,000.  
Net proceeds to the Company were $54,528,000.  As a result, 
575,000 shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding.  The 
Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference equivalent to 
$25 per depository share and dividends accumulate on the 
Preferred Stock at 8.5% per annum, equivalent to $2.125 per 
year per depository share.  There are no mandatory sinking 
fund requirements on the Preferred Stock.  

The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the 
holder at any time, unless previously redeemed, into shares 
of Common Stock of the Company at a rate equivalent to 1.708 
shares of Common Stock for each Depository Share.  The 
Preferred Stock and the Depository Shares representing such 
stock are not redeemable prior to July 1, 1996.  The 
Preferred Stock is redeemable thereafter at the option of 
the Company, in whole or in part, from time to time, 
initially at an amount equivalent to $26.28 per Depository 
Share, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning 
July 1, 1996, and thereafter at prices declining annually to 
an amount equivalent to $25 per Depository Share on and 
after July 1, 2002, plus, in each case, an amount equal to 
the sum of all accrued and unpaid dividends.

The Preferred Stock may be exchanged at the option of the 
Company, as a whole only, on any dividend payment date 
commencing July 1, 1996, for 8 1/2% Convertible Subordinated 
Exchange Debentures due July 1, 2012 (the "Exchange 
Debenture") in a principal amount equal to $100 per share of 
Preferred Stock.  The Exchange Debenture, if issued, will be 
convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed, into shares of Common Stock at the then 
applicable conversion rate for the Preferred Stock.

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Preferred Stock 
was used to purchase 1,295,589 shares of Company Common 
Stock from a subsidiary of Penn Virginia Corporation ("Penn 
Virginia").  The Company retired these shares in December 
1992.  Penn Virginia's voting interest in the Company prior 
to this transaction was 39.6%.  Penn Virginia's voting 
interest in the Company was 18.95%, 18.96% and 18.96% at 
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  

On January 28, 1993 the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights 
Plan (the "Plan") and declared a distribution under the Plan 
of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right ("Right") for each 
outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock.  In the 
event that any person or group acquires a 20% or greater 
position in the Company, each holder of a Right (other than 
the acquiring person or group) will be entitled to purchase 
one one-hundredth of one share of Westmoreland Series B 
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a per share purchase 
price of $30, or, in lieu of the Preferred Stock, the number 
of shares of the Company's Common Stock having a market 
value at that time of $60.  If the Company is acquired in a 
merger or other business combination transaction, each 
holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group) 
will be entitled to purchase a number of shares of the 
acquiring company's common stock having a market value at 
that time of $60.

The Company can redeem the Rights at a redemption price of 
$.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day 
(subject to extension) after a public announcement that a 
20% position is acquired.

The Board of Directors has the flexibility to lower the 20% 
threshold to not less than 10% prior to the time any person 
or group acquires a 20% position in the Company.  The Rights 
expire on February 11, 2003.

After obtaining a waiver to its 1977 Loan Agreement, the Company 
declared and paid an $.08 dividend on Common Stock in each of the 
four quarters of 1992.  On January 26, 1993 the Company announced 
that the regular quarterly dividend of $.08 per share of common 
stock payable for the first quarter of 1993 would be suspended 
and has not been resumed.  Common stock dividend payments may not 
be declared until the preferred stock dividends that are in 
arrears are made current.

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid 
quarterly from the third quarter of 1992 through the first 
quarter of 1994.  The declaration and payment of preferred stock 
dividends was suspended in the second quarter of 1994 in 
connection with extension agreements with the Company's principal 
lenders.  The last quarterly preferred stock dividend paid in 
1994 was on April 1, 1994.  On February 1, 1995 the Board of 
Directors declared a first quarter preferred stock dividend to be 
paid April 1, 1995 to holders of record as of March 10, 1995.  
The three quarterly dividends which are in arrears  at December 
31, 1994 (those dividends whose payment dates would have been 
July 1, 1994, October 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995) amount to 
$3,666,000 in the aggregate ($6.38 per preferred share).  The 
Company's Board of Directors will continue to review the payment 
of quarterly preferred stock dividends as well as the three 
preferred stock dividends which are in arrears in light of the 
Company's ongoing business circumstances. 


The Company is reviewing its options with respect to its Virginia 
Division, which include the possible future sale, downsizing or 
shutdown of all or a portion the Virginia Division, at which time 
the Company may be required to recognize, for accounting 
purposes, a significant portion of its postretirement medical 
liabilities.  The total amount of the postretirement medical 
liabilities which would be expensed at the time the Virginia 
Division's shutdown, downsizing or sale occurs is not known at 
this time, however the impact of this noncash expense on 
shareholders' equity could affect the Company's ability to pay 
preferred stock dividends.  

There are also statutory restrictions limiting the payment 
of preferred dividends under Delaware law, the state in 
which the Company is incorporated.  Under Delaware law, the 
Company is permitted to pay dividends only:  (1) out of 
surplus, surplus being the amount of shareholders' equity in 
excess of the par value of the Company's two classes of 
stock; or (2) in the event there is no surplus, out of net 
profits for the fiscal year in which a dividend is declared 
(and/or out of net profits from the preceding fiscal year), 
but only to the extent that shareholders equity exceeds par 
value of preferred stock ($575,000).  The combined par value 
of the Company's preferred and common stocks is $17,965,000.  
The Company's shareholders' equity at December 31, 1994 was 
$50,724,000.

13.	Incentive Stock Option and
	Stock Appreciation Rights Plans

As of December 31, 1994, the Company had options and stock 
appreciation rights outstanding and unexercised from two 
Incentive Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Rights Plans.

The Plans provide for two incentive elements, incentive 
stock options ("ISOs") and stock appreciation rights 
("SARs").  An ISO gives the holder the right to purchase 
from the Company a specified number of shares of the 
Company's common stock for a specified price during a 
specified period. The 1985 Plan also provides for the grant 
of non-qualified options, if so designated, and contains the 
terms specified for non-qualified options.  An SAR gives the 
holder the right to receive, without payment to the Company, 
its "value" in cash.  The "value" of an SAR for this purpose 
will be the excess, if any, of the fair market value of one 
share of common stock of the Company on the date the right 
is exercised over non-qualified exercise price of the 
related option.  ISOs granted under the Plans may not have 
an option price that is less than the fair market value of 
the stock on the date of grant.  ISOs and SARs may not be 
exercised until 2 years from the date of grant as to 50% of 
the total number granted and as to the remaining 50% not 
until 3 years from the date of grant; the right to exercise 
ISOs and SARs terminates after 8 years from the date of 
grant. The maximum number of shares of the Company's common 
stock and SARs that may be issued or granted under the Plans 
is as follows:

                               1982 Plan      1985 Plan
		

   Shares of common stock           200,000         400,000
   Stock appreciation rights        470,000         940,000
		

The 1982 Plan expired on January 4, 1992, and the 1985 Plan 
expired on January 7, 1995.  Therefore, no further ISOs or 
SARs may now be granted from either plan.  Information for 
1994, 1993 and 1992 with respect to the Plans is as follows:
                                                            Stock

  December 31, 1994       5.75- 18.50     411,855          15,269
       

Over the periods in which the SARs become exercisable, the 
Company accrues as expense the amount by which the market 
price exceeds the various grant prices of the SARs 
outstanding.  This is adjusted in subsequent reporting 
periods for increases or decreases in the market price of 
the stock.  In 1994 and 1993 no accrual was recorded.  In 
1992 the net amount credited to earnings was $143,000. 

During 1992, the Company purchased 2,696 shares of its 
Common Stock to fund ISOs exercised in 1992.   The market 
price which the Company paid to acquire the shares was more 
than the option price which the employees paid to the 
Company in accordance with the terms of the plan and the 
difference of $15,000 was recorded as a reduction to Other 
Paid-In Capital.  The per share market value of the ISOs 
exercised in 1992 was $20.00.


14.	Transactions with Affiliated Companies

The Company leases coal lands from of Penn Virginia 
Resources Corporation whose parent company, Penn Virginia 
Corporation ("Penn Virginia") holds an 18.95% voting 
interest in the company at December 31, 1994.  Amounts paid 
to Penn Virginia for royalties on coal were $11,019,000, 
$11,699,000 and $10,689,000 for the years ended December 31, 
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  In 1995 the Company sold 
certain mineral leases back to Penn Virginia.  Refer to Note 
2. 

Westmoreland Resources, Inc., a 60% owned subsidiary, has a 
coal mining contract with Morrison Knudsen Company, Inc., 
one of its stockholders.  Mining costs incurred under the 
contract were $15,390,000, $12,131,000 and $12,651,000 in 
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.





15.	Income Taxes (Benefit)

16. Operations

Segment Information

The Company's principal business is the production and sale 
of coal in the United States and until recently the 
marketing of coal on a worldwide basis.  The Company 
produces coal in the Eastern and Western United States.  
Eastern operations are conducted through the Virginia 
Division and a wholly-owned subsidiary, Pine Branch.  Powder 
River Basin coal is produced by WRI from reserves owned by 
the Crow Indians in Montana.  The Company markets coal 
primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, WCSC, 
headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Most of the 
coal now sold by WCSC is processed at and shipped from 
Company properties to electric utilities within the United 
States.  Historically, WCSC has also sold steam and 
metallurgical coal into the domestic and export markets.  In 
the past a significant portion of this coal was produced by 
unaffiliated producers.  During 1994 the Company withdrew 
from the export market and severed most of its relationships 
with unaffiliated producers.  

The Company is also engaged in the business of developing 
and owning interests in cogeneration and other non-regulated 
independent power plants, through its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, WEI. 

The Company has no intersegment sales for the years shown. 
In presenting operating income by segment, unallocated 
corporate expenses are charged to coal operations.

1992 coal revenues.  Long-term contracts generated 72% of the 
coal revenues.   Coal sold to the steam market in the United 
States, represented 61% of the Company's coal revenues;  these 
sales were distributed as follows: 18% in the Northeast, 73% in 
the Southeast and 9% in the Midwest.  The Company's total export 
accounts receivable at December 31, 1992 was $24,544,000.

The Company makes yearly evaluations of its reserves and 
periodically modifies the amount of reserves reported.  The 
reserve evaluations are based on new information developed by 
bore-hole drilling, examination of outcrops, acquisitions, 
dispositions, production, changes in mining methods, abandonments 
and other information.  Substantially all of the estimated coal 
reserves are leased from others.  The decrease in 1994 is due to 
1994 production, the sale of the assets of Criterion Coal 
Company, and the removal of certain reserves due to changes in 
mining plans or the elimination of reserves deemed to be 
uneconomical to mine.  The decrease in 1993 is due to 1993 
production and the removal of certain assets due to changes in 
mining plans or deemed to be uneconomical to mine.







Independent Auditor's Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Westmoreland Coal Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Westmoreland Coal Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the 
three-year period ended December 31, 1994.  These consolidated 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Westmoreland Coal Company and subsidiaries at 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations 
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year 
period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

     ($1.00 par value)


Dividends:

After obtaining a waiver to its 1977 Loan Agreement, the Company 
declared and paid an $.08 dividend on Common Stock in each of the 
four quarters of 1992.  On January 26, 1993 the Company announced 
that the regular quarterly dividend of $.08 per share of common 
stock payable for the first quarter of 1993 would be suspended 
and has not been resumed.  Common stock dividend payments may not 
be declared until the preferred stock dividends that are in 
arrears are made current.

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid 
quarterly from the third quarter of 1992 through the first 
quarter of 1994.  The declaration and payment of preferred stock 
dividends was suspended in the second quarter of 1994 in 
connection with extension agreements with the Company's principal 
lenders.  The last quarterly preferred stock dividend paid in 
1994 was on April 1, 1994.  Common stock dividend payments were 
not permitted under covenants contained in the Company's loan 
agreements from January 1993 through December 22, 1994.  Further 
payment of common stock dividends is not permitted until the 
preferred dividend arrearages are satisfied.  On February 1, 1995 
the Board of Directors declared a quarterly preferred stock 
dividend to be paid April 1, 1995 to holders of record of March 
10, 1995.  The three quarterly dividends which are in arrears at 
December 31, 1994 (those dividends whose payment dates would have 
been July 1, 1994, October 1, 1994 and January 1, 1995) amount to 
$3,666,000 in the aggregate ($6.38 per preferred share). The 
Company's Board of Directors will continue to review the payment 
of quarterly preferred stock dividends as well as the three 
preferred stock dividends which are in arrears, in light of the 
Company's ongoing business circumstances.

The Company is reviewing its options with respect to its Virginia 
Division, which include the possible future sale, downsizing or 
shutdown of all or a portion the Virginia Division, at which time 
the Company may be required to recognize, for accounting 
purposes, a significant portion of its postretirement medical 
liabilities.  The total amount of the postretirement medical 
liabilities which would be expensed at the time the Virginia 
Division shutdown or sale occurs is not known at this time, 
however the impact of this non-cash expense on shareholders' 
equity could affect the Company's ability to pay preferred stock 
dividends. 

There are also statutory restrictions limiting the payment of 
preferred dividends under Delaware law, the state in which the 
Company is incorporated.  Under Delaware law, the Company is 
permitted to pay dividends only:  (1) out of surplus, surplus 
being the amount of shareholders' equity in excess of the par 
value of the Company's two classes of stock; or (2) in the event 
there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in 
which a dividend is declared (and/or out of net profits from the 
preceding fiscal year), but only to the extent that shareholders 
equity exceeds par value of preferred stock ($575,000).  The 
combined par value of the Company's preferred and common stocks 
is $17,965,000.  The Company's shareholders' equity at December 
31, 1994 was $50,724,000.
