PART II -- Rules 12b-25(b) AND (c)

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or 
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the 
following should be completed.  (Check box if appropriate)

     (a)  The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this 
form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort 
or expense;
 X   (b)  The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition 
report on Form 10-K,  Form 20-F, 11-K, Form N-SAR, or portion thereof, 
will be filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the

fifth calendar day following the prescribed due date; and 
     (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 
(12-b-25(c) has been attached if applicable.

PART III -- NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, 11-K, 
10-Q, N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof, could not be 
filed within the prescribed time period.  (Attach Extra Sheets If 
Needed).  The Registrant is engaged in negotiations with its primary 
lenders and guarantors to cure defaults arising from its non-compliance 
with certain financial covenants as of December 31, 1993 by obtaining 
amendments to those covenants or waivers of the defaults, or by a 
possible refinancing of its lending facilities, including obtaining a 
replacement Revolving Credit Facility or extension of the maturity 
dates.  The Registrant expects the new lending facility to be in place 
or amendments and waivers obtained as soon as practicable, which may 
cause the Registrant to prepare its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 1993 
in a manner materially different from the manner of presentation now 
applicable.  In addition, the independent auditors' report may also be 
significantly different from the report that would now be given, which 
would be misleading under the circumstances.

(2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter) 
period that the registrant was required to file such reports) been 
filed?  
       If answer is no, identify report(s)   Yes_X_         No___

operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will 
be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject 
report or portion thereof?
                                             Yes_X_         No___

narratively and quanitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons 
why a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

Westmoreland Announces Fourth Quarter 1993
and 1993 Financial Results
and Declares Quarterly Dividend
On Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
_______________

Philadelphia, PA - February 25, 1994 -- Westmoreland Coal Company 
(NYSE:WCX) today announced its fourth quarter 1993 and full year 1993 
financial results which included special charges aggregating $79 million 
and additional accruals for workers compensation liabilities.

	The Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared 
the stated quarterly dividend of $0.53125 per depositary share of the 
Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock.  The dividend is 
payable on April 1, 1994 to holders of record as of March 10, 1994.

Fourth Quarter 1993 Results

	Westmoreland Coal Company's net loss, after preferred dividends, 
was $94 million, or a loss of $13.44 per share, for the fourth quarter 
1993 compared to a net loss after preferred dividends, of $38 million or 
a loss of $5.43 per share, for the same quarter in 1992.  Included in 
the 1993 net loss was $79 million of special charges and $10 million of 
additional accruals for workers compensation liabilities or a total of 
$89 million.

	1993's fourth quarter results include $79 million of charges 
related to the writeoff in the carrying value of certain mining 
operations and coal reserves along with provisions for the termination 
of certain operations and personnel.  These charges resulted from the 
Company's continuing strategic review of its mining operations in light 
of a continued depressed coal market that shows no definite signs of 
prolonged improvement.  The additional accrual for workers compensation 
liabilities resulted from the Company's continuing assessment of its 
exposure.

	Of the $79 million of special charges, $43 million is for the 
planned discontinuation in the second quarter of 1994 of most of the 
Hampton Division's operations; $20 million is for the writeoff of the 
partially developed Triangle mine complex idled since the early 80's and 
classified within Other Coal Operations; and $16 million is for the 
planned closedown in late 1994 of the Wentz mine complex and the 
writeoff of certain assets within the Virginia Division.  The decision 
on the Hampton Division comes as a result of the loss in January 1994 of 
an above-market coal sales contract for 300,000 tons per year.  The 
Triangle writeoff derives from management's 1993 review of 
underperforming assets and its reassessment of the potential market and 
economics of further development and operation of this complex in the 
foreseeable future.  The anticipated closedown of the Wentz mine complex 
is due to the depletion of its economically mineable reserves.  Finally, 
the bulk of the other asset writeoffs in the Virginia Division arise 
from the review of the economic potential for certain undeveloped coal 
reserves owned in fee.

	Of the total $79 million in charges, $39 million are non-cash and 
are related to the book value of assets written down and $40 million is 
related to accruals, which will be funded.  Approximately $9 million of 
the accruals will be funded in 1994, $5 million in 1995 and the 
remainder in 1996 and beyond.  The longer term accrual relates to 
retiree medical benefits to be funded over the lifetimes of the 
beneficiaries.  These charges are not expected to result in a material 
impact on 1994 earnings.

	1992's fourth quarter results included charges totalling $35 
million, of which $21 million was related to loans and obligations on 
behalf of the Adventure Resources Companies, a coal supplier that filed 
for bankruptcy, with the remainder related to uncollectible trade 
receivables, reclamation and workers' compensation accruals.  

	Excluding all of the above charges, accruals and writeoffs, the 
net loss after preferred dividends for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $5 
million as compared to a loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 
1992.  The 1993 fourth quarter loss includes $2 million of increased 
expense compared to 1992 attributable to the mandatory recognition of 
non-cash charges related to the adoption of SFAS 106 (Employers 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions).

	Total revenues for the fourth quarter 1993 were $125 million as 
compared to $130 million for the same period in 1992.  Coal sales were 
4.5 million tons in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared to 4.7 million 
tons in the same quarter of 1992.  This decrease was caused by the 
depressed export market and the closing in early-1993 of a mining 
operation by a non-affiliated entity for which Westmoreland Coal Sales 
Company acted as sales agent. 

1993 Financial Results

	Westmoreland's net loss, after preferred dividends, for 1993 was 
$103 million, or a loss of $14.74 per share, compared to a net loss of 
$43 million, or a loss of $5.68 per share in 1992.  The principal 
factors impacting results were the increased charges in the fourth 
quarter of 1993 compared to 1992 and $11 million of non-cash SFAS 106 
charges and lower export earnings.  These adverse factors were partially 
offset by improved operations at the Virginia Division and Criterion 
Coal Company.

	Total revenues for 1993 were $465 million as compared to $536 
million in 1992.  Coal sales were 16.7 million tons in 1993 versus 19.4 
million tons in 1992.  This decrease was due almost entirely to a 
reduction in tons sold for other producers.  Export sales tons decreased 
32% while domestic sales tons decreased 8%.

	Cash flow from operating activities for 1993 was $32 million in 
1993 compared to $2 million in 1992.  This improvement is related to 
aggressive working capital management and improved productivity.

Discontinued Operations

	Included in the net loss after preferred dividends for 1993 was 
income from discontinued operations of $1 million as compared to $2 
million for 1992.  Westmoreland Energy, Inc. is currently accounted for 
as a discontinued operation having been offered for sale in the third 
quarter of 1993.

Liquidity

	As of December 31, 1993, Westmoreland is not in compliance with 
certain of the financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit 
Loan Agreement maturing July 1994, the 10% Senior Notes due July 1994, 
the Westmoreland obligation under a $27 million letter of credit 
expiring in July 1994 related to the financing of a portion of the 
Dominion Terminal Associates coal export terminal and the Westmoreland 
guarantee of a lease transaction on $4 million of mining equipment.  
Outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Loan Agreement and 10% 
Senior Notes total $24 million as of February 24, 1994.  Current 
unrestricted cash on hand is approximately $16 million.

	The Company is engaged in discussions with the institutions 
participating in these credit arrangements about possible modifications 
of the financial covenants or restructuring of the facilities including 
the extension of the maturities thereof.  "We are hopeful that 
improvements in Westmoreland's operations reflected in our current cash 
position, expected positive cash flow from operations in 1994 and the 
prospect of additional liquidity from possible asset dispositions will 
result in continued support by our lenders," said Francis J. Boyle, 
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Westmoreland.  "If 
we are successful in resolving these matters with our lenders promptly, 
we would expect an unqualified opinion for 1993 results from our 
auditors."

Outlook

	"We will continue our careful assessment of the Company's assets, 
strengths and weaknesses, the strategic alternatives available, and our 
aggressive management wherever changes need to be made," said 
Christopher K. Seglem, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "While 
perhaps bitter medicine, these steps must be taken to put Westmoreland 
on as solid a footing as possible.  The Company is committed to dealing 
with the problem of underperforming assets.  We are also pleased to 
report improvement in our cash flow from operations."

	"We have aggressively cut overhead, eliminated high cost 
production, and improved our financial management, particularly with 
respect to cash.  We have also forged a new and innovative labor 
platform with the United Mine Workers of America without a strike and 
significantly improved operations management. However, the Company's 
projected cash requirements for 1994 are significantly in excess of cash 
expected to be generated by operations because of the $51 million of 
debt and letters of credit maturing in July and the commitments of $29 
million for Westmoreland Energy that are due through December 1994," Mr. 
Seglem said.  "This makes it likely that Westmoreland will sell a major 
asset, but we will not be forced into a sale that is not in the best 
interest of the shareholders.  We would prefer to solve this problem by 
extending the maturity of our debt agreements.  As previously announced, 
we have offered to sell Westmoreland Energy, Inc., our independent power 
subsidiary.  In addition, the strategic review currently underway may 
result in the divestment of certain of our coal mining operations.  The 
decision to sell Westmoreland Energy, Inc. or coal mining operations 
depends in large part on the price that prospective buyers are willing 
to pay.  As an alternative, we are seeking an extension of the July 1994 
maturities from our lenders and are pursuing other actions to bridge our 
cash requirements.  After our 1994 cash requirements are met, our total 
cash flow for the next few years should be more than adequate to meet 
currently projected needs."

	"No assurances can be given that asset sales can be accomplished 
or that the Company's discussions with its lenders will result in a 
waiver of the current covenant defaults or help the Company address the 
fact that the debt is likely to mature prior to the availability of 
proceeds from the sale of Westmoreland Energy or one of the coal 
operations.  Without cooperation from lenders, the Company might be 
unable to meet its obligations upon acceleration or at the scheduled 
maturity of its credit agreements."

	"The Company is also continuing in its efforts to restructure its 
Virginia Division including the closing of its Wentz mine and 
preparation plant complex in 1994.  However, as we have previously 
disclosed, subsequent to the expiration of two above-market sales 
contracts in 1995 and 1996, the ability of the Virginia Division to 
operate profitably would require price increases, cost reductions or 
some combination of the two.  Some industry experts are predicting price 
increases, and in cooperation with our workforce we have made 
significant strides in addressing costs.  But it would be premature to 
predict the Virginia Division's ability to produce coal profitably at 
market prices after 1996 when its two major sales contracts will have 
expired."

Preferred Dividend

	At today's meeting, the Board declared the stated quarterly 
dividend of $0.53125 per depositary share of the Series A Convertible 
Exchangeable Preferred Stock, payable April 1, 1994 to holders of record 
on March 10, 1994.
