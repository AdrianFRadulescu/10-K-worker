ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

During the year ended December 31, 1995, Westmoreland Coal Company's (the
"Company") principal business was the production and sale of coal in the United
States.  Unlike prior years, the Company's operations in 1995 did not include
the marketing and sale of a significant amount of coal produced by unaffiliated
producers.   Beginning in 1992, the Company commenced a strategic review of
operations to eliminate underperforming assets and to attempt to achieve
sustainable profitability.   Pursuant to this strategic review, the Company has
sold or shut down a number of assets and operations, paid off its bank debt,
withdrawn from the export market and substantially reduced marketing of coal
for unaffiliated producers.

Since the idling of the Company's Eastern operations in the third quarter of
1995, the Company's principal businesses have become, (i)the production and
sale of coal from the Powder River Basin in Eastern Montana; (ii) the ownership
of interests in cogeneration and other non-regulated independent power plants;
the provision of repair and maintenance services to utilities and power
projects; and (iii) the leasing of capacity at Dominion Terminal Associates, a
coal storage and vessel loading facility.

COAL OPERATIONS

COAL PRODUCTION

Through Westmoreland Resources, Inc. ("WRI"), the Company produces coal in the
Powder River Basin in eastern Montana from reserves owned by the Crow Indians.
Prior to the idling, eastern operations were conducted through the Virginia
Division and a wholly-owned subsidiary, Pine Branch Mining Incorporated ("Pine
Branch") on 60,000 acres of reserves located in Virginia and Kentucky.
Limited production by subcontractors and subleases remains.

The following sections describe the Company's currently owned mining and
production facilities some of which have been idled or closed.





                                       A3
<PAGE>   4
WESTMORELAND RESOURCES, INC.  WRI is 60% owned by the Company.  Morrison
Knudsen Corporation owns 24% and Penn Virginia Equities_Corporation owns 16%.
WRI operates one large surface mine on approximately 15,000 acres of
subbituminous coal reserves.  WRI shipped 4,426,000 tons, 4,364,000 tons, and
3,224,000 tons of coal in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Morrison Knudsen
Corporation currently mines WRI's coal reserves on a contract basis.  The
Company received cash dividends from WRI of $1,650,000, $1,500,000 and $540,000
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

VIRGINIA DIVISION.  The Company's Virginia Division consists of eight
underground mines. In 1995, the Company operated five of these mines, all of
which are now idled, and three were operated by independent contractors.  The
Company's Virginia Division assets include two preparation plants and one
transloading facility.   The Virginia Division shipped 2,007,000 tons,
4,512,000 tons, and 4,878,000 tons of coal in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively, including coal produced by independent contractors, coal
purchased from Pine Branch and coal purchased from third party locations.  As
of December 31, 1995, the Virginia Division properties employed 48 people.

The Company idled the Virginia Division in the third quarter of 1995 and is
maintaining the properties on a standby basis except for  portions currently
being operated by two mining contractors.  Associated with this idling was the
recognition of certain future liabilities through unusual accounting charges.
Included in these charges were the writedown to the estimated net realizable
value of the remaining fixed assets of $18.9 million, the recognition of
postretirement medical costs of $34.3 million, the recognition of a potential
UMWA pension withdrawal liability of $20.0 million, severance and early
retirement costs of $8.6 million, and other costs totaling approximately $5.5
million.  In addition, the Company recognized idling costs incurred during the
fourth quarter of 1995 while the property is on standby basis.  The Company
continues to seek buyers and/or operators for its Virginia Division assets and
facilities.  Depending upon the structure of such transactions, the Company may
be able to reverse some of the above referenced charges.

PINE BRANCH MINING INCORPORATED.  Pine Branch is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company with surface mining operations on reserves subleased from the
Virginia Division.  Pine Branch began operations in 1992 and consists of one
mine.  Pine Branch also performs reclamation work for the Virginia Division at
certain sites that were previously abandoned by independent contractors.  The
operations of Pine Branch also were suspended during the third quarter of 1995.
As a result,





                                       A4
<PAGE>   5
certain charges and liabilities were incurred.  Included in the charges were
$1,400,000 for the write-off of fixed assets, $121,000 of medical benefits, and
$900,000 for final reclamation obligations.

CRITERION COAL COMPANY.  The Company sold the assets of Criterion Coal Company,
a wholly-owned subsidiary, and its affiliated companies,  ("Criterion") on
December 22, 1994 to CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc.("CONSOL"). Criterion consisted of
six mines, including two surface mines and four underground mines, and a
preparation plant.  All of the mining operations were conducted by independent
contractors on Criterion's properties.  Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the sale of
Criterion.

HAMPTON DIVISION.    The Company sold the assets of its Hampton Division in
January 1995 and concurrently sold the related mining lease back to the lessor,
Penn Virginia Resources Corporation.  From January 1994 through April 1994, the
Hampton Division operations consisted of two underground mines, a large surface
mine, a central machine shop and a preparation plant.  It operated on
approximately 14,000 acres in West Virginia and employed 130 people.  Most of
the Hampton Division was closed down in May 1994 due to high production costs
and market conditions, including the termination of an above-market coal sales
contract.  Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional discussion related to the sale of the Hampton Division.

COAL MARKETING

Historically, Westmoreland Coal Sales Company, Inc. ("WCSC") has sold steam and
metallurgical coal to the domestic and export markets.  Prior to 1995, a
significant portion of this coal was supplied by unaffiliated producers.  The
majority of the Company's sales have been in the steam market and have suffered
from decreasing prices, declining demand for certain qualities of coal, higher
production costs and limited supply.  Activities related to unaffiliated
producers also required that the Company provide a substantial amount of
working capital.  During the five year period from 1990 through 1994, the
Company established $4,801,000 in reserves for potentially uncollectible
accounts receivable related to coal sold for unaffiliated producers.
Additionally, in 1992 the Company fully reserved $20,489,000 of loans, a debt
guarantee and other related items on behalf of Adventure Resources, Inc.
("Adventure"), an unaffiliated producer. WCSC was the exclusive sales agent for
Adventure Resources, whose other affiliated companies include M.A.E.





                                       A5
<PAGE>   6
Services, Inc. and Maben Energy Corporation.  As sales agent for Adventure, the
Company purchased all of Adventure's clean coal production at the time it was
produced and carried all inventory and accounts receivable related to the sale
of Adventure's coal production.  No coal was supplied from Adventure during
1995.  Adventure supplied 1,664,000 tons of the total tons purchased by the
Company from unaffiliated producers in 1994.  On December 2, 1992 Adventure,
and certain of its affiliated companies, filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.  Pursuant to a
plan, whose terms were discussed and negotiated with Adventure and related
customers, the Company terminated its obligation to buy coal from Adventure and
to provide financial support as of November 8, 1994.  Refer to the Adventure
Resources, Inc. section of Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further details related to the establishment of this reserve.

During 1994 the Company withdrew from the export market and severed most of its
relationships with remaining unaffiliated producers.  Curtailment of the coal
marketing services provided to unaffiliated producers reduced substantially the
demands on the Company's working capital.

As a result of its asset dispositions, withdrawal from the export market and
reduction in activities related to unaffiliated producers during 1994, the
Company also closed related sales and field offices located in Banner,
Kentucky; Beckley, West Virginia; and Charlotte, North Carolina.


The following tables show, for each of the past five years, tons sold and
revenues derived from Company and unaffiliated production as well as revenues
from domestic and export activities. Included in Company tonnage below are
amounts of produced tonnage purchased from non-Company properties, but
processed through Company-owned facilities.

In 1995, the three largest customers of the Company accounted for 78% of its
coal revenues.  Duke Power Company, Georgia Power Company and Northern States
Power accounted for 52%, 13% and 13%, respectively, of the Company's coal
revenues in 1995.  The Duke Power Contract was sold back to the utility during
the third quarter of 1995.  The Georgia Power Contract expired during 1995 and
was not renewed.  No other customer accounted for as much as 10% of the
Company's 1995 coal revenues.

The majority of the coal produced by WRI is sold under long-term contracts.
The long-term contract with its largest customer, Northern States Power,
expires in 2005 and accounted for 59% of the tons sold by WRI in 1995.





                                       A8

WRI has also entered into an option agreement with Northern States Power
whereby it has agreed to sell up to an additional 200,000,000 tons of coal
through December 31, 2005.  As compensation for granting the option, WRI
receives 1 1/4 cents, payable quarterly (with applicable price adjustments) for
each optioned ton.  The option may be exercised at any time in whole or in part
through  December 31, 2005. If exercised, the sales price will be based on the
market price at the time the option is exercised.  WRI recorded income
totalling $3,014,000, $2,961,000 and $3,202,000 during 1995, 1994 and 1993
respectively, relative to the option agreement.  No coal has been delivered
under the option agreement.

WRI's customers accounted for $31,088,000 in coal revenues in 1995 from the
sale of 4,426,000 tons of coal, which represent 28% of the Company's total 1995
coal revenues and 65% of the Company's total tons sold in 1995.

Cleancoal Terminal Company ("Cleancoal") a former wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, was a rail-to-barge transloading and storage facility on the Ohio
River in Kentucky between Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio.  The
terminal ceased operations in January 1995 as a result of continuing operating
losses and an agreement to sell Cleancoal's assets to an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the CSX Corporation. The majority of Cleancoal's employees were
laid off on January 31, 1995.  The sale transaction was completed during the
third quarter of 1995. The terminal was utilized by the Company to blend and
transport coal from primarily unaffiliated producers in Kentucky for shipments
to midwestern, southern and foreign markets.    Cleancoal had an annual
transloading capacity of 6,000,000 tons.  Cleancoal transloaded 1,304,000 tons
and 2,511,000 tons in 1994 and 1993, respectively but was unable to generate a
profit.  No coal was transloaded during 1995. Refer to Note 3 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more details related to the Cleancoal
sale.

Westmoreland Terminal Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns a
20% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates ("DTA"), the owner of a coal
storage and vessel-loading facility in Newport News, Virginia.  Prior to 1995,
the terminal was utilized by the Company for most of its coal exporting and
intracoastal business.  DTA's annual throughput capacity is 22,000,000 tons,
and its ground storage capacity is 1,700,000 tons.  In 1995, DTA loaded
15,900,000 tons, including 1,461,000 tons for the Company.  Presently, the
Company utilizes the terminal to lease ground storage space and





                                       A9

vessel-loading capacity and facilities to others.  Refer to Note 6 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding DTA.

INDEPENDENT POWER OPERATIONS

WEI is engaged in the businesses of owning and managing interests in
independent power projects.  WEI, through various subsidiaries, currently has
interests in eight such power projects.  The Roanoke Valley II project ("ROVA
II" or  "ROVA II Project") became operational during 1995, bringing the number
of projects in commercial service to eight.  WEI has a 50% interest in ROVA II
and made an equity funding investment of $4,611,000 in 1995.  WEI also provides
repair and maintenance services to utilities and power projects through its
subsidiary Corona Engineering Corporation ("CEC"), located in Atlanta, Georgia.
Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information concerning WEI.

Independent power projects sell electricity through long term power contracts
to either utilities, or in some cases, to large industrial users.  There are
three types of independent power projects:  cogeneration projects which
sequentially provide two types of useful energy (e.g., electricity and steam)
from a single primary fuel (e.g., coal); small power producers which utilize
waste, biomass or other renewable resources as fuel; and exempt wholesale
generators ("EWG") which provide electrical energy without the requirement to
sell thermal energy or use waste or renewables as fuel sources.  The key
elements of an independent power project are a long-term contract for the sale
of electricity, long- term contracts for the fuel supply, a suitable site,
required permits and project financing.  Cogeneration projects require another
long-term contract for the sale of the steam or other thermal energy.  The
economic benefits of cogeneration can be substantial because, in addition to
generating electricity, a significant portion of the energy is used to produce
steam or high temperature water (thermal energy) for industrial processes.
Electricity is sold to utilities and in certain situations, to end-users of
electrical power, including large industrial facilities.  Thermal energy from
the cogeneration plant is sold to commercial enterprises and other
institutions.  Large industrial users of thermal energy include plants in the
chemical processing, petroleum refining, food processing, pharmaceutical, pulp
and paper industries.

The demand for power generated by cogeneration and other independent power
plants was originally fostered by the energy crises of the





                                      A10
<PAGE>   11
1970's, which led to the enactment of legislation that encouraged companies to
enter the cogeneration and independent power generation industry by reducing
regulatory requirements and facilitating the sale of electricity by such
companies to utilities.  However, the number of entrepreneurs who entered this
arena along with various market developments has dramatically limited the
number and quality of opportunities in the United States.  First, the demand
for electrical power has not reached initial projections resulting in excess
supply and severe downward pressure on generation and prices.  Second, public
and regulatory policy has reshifted its focus, now to open, competitive power
markets.  Such changes threaten projects which are not cost competitive.
Third, as utilities have consolidated and otherwise positioned themselves to
address these pressures, they have become even more hostile and aggressive
toward independent power operators, other than their own unregulated
subsidiaries.  As a result, the Company believes the domestic independent power
market has matured and will offer extremely limited opportunities for the
development of new projects.  Most independent power producers are now
primarily focused on the international market place, in such places as China
and India, for development.  The very large capital demands, lengthy
development periods, and international risks make such opportunities
unattractive to the Company.  As a result, the Company has made a strategic
decision to focus its efforts on maximizing the return on its existing
investments.

On October 31, 1995, WEI, through its newly formed subsidiary,
Westmoreland-Corona, Inc., completed the purchase of The Corona Group Inc.
("Corona").  Corona and its subsidiaries offer technical services and repair
and maintenance services to the power generating industry, including utilities,
cogeneration facilities and independent power producers.

Corona was acquired for $2,771,000 in cash plus the assumption of $2,042,000 in
notes payable and other liabilities, in exchange for 100% of Corona's stock.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method.  The transaction
resulted in goodwill of $790,000 which is being amortized straight-line over a
period of fifteen years.  The Company's 1995 financial statements include
results of operations from Corona for the period from November 1, 1995 to
December 31, 1995.

GENERAL

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS

The Company, including subsidiaries, employed 137 people on December 31, 1995
compared with 829 on December 31, 1994.  Included in these figures are 21
employees represented by the United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA") at
December 31, 1995, as compared to 576 such employees at December 31, 1994.

The Independent Bituminous Coal Bargaining Alliance ("IBCBA"), an alliance of
four coal companies, including Westmoreland Coal Company, was formed in 1992 to
negotiate a wage agreement with the UMWA.  The IBCBA and the UMWA successfully
reached an interim agreement on July 1, 1993.   A successor five year agreement
between the Company and the UMWA, which retained the major features of the
interim agreement, became effective as of December 16, 1993 (the "1993
Agreement").  The 1993 Agreement provides for the Company and the UMWA at the
local level to work together to reduce health care costs, maximize the
utilization of the Company's investments, recognize special local operating and
competitive conditions, provide flexibility in work and scheduling, create
incentive programs, recognize employees' skills and performance, involve and
integrate employees and the UMWA in the success of their mines and the Company,
and improve overall labor management relations.  Pursuant to the interim
agreement and the 1993 Agreement, the Company implemented a managed care
network in southwest Virginia, where most of its formerly active employees are
located, and in West Virginia, where most of its retired employees are located,
in an effort to control health care costs.  Participation in a managed care
network for retired employees covered by the Coal Industry Health Benefit Act
of 1992 is voluntary.  The 1993 Agreement provided for a wage increase of $.50
per hour, retroactive to February 1, 1993, the date on which the prior
five-year agreement expired.  The 1993 Agreement also provides for additional
wage increases of $.40 per hour on December 16, 1994 and December 16, 1995, and
for additional wage reopeners in 1996 and 1997.  The effect of the UMWA
contract in the future should be minimal due to the  scaled-down status of the
covered operations.

COMPETITION

The coal industry is highly competitive and the Company competes (principally
on price and quality of coal) with many other coal producers of all sizes.  The
Company's production, including the





                                      A12
<PAGE>   13
production of WRI, accounted for less than 1% of coal production in the United
States in 1995.  The nation's largest coal producer accounted for an estimated
9% of coal production in the United States in 1995. Coal production in the
United States reached a record level in 1994. Coal usage by electric utilities
reached record levels in 1994. Coal-fired generation was responsible for nearly
60% of all electricity generated within the United States in 1995.

The Company's steam coal production also competes with other energy sources in
the production of electricity.  For example, a significant, but indirect, cause
of lower coal demand in the future in the electric utility sector could be low
natural gas prices which could encourage utilities to meet a substantial
portion of future electricity growth with natural gas-fired capacity additions.
Such a strategy would displace some potential new coal-fired capacity.

WEI is subject to increasing competition with respect to the development of new
cogeneration projects from unregulated affiliates of utility companies,
affiliates of fuel and equipment suppliers and other independent developers.
WEI ranks approximately fortieth in size in the independent power industry with
net ownership of 233 megawatts of generation capacity as compared to its
largest competitor which has net ownership in excess of 5,700 megawatts of
generation capacity.

MINING SAFETY AND HEALTH LEGISLATION

The Company is subject to state and federal legislation prescribing mining
health and safety standards, including the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health
Act of 1969 and the 1977 Amendments thereto.  In addition to authorizing fines
and other penalties for violations, the Act empowers the Mine Safety and Health
Administration to suspend or halt offending operations.

ENERGY REGULATION

WEI's cogeneration operations are subject to the provisions of various laws and
regulations, including the federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of
1978 ("PURPA").  PURPA provides qualifying cogeneration facility status ("QF")
to operations such as WEI's, which allows those facilities to operate with
certain exemptions from substantial federal and state regulation, including
regulation of the rates at which electricity can be sold.





                                      A13
<PAGE>   14
The most significant recent change in energy regulation was the passage of the
National Energy Policy Act of 1992 ("EP Act").  Companies can now apply for
Exempt Wholesale Generator ("EWG") status with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC").   An EWG project can provide electrical energy without the
requirement to sell thermal energy to a user.  The EP Act permits an EWG
project to also be a QF project.  An EWG that is not a QF project must have its
power rates approved.  An EWG project that is a QF project can receive avoided
cost rates that are not subject to approval by FERC.  WEI received EWG status
and power rate approval for its ROVA I project in December 1993 as permitted in
its power purchase agreement.  In order to provide additional flexibility, in
March 1995 WEI received EWG status for all of its other projects except Ft.
Lupton and Fort Drum.  WEI intends to maintain the QF status for all its
current projects except ROVA I where returns can be maximized as an EWG as a
result of reduced operating costs.  Refer to the 'Recent Developments Relating
to Independent Power Projects' section of Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding QF issues and ROVA I's "forced
outage" issue.

PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT

MINING OPERATIONS.  The Company believes its mining operations are
substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to surface mining
and reclamation, and it is the policy of the Company to operate in compliance
with such standards.  The Company maintains compliance primarily through
maintenance and monitoring activities.  In 1995 the Company accrued
approximately $3,400,000 against operations in order to comply with
environmental regulations applicable to its mining operations.  The entire
charge related to idling of the Company's Virginia Division and Pine Branch
operations.  The Company estimates its total liabilities for reclamation are
approximately $10,311,000, all of which have been accrued as of December 31,
1995.  Actual cash paid to perform reclamation in 1995 amounted to $210,000.
In 1994 the Company charged $1,245,000 to earnings which did not include a
$3,135,000 credit to earnings resulting from a reversal of reclamation accruals
in connection with the sales of inactive properties in West Virginia and the
assets of Criterion in Kentucky.  In addition, reclamation fees imposed by the
Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the "Surface Mining
Act") amounted to approximately $1,755,000, $2,414,000 and $2,077,000 in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.





                                      A14
<PAGE>   15
The Company projects that 1996 charges for maintenance and monitoring
activities to meet environmental requirements for operations it continues to
own will be minimal due to the idle status of Eastern operations.  The
reduction in overall charges, exclusive of idling costs for environmental
purposes, is largely due to the asset dispositions that took place in 1994 and
early 1995, pursuant to which the buyers assumed reclamation and environmental
liabilities.  Future costs could change either to reflect the impact of new
regulations or because presently unforeseeable conditions may be imposed on
future mining permits.

The Surface Mining Act regulations set forth standards, limitations and
requirements for surface mining operations and for the surface effects of
underground mining operations. Under the regulatory scheme contemplated by the
Surface Mining Act, the Federal Office of Surface Mining ("OSM") issued
regulations which set the minimum standards to which State agencies concerned
with the regulation of coal mining must adhere.  States that wish to regulate
such coal mining must present their regulatory plans to OSM for approval.  Once
a State plan receives final approval, the State agency has primary regulatory
authority over mining within the State, and OSM acts principally in a
supervisory role.  State agencies may impose standards more stringent than
those required by OSM.  The two states in which the Company currently has
mining operations, active or idle, Virginia and Montana, have submitted
regulatory plans to OSM, and these plans have received final approval.  There
would be potential risk to the Company in the event it, or any of its
independent contractors, fails to satisfy the obligations created by the
Surface Mining Act.  Independent contractors mining on Company properties,
pursuant to their agreements with the Company, are primarily responsible for
compliance with environmental laws relating to those properties.  In the event,
however, that any of its independent contractors fail to satisfy their
obligations under the Surface Mining Act, the Company, depending upon the
circumstances, might have, and has had, to carry out such obligations in order
to avoid having its existing permits revoked or applications for new permits or
permit modifications blocked. Compliance with the Surface Mining Act
regulations has been costly for the Company and the coal mining industry in
general.

In the event final reclamation is not performed in accordance with State and
Federal regulations, the Company has $12,000,000 and $18,000,000 of reclamation
bonds in place in Montana and Virginia, respectively, that assures compliance
with all applicable regulations.





                                      A15
<PAGE>   16
In 1990, certain amendments were enacted to the Clean Air Act ("1990
Amendments").  As the first major revisions to the Clean Air Act since 1977,
the 1990 Amendments vastly expanded the scope of federal regulations and
enforcement in several significant respects.  In particular, the 1990
Amendments require that the United States Environmental Protection Agency issue
new regulations related to ozone non-attainment, air toxics and acid rain.
Phase I of the acid rain provisions required, among other things, that electric
utilities reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions to less than 2.5 lbs per
million Btu by January 1, 1995.  Phase II requires an additional reduction in
emissions to less than 1.2 lbs per million Btu by January 1, 2000.

The 1990 Amendments allow utilities the freedom to choose the manner in which
they will effect compliance with the required emission standards, including
switching to lower sulfur coal, scrubbing and using SO2 credit allowances.  The
Company currently anticipates little or no impact from the ozone non-attainment
and air toxic provisions of the 1990 Amendments.

INDEPENDENT POWER.  The environmental laws and regulations applicable to the
projects in which WEI participates primarily involve the discharge of emissions
into the water and air, but can also include wetlands preservation and noise
regulation.  These laws and regulations in many cases require a lengthy and
complex process of obtaining licenses, permits and approvals from federal,
state and local agencies.  Meeting the requirements of each jurisdiction with
authority over a project can delay or sometimes prevent the completion of a
proposed project, as well as require extensive modifications to existing
projects.  The partnership owners of the projects in which WEI has its
interests have the primary responsibility for obtaining the required permits
and complying with the relevant environmental laws.

The Clean Air Act and the 1990 Amendments contain provisions that regulate the
amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that may be emitted by a project.
Most of the projects in which WEI has investments are fueled by low sulfur coal
and are not expected to be significantly affected by the acid rain provisions
of the 1990 Amendments.  New domestic projects will be required to obtain
allowance offsets for SO2 emissions if they do not meet emission standards.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 1995, the Company owned or leased coal properties located in
Virginia and Montana.  The Company's estimated demonstrated reserves in owned
or leased property on December 31, 1995 in Virginia were 23,179,000 tons and in
Montana were 657,423,000 tons.  In Virginia the Company also owned or leased
264,848,000 tons currently classified by the Company as Unassigned Uneconomic.
Unassigned Uneconomic tonnages are legally recoverable with current technology,
but require significant capital expenditures and construction of new mine
openings and  are not in the Company's mining plans today, because they cannot
be mined profitably based on current projected economic conditions.  Nearly all
of the Company's eastern reserves are leased from others including 268,693,000
tons under lease from Penn Virginia Resources Corporation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Penn Virginia Corporation, ("Penn Virginia") which owns an 18.95%
and 18.96% voting interest in the Company at December 31, 1995 and December 31,
1994, respectively.  All leases with Penn Virginia run to exhaustion of the
coal reserves.  Properties located in Montana are leased by WRI from the Crow
Tribe of Indians and run to exhaustion.  The balance of the Company's leases
are for varying terms, including to exhaustion.  Certain reserves are owned in
fee.  In January 1995, as part of its sale of the Hampton Division, the Company
sold back coal reserve leases in West Virginia (the Hampton Division) of
62,875,000 tons to the lessor, Penn Virginia.  These reserves consisted of
8,091,000 tons of demonstrated reserves and the balance were Unassigned
Uneconomic reserves.

The following table shows the Company's estimated demonstrated coal reserve
base and production in 1995. The term "demonstrated coal reserve base" is as
defined in the "Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological
Survey" (Circular 891).  This represents the sum of the measured and indicated
reserve bases and includes assigned and unassigned economic reserves.

Estimates of reserves in Virginia are based mainly upon yearly evaluations made
by the Company's professional engineers and geologists.  The Company
periodically modifies estimates of reserves under lease which may increase or
decrease previously reported amounts.  The reserve evaluations are based on new
information developed by bore-hole drilling, examination of outcrops,
acquisitions, dispositions, production, changes in mining methods, abandonments
and other information.

Coal reserves in Montana represent recoverable tonnage held under the terms of
the Crow Tribe Lease, as amended in 1982, and other minor leases.  These
reserves were estimated to be 799,803,000 tons as of January 1, 1980 based
principally upon a report by independent consulting geologists, prepared in
February 1980.  The reserves consist of two main seams and a stray seam between
the upper and lower main seams.  Currently, the upper seam, with estimated
assigned reserves of 244,000,000 tons, is the only seam being mined in response
to a quality modification required by a significant customer.  Annually,
estimated remaining recoverable reserves are reduced by production in the upper
main seam and by the amount of reserves in the lower and stray seams bypassed
after mining the upper main seam.

In addition to the coal reserves mentioned above, as of December 31, 1995 the
Company owns several coal preparation and loading facilities in Virginia.  WRI
owns and operates a dragline and coal crushing and loading facilities at its
mine in Montana.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS

On November 8, 1994, the Company filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code seeking the confirmation of a so-called "pre-packaged"
Plan of Reorganization.  This measure was taken to obtain protection from the
Company's principal lenders pending the closing of the sale of the assets of
Criterion which closing was also facilitated by the filing.  The Federal
Bankruptcy Court approved the Company's Plan of Reorganization on December 16,
1994.  As approved in the Plan of Reorganization, the Company proceeded to
complete its sale of the assets of Criterion on December 22, 1994 and paid in
full its maturing debt obligations, at which time it emerged from bankruptcy.
Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information concerning the Company's Plan of Reorganization.

WESTMORELAND ENERGY, INC.

WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E Partners (the "ROVA
Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's principal customer contracted to
purchase the electricity generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  In
the second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA Partnership's
interpretation of the provisions of the contract dealing with the payment of
the capacity purchase price when the facility experiences a "forced outage"
day.  A forced outage day is a day when ROVA I is not able to generate a
specified level of electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the
customer is required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full capacity purchase
price unless forced outage days exceed a contractually stated annual number.
The customer asserts that it is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1995, the customer withheld approximately $8,500,000 of
capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA Partnership because of this
dispute.  The customer has withheld an additional $203,000 from the ROVA
Partnership through March 4, 1996.  On October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership
filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to
recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments may not be withheld in
the

future.  On December 12, 1994 the customer filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint and on March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  The ROVA
Partnership filed an amended complaint on April 17, 1995.  On April 27, 1995
the customer filed another motion to dismiss the complaint.  On August 23, 1995
the Court denied the customer's motion to dismiss and set a trial date of March
25, 1996.  The customer filed two motions for summary judgement.  The court
denied the customer's first motion for summary judgement on January 30, 1996;
however, on March 18, 1996 the Court granted the customer's second summary
judgement motion and effectively dismissed the complaint.  The ROVA Partnership
is evaluating its options, including possible appeal of the Court's decision
granting summary judgement.  A reserve was recorded as of December 31, 1994 for
the full amount withheld by the customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share of
the withheld payments in earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of
1994.  In the fourth quarter of 1994, WEI's revenues were reduced by
$2,928,000, representing its 50% share of the disputed amount.  No earnings
were recognized by WEI in 1995 for payments withheld by the customer relating
to forced outage days.  Regardless of the outcome, the Company believes ROVA I
will continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flows.

                 pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, either civil,
                 criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the
                 fact that he is or was a director, officer or supervisor or
                 manager of the corporation or a constituent corporation
                 absorbed in a consolidation or merger, or while a director,
                 officer or supervisor or manager of the corporation is or was
                 serving at the request of the corporation or a constituent
                 corporation absorbed in a consolidated or merger, as a
                 director, officer or supervisor or manager of another
                 corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
                 enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
                 judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
                 reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action,
                 suit or proceeding, whether or not the indemnified liability
                 arises or arose from any threatened, pending or completed
                 action by or in the right of the corporation to the extent
                 that such person is not otherwise indemnified and to the

                 law.

SECTION  2.      Advance of Expenses

                 Expenses incurred by a director, officer or supervisor or

                 proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
                 the director, officer or supervisor or manager to repay such
                 amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
                 entitled to be indemnified by the corporation.

SECTION  3.      Procedure for Determining Permissibility

                 The procedure for determining the permissibility of

                 corporation between the time of the action or failure to act
                 giving rise to the claim for indemnification and such claim,
                 and at the option of the person seeking indemnification, the
                 permissibility of indemnification shall be determined by
                 independent legal counsel selected jointly by the corporation
                 and the person seeking indemnification.   The reasonable
                 expenses of any director, officer or supervisor or manager in
                 prosecuting a successful claim for indemnification, and the
                 fees and expenses of any special legal counsel engaged to
                 determine permissibility of indemnification, shall be borne by
                 the corporation.

                 the director, officer or supervisor or manager, such
                 obligations of the corporation in connection with a claim
                 based on any act or failure to act occurring before such
                 modification or repeal.

                 The indemnification and advance of expenses provided by this
                 Article V shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to
                 which one indemnified may be entitled, both as to action in
                 his official capacity and as to action in another capacity
                 while holding such office, and shall inure to the benefit of

                 prohibited by applicable law, and (ii) give other
                 indemnification to the extent permitted by law.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash provided by operating activities was $8,174,000 in 1995.  Cash provided
from operating activities totaled $13,622,000 and $32,600,000 in 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The reduction of cash provided by operations in 1995 as compared
to 1994 is mainly attributable to operating losses of $24,359,000 for the first
nine months of 1995 and idling costs for the remainder of 1995 for the Virginia
division.  The Company received $23,503,000 from the sale of a coal contract in
1995.  For 1994, the Company's withdrawal from the export market and decreased
participation in the brokered coal business provided $19,208,000 of available
cash.  This was due to reductions in working capital from December 31, 1993 of
$17,940,000 related to export receivables, $6,000,000 related to domestic
receivables for coal sold on behalf of unaffiliated producers and $3,553,000
related to coal export inventory, all of which was partially offset by an
$8,285,000 reduction in accounts payables related to unaffiliated producers.

Cash provided from investing activities in 1995 and 1994 was $1,868,000 and
$43,886,000, respectively.  Cash used in investing activities totaled
$7,223,000 in 1993.  The Company received $10,131,000 from the disposition of
various assets, mainly the Hampton Division, and $3,145,000 in note payments in
1995.  Offsetting this cash inflow were cash investments relating to equity
commitments for a cogeneration project of $4,611,000, acquisitions of
$2,771,000 and fixed asset additions of $2,923,000.  In 1994, the Company
realized net proceeds from the sale of the assets of Critierion and other
assets totaling $78,273,000.  Cash used for investment purposes at Westmoreland
Energy, Inc.  ("WEI") was $27,928,000 during 1994 of which $23,178,000 was used
for equity funding commitments for independent power operations.  The Company
invested $5,892,000 in capital additions in 1994.  The Company has now
completed all equity commitments for its current portfolio of cogeneration and
independent power projects.  Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information relating to WEI and the independent power
operations.

Cash used in financing activities in 1995, 1994 and 1993 totaled $13,784,000,
$66,317,000 and $11,864,000, respectively.  Cash used in 1995 included
$10,240,000 relating to the repayment of debt and $2,444,000 in preferred stock
dividends.  In 1994, cash used in financing activities included the repayment
of the Company's Revolving Credit Loan of $12,000,000, its 10% Senior Unsecured
Notes of $12,825,000, the payment of the Reimbursement Obligation related to
the Dominion Terminal Associated ("DTA") bonds of $26,560,000 and other debt
payments of $3,281,000.  The Company also transferred $8,210,000 during 1994 to
a cash deposit account to collateralize the Company's outstanding surety bonds
for its workers' compensation self-insurance programs.  The Company paid
preferred stock dividends of $2,444,000 in 1994.

Consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1995 totaled $11,711,000
(including $3,213,000 at Westmoreland Resources, Inc. ("WRI")).  At December
31, 1994, cash and cash equivalents totaled $15,453,000 (including $2,445,000
at WRI).   The Company's cash and cash equivalents are not restricted as to use
or disposition.  The cash at WRI, a 60%- owned subsidiary, is available to the
Company only through dividends.  In addition, the Company had restricted cash,
which was not classified as cash or cash equivalents, of $17,960,000 and
$9,210,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.   The $17,960,000 is
comprised of two items:  a $9,960,000 interest-bearing cash deposit account,
which collateralizes the Company's outstanding surety bonds for its workers'
compensation self-insurance programs and $8,000,000 invested in certificates of
deposit which is classified as an Investment in Independent Power Projects at
December 31, 1995.  The $8,000,000 in certificates of deposit represents cash
proceeds which were transferred from debt reserve accounts of certain of the
Company's independent power projects and for which bank letters of credit were
substituted.  The cash proceeds are restricted as to use and were invested in
certificates of deposit of the bank issuing the letters of credit.  The
certificates of deposit collateralize the letters of credit.

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid quarterly from
the third quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1994.  The declaration
and payment of preferred stock dividends was suspended in the second quarter of
1994 in connection with extension agreements entered into with the Company's
principal lenders.  Upon the expiration of these





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
extension agreements, the Company paid a quarterly dividend on April 1, 1995
and July 1, 1995.  Pursuant to Delaware law, the preferred stock dividend was
suspended in the third quarter of 1995 as a result of the recognition of losses
related to the idling of the Virginia division and the resulting shareholders'
deficit.  The five quarterly dividends which are in arrears (those dividends
whose payment dates would have been July 1, 1994, October 1, 1994, January 1,
1995, October 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996) amount to $6,109,000 in the
aggregate ($10.63 per preferred share).

There are statutory restrictions limiting the payment of preferred stock
dividends under Delaware law, the state in which the Company is incorporated.
Under Delaware law, the Company is permitted to pay preferred stock dividends
only: (1) out of surplus, surplus being the amount of shareholders' equity in
excess of the par value of the Company's two classes of stock; or (2) in the
event there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which a
preferred stock dividend is declared  (and/or out of net profits for the
preceding fiscal year), but only to the extent that shareholders' equity
exceeds the par value of the preferred stock ($575,000).  The Company had a
shareholders' deficit at December 31, 1995 of $38,106,000.  The Company's Board
of Directors will continue to review the payment of quarterly preferred stock
dividends, as well as the five preferred stock dividends which are in arrears,
in light of the above restrictions and the Company's ongoing business
circumstances.

PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

On November 8, 1994, the Company filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code seeking the confirmation of a so-called "pre-packaged"
plan of reorganization (the "Plan of Reorganization").  This measure was taken
to obtain protection from the Company's principal lenders pending the closing
of the sale of the assets of Criterion which closing was also facilitated by
the filing.  The Federal Bankruptcy Court approved the Company's Plan of
Reorganization on December 16, 1994.  As provided in the Plan of
Reorganization, the Company proceeded to complete its sale of the assets of
Criterion on December 22, 1994 and paid in full its maturing debt obligations
at which time it emerged from bankruptcy.  Refer to Note 1 for additional
information concerning the Company's Plan of Reorganization.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK

The major factor impacting the Company's liquidity outlook is its significant
"heritage costs".  These heritage costs consist primarily of cash payments for
postretirement medical benefits, workers' compensation costs and UMWA pension
benefits.  The Company also is obligated for its own pension and pneumoconiosis
benefits; however, both of these future obligations enjoy a funding surplus at
present.  The Company has ongoing cash expenditures in excess of $15,000,000
per year for postretirement medical benefits which could continue over the next
approximately 45 years and approximately $6,500,000 per year for workers'
compensation benefits which will decline to zero over the next 20 years.  The
Company is required under the national contract with the UMWA to pay amounts
based on hours worked or tons processed to the UMWA Retirement Funds with
respect to unionized employees.  Since this is a multiemployer plan, under
ERISA, a contributing company is liable for its share of unfunded vested
liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the plan.  The Company's
liability for complete withdrawal is estimated to be approximately $20,000,000,
however, there has been no determination by the UMWA trustees that the Company
has incurred a partial or complete withdrawal.

The Company's current principal sources of cash flow include cash distributions
from its independent power projects, dividends from WRI and cash from
operations of DTA.  Management believes that cash generated from these sources
and cash reserves should be sufficient to pay the Company's heritage costs for
the next 12 to 18 months.  The Company hopes to improve its near-term cash
reserve position in a number of ways including  using independent contractors
to mine coal at the Virginia Division or by divesting all or part of that
Division, by selling certain other non-strategic assets and by receiving cash
from liquidation of certain assets given as collateral by Adventure Resources.
The Company also plans to seek further cost reductions wherever feasible and
prudent, and attempt to reduce or defer certain postretirement medical,
workers' compensation and related payments.  If future operations do not
generate cash as expected or the aforementioned actions are not executed in the
time frame and to the extent management anticipates, the Company could
experience liquidity problems in 1996.

Under a Federal law (the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992), the
Company is required to provide postretirement





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
medical benefits for UMWA miners by making premium payments into three benefit
plans:  (i) the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund (the "Combined Fund"), a
multiemployer plan which benefits miners who retired before January 1, 1976 or
who retired thereafter but whose last employer did not provide benefits
pursuant to an operator-specific Individual Employer Plan ("IEP"), (ii) an IEP
for miners who retired after January 1, 1976 and (iii) the 1992 UMWA Benefits
Plan, a multiemployer plan which benefits (A) miners who were eligible to
retire on February 1, 1993, who did retire on or before September 30, 1994 and
whose former employers are no longer in business, (B) miners receiving benefits
under an IEP whose former employer goes out of business and ceases to maintain
the IEP, and (C) new spouses or new dependents of retirees in the Combined Fund
who would be eligible for coverage thereunder but for the fact that the
Combined Fund closed to new beneficiaries as of July 20, 1992.  The premiums
paid by the Company cover its own retirees, its current workforce and its
allocated portion of the pool of retired miners whose previous employers have
gone out of business.

The Company met all of its premium obligations through the end of 1995, but has
not paid a premium to the Combined Fund in 1996.  The Company's current annual
premiums to the Combined Fund are approximately $5,000,000.  The Company has
made a proposal to the staff of the Combined Fund to address these late
premiums and a portion of its future premiums, and discussions are ongoing.
The Company may modify its proposal based on these discussions, but its
objective is to conserve cash for acquisitions so that it can give the Combined
Fund adequate assurance that the Company will not only be able to make up its
current premiums but be able to pay future obligations as well.  The Company
has requested the Combined Fund staff to consider the Company's proposal and
the Company's financial situation and present the proposal to the plan
trustees.  Any decision in this matter must be made by the plan trustees, who
could reject any proposal from the Company.  The trustees could initiate legal
action to recover overdue premiums.  If the Company is required to pay all
premiums on a current basis, it could experience liquidity problems if current
plans as described above do not materialize.

In addition, the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the "Act")
authorized the Trustees of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan to implement security
provisions pursuant to the Act.  In 1995, the Trustees issued security
provisions which give contributors to the Plan several options for satisfying
the Act's security





                                       6
<PAGE>   7
requirements, and set the level of security to be provided by the Company at
approximately $22,000,000.  The security under any of the options was required
to be provided by January 1, 1996; however, the Company has not yet provided
security as required under the Act.  The Company has proposed to the staff of
the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan using Company assets as collateral for its
obligation.  The 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan trustees could initiate legal action to
enforce the Company's security requirements.  Although discussions remain
ongoing, management believes the Company will be able to satisfy the security
requirements through a mutually agreeable alternative, however, there can be no
assurance the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan trustees will accept such an alternative
and will not initiate legal action to enforce its security requirements.

The Company's current sources of cash flow, as described above, will not be
sufficient by themselves to cover operating expenses and the Company's
"heritage costs" on a long-term basis.  Management of the Company believes it
can restore the Company to profitability by adopting a strategy of acquiring
income-producing businesses and properties that will generate earnings and cash
flow.  Management of the Company has devoted significant time and effort to
this strategy, with one small acquisition being completed in 1995, and the
preliminary identification of additional candidates.  The time required to
implement an acquisition strategy is impossible to estimate, and no assurances
can be given that the Company can successfully implement the strategy or
achieve long-term viability.

SUMMARY

The Company reported operating losses of $95,560,000 (excluding $9,088,000 of
gains on the sales of assets) and $15,218,000 (excluding $41,130,000 of gains
on the sales of assets) in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The most significant item affecting results of operations for 1995 was
$66,623,000 of unusual charges relating to the idling of Eastern coal
operations.  Refer to Note 4 for details related to the unusual charges.

The most significant items affecting 1994's net income were gains of
$34,142,000 on the sale of the assets of Criterion and $6,988,000 on the sale
of several inactive properties in West Virginia.  Refer to Note 3 for details
related to asset sales.

The following sections compare the results of 1995 to 1994.

VIRGINIA DIVISION

Virginia Division incurred operating losses of $93,900,000 in 1995 compared to
operating losses of $3,726,000 in 1994.

- -  The major contributor to the increased operating loss was the recognition of
charges relating to the idling of the division during the third quarter of
1995.  Included in these charges were postretirement medical costs of
$34,300,000, recognition of a potential UMWA pension withdrawal liability of
$20,000,000, writedown of fixed assets of $18,900,000, severance and early
retirement costs of $8,600,000 and other costs totaling approximately
$5,500,000.

- -  The Virginia Division recognized a $23,503,000 gain from the sale of a coal
purchase agreement, which was offset against the above mentioned charges.

- -  The Virginia Division recognized $12,890,000 of workers' compensation
expense in 1995 compared to $7,574,000 in 1994.  In 1994 the Company refined
its methodology for estimating the Company's workers' compensation liabilities
by engaging an independent actuary  and as a result accrued an additional
$3,200,000 expense in 1994 related to prior years' claims for the





                                       9

Virginia Division.  The Company will continue to utilize an actuarial analysis
in the future as it is a more reliable method of estimating this liability.

HAMPTON DIVISION

In January 1995, the Company sold the assets of the Hampton Division.  Refer to
Note 3 for details related to the asset sales.

CRITERION COAL COMPANY 

The assets of Criterion were sold in the fourth quarter of 1994.  Refer to Note
3 for details related to the asset sale.

PINE BRANCH MINING INCORPORATED ("PINE BRANCH")

Pine Branch had operating losses of $2,196,000 and $1,778,000 in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Operating losses in 1995 are largely attributable to the
recognition of certain liabilities and charges associated with the shutdown of
Pine Branch operations in the third quarter of 1995.  Included in the charges
were $1,400,000 for the write-off of fixed assets, $121,000 of medical
benefits, and $900,000 for final reclamation.

WESTMORELAND RESOURCES, INC.

WRI had operating income of  $4,640,000 and $2,592,000 in 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  The increase in earnings was due to the recognition of
additional income from the settlement of a state tax dispute wherein WRI
received a refund of $1,003,000, including interest and reversed accrued and
unpaid state income tax totaling $1,214,000.  Earnings before income taxes and
the tax settlement were comparable to 1994.  The Company received cash
dividends from WRI of $1,650,000 and $1,500,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

WESTMORELAND COAL SALES COMPANY ("WCSC")

WCSC had an operating loss of approximately $2,038,000 in 1995 and operating
income of $1,895,000 in 1994.  Included in the results for 1995 was $967,000 in
income generated from the reversal of bad debt allowances related to reserved
accounts subsequently collected.  Excluding this benefit, the decrease in
1995's operating income was primarily due to the absence of profits from export
business which was discontinued because of





                                       10
<PAGE>   11
low margins and high working capital requirements.  WCSC continues to reduce
its selling and administrative expenses as a result of the decline in coal
marketing and sales activity.

NET CORPORATE EXPENSES

Net corporate expenses decreased $7,423,000 in 1995 over 1994.  This decrease
is a result of expenses relating to the Company's bankruptcy proceedings being
recognized in 1994 and the reduced operating costs as a result of reduced
staffing and relocating the corporate offices in September 1995.  Bankruptcy
expenses in 1994 included $1,050,000 related to legal fees, $2,332,000 related
to the settlement of non-Criterion related claims and $1,000,000 accrued for
the buyout of the Philadelphia office lease, which was negotiated as part of
the bankruptcy proceedings.  Relocation of the Corporate office has provided
and will continue to provide for significant reductions in the cost of office
space.

WEST VIRGINIA - IDLED OPERATIONS

West Virginia had operating losses of $9,176,000 in 1995 and $8,657,000 in
1994.  West Virginia - Idled Operations are made up of costs (principally
postretirement medical and workers' compensation costs) associated with mining
operations in West Virginia which had been closed in prior years.

CLEANCOAL TERMINAL COMPANY

The Company sold the assets of Cleancoal Terminal Company to an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation ("CSX") in September 1995.  In
exchange for the assets of Cleancoal and payment of $2,500,000, CSX agreed to
release the Company from an $8,864,000 loan guarantee made on behalf of
Adventure Resources.  The Company was also released from related interest
payments to CSX of approximately $840,000 per year.  Cleancoal's unprofitable
operations were discontinued in January 1995 and the majority of its employees
were laid off on January 31, 1995.  The loss on the sale of the assets of
Cleancoal Terminal Company was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1994.

INDEPENDENT POWER OPERATIONS

The Company's Independent Power Operations, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
WEI, recorded operating income of $15,148,000 in 1995 and $548,000 in 1994.
WEI has interests in eight projects, of which seven were operational as of
December 31, 1994 and the eighth became operational in the second quarter of
1995.  The improvement in operating income is due to three main factors:

- -  Increased equity earnings of $4,282,000 primarily from the three projects
which became operational during 1994 and in the second quarter of 1995.

- -  The recognition in 1995 of $4,000,000 of deferred development fees received
in prior years in connection with two projects.

- -  Decreased expenses of $2,532,000 related to the amortization of an equity
support agreement for three independent power projects.  This equity support
agreement expired in October 1995.

WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E Partners (the "ROVA
Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's principal customer contracted to
purchase the electricity generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  In
the second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA Partnership's
interpretation of the provisions of the contract dealing with the payment of
the capacity purchase price when the facility experiences a forced outage day.
A forced outage day is a day when ROVA I is not able to generate a specified
level of electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the customer is
required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full capacity purchase price unless
forced outage days exceed a contractually stated annual number.  The customer
asserts that it is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1995, the customer withheld approximately $8,500,000 of
capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA Partnership because of this
dispute. The customer has withheld an additional $203,000 from the ROVA
Partnership through March 4, 1996.  On October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership
filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to
recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments may not be withheld in
the future.  On December 12, 1994 the customer filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint and on March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  The ROVA
Partnerships filed an amended complaint on April 17, 1995.  On April 27, 1995
the





                                       12
<PAGE>   13
customer filed another motion to dismiss the complaint.  On August 23, 1995,
the Court overruled the customer's motion to dismiss and set a trial date of
March 25, 1996.  The customer filed two motions for summary judgement.  The
Court denied the customer's first motion for summary judgement on January 30,
1996; however, the customer filed a second summary judgement motion on March 1,
1996.  On March 18, 1996, the Court granted the customer's second summary
judgement motion and effectively dismissed the complaint.  The ROVA Partnership
is evaluating its options, including possible appeal of the Court's decision
granting summary judgement.  The capacity purchase price withheld had been
included in the revenues and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve
was recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount withheld by the
customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share of the withheld payments in
earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1994.  In the fourth
quarter of 1994, WEIGs revenues were reduced by $2,928,000, representing its
50% share of the disputed amount. No earnings were recognized by WEI in 1995
for payments withheld by the customer relating to forced outage days.
Regardless of the outcome, the Company believes ROVA I will continue to operate
profitably and generate positive cash flows.

GAINS ON THE SALES OF ASSETS

The Company realized a gain in 1995 of $9,088,000 on the sale of the assets of
the Hampton Division.  The Company realized gains in 1994 of $34,142,000 on the
sale of the assets of Criterion and $6,988,000 on the sale of several inactive
properties in West Virginia.  Refer to Note 3 for details related to asset
sales.

OTHER

Coal revenues in 1995 decreased $258,863,000 (70%) from 1994 due principally to
the Company's decision to idle the Eastern Coal operations.

Income tax expense in 1995 and 1994 included the provision for WRI, which is
not consolidated with the Company for Federal income tax purposes, and state
taxes related to the Company's other operations.

Inflation did not have a material impact on the Company's operations in 1995
and 1994.

WEI PROJECT CONTINGENCIES

SOUTHAMPTON.  The Southampton plant, a 70 megawatt coal-fired cogeneration
facility in Franklin, Virginia, supplies process steam to a nearby chemical
manufacturer and bulk electric power under contract to Virginia Electric and
Power Company ("Virginia Power") as a qualifying facility (QF) under the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act ("PURPA").  The plant began commercial
operation in 1992.  On July 7, 1994, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC") denied the request of LG&E-Westmoreland Southampton ("the
Partnership", in which WEI has a 30% interest) for a waiver of certain QF
requirements and directed the Partnership to show cause as to why it should not
be required to file new cost- based rates for its 1992 electric sales to
Virginia Power.

The Partnership filed a request for rehearing and a motion to consider its
request for rehearing as timely filed, or in the alternative, to treat its
request for rehearing as a motion for reconsideration, in August 1994, one day
out of time.  The Partnership is seeking a reversal of FERC's prior order, or,
in the alternative, a clarification of FERC's order stating that, with the
exception of rates, the Partnership remains a QF for 1992 exempt from
regulation as a public utility under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
("PUHCA"), utility laws of Virginia and various portions of the Federal Power
Act.

In late August 1994, Virginia Power filed a motion for leave to respond to the
Partnership's request for rehearing and response to request for rehearing, and
a response to the Partnership's show cause order.  In September 1994, the
Partnership filed with FERC its answer to Virginia Power's motion and response.
Also in September 1994, FERC granted itself an extension of time to act on the
Partnership's request for rehearing, tolling the 30-day period in which FERC
was to have acted on the Partnership's rehearing request.  The parties have
fully briefed and submitted to FERC their respective motions with respect to
the request for rehearing and are awaiting FERC's decision.  As FERC had not
acted on the Partnership's request for rehearing, in December 1995, the
Partnership filed with FERC a motion to request a settlement conference.
Virginia Power subsequently filed a response in which it did not object to the
proposed settlement conference.  The parties are awaiting FERC action, but
expect a settlement proceeding to be initiated in the first half of 1996.





                                       14
<PAGE>   15
The Company believes that FERC will grant the Partnership the relief that it is
seeking and, accordingly, the ultimate resolution of the matter is not expected
to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations,
its financial condition or liquidity.  However, in light of FERC's July 7, 1994
order, and the arguable lateness of the filing of the request for rehearing one
day out of time, the Company cannot predict what action FERC ultimately will
take.  Possible consequences from an adverse decision include refunds, third
party lawsuits, and potential regulatory and other problems under PUHCA,
Virginia utility law and the Federal Power Act, the scope and amount of which
cannot be determined at this time.

ROANOKE VALLEY I.  The Company owns a 50% interest in Westmoreland-LG&E
Partners ("WLP"), the sole owner of Roanoke Valley I, a cogeneration facility
selling electric power to Virginia Power and steam energy to Patch Rubber
Company.  Under the Power Purchase Agreement ("PPA") between WLP and Virginia
Power, WLP is entitled to receive capacity payments based on availability.
From May 1994 through December 1995, Virginia Power withheld approximately
$8,500,000 of these capacity payments during periods of forced outages.  To
date, the Company has not realized any income on its 50% portion of the
capacity payments being withheld by Virginia Power.  In October 1994, WLP filed
a complaint against Virginia Power seeking damages of at least $5,700,000,
contending that Virginia Power breached the PPA in withholding such payments.
In June 1995, the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia denied
Virginia Power's motion to dismiss WLP's complaint.  In November 1995, Virginia
Power filed with the court a motion for summary judgment, and a hearing on the
motion was held in early December 1995.  In late January 1996, the court denied
Virginia Power's motion for summary judgment.  The customer filed a second
summary judgement motion on March 1, 1996.  On March 18, 1996, the Court
granted the customer's second summary judgement motion and effectively
dismissed the complaint.  The ROVA partnership is evaluating its options,
including possible appeal of the Court's decision granting summary judgement.
Regardless of the outcome, the Company believes Roanoke Valley I will operate
profitability and generate positive cash flows.

RENSSELAER.  The Company has been informed through public filings that Niagara
Mohawk Power Corporation ("NIMO")(which is the purchasing utility for the
Company's Rensselaer cogeneration facility in which the Company has a 50%
interest) believe that, absent significant relief from its power purchase
arrangements with independent power producers (including qualifying
cogenerators), it may be forced either to file voluntary bankruptcy or attempt
to condemn and purchase the





                                       15
<PAGE>   16
cogeneration facilities through eminent domain.  The Company intends to oppose
any efforts by NIMO to nullify its contract for the Rensselaer project.

SUMMARY

The Company incurred operating losses of $15,218,000 (excluding $41,130,000 of
gains on the sales of assets) and $95,230,000 (including unusual charges of
$79,250,000) in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The most significant item affecting results of operations for 1993 was
$79,250,000 of unusual charges related to the write-off of the carrying value
of certain mining operations and coal reserves along with provisions for the
termination of certain operations and personnel.  These charges resulted from
the





                                       17
<PAGE>   18
Company's continuing strategic review of its mining operations in light of
projected costs, prices and demand.  Refer to Note 4 for details related to the
unusual charges.

The most significant items affecting 1994's net income were gains of
$34,142,000 on the sale of the assets of Criterion and $6,988,000 on the sale
of several inactive properties in West Virginia.  Refer to Note 3 for details
related to asset sales.

Coal revenues in 1994 decreased $95,090,000 (20%) from 1993 due principally to
the Company's decision to withdraw from the export market ($70,150,000 decline
in revenues) and the partial shutdown of the Hampton Division in May of 1994
($18,326,000 decline in revenues).

The following sections compare the results of 1994 to 1993.

VIRGINIA DIVISION

Virginia Division incurred operating losses of $3,726,000 in 1994 compared to
operating losses of $24,309,000 in 1993.

- -  Included in 1993's results were unusual charges totalling $16,092,000.
Refer to Note 4 for further details.

- -  The Virginia Division recognized $7,574,000 of workers' compensation expense
in 1994 compared to $14,725,000 in 1993.  The amount recorded in 1993 reflects
a $9,250,000 adjustment based upon management's reassessment of the workers'
compensation liability. In 1994 the Company refined its methodology for
estimating the Company's workers' compensation liabilities by engaging an
independent actuary  and as a result accrued an additional $3,200,000 expense
in 1994 related to prior years' claims for the Virginia Division.

- -  Due to reduced production from Company mines, the Virginia Division
purchased an additional 139,000 tons from unaffiliated producers during 1994
compared to 1993.   This production shortfall added approximately $3,000,000 in
additional costs over the 1993 levels.





                                       18
<PAGE>   19
- -  Depreciation expense in 1994 decreased $2,553,000 over the 1993 amount due
to the write-down of certain plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 1993.

HAMPTON DIVISION

Hampton Division recorded operating income of $4,490,000 and operating losses
of $42,238,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

- -  Hampton's results improved due to the elimination of losses related to that
portion of the Hampton Division that was closed in the second quarter of 1994.
Reserves for these operating losses and shutdown costs were accrued in the
fourth quarter of 1993.  The operating profit in 1994 relates to a large
surface mine which was operated by a contractor on the Hampton property and a
$2,100,000 reversal of a workers' compensation liability recorded in December
1993 in connection with the anticipated Hampton shutdown.

- -  The Hampton Division incurred unusual charges in 1993 totalling $43,158,000
related to the planned discontinuation of most of the Hampton Division's
operations in the second quarter of 1994.  This action was necessitated by the
loss of an above-market coal supply contract in December 1993.  Based on market
conditions and cost structures, it was unlikely that there were operational
scenarios which would have resulted in future positive cash flow had the
Company continued to operate the deep mine, the preparation plant and the
support facilities.  The other major above-market coal supply contract
associated with the Hampton Division continued to be supplied by the production
from a contractor-operated surface mine on the property.  The components of the
shutdown costs were $8,247,000 for fixed asset writedowns, $25,653,000 related
to the accrual of postretirement medical liabilities, $3,900,000 in termination
costs for approximately 130 employees, $1,800,000 for reclamation and
$3,558,000 for anticipated operating losses and other shutdown reserves.

CRITERION COAL COMPANY

Criterion recorded operating income of $8,094,000 and $10,289,000 in 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Criterion's operating income in the second half of 1994
was hampered by a deterioration in geological conditions at certain mines.





                                       19

PINE BRANCH MINING INCORPORATED ("PINE BRANCH")

Pine Branch had operating losses of $1,778,000 and  $1,356,000 in 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Pine Branch experienced unusually severe weather
conditions in the first quarter of 1994 adversely impacting production and
operating costs which led to an operating loss for the first quarter of 1994 of
$1,180,000.  Productivity increased during the second half of 1994 as a result
of a new operating plan.

WESTMORELAND RESOURCES, INC.

WRI had operating income of  $2,592,000 and $3,152,000 in 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The decrease in earnings was due to lower "take or pay" payments
received in 1994 compared to 1993 from contracts whose terms have since ended
and increased legal costs of $390,000 in 1994 related to a dispute with the
Crow Indian Tribe.  Also, the price received from WRI's second largest customer
was reduced as part of the renegotiation of its contract.  This deterioration
was partially offset by earnings on higher levels of shipments in 1994.  The
Company received cash dividends from WRI of $1,500,000 and $540,000 in 1994 and
1993, respectively.

WESTMORELAND COAL SALES COMPANY ("WCSC")

WCSC had operating income of approximately $1,900,000 in both 1994 and 1993.
Included in the 1994 results was $2,833,000 in income generated from the
reversal of bad debt allowances related to a contract assigned to CONSOL of
Kentucky, Inc. ("CONSOL").   Excluding this benefit, the decrease in 1994's
operating income was primarily due to the absence of profits from sales to the
export market and the related brokering business.  WCSC reduced its selling and
administrative expenses by $1,000,000 in 1994.

NET CORPORATE EXPENSES

Net corporate expenses increased $3,685,000 in 1994 over 1993.  The increase
was due to $4,382,000 of expenses related to the Company's bankruptcy
proceedings.  $1,050,000 of the bankruptcy cost was related to legal fees,
$2,332,000 was related to the settlement of non-Criterion related claims and
$1,000,000 was accrued for the buyout of the Company's building lease in
Philadelphia under a settlement negotiated during the bankruptcy proceedings.
The Company moved to less costly office facilities





                                       20
<PAGE>   21
during 1995.  The Company also experienced higher legal costs prior to the
bankruptcy proceedings, primarily related to debt restructuring negotiations.
Other corporate expenses were reduced in 1994 as a result of the August 1993
workforce reduction.

WEST VIRGINIA - IDLED OPERATIONS

The Company had operating losses of $8,657,000 in 1994 and $29,779,000
(including $20,000,000 of unusual charges) in 1993. The unusual charges in 1993
represented the write-off of the partially developed Triangle Mine Complex
("Triangle"). Excluding the unusual charges in 1993, West Virginia - Idled
Operations are made up of costs (principally postretirement medical and
workers' compensation costs) associated with mining operations in West Virginia
which had been closed in prior years.

CLEANCOAL TERMINAL COMPANY

The Company announced, during the fourth quarter of 1994, that it had reached
agreement with an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation  ("CSX")
to release the Company from an $8,864,000 loan guarantee reflected in Long-Term
Debt in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet in exchange for the transfer
of the assets of Cleancoal and the payment of $2,500,000 to CSX.  The Company
was also released from related interest payments to CSX of approximately
$70,000 per month.  The transaction was completed in 1995.  The loss of
$1,882,000 related to this transaction was recognized in 1994.  The Cleancoal
terminal was shut down in January 1995 and the majority of its employees were
laid off on January 31, 1995.

Cleancoal incurred operating losses in 1994 of $3,446,000, including the
anticipated loss of $1,882,000 on the pending sale of its assets, and $126,000
in 1993.  Cleancoal has an annual transloading capacity of 6,000,000 tons.  In
a highly competitive market, Cleancoal transloaded 1,304,000 tons and 2,511,000
tons  in 1994 and 1993.

INDEPENDENT POWER OPERATIONS

The Company's Independent Power Operations, through its wholly-owned subsidiary
WEI, recorded operating income of $548,000 in 1994 and incurred operating
losses of $1,195,000 in 1993.    WEI has interests in eight projects, of which
seven were operational as of December 31, 1994 and the eighth became
operational in the second quarter of 1995.

WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E Partners (the "ROVA
Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's principal customer contracted to
purchase the electricity generated by ROVA I under a long-term contract.  In
the second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA Partnership's
interpretation of the provisions of the contract dealing with the payment of
the capacity purchase price when the facility experiences a forced outage day.
A forced outage day is a day when ROVA I is not able to generate a specified
level of electrical output.  The ROVA Partnership believes that the customer is
required to pay the ROVA Partnership the full capacity purchase price unless
forced outage days exceed a contractually stated annual number.  The customer
asserts that it is not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1994, the customer withheld approximately $5,856,000 of
capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA Partnership because of this
dispute.  On October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership filed a complaint in the
Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to recover these amounts and to
confirm that such payments may not be withheld in the future.  The capacity
purchase price withheld had been included in the revenues and earnings of the
ROVA Partnership until a reserve was recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the
full amount withheld by the customer.  WEI had recognized its 50% share of the
withheld payments in earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1994.
In the fourth quarter of 1994, WEIGs revenues were reduced by $2,928,000,
representing its 50% share of the disputed amount.  No earnings are being
recognized by WEI for payments withheld by the customer relating to forced
outage days.

GAINS ON THE SALES OF ASSETS

The Company realized gains in 1994 of $34,142,000 on the sale of the assets of
Criterion and $6,988,000 on the sale of several inactive properties in West
Virginia.  The Company realized a





                                       22
<PAGE>   23
$2,000,000 gain in 1993 from the sale of a portion of its interest in the Ft.
Lupton independent power project.  Refer to Note 3 for details related to asset
sales.

OTHER

Income tax expense in 1994 and 1993 included the provision for WRI, which is
not consolidated with the Company for Federal income tax purposes, and state
taxes related to the Company's other operations.  Also included in 1993 was a
$683,000 benefit related to the settlement of a state income tax dispute.

Inflation did not have a material impact on the Company's operations in 1994 or
1993.

  (1)    In 1995, 1994, and 1993, the Company significantly reduced the level
         of activity related to selling coal in the export market and coal
         sourced from unaffiliated producers thus reducing revenues and costs
         and expenses.  Coal revenues include the revenues of Cleancoal
         Terminal Company.

 (2)     In 1992, the Company established a provision for doubtful accounts
         totalling $29,055,000; $20,489,000 was related to loans and a
         guarantee obligation on behalf of Adventure, a coal supplier that
         filed for bankruptcy, and $7,747,000 was established for potentially
         uncollectible trade receivables.  In 1994 the Company reversed
         $2,833,000 of the trade receivable reserve into income.

 (3)     In 1995 and 1993, the Company recorded a loss on idling of   Eastern
         operations and unusual charges, respectively, related to the write-off
         of the carrying value of certain mining operations and coal reserves
         along with provisions for the termination of certain coal operations
         and personnel.  Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
         Statements for further details.

 (4)     In 1995, the Company recognized a $9,088,000 gain on the sale of the
         assets of the Hampton Division.  In 1994, the Company recognized a
         $34,142,000 gain on the sale of the assets of Criterion to Consol and
         a gain of $6,988,000 on the sale of several inactive properties in
         West Virginia.  Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
         Statements for further details on the sales of assets.

 (5)     Reflects the 40% interest in Westmoreland Resources, Inc. not owned by
         the Company.

 (6)     On July 1, 1992, the Company issued 575,000 shares of Preferred Stock
         previously authorized.  Two quarterly dividends at (8.5% per annum)
         were declared in 1992, four quarterly dividends were declared in 1993,
         one quarterly dividend was declared in 1994 and two quarterly
         dividends were declared in 1995.  As of December 31, 1995, there were
         five cumulative undeclared quarterly preferred stock dividends in
         arrears.  Cumulative undeclared preferred dividends are deducted from
         net income (loss) in determining net income (loss) applicable to
         common shareholders.  Refer

         to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
         information on the Company's Capital Stock.

 (7)     In July 1, 1992, the Company purchased 1,295,589 of its own shares
         from Penn Virginia and in December 1992 retired the shares.

 (8)     The decrease in working capital from 1994 to 1995 resulted from
         charges incurred when the Company idled Virginia operations in the
         third quarter of 1995.  The increase in working capital from 1993 to
         1994 resulted from the Company's sale of the assets of Criterion and
         the subsequent repayment of the majority of its debt obligations, then
         classified as current liabilities.  The decrease in working capital
         from 1992 to 1993 resulted from the reclassification of long-term debt
         to current, the adoption of SFAS 106 and the accruals for mine closure
         costs, all in 1993.

 (9)     Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
         information regarding the Company's debt structure.

Westmoreland Coal Company and Subsidiaries

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSOLIDATION POLICY

The Consolidated financial statements of Westmoreland Coal Company (the
"Company") include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.  The
Company uses the equity method of accounting for companies where its ownership
is between 20% and 50% and for partnerships and joint ventures in which less
than a controlling interest is held.

USE OF ESTIMATES

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities in order to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Actual
results will likely differ from those estimates.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All such
instruments are carried at cost.  Cash equivalents consists of Eurodollar time
deposits, money market funds and bank repurchase agreements.

INVENTORY VALUATION

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost and include expenditures for
new facilities and those expenditures that substantially increase the
productive lives of existing plant and equipment.  Development costs of mines
in the pre-operating stage are capitalized until commercial operations
commence.  Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.  Mineral
rights are depleted based upon estimated recoverable reserves.  Plant and
equipment are depreciated straight-line over the assets' estimated useful
lives, ranging from 3 to 40 years.  The Company assesses the carrying value of





                                       33
<PAGE>   34
its property, plant and equipment for impairment by comparing estimated
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from such assets with their
net book value.  If net book value exceeds estimated cash flows, the asset is
written down to fair value.  When an asset is retired or sold, its cost and
related accumulated depreciation and depletion are removed from the accounts.
The difference between unamortized cost and proceeds on disposition is recorded
as a gain or loss.  Fully depreciated plant and equipment still in use are not
eliminated from the accounts.

INDEPENDENT POWER DEVELOPMENT

Costs incurred during the development process of independent power projects are
expensed in the period incurred until certain events, including the execution
of certain contracts, which are critical to a project's construction and
operation, have occured.  After these events have taken place, all subsequent
costs are capitalized.  At the time when non-recourse bank financing has been
obtained, costs previously expensed by the Company, to the extent reimbursed,
are reported as development fee income.  All other income generated in
connection with a project's development is deferred until the project achieves
commercial operation, the required equity funding commitment is made, and the
conversion of the loan from a construction loan to a term loan is completed.

WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND PNEUMOCONIOSIS BENEFIT LIABILITIES

The Company is self-insured for workers' compensation claims and federal and
state pneumoconiosis benefits for current and former employees.

The liability for workers' compensation claims is an actuarially determined
estimate of the ultimate losses incurred on such claims based on the Company's
experience, and includes a provision for incurred but not reported losses.
Adjustments to the probable ultimate liability are made continually based on
subsequent developments and experience and are included in operations as
incurred.

The Company accrues for the projected costs of pneumoconiosis benefits, on an
actuarial basis, over the service period of its mining employees.  An
independent trust has been established to fund these benefits.





                                       34
<PAGE>   35
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

The Company accounts for health care and life insurance benefits provided to
certain retired employees and their dependents by accruing the cost of such
benefits over the service lives of employees.  The Company is amortizing its
transition obligation, for past service costs relating to these benefits, over
twenty years.  For union employees who retired prior to 1976, the Company
provides similar medical and life insurance benefits by making payments to a
multiemployer union trust fund.  The Company expenses such payments when made.

COAL REVENUES

The Company recognizes coal sales revenue at the time title passes to the
customer.  The Company also records as revenue amounts received from coal
related activities, such as proceeds from coal contract buy-outs and coal
option payments.  Coal revenues include the sale of mined coal and sales of
coal produced by unaffiliated mining companies where the Company is a sales
agent or broker.  The Company recognizes revenue of the coal sold for
unaffiliated companies since the Company assumes the credit risk for the sale,
performs other services such as invoicing, quality control and shipment
monitoring, and in most cases takes title to the coal.  Coal revenues
pertaining to coal sold for other companies amounted to $5,959,000,
$83,196,000, $157,788,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

RECLAMATION

Reclamation costs at active sites are accrued over the expected mine life using
the units of production method based on recoverable reserves and environmental
and regulatory requirements.  If a mine shuts down prior to the expected mine
life, the Company accrues the remaining reclamation obligation at the time of
shutdown.  Estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments are made in
accruals to provide for expected future costs.

INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability
method.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Company's
financial statements based on the difference between the financial statement
carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax
rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.





                                       35
<PAGE>   36
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Declared and undeclared cumulative preferred dividends are deducted from net
income in determining net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders.

Net income (loss) per share applicable to common shareholders is computed by
dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during the year.  Common stock equivalents are not included in the
calculation when they would have an anti-dilutive effect on income (loss) per
share.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Company is engaged in the production and sale of coal and owns interests in
cogeneration and other non-regulated independent power plants, principally
within the United States.

The Company incurred a net loss of $86,386,000 and significantly curtailed its
coal mining operations during 1995, and as of December 31, 1995 has a working
capital and shareholders' deficit of $16,111,000 and $38,106,000, respectively.
Management believes, based on its current plans and certain actions taken
subsequent to December 31, 1995, the Company can meet its cash requirements
throughout 1996.  In order to improve the Company's liquidity, management may
re-commence mining, on a contract basis, at its Virginia Division, sell certain
assets, and reduce or defer certain postretirement medical, workers'
compensation and related payments due in 1996.  If these actions are not
implemented in the time frame and to the extent management contemplates, the
Company could experience liquidity problems during 1996.  The Company's long
term viability is ultimately dependent on acquiring or developing additional
profitable operations.

The Company and several of its subsidiaries filed petitions under Chapter 11 of
the Federal Bankruptcy Code on November 8, 1994 seeking the confirmation of a
so-called "prepackaged" plan of reorganization (the "Plan of Reorganization").

The Plan of Reorganization was premised on consummating the sale of certain
assets in order to realize sufficient funds to satisfy $39,250,000 of the
Company's debt obligations which matured on November 8, 1994 and to satisfy
$23,178,000 of equity funding commitments of Westmoreland Energy, Inc.("WEI")
which were due December 30, 1994.

The Company proceeded to complete the sale of certain assets on December 22,
1994 and paid in full its maturing debt obligations of $39,250,000, at which
time it emerged from bankruptcy.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

The Corona Group

On October 31, 1995, WEI, through its newly formed subsidiary,
Westmoreland-Corona, Inc., completed the purchase of The Corona Group Inc.
("Corona").  Corona and its subsidiaries offer technical services and repair
and maintenance services to the power generating industry, including utilities,
cogeneration facilities and independent power producers.

Corona was acquired for $2,771,000 in cash plus the assumption of $2,042,000 in
notes payable and other liabilities, in exchange for 100% of Corona's stock.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method.  The transaction
resulted in goodwill of $790,000 which is being amortized straight-line over a
period of fifteen years.  The Company's 1995 financial statements include
results of operations from Corona for the period from November 1, 1995 to
December 31, 1995.

3.   DISPOSITIONS

Cleancoal Terminal Company

In September 1995, the Company completed the sale of Cleancoal Terminal Company
("Cleancoal").  In exchange for the assets of the unprofitable Cleancoal
operations and a cash payment of $2,500,000, the Company was released from its
$8,864,000 loan guarantee obligation on behalf of Adventure Resources to the
purchaser, as well as the guarantee of related interest payments of
approximately $70,000 per month.  In anticipation of the pending sale, the
Company had recognized a loss of $1,882,000 in the fourth quarter of 1994,
closed Cleancoal in January 1995 and laid off the majority of the Cleancoal
employees on January 31, 1995.

Hampton Division

In January 1995, the Company sold the assets of its Hampton Division to an
unrelated party and sold the Hampton Division mineral lease to the lessor for
$9,045,000.  The net proceeds to the Company, after the buy out of a related
capital lease, were approximately $7,376,000.  The Company recorded a gain on
the disposal of $9,088,000 in 1995, after the reversal of certain liabilities,
including the reclamation and environmental liabilities associated with the
Hampton Division





                                       38
<PAGE>   39
which were assumed by the purchasers in the transaction.  See Note 4 for
information relating to the shutdown of the Hampton Division.

The revenues, costs and earnings of the Hampton Division for 1994 and 1993 are
summarized below:

</TABLE>

Criterion

In the fourth quarter 1994, the Company sold the assets of its subsidiary
Criterion for cash proceeds of $74,375,000 (net of related cash expenses of
$4,165,000) and realized a gain on the transaction of $34,142,000.

West Virginia - Idled Operations

In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold several inactive properties in
the West Virginia Division for cash proceeds of $3,800,000 and the transfer of
reclamation liabilities related to the purchase, resulting in a gain of
$6,988,000.  These properties had not been in operation since the mid-1980's.

4. UNUSUAL CHARGES

Virginia Division

In the third quarter of 1995, the Company incurred $66,600,000   in unusual
charges associated with the cessation of mining activities at the Pine Branch
and the Virginia Division properties.  Included in these charges were a
postretirement benefit cost curtailment charge of $34,285,000, a potential UMWA
pension withdrawal liability of $19,800,000, an impairment of fixed assets of
$18,900,000, severance and early retirement costs of $8,600,000 and other costs
totalling approximately $5,500,000.  These charges were partially offset by a
$23,500,000 gain realized from the settlement of a coal purchase agreement with
the Virginia Division's major coal customer.





                                       39
<PAGE>   40
Idling of the Virginia Division resulted in the termination of 706 employees.
There are 44 employees remaining that are currently involved in maintaining the
properties on a standby status.  Of those who were terminated, 600 were UMWA
employees involved in all aspects of mining operations.  The remaining 106
employees were salaried and supervisory personnel.

In addition, the Virginia Division recorded $16,092,000 in unusual charges in
1993 related to the closure of the Wentz mine and preparation plant complex, a
write-off of an undeveloped block of reserves, and a write-off related to
certain other assets.

Hampton Division

In 1994, the Company reversed $2,100,000 of the reserves established in 1993
for workers' compensation liabilities based upon the results of an actuarial
analysis.

In 1993, the Company recorded unusual charges of $43,158,000 related to the
anticipated shutdown of the majority of the Hampton Division operations in the
second quarter of 1994.  These charges include a write-down of the fixed
assets, an accrual related to the postretirement medical liabilities,
termination costs, a reclamation accrual, and other shutdown reserves.  The
Company calculated and recorded these charges in 1993 anticipating termination
of approximately 130 employees.  There were 127 employees of the Hampton
Division who were terminated when the shutdown occured in 1994.

West Virginia

In 1993, the Company recorded $20,000,000 in unusual charges for the write-off
of a partially developed property which was subsequently sold in 1994.  All
reclamation and environmental liabilities were transferred as part of the sales
transaction.

WEI performs project development and venture and asset management services for
the partnerships and has recognized related revenues and income of $454,000,
$712,000 and $363,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  These management fees are recorded as revenues when the service
is performed.  WEI receives development fees from certain projects.
Recognition of these fees as income is deferred until the related project
achieves commercial operation, the required equity funding commitment is made
and the conversion of the loan from a construction loan to a term loan is
completed.  WEI had no deferred fees at the end of 1995 and deferred fees of
$4,000,000 at December 31, 1994. Deferred fees of $4,000,000 were recognized in
1995.   No deferred fees were recognized in 1994 or 1993.

Equity Support Agreement

On April 15, 1993, the Company entered into an equity support agreement with
LG&E Power Inc. ("LG&E") whereby WEI's equity funding commitments of the ROVA
I, Rensselaer and ROVA II projects were guaranteed by LG&E.  As consideration
for these guarantees, the Company had pledged its interest in all three of
these projects as security to LG&E.  WEI's ownership interest in the
Rensselaer, ROVA I and ROVA II projects continued to be pledged to LG&E until
the ROVA II project equity funding commitments was satisfied.  That funding
commitment, in the amount of $4,600,000, was made in October 1995, thus ending
the equity support agreement.  The Company paid fees of 1.25 percent per annum
on the aggregate amount of the guarantees and a fee of $4,750,000.  These fees
were being amortized through the required





                                       43
<PAGE>   44
equity funding dates of the respective projects.  Such amortization expense was
$425,000 in 1995, $2,957,000 in 1994, and $2,459,000 in 1993.

Recent Developments Relating to Independent Power Projects

Southampton Project  WEI owns a 30% general partnership interest in
LG&E-Westmoreland Southampton ("Southampton Partnership"), which owns the
Southampton Project.  The Southampton Project, which was engaged in start-up
and testing operations from September 1991 through March 1992, failed to meet
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") operating standards for a
qualifying facility ("QF") in 1992.  The failure was due to three factors: (i)
the facility was not dispatched by its power customer, Virginia Electric and
Power Company ("Virginia Power"), on a baseload schedule as anticipated, (ii)
the facility was engaged in start-up and testing operations during a portion of
that year, and (iii) the facility operator mistakenly delivered non-sequential
steam to the host over a significant period of time.  On February 23, 1994, the
Southampton Partnership filed a request with the FERC for a waiver of the
FERC's QF operating standard for 1992.  Virginia Power intervened in the FERC
proceeding, opposed the granting of a waiver, and alleged that its power
contract with the Southampton Partnership had been breached due to the failure
of the facility to maintain QF status in 1992.

On July 7, 1994, the FERC issued an order (1) denying the application of the
Southampton Partnership for a waiver of the FERC's QF operating standard in
1992 with respect to the Southampton Project and (2) directing the Southampton
Partnership to show cause why it should not be required to file rate schedules
with the FERC governing its 1992 electricity sales for resale to Virginia
Power.  In 1994 the Southampton Project established a reserve for the
anticipated refund obligations relating to this issue. On August 9, 1994, the
Southampton Partnership filed a request for rehearing of FERC's order or,
alternatively, a motion for reconsideration.  If the FERC were to deny the
requested waiver on rehearing and to determine that the Southampton Partnership
had been a "public utility" in 1992, then the Southampton Partnership's 1992
actions could be subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act and state
laws and regulations; two other cogeneration projects in which the Company
holds ownership interests could also be subject to such regulation; the Company
and certain of its subsidiaries could





                                       44
<PAGE>   45
become subject to regulation for 1992 under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act; and defaults might be created under certain existing agreements.  No
assurance can be provided as to the timing of the FERC's decision or the
outcome.  The Company believes that a denial by FERC of a waiver for the
Southampton facility would not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, operations or liquidity of the Company.

ROVA I Project - WEI owns a 50% partnership interest in Westmoreland-LG&E
Partners (the "ROVA Partnership").  The ROVA Partnership's principal customer
contracted to purchase the electricity generated by ROVA I under a long-term
contract.  In the second quarter of 1994, that customer disputed the ROVA
Partnership's interpretation of the provisions of the contract dealing with the
payment of the capacity purchase price when the facility experiences a forced
outage day.  A forced outage day is a day when ROVA I experiences an
interruption in the facility's ability  to generate electrical output.  The
ROVA Partnership believes that the customer is required to pay the ROVA
Partnership the full capacity purchase price unless forced outage days exceed a
contractually stated allowed annual number.  The customer asserts that it is
not required to do so.

Through December 31, 1995, the customer withheld approximately $8,500,000 of
capacity purchase price payments to the ROVA Partnership because of this
dispute. The customer has withheld an additional $203,000 from the ROVA
Partnership through March 4, 1996.  On October 31, 1994, the ROVA Partnership
filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia to
recover these amounts and to confirm that such payments may not be withheld in
the future.  On December 12, 1994 the customer filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint and on March 17, 1995 the Court granted this motion.  The ROVA
Partnership filed an amended complaint on April 17, 1995.  On April 27, 1995
the customer filed another motion to dismiss the complaint.  On August 23, 1995
the Court denied the customer's motion to dismiss and set a trial date of March
25, 1996.  The customer filed two motions for a summary judgement.  The court
denied the customer's first motion for summary judgement on January 30, 1996;
however, the customer filed a second summary judgement motion on March 1, 1996.
On March 18, 1996 the Court granted the customer's second summary judgement
motion and effectively dismissed the complaint.  The ROVA Partnership is
evaluating its options, including possible appeal of the Court's decision
granting summary judgement.  The capacity purchase price withheld had been
included in the revenues and earnings of the ROVA Partnership until a reserve
was recorded as of December 31, 1994 for the full amount withheld by the
customer.  WEI





                                       45
<PAGE>   46
had recognized its 50% share of the withheld payments in earnings in the
second, third and fourth quarters of 1994.  In the fourth quarter of 1994,
WEIGs revenues were reduced by $2,928,000, representing its 50% share of the
disputed amount. No earnings were recognized by WEI in 1995 for payments
withheld by the customer relating to forced outage days.


6.  WESTMORELAND TERMINAL COMPANY

Westmoreland Terminal Company ("WTC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, has a 20% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates ("DTA"), a
partnership formed for the construction and operation of a coal-storage and
vessel-loading facility in Newport News, Virginia.  DTA's annual throughput
capacity is 22 million tons, and its ground storage capacity is 1.7 million
tons.

The Company currently leases the terminal's ground storage space and
vessel-loading facilities to certain unaffiliated parties.  Historically, the
Company utilized the terminal for most of its coal exporting business.  In
1994, the Company discontinued export sales.

WTC and the Company have a joint and several obligation for interest and
principal obligations with respect to its share of certain DTA bonds
($26,560,000 principal balance at December 31, 1995 and 1994).  These
obligations were supported by a letter of credit on which the Company was the
ultimate obligor.

In 1994, the Company was in violation of certain covenant requirements in
connection with the DTA letter of credit.  As a result, on June 9, 1994 the DTA
letter of credit was drawn.    The proceeds of the draw were used to purchase
$26,560,000 (par value) of DTA bonds.  The Company repaid the amounts drawn
under the DTA letter of credit on December 22, 1994.  The $26,560,000 of DTA
bonds are now owned by WTC and have been accounted for as an increase in the
investment in DTA.

8. WORKERS' COMPENSATION BENEFITS

The Company was self-insured for workers' compensation benefits through
December 31, 1995. The amounts charged to expense for workers' compensation
were $12,890,000, $5,108,000 and $17,204,000 for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The cash payments for workers' compensation were $6,505,000,
$6,266,000 and $6,193,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.





                                       49
<PAGE>   50
The Company is required to obtain surety bonds in connection with its
self-insured workers' compensation plan.  The Company's surety bond underwriter
requires cash collateral for such bonding.  As of December 31, 1995, $9,960,000
was deposited in the cash collateral account which is classified in Other
Assets (long-term) in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Beginning in
1996 the Company is covered by insurance for new workers' compensation claims
and is no longer self-insured.

9. PNEUMOCONIOSIS BENEFITS

The Company is  self-insured for Federal and state pneumoconiosis benefits.
Some years ago the Company created a trust with an independent trustee to fund
payment of these benefits and uses an actuarial method of providing for the
cost of projected benefits to current and former employees based on existing
and estimated future claims.  The discount rates used for 1995 and 1994 were
7.0% and 7.5%, respectively.

The following table sets forth the plan's status:

Based on actuarial data, the Company credited to earnings $1,133,000,
$2,471,000 and $2,047,000, in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, representing
primarily the amortization of the unrecognized net gain.

10. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS

Single-Employer Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries provide certain health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees and their dependents.  Substantially all of the
Company's current employees (unionized and non-unionized) may become eligible
for these benefits if certain age and service requirements are met at the time
of termination or retirement as specified in the plan agreement.  These
benefits are provided through self-insured programs.

In 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106").  Under this standard the cost of
postretirement benefits other than pensions must be recognized on an accrual
basis as employees perform services rather than the "pay-as-you-go" basis.

The Company adopted SFAS 106 effective January 1, 1993 and elected to amortize
its unrecognized, unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation over a
20-year period.  The Company expensed $15,259,000, $16,726,000, and $18,138,000
for SFAS 106 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  This accounting standard
does not change the cash requirements for funding these benefits.  Cash
payments for medical and life insurance benefits were $9,722,000, $7,775,000
and $7,604,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

During 1995, as a result of the events described in Note 4, the number of
employees and employees accumulating benefits under the plan, has been reduced
significantly.  The impact of these events has been accounted for as a plan
curtailment, and accordingly, the Company recognized a loss of $34,285,000
which has been included as a component of unusual charges.

</TABLE>

The health care cost trend rate assumed ranges from 7.5% in 1996 to 5% by the
year 2001.  Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one
percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995 by $17,700,000 and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit
cost for 1995 by $1,200,000.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
was 7.0% and 8.50% at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost are as follows:

Multiemployer Plans

The Company makes payments into the UMWA Benefit Trust Funds (the "Funds"),
which are multiemployer health plans neither controlled nor administered by the
Company.  These Funds are designed to pay benefits to the Company's UMWA
employees who retired prior to





                                       52
<PAGE>   53
1976 and to the Company's pro-rata assigned share of UMWA retirees whose
companies are no longer in business.  Prior to February 1993, the amount paid
by the Company was based on hours worked or tons processed (depending on the
source of the coal) in accordance with the National Contract with the UMWA.
Beginning February 1993 the Company is required by the Coal Industry Retiree
Health Benefit Act of 1992 to make monthly premium payments into the Funds.
These payments are based on the number of beneficiaries assigned to the
Company.  The net present value of the Company's future cash payments is
estimated to be $53,918,000.  The amounts of the cash payments into the Funds
were $5,368,000, $6,072,000 and $3,827,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  Included in the 1995 amount were cash payments of $570,000 that
were charged against an accrual established in 1993 for the Hampton Division
shutdown.  Excluding the Hampton shutdown accrual the amounts expensed by the
Company amounted to $4,798,000, $4,327,000, and $4,937,000 in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.  Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding the
Hampton shutdown.

In addition, employees terminated due to layoffs may be eligible for health
care, life insurance and certain other benefits for a period of up to 24
months.  The Company charges against earnings an estimate of all these future
costs associated with such employees in the month of layoff.

11. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries have a non-contributory defined benefit
pension plan covering non-union employees.  Benefits are based on years of
service and the employee's average annual compensation for the highest five
continuous years of employment as specified in the plan agreement.  The
Company's funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount
prescribed, as specified by applicable regulations.  Prior service costs and
actuarial gains are amortized over plan participants' expected future service
using the straight-line method.  The transition asset is amortized over twenty
years with seventeen years remaining.  Pension income amounted to $2,439,000,
$1,862,000, and $1,682,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Projected benefits have been discounted using a rate of 7.0% and 7.25% at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The rate of increase in future
compensation levels for the plan were 5.0% and 5.5% at December 31, 1995 and
1994, respectively.  The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9.0%
for 1995 and 1994.

During 1995, as a result of the events described in Note 4, the number of
employees, and employees accumulating benefits under the plan, has been
significantly reduced.  The impact of these events has been accounted for as a
plan curtailment.

Effective January 1, 1992 the Company adopted the Westmoreland Coal Company
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP").  The SERP is an unfunded
non-qualified deferred compensation plan which provides benefits to certain
employees that are not eligible under the Company's defined benefit pension
plan due to maximum limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act ("ERISA") and the Internal Revenue Code.  SERP expense amounted to
$225,000, $232,000, and $199,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993 respectively.

The following table sets forth the plan's funded status and amounts recognized
in the Company's financial statements.

Projected benefits have been discounted using a rate of 7.0% and 8.5% at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The rate of increase in future
compensation levels for the plan was 5.0% for 1995 and 1994.

The Company is required under the national contract with the United Mine
Workers' of America (the "UMWA") to pay amounts based on hours worked or tons
processed (depending on the source of the coal) to the UMWA Retirement Funds
with respect to unionized employees.  These multiemployer pension plans are not
controlled or administered by the Company.  The amounts charged to expense,
including payments made by the Company on behalf of certain contract miners,
were $19,800,000, $1,021,000 and $1,190,000 for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The amount charged in 1995 to expense
includes the estimated liability the Company would incur upon withdrawal from
the plan.  Under ERISA, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment
Act of 1980, a company contributing to a multiemployer plan is liable for its
share of unfunded vested liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the
plan.  There has been no determination by the UMWA trustees that the Company
has incurred a partial or complete withdrawal.

The Board of Directors approved the establishment of a voluntary Early
Retirement Incentive Program (the "Program") during the first quarter of 1995.
The program was implemented in 1995 during the third quarter and is
substantially completed.  Senior Management and employees of WEI are not
eligible to participate in this program.  Participating employees who receive
benefits under the Program are not eligible for benefits under the severance
policies of the Company or its subsidiaries.  Under ERISA, pension assets are
only available to plan participants.  The Company recorded a charge of
$9,069,000 for benefits paid to employees participating in the program in 1995.

12. INCOME TAXES (BENEFIT)

The Company's ownership percentage in WRI is below the 80% threshold required
for including WRI in the Company's consolidated income tax return.
Accordingly, WRI must file stand-alone tax returns and the Company is not able
to offset WRI's income with the Company's net operating loss carryforwards.

Income tax expense attributable to income (loss) before income taxes and
minority interest consists of:

In July 1992, the Company sold 2,300,000 Depository Shares, each representing
one quarter of a share of Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock
(the "Preferred Stock") for a total public offering price of $57,500,000.  Net
proceeds to the Company were $54,528,000.  As a result, 575,000 shares of
Preferred Stock are outstanding.  The Preferred Stock has a liquidation
preference equivalent to $25 per depository share and dividends accumulate on
the Preferred Stock at 8.5% per annum, equivalent to $2.125 per year per
depository share.  There are no mandatory sinking fund requirements on the
Preferred Stock.

The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder at any time,
unless previously redeemed, into shares of Common Stock of the Company at a
rate equivalent to 1.708 shares of Common Stock for each Depository Share.  The
Preferred Stock and the Depository Shares representing such stock are not
redeemable prior to July 1, 1996.  The Preferred Stock is redeemable thereafter
at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, from time to time, initially
at an amount equivalent to $26.28 per Depository Share, if redeemed during the
twelve month period





                                       59

beginning July 1, 1996, and thereafter at prices declining annually to an
amount equivalent to $25 per Depository Share on and after July 1, 2002, plus,
in each case, an amount equal to the sum of all accrued and unpaid dividends.

The Preferred Stock may be exchanged at the option of the Company, as a whole
only, on any dividend payment date commencing July 1, 1996, for 8.5%
Convertible Subordinated Exchange Debentures due July 1, 2012 (the "Exchange
Debenture") in a principal amount equal to $100 per share of Preferred Stock.
The Exchange Debenture, if issued, will be convertible at the option of the
holder at any time, unless previously redeemed, into shares of Common Stock at
the then applicable conversion rate for the Preferred Stock.

Penn Virginia's voting interest in the Company was 18.95% at December 31, 1995,
and 1994 and 18.96% at December 31, 1993.

On January 28, 1993 the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the "Plan")
and declared a distribution under the Plan of one Preferred Stock Purchase
Right ("Right") for each outstanding share of the Company's Common Stock.  In
the event that any person or group acquires a 20% or greater position in the
Company, each holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group) will
be entitled to purchase one one-hundredth of one share of Westmoreland Series B
Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a per share purchase price of $30, or,
in lieu of the Preferred Stock, the number of shares of the Company's Common
Stock having a market value at that time of $60.  If the Company is acquired in
a merger or other business combination transaction, each holder of a Right
(other than the acquiring person or group) will be entitled to purchase a
number of shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a market value
at that time of $60.

The Company can redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $.01 per Right at
any time until the tenth business day (subject to extension) after a public
announcement that a 20% position has been acquired.

The Board of Directors has the flexibility to lower the 20% threshold to not
less than 10% prior to the time any person or group acquires a 20% position in
the Company.  The Rights expire on February 11, 2003.

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid quarterly from
the third quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1994.  The declaration
and payment of preferred stock dividends was suspended in the second quarter of
1994 in connection with extension agreements of the Company's principal
lenders.  Upon the expiration of these extension agreements, the Company paid a
quarterly dividend on April 1, 1995 and July 1, 1995.  Pursuant to the
requirements of Delaware law, the preferred stock dividend was suspended in the
third quarter of 1995 as a result of recognition of losses and the subsequent
shareholders' deficit.  The five quarterly dividends which are in arrears
(dividend payment dates  July 1, 1994, October 1, 1994, January 1, 1995,
October 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996) amount to $6,109,000 in the aggregate
($10.63 per preferred share). Common stock dividends may not be declared until
the preferred stock dividends that are in arrears are made current.

There are statutory restrictions limiting the payment of preferred stock
dividends under Delaware law, the state in which the Company is incorporated.
Under Delaware law, the Company is permitted to pay preferred stock dividends
only: (1) out of surplus, surplus being the amount of shareholders' equity in
excess of the par value of the Company's two classes of stock; or (2) in the
event there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which a
preferred stock dividend is declared (and/or out of net profits from the
preceding fiscal year), but only to the extent that shareholders' equity
exceeds the par value of the preferred stock ($575,000).  The Company had a
shareholders' deficit at December 31, 1995 of $38,106,000.

14.    INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AND
       STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS PLANS

As of December 31, 1995, the Company had options, stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock outstanding from three Incentive Stock Option and Stock
Appreciation Rights Plans.

The plans provide for three types of incentive awards: incentive stock options
("ISOs"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted stock.  The 1982
and 1985 Plans provide for the granting of ISOs and SARs and the 1995 Plan
provides for the granting of ISOs and restricted stock.  The 1985 and 1995
Plans also provide for the grant of non- qualified options, if so designated,
and contains the terms specified for non-qualified options.  A SAR gives the
holder the right to receive, without payment to the Company, its "value" in
cash.  The "value" of an





                                       61
<PAGE>   62
SAR for this purpose will be the excess, if any, of the fair market value of
one share of common stock of the Company on the date the right is exercised
over the exercise price of the SAR.  Restricted stock is an award payable in
shares of common stock subject to forfeiture under certain conditions.  ISOs
granted under the Plans may not have an option price that is less than the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant.  ISOs and SARs under the 1982
and 1985 Plans may not be exercised until 2 years from the date of grant as to
50% of the total number granted and as to the remaining 50% not until 3 years
from the date of grant; the right to exercise ISOs and SARs terminates after 8
years from the date of grant. Under the 1995 Plan one-fourth of the ISOs
granted vest in each of the next four years.  The maximum number of shares of
the Company's common stock and SARs that may be issued or granted under the
Plans is as follows:

Over the periods in which the SARs become exercisable, the Company accrues as
expense the amount by which the market price exceeds the various grant prices
of the SARs outstanding.  This is adjusted in subsequent reporting periods for
increases or decreases in the market price of the stock.  In 1995, 1994 and
1993 no accrual was recorded.

15.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Protection of the Environment

The Company believes its mining operations are substantially in compliance with
applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations,
including those relating to surface mining and reclamation, and it is the
policy of the Company to operate in compliance with such standards.  The
Company maintains compliance primarily through maintenance and monitoring
activities.  In 1995 the Company accrued approximately $3,400,000 against
earnings in order to comply with environmental regulations applicable to its
mining operations.  The entire charge related to idling of the Company's
Virginia Division and Pine Branch operations.  The Company estimates its total
liabilities for reclamation are $10,311,000, all of which have been accrued as
of December 31, 1995.  Actual cash paid to perform reclamation in 1995 amounted
to $210,000.  In 1994 the Company charged $1,245,000 to earnings which did not
include a $3,135,000 credit to earnings resulting from a reversal of
reclamation accruals in connection with the sales of inactive properties in
West Virginia and the assets of Criterion in Kentucky.  In addition,
reclamation fees imposed by the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (the "Surface Mining Act") amounted to approximately $1,755,000,
$2,414,000 and $2,077,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

In the event final reclamation is not performed in accordance with state and
federal regulations, the Company has $12,000,000 and $18,000,000 of reclamation
bonds in place in Montana and Virginia, respectively, that assures compliance
with all applicable regulations.

Adventure Resources, Inc.

The Company has both secured and unsecured claims against Adventure Resources,
Inc. ("Adventure") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia.  The secured claims approximate $10,000,000 and are
collateralized by first and subordinated liens on certain assets of Adventure.
No payments have been received on these claims to date, however, asset sales
are pending and the Company is moving to foreclose on certain assets.  As of
December 31, 1995, all claims against Adventure have been fully reserved due to
the uncertainty of collecting all or a portion of the amounts.

Lease Obligations

The Company and its subsidiaries lease coal lands from an affiliated Company
and other third-parties.  Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is
subject to minimum annual royalties aggregating $606,000 plus real estate
taxes, until the leases expire in 1998.

WRI has an agreement to lease coal reserves from the Crow Tribe of Indians
which is in effect until exhaustion of the underlying reserves.  This lease
requires annual rentals, recoupable minimum royalty and production royalty
payments.  The royalty rate varies from 6% of the F.O.B. mine price to a 12.5%
rate net of all production-based taxes.

Royalties and rentals charged to expense under all lease agreements, including
those in effect for WRI, amounted to $5,844,000, $17,262,000 and $17,761,000 in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company has operating lease commitments expiring at various dates,
primarily for real property and equipment.  Minimum rental obligations existing
under these leases at December 31, 1995 are as follows:

The Company makes yearly evaluations of its reserves and periodically modifies
the amount of reserves reported.  The reserve evaluations are based on new
information developed by bore-hole drilling, examination of outcrops,
acquisitions, dispositions, production, changes in mining methods, abandonments
and other information.  Substantially all of the estimated coal reserves are

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Westmoreland Coal Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Westmoreland
Coal Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Westmoreland Coal
Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Dividends:

After obtaining a waiver to its 1977 Loan Agreement, the Company declared and
paid an $.08 dividend on Common Stock in each of the four quarters of 1992.  On
January 26, 1993 the Company announced that the regular quarterly dividend of
$.08 per share of common stock payable for the first quarter of 1993 would be
suspended and has not been resumed.  Common stock dividend payments may not be
declared until the preferred stock dividends that are in arrears are made
current.

Preferred stock dividends at a rate of 8.5% per annum were paid quarterly from
the third quarter of 1992 through the first quarter of 1994.  The declaration
and payment of preferred stock dividends was suspended in the second quarter of
1994 in connection with extension agreements of the Company's principal
lenders.  Upon the expiration of these extension agreements, the Company paid a
quarterly dividend on April 1, 1995 and July 1, 1995.  The preferred stock
dividend was suspended in the third quarter of 1995 as a result of recognition
of losses and the subsequent shareholders' deficit.  Common stock dividend
payments were not permitted under covenants contained by the Company's loan
agreements from January 1993 through December 22, 1994.  Further payment of
common stock dividends is not permitted until the preferred stock dividends
that are in arrears are made current.  The five quarterly dividends which are
in arrears (those dividends whose payment dates would have been July 1, 1994,
October 1, 1994, January 1, 1995, October 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996) amount
to $6,109,000 in the aggregate ($10.63 per preferred share).

There are statutory restrictions limiting the payment of preferred stock
dividends under Delaware law, the state in which the Company is incorporated.
Under Delaware law, the Company is permitted to pay preferred stock dividends
only: (1) out of surplus, surplus being the amount of shareholders' equity in
excess of the par value of the Company's two classes of stock; or (2) in the
event there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which a
preferred stock dividend is delcared (and/or out of net profits from the
preceding fiscal year), but only to the extent that shareholders' equity
exceeds the par value of the preferred stock ($575,000).  The Company had a
shareholders' deficit at December 31, 1995 of $38,106,000.
