                               General

    Unitil Corporation (the Company), a registered public utility
holding company, was incorporated under the laws of The  State of  New
Hampshire  on  September  7,  1984. Through  Concord Electric  Company
(CECo), Exeter &  Hampton Electric  Company (E&H),  Fitchburg Gas  and
Electric Light Company (FG&E) and Unitil Power  Corp. (Unitil  Power),
all of which are wholly owned utility subsidiaries of the Company, the
Company's   principal   business   is   the  purchase,   transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity at retail,  and the  distribution
and sale of natural gas at retail by FG&E. The  Company was  initially
incorporated in connection with  a business  combination between  CECo
and E&H, which became subsidiaries of the Company on January 23,  1985
through a share exchange. Prior to  this share  exchange, the  Company
conducted no  business operations  and had  no assets.  FG&E became  a
wholly owned subsidiary of  the Company  by a  "pooling of  interests"
merger between FG&E and the Company on April 28, 1992. Unitil Power, a
New Hampshire corporation incorporated  on October  9 ,  1984, is  the
wholesale supplier of electricity  to CECo  and E&H.  The Company  has
three additional subsidiaries:  Unitil Realty  Corp. (Unitil  Realty),
Unitil Resources,  Inc. (Unitil  Resources) and  Unitil Service  Corp.
(Unitil Service). The Company's principal executive office is  located
at 216 Epping Road, Exeter, New Hampshire 03833-4571. (Telephone (603)
772-0775)
    CECo, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in 1901, is engaged
in the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity at
retail to approximately 26,350 customers in the City of Concord, which
is  the  state  capital,  and  twelve  surrounding towns,  all in  New
Hampshire. CECo's service area  consists of  approximately 240  square
miles in the Merrimack River Valley  of south  central New  Hampshire.
The service area includes the City of  Concord and  major portions  of
the surrounding towns of Bow, Boscawen, Canterbury, Chichester, Epsom,
Salisbury and Webster, and limited areas in the  towns of  Allenstown,
Dunbarton, Hopkinton, Loudon and Pembroke. 
    CECo serves residential, commercial and industrial customers. The
State  of  New Hampshire's  government operations  are located  within
CECo's service area,  including the  executive, legislative,  judicial
branches and offices  and facilities  for all  major state  government
services. In addition, CECo's service area is a retail trading  center
for the north central part of the state and has over sixty diversified
businesses  relating  to  insurance,  printing, electronics,  granite,
belting, plastic yarns, furniture, machinery,  sportswear and  lumber.
Of CECo's 1995 retail electric revenues, approximately 34% was derived
from  residential  sales,  52% from  commercial and  non-manufacturing
sales,  12%  from  industrial/manufacturing  sales and  2% from  other
sales.
    E&H, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in 1908, is engaged
in the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity at
retail to approximately 37,120 customers in Exeter and in all or  part
of seventeen surrounding towns, all  in New  Hampshire. E&H's  service
area consists of approximately 168  square miles  in southeastern  New
Hampshire. The service area  includes all  of the  towns of  Atkinson,
Danville, East Kingston, Exeter, Hampton,  Hampton Falls,  Kensington,
Kingston, Newton, Plaistow, Seabrook, South Hampton and Stratham,  and
portions of the towns of  Derry, Brentwood,  Greenland, Hampstead  and
North Hampton.
    E&H serves residential, commercial and industrial customers.
Commercial and industrial customers are quite diversified and  include
retail  stores, shopping  centers, motels,  farms, restaurants,  apple
orchards and office buildings, as well as manufacturing firms  engaged
in  the  production  of  sportswear, automobile  parts and  electronic
components. It is estimated that there are over  150,000 daily  summer
visitors to  E&H's territory,  which includes  several popular  resort
areas  and  beaches along  the Atlantic  Ocean. Of  E&H's 1995  retail
electric  revenues,  approximately  47% was  derived from  residential
sales,  41%  from  commercial  and non-manufacturing  sales, 10%  from
industrial/manufacturing sales and 2% from other sales.
    FG&E, a Massachusetts corporation organized in 1852, is an
operating public utility providing electric and natural gas service in
the  City  of Fitchburg  and several  surrounding communities.  FG&E's
service  area  encompasses  approximately  170 square  miles in  north
central Massachusetts. 
    Electric service is supplied by FG&E to approximately 25,250
customers  in  the  communities  of  Fitchburg,  Ashby,  Townsend  and
Lunenburg.  FG&E provides electric service to residential, commercial,
and industrial customers.  FG&E's industrial  customers include  paper
manufacturing  and  allied  products  companies,  rubber and  plastics
manufacturers, chemical  products companies  and printing,  publishing
and allied industries. Of FG&E's 1995 electric revenues, approximately
36%  was  derived  from  residential  sales, 35%  from commercial  and
non-manufacturing sales, 28% from  industrial/manufacturing sales  and
1% from other sales.
     Natural gas service is supplied by FG&E to approximately 15,000
customers in the communities of Fitchburg, Lunenburg, Townsend, Ashby,
Gardner and Westminster, all located in Massachusetts. Of FG&E's  1995
gas operating revenues, approximately 52% was derived from residential
sales, 24% from commercial sales, 11%  from firm  sales to  industrial
customers,  and  13%  from  interruptible  sales (which  are sales  to
customers who possess alternative energy sources and who use gas on an
as-available  basis).  Approximately  30%  of  FG&E's  industrial  gas
revenue was derived from firm sales to paper manufacturing and  allied
products companies. The industrial gas revenue was  derived from  firm
sales to fabricated metal products manufacturers, rubber and  plastics
manufacturers,  primary  iron  manufacturers  and other  miscellaneous
industries.
     Natural gas sales in New England are seasonal, and the Company's
results of operations reflect this  seasonality. Accordingly,  results
of  operations  are typically  positively impacted  by gas  operations
during the five heating season months from November  through March  of
the  following  year.  Electric  sales  in  New England  are far  less
seasonal than natural gas sales; however, the highest usage  typically
occurs in the summer and  winter months  due to  air conditioning  and
heating requirements, respectively. 
    Unitil Power, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in 1984, is
the full requirements wholesale supplier  of electricity  to CECo  and
E&H. (See Energy Requirements and Regulation and Rates.)
    Unitil Realty, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in 1986,
was  established  to acquire  real estate  to support  the growth  and
expansion of the Company's utility and energy related business. Unitil
Realty,   until   February   1995,  owned   the  Company's   corporate
headquarters and related land located on  Epping Road  in Exeter,  New
Hampshire. This  property was  taken by  the State  of New  Hampshire,
through eminent domain, for the planned expansion of  Route 101.  (See
"Capital Requirements" under Item 1 of this report)  UNITIL Realty did
purchase land in Hampton, New Hampshire during  1995, on  which it  is
currently constructing UNITIL's new corporate headquarters.
    Unitil Resources, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in
1993, provides consulting and other services on energy related matters
to non-affiliates. These services include power brokering,  financial,
accounting, regulatory and related operational services. 
    Unitil Service, a New Hampshire corporation incorporated in 1984,
supplies centralized professional and support services  to the  Unitil
System of Companies.
       
                Competition and Industry Restructuring

    The current focus on restructuring the electric industry has been
building in recent years due  to a  variety of  economic, social,  and
political forces.  They  include legislative  and regulatory  changes,
technological advances and consumer demands for lower prices. 
    Competition at the wholesale level has existed for a number of
years, and  has been  increasing as  a result  of the  passage of  the
Energy Policy Act  of 1992,  initiatives in  transmission pricing  and
policy at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and greater
contracting activity  among utility  and non-utility  suppliers. As  a
wholesale  purchaser  of  electric  energy  for  resale to  customers,
wholesale competition has provided the Company with many opportunities
for achieving significant power supply savings for its customers.  The
focus of industry restructuring has now shifted to the retail electric
market,  however,  where  electricity  is  provided  directly  to  the
ultimate users.
    For many utilities this shift from natural monopoly to open
competition is causing dramatic changes  in their  traditional way  of
doing business.  Increasing competition is moving the industry towards
an  unbundling  of  the  traditional  vertically  integrated   utility
structure  into  separate  generation,  transmission and  distribution
activities.  As the industry continues to unbundle into these separate
functional areas, it is likely that the transmission and  distribution
of electricity  will remain  largely regulated  as monopoly  services,
while  the  generation  and  sale  of  energy  will   shift  to   open
competition. 
    For Unitil, preparation for and adaptation to a competitive
environment has long been part of  the Company's  business strategy.  
Unitil  has  always been  structured along  functional business  lines
reflecting a separation of its core distribution  operations from  its
market  based  energy acquisition  and supply  business.   For over  a
decade Unitil has managed and delivered  competitively priced,  market
based  energy  supplies to  its customers,  putting it  "ahead of  the
curve" as many utilities are now just  beginning to  struggle to  make
this transition.  As a result  of this  strategy, Unitil  has a  track
record of offering reliable  energy services  at prices  that are  now
among  the  lowest  in  our  region.  Further,   as  new   competitive
opportunities emerge, Unitil is designing new services and pricing its
products to be the supplier of choice.  
    The Unitil Companies have received regulatory approval for the
Company's Energy  Bank(TM)   program.   Energy Bank(TM)  is an  innovative
economic development program designed to bring low-cost energy to  new
and  expanding  industrial customers.  With rates  in the  range of  5
cents/KWH, this  program offers  electric energy  at a  price that  is
equal to the national average  industrial rate  and is  40% below  the
current  average  industrial  rate  in New  England.   In addition  to
providing substantial  benefits  to  new  and  expanding   industrial
customers in  the  form of  very competitive  market pricing,  Energy
Bank(TM) will also  provide significant  benefits to  all the  System's
customers in the form of local economic development activity,  reduced
power costs, and lower costs to all customers through the issuance  of
Power Dividends. 
    Unitil has also taken steps to prepare for competitive
opportunities in new, unregulated energy markets.  On January 5, 1996,
Unitil filed an application on Form U-1 with the SEC  to allow  Unitil
Resources to engage in electric power,  natural gas  and other  energy
commodity marketing at wholesale and at retail.   Unitil Resources  is
currently authorized to  engage in  the business  of providing  energy
related management and consulting services, including power brokering,
to  entities  outside  the  Unitil  holding  company  system.   Unitil
Resources will have to comply with  any applicable  federal and  state
regulation on  its  activities  in  the   wholesale  and   retail
electricity and natural gas  markets, but  will otherwise  be free  to
compete  on  an  unregulated  basis  with  other  competitive   energy
suppliers in the evolving competitive marketplace.   Approval of  this
request is expected in the spring of 1996.         
    Unitil continues to actively participate in industry, legislative
and regulatory proceedings on the issues of  competition and  industry
restructuring  at  both  the  federal  and  state  levels, favoring  a
reasonable and orderly transition to competition and  more choice  for
all customers.
    Both the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission ( the "NHPUC")
and the New Hampshire Legislature  have been  involved in  discussions
and analysis relative to competition in the industry.  Early in  1995,
in response  to a  petition by  a power  marketer seeking  to sell  to
certain  industrial  customers  of  an  investor-owned  New  Hampshire
utility, the NHPUC ruled that utilities in New Hampshire  do not  have
exclusive franchise territories as a matter of law.  This decision has
been appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, where a decision  is
now pending.  In June 1995, New Hampshire  Senate Bill  168 (SB  168),
was signed into law.  SB 168  established a  legislative committee  to
consider changes in the structure of the electric utility industry and
directed  the  NHPUC to  begin a  retail wheeling  pilot program.  The
legislative committee and its subcommittees met  regularly during  the
summer  and  fall  of  1995,   and  several   members  sponsored   new
legislation, now  actively under  consideration,   that would  require
utility restructuring and retail customer choice  as early  as 1997.  
The  NHPUC  issued its  final guidelines  on a  retail wheeling  pilot
program on February 28, 1996, requiring utility compliance filings  by
March 15, 1996, and implementation on May 28, 1996.
    During 1995, the MDPU concluded initial hearings in an
electric industry restructuring docket, and issued an order  requiring
the   three   largest   Massachusetts  electric   utilities  to   file
restructuring plans in February 1996, and the remaining Massachusetts'
electric utilities (including FG&E) to file restructuring plans  three
months after the MDPU issues orders regarding the first three plans.  
The  three  utilities  filed  plans  on  February  19,  1996, but  the
Department  subsequently  decided  to undertake  a generic  rulemaking
proceeding in order to establish consistent statewide ground rules for
industry  restructuring.   This process  is expected  to take  several
months, culminating in utility compliance filings on October 6, 1996.
    One aspect of the restructuring of the electric industry which
could have an  adverse impact  on the  Company is  the rate  treatment
accorded by regulators to  a utility  company's potentially  "stranded
costs",  i.e.,  investments  in  electric generation facilities and 
contractual obligations from purchased  power contracts,  which have  a
fair market value, based upon current wholesale market conditions, which
is less than the book value of such assets or the contract price.   To
the  extent  that  regulators  implement open  retail competition  and
resulting  retail  market rates  are comparable  to current  wholesale
prices, and to the extent utilities are unable to  recover such  costs
from ratepayers or to mitigate such costs  through expense  reductions
or other means, such utilities may incur losses  and may  be forced  to
write-down certain investments in connection with the restructuring  of
the industry.  The Company's subsidiaries which own relatively few  electric
generation  assets, rely  more heavily  than most  other utilities  on
competitively-acquired  purchased  power  contracts  subject  to  FERC
regulation, and offer retail rates that are  among the  lowest in  the
New England region, but the financial impact, if any,  on the  Company
of regulatory treatment of stranded costs in industry restructuring is
impossible to predict at this time.
    Although regulatory change with respect to natural gas utilities
has been much less active  in 1995  than for  electric utilities,  the
Department issued an Order on March 15, 1996, clarifying its standards
for  review  of  gas  purchase  contracting  decisions  by  local  gas
distribution  companies.     The   Department  has   also  ordered   a
Massachusetts gas company subject to its jurisdiction  to undertake  a
pilot program on retail competition for residential customers, and the
Unitil companies are now participating  on the  committees which  have
been set up to advise, develop and monitor the pilot program.
    Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of these
legislative changes and regulatory proceedings,  the Company  believes
that increasing competition in the industry is inevitable. The Company
also believes that it is well positioned to respond positively to  the
changing  regulatory   environment  and   the  shift   to  more   open
competition.

                         Rates and Regulation

    The Company is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) as a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company  Act  of  1935 (1935  Act), and  it and  its subsidiaries  are
subject  to  the  provisions  of  the 1935  Act. The  Company and  its
subsidiaries,  where  applicable,  are  subject to  regulation by  the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),  the NHPUC  and the  MDPU
with respect to rates, adequacy  of service,  issuance of  securities,
accounting and other matters. Unitil Power, as a wholesale utility, is
subject to rate regulation by the FERC. Both CECo and  E&H, as  retail
electric utilities in New Hampshire, are subject to rate regulation by
the NHPUC, and FG&E is subject to MDPU regulation with respect to  gas
and electric retail rates,  and FERC  regulation with  respect to  New
England Power Pool (NEPOOL) interchanges and other wholesale sales  of
electricity. 
    The revenues of the Company's three retail operating subsidiaries
are collected pursuant to rates on file with the NHPUC, the MDPU  and,
to a minor extent, the FERC.  In general, retail  rates are  comprised
of a base rate component, established during  comprehensive base  rate
cases, and various periodic  rate adjustment  mechanisms, which  track
and reconcile particular  expense elements  with associated  collected
revenues. The last  comprehensive regulatory  proceedings to  increase
base rates for  the Company's  retail operating  subsidiaries were  in
1985 for CECo, 1984 for FG&E, and 1982 for E&H.  The  majority of  the
System's utility operating revenues are collected  under various  rate
adjustment mechanisms, including revenues collected from customers for
fuel, purchased power, cost of gas, and demand-side management program
costs. 
    The Unitil System Agreement (System Agreement), as approved by the
FERC, governs wholesale sales  by Unitil  Power to  its New  Hampshire
retail  distribution  affiliates,  CECo  and  E&H,  and  provides  for
recovery by Unitil Power of  all costs  incurred in  the provision  of
service.  Unitil Power  has continued  to adjust  its wholesale  rates
every six months in accordance with the System Agreement, and CECo and
E&H have continued to file corresponding semi-annual changes in  their
retail fuel and purchased power adjustment clauses with the NHPUC  for
approval.
     FG&E also files a quarterly electric fuel charge and a
semi-annual gas adjustment factor with the MDPU for approval to adjust
its rates for changes in fuel and gas related costs.  Although all  of
FG&E's fuel costs and the largest portion of its purchased power costs
are  fully  recovered  under  the  Department's  Electric Fuel  Charge
regulations, FG&E's electric  generation entitlements  are subject  to
annual performance reviews. Performance targets are filed  by FG&E  in
advance and approved by the Department, and  in January  of each  year
FG&E files data on actual unit performance for the  prior November  to
October  period.  The Department  will investigate  reasons why  units
failed to  meet target  performance criteria,  and has  in some  cases
disallowed recovery of replacement power costs  for unplanned  outages
which  the  Department deemed  to be  due to  imprudent operations  or
actions.
    The NHPUC issued its final guidelines on a retail wheeling pilot
program on February 28, 1996, requiring utility compliance filings  by
March 15, 1996, and implementation on May  28, 1996.   The  guidelines
provide that up  to 3%  of each  utility's retail  customer's will  be
allowed to select from among competing electric  supply providers  and
have  this  supply delivered  across the  local utility  system.   All
utilities,  including Unitil's  New Hampshire  based retail  operating
companies, CECo  and E&H,  have filed  plans with  the Commission  and
hearings  are scheduled  in early  April.   The Commission  Guidelines
have,  in some  cases, raised  legal and  jurisdictional issues  which
parties in the proceeding have  tried to  resolve through  alternative
proposals and settlements in order  to avoid  protracted litigation.  
The Unitil companies, on March 20, 1996, filed a settlement  agreement
with the Office of the Consumer Advocate which, if  accepted by  the
NHPUC, would resolve the companies' key concerns regarding federal and
state ratemaking jurisdiction.  Unitil's plans for  the pilot  program
involve  CECo  and  E&H  providing  delivery  services  to   customers
participating in the pilot within their own service areas, and  Unitil
Resources  offering  competitive  electric  supply  services to  pilot
program customers throughout the entire state.
    FG&E, the Company's combination gas and electric retail operating
subsidiary, has been incurring FERC-approved  transition charges  from
interstate  pipeline  suppliers, resulting  from the  transition to  a
comprehensive set of new regulations under  FERC Order  636. In  June,
1994, the  MDPU opened  an investigation  for the  purpose of  setting
standards  for the  recovery by  Massachusetts gas  utilities of  FERC
Ordered  636-related transition  costs billed  by interstate  pipeline
companies. On March 8, 1995, the MDPU issued its final  Order in  this
proceeding, which authorized and directed all gas utilities to recover
Order 636-related transition costs as incurred through the cost of gas
adjustment mechanism on a  flat volumetric  rate. Through  the end  of
1995,  the  amount  of  transition  costs  incurred  by  FG&E  totaled
approximately $2.2 million. These costs have  been recovered  directly
from  FG&E's  gas  customers  through  the  cost  of  gas   adjustment
mechanism.  Based on  estimates included  in rate  filings before  the
FERC, and on  other publicly  available information,  it is  estimated
that FG&E may incur up  to an  additional $1.2  million of  transition
costs  in  future years.  FG&E expects  full recovery  of these  costs
through billings to customers.
    On May 2, 1995, Unitil made an application to the SEC on Form U-1
seeking renewed authority and approval for short-term bank  borrowings
by  Unitil  and  its  subsidiaries and  for renewed  approval for  and
operation  of  the  Unitil  System  Companies' cash  pooling and  loan
arrangement.  The SEC published the requisite notice  with respect  to
this filing on  May 26,  1995.   On July  11, 1995,  the SEC  approved
Unitil's application on this matter.

                          Resource Planning

    Within both New Hampshire and Massachusetts state jurisdictions,
the Company's utility operating subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
review  of  their  forecasting,  planning,  and  long  term   resource
acquisition processes. The operating  companies are  required to  file
resource planning documents and plans every two  years, in  accordance
with Integrated Resource Management (IRM) rules  in Massachusetts  and
the  Integrated  Resource  Planning  (IRP) process  in New  Hampshire.
Additionally, the operating companies are currently  required to  file
annually comprehensive Demand-Side Management (DSM)Program Plans  with
their respective state regulatory commissions.

Electric Resource Planning

      In New Hampshire, an IRP was filed with the NHPUC on April 30,
1994. The NHPUC approved the IRP on February 22, 1995. The 1995/96 DSM
Program Plan was filed  with the  NHPUC on  February 1,  1995 and  was
approved June 28, 1995, for implementation beginning on July 1, 1995. 
      In Massachusetts, FG&E filed its first IRM with the MDPU on
August 3, 1992. In January 1993, FG&E filed a Comprehensive Settlement
of Phase I of the IRM process.  On November  15, 1993,  FG&E made  its
Phase III IRM filing, in which it proposed DSM programs for 1994-1995,
and supply side initiatives. On February 15, 1994,  the MDPU  approved
this filing, authorized the DSM programs to proceed through July 1995,
and approved the supply resources.  A  12-month DSM  Program Plan  was
filed on April 7, 1995, covering the period from August, 1995 to July,
1996.  This plan was approved on July 18, 1995.

Gas Resource Planning

      The MDPU requires that gas companies file long term gas
forecasts  and  resource  plans  consistent with  IRP principles,  and
further requires that all contracts in excess of one year be filed for
approval in advance. FG&E filed a gas IRP on July 29,  1994. The  MDPU
has initiated a review  of FG&E's gas IRP, which is currently ongoing.
 Anorder is expected in early 1996.
     
                         Energy Requirements

    CECo, E&H, FG&E and Unitil Power are members of NEPOOL. Under the
NEPOOL  Agreement,  to  which  virtually  all  New  England   electric
utilities are parties, substantially all operation and dispatching  of
electric generation and bulk transmission capacity in  New England  is
performed on a regional basis. The NEPOOL Agreement imposes generating
capacity and reserve obligations  and provides  for the  use of  major
transmission  facilities  and  payments  associated  therewith.   Each
company's capability responsibility under NEPOOL involves carrying  an
allocated  share  of  New  England  capacity  requirements  which   is
determined for  each six-month  period based  on regional  reliability
criteria. Unitil Power, as the full requirements supplier to CECo  and
E&H, had a capability responsibility as of December, 1995 of 224.85 MW
and a corresponding peak demand of 195.61 MW that occurred on July 14,
1995. FG&E's capability responsibility as of December, 1995 was  91.99
MW, with a corresponding peak demand of 79.69 MW that occurred on June
20, 1995.
    To meet the needs of CECo and E&H, Unitil Power has contracted for
generating  capacity  and  energy  and  for  associated   transmission
services  as  needed  to  meet NEPOOL  requirements and  to provide  a
diverse and  economical energy  supply. Unitil  Power's purchases  are
from various utility and non-utility generating units using a  variety
of fuels and from several utility systems in the U.S. and Canada.  For
the twelve months ending December 31,1995, Unitil Power's energy needs
were provided by the following fuel sources: nuclear (32%), oil (21%),
coal (19%), gas (13%), wood and refuse (5%) , hydro  (1%), and  system
and other (9%). 
    FG&E meets its capacity requirements through ownership interests
and  power  purchase  contracts.  FG&E's  purchases  are from  various
utility and non-utility generating units using a variety of fuels  and
from several utility systems in the U.S.  and Canada.  For the  twelve
months  ending  December  31,  1995,  FG&E's  energy needs,  including
generation from joint-owned units,  were provided  from the  following
fuel sources: nuclear (24%), oil (22%), wood (25%),  hydro (4%),  coal
(7%) and system and other (18%). 
    FG&E has a 4.5% ownership interest, or 20.12 MW, in an oil and
natural gas-fired generating plant in New Haven, Connecticut, which is
operated  by  The United  Illuminating Company,  the plants'  majority
owner. FG&E also has a 0.1822% ownership interest, or 1.13  MW, in  an
oil-fired generating plant in Yarmouth,  Maine, which  is operated  by
Central  Maine  Power  Company  as the  majority owner,  and a  0.217%
ownership  interest,  or  2.5  MW,  in  the Millstone  3 nuclear  unit
operated by Northeast  Utilities, parent  of the  principal owners  of
that unit. In addition, FG&E operates an oil-fired combustion  turbine
with  a  current capability  of 26.6  MW under  a long-term  financing
lease.

                             Fuel Supply

      Oil.  Approximately 22% of FG&E's and 21% of Unitil Power's
electric power in 1995 was provided by oil-fired units, some of  which
are  owned  by  FG&E.   Most  fuel oil  used by  New England  electric
utilities  is  acquired  from  foreign  sources  and  is  subject   to
interruption and price increases by foreign governments. 
     Coal. Approximately 7% of FG&E's and 19% of Unitil Power's 1995
requirements  were  from  coal-burning   facilities.  The   facilities
generally purchase their coal under long term  supply agreements  with
prices tied to economic indices. Although coal is stored both  on-site
and by  fuel suppliers,  long term  interruptions of  coal supply  may
result in limitations in the production of power or fuel switching  to
oil and thus result in higher energy prices.
     Nuclear. FG&E has a 0.217% ownership interest in Millstone Unit
No. 3 (the Unit). The Unit has contracted for certain segments of  the
nuclear  fuel  production  cycle  through  various  dates. This  cycle
includes, among other things, mining, enrichment and disposal of  used
fuel.  Contracts  for  various  segments  of  the fuel  cycle will  be
required  in  the  future, and  their availability,  prices and  terms
cannot now be predicted.
    Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the participants
in Millstone 3 were required to enter into contracts  with the  United
States Department of Energy, prior to the operation of that Unit,  for
the  transport  and  disposal  of  spent  fuel  at  a  nuclear   waste
repository. Under the Act, a national repository for nuclear waste was
anticipated to be in operation by  1998. FG&E  cannot predict  whether
the Federal  government will  be able  to provide  interim storage  or
permanent disposal repositories for spent fuel.

                      Gas Operations and Supply

     FG&E distributes gas purchased from domestic and Canadian
suppliers under  long term  contracts as  well as  gas purchased  from
producers  and  marketers  on  the  spot  market.  The  diversity  and
flexibility  of  supply  reflects  FG&E's  commitment  to  securing  a
reliable gas supply at the lowest possible cost. The following  tables
summarize actual gas purchases by source of supply and the cost of gas
sold for the years 1993 through 1995:

     Under Order 636, issued by the FERC in 1992, FG&E's former sole
supplier  of  pipeline  services, TGP,  was required  to unbundle  its
transportation services and its sales services. As a result, all Local
Distribution  Companies  (LDCs)  now  arrange  for   a  portfolio   of
transport, storage and supply contracts to meet customer requirements.

     In 1993, FG&E added two long term purchases of gas supply that
replaced supplies previously provided by TGP.  These contracts  expire
on October 1999 and October 1996 respectively. The MDPU approved these
contracts in March 1994. FG&E also has  underground storage  contracts
which  provide  significant  natural  gas storage  capacity. TGP  also
provides FG&E with underground storage. FG&E  has firm  transportation
agreements with TGP for delivery of storage gas .
     As a supplement to pipeline natural gas, FG&E owns a propane air
gas plant and  has under  a financial  lease a  liquefied natural  gas
(LNG)  storage  and  vaporization  facility.  These  plants  are  used
principally during peak load periods to augment the supply of pipeline
natural gas. 

                        Environmental Matters

    The Company does not expect that compliance with environmental
laws or regulations will have a material  effect on  its business,  or
the businesses of its subsidiaries. The Company does not know whether,
or to what extent, such regulations may affect it or its  subsidiaries
by impinging on the operations of other electric and gas utilities  in
New England.
    Unitil Power and FG&E purchase wholesale capacity and energy from
a diverse group of suppliers using various fuel sources  and FG&E  has
ownership interests in certain generating plants. Some of the purchase
power contracts contain cost adjustment provisions that may allow  the
supplier to pass through environmental remediation costs. The  Company
has not been informed whether  any of  these suppliers  are likely  to
incur significant environmental remediation costs and, if so, which if
any such costs may be passed through.
    The Company continues to work with federal and state environmental
agencies to assess the environmental contamination in the vicinity  of
former gas manufacturing sites operated by Fitchburg Gas and  Electric
Light Company, the Company's  combination gas  and electric  operating
subsidiary.   Based  on information  developed over  the last  several
years,   it   has  been   discovered  that   there  is   environmental
contamination at a  former gas  manufacturing plant  in Fitchburg,  MA
(the Sawyer Passway site).  In December  1995 the  Company accepted  a
Tier 1B permit  from the  Massachusetts Department  of   Environmental
Protection (DEP) to address the site pursuant to  the requirements  of
the  Massachusetts  Contingency  Plan.    Further  investigations  are
necessary to assess the extent and nature of the contamination, and to
evaluate potential remedies.  Reports on those investigations are  due
to be filed with the DEP in early 1997.  Because these  investigations
are at an early stage  management cannot,  at this  time, predict  the
costs  of  future  analysis  and  remediation.  The   costs  of   such
assessments and any remedial action  determined to  be necessary  will
initially be funded from traditional sources of capital and  recovered
from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the MDPU.  
The Company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may
provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site. 
    
                         Capital Requirements

    Net capital expenditures increased approximately $3.7 million in
1995 as a result of planned spending for utility system  improvements,
as well as the taking by the  State of New Hampshire of the  Company's
current headquarters and  the commencement  of construction  of a  new
corporate  headquarters. This  increase in  capital expenditures  from
1994  to  1995  reflects  increased  spending  of  approximately  $5.7
million, $2.3 million for normal utility system improvements and  $3.4
million for the construction on a new  corporate headquarters,  offset
by proceeds of $2.0 million from the taking of the Company's corporate
headquarters.
    In February 1995, Unitil's corporate headquarters, located in
Exeter, New Hampshire, was taken by the State of New Hampshire through
eminent  domain in  connection with  the Route  101 highway  expansion
project. As a result of this taking, the  Company purchased  land   in
Hampton, New Hampshire, during 1995, and began construction  of a  new
corporate headquarters, which is scheduled for  completion during  the
summer of 1996.
    In 1996, total capital expenditures are expected to approximate
$18.9  million.  This  projection  reflects  capital  expenditures  of
approximately  $14.8  million  for normal  utility system  expansions,
replacements  and  other  improvements  and  capital  expenditures  of
approximately $4.1 million related to the  completion of  construction
of the new corporate headquarters.

                         Financing Activities

    No long-term debt was issued by any of the Unitil System companies
during 1995, however, during both 1994 and 1993 various Unitil  System
Companies completed private placements  of long-term  debt. The  funds
generated  by  these  transactions were  primarily used  to repay  the
short-term indebtedness incurred by each system company to fund  their
ongoing  construction  programs,  and  also  to  redeem higher  coupon
long-term debt issues prior  to their  maturity. The  impact of  these
transactions  has  been to  gradually lower  the average  cost of  the
System's long-term debt portfolio.
    The Company currently has unsecured committed bank lines for
short-term debt aggregating $10,000,000 with three banks for which  it
pays commitment fees. At December 31, 1995, the unused portion of  the
committed  credit  lines  outstanding  was  $7,300,000.   The  average
interest rate on all short-term borrowings outstanding during 1995 was
6.59%.

                          Employee Relations

    As of December 31, 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries had 324
full-time employees. The Company considers its  relationship with  its
employees  to  be  good  and  has  not  experienced  any  major  labor
disruptions since the early 1960's. 
    There are 120 employees represented by labor unions.  In 1995, one
of Unitil's retail operating subsidiaries,  E&H, reached  a new  three
year  pact  with  its  employees  covered by  a collective  bargaining
agreement.  In 1994, two  of Unitil's  retail operating  subsidiaries,
CECo and  FG&E, reached  new three  year pacts  with their  respective
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. The  agreements
provide for discreet  salary adjustments,  established work  practices
and provided uniform benefit packages. 
    The Company and its subsidiaries, where applicable, have in effect
funded  Retirement  Plans  and  related  Trust  Agreements   providing
retirement  annuities  for  participating  employees  at  age 65.  The
Company's policy is to fund the pension cost accrued. (See  Note 9  of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in  Part II  Item
8. , page 35 .)

Item 2.  Properties

     CECo's distribution service center building and adjoining
administration  building,  totaling  37,560  square  feet  of  office,
warehouse and garage area, are located on land in the City of  Concord
owned  by  CECo  in  fee.  CECo's   seventeen  electric   distribution
substations constitute 94,400 KVA of capacity  for the  transformation
of electric energy from the 34.5  KV transmission  voltage to  primary
distribution voltage levels. The  electric substations  are, with  one
exception, located on land owned by CECo in fee. The sole exception is
located on land occupied pursuant to a perpetual easement.
     CECo has in excess of 39 pole miles of 34.5 KV electric
transmission facilities located, with minor exceptions, either on land
owned  by  CECo  in  fee  or on  land occupied  pursuant to  perpetual
easements.  CECo  also  has  618  pole  miles  of  overhead   electric
distribution primary voltage lines and approximately 97 cable miles of
underground primary voltage lines. The electric distribution lines are
located in, on or under public highways or private  lands pursuant  to
lease,  easement,  permit,  municipal   consent,  tariff   conditions,
agreement or license, expressed or implied through use by CECo without
objection by the owners. In the  case of  certain distribution  lines,
CECo owns only a part interest in the poles upon which  its wires  are
installed,  the  remaining  interest  being  owned  by  telephone  and
telegraph companies.
     Additionally, CECo owns in fee 137.7 acres of land located on the
east bank of the Merrimack River in the City of Concord. Of the  total
acreage, 81.2 acres are  located within  an industrial  park zone,  as
specified in the zoning ordinances of the City of Concord.
      The physical properties of CECo (with certain exceptions) and
its franchises are subject to the lien  of its  Indenture of  Mortgage
and Deed of Trust, as supplemented, under which the respective  series
of First Mortgage Bonds of CECo are outstanding.
      E&H's distribution and engineering service center building is
located  on  land  owned  by  E&H  in  fee.  E&H's  fourteen  electric
distribution substations, together with a 5,000 KVA mobile substation,
constitute 91,400 KVA of capacity for the  transformation of  electric
energy from the 34.5 KV transmission voltage  to primary  distribution
voltage levels. The electric substations are located on land owned  by
E&H in fee.
     E&H has in excess of 68 pole miles of 34.5 KV electric
transmission  facilities  located  on  land either  owned or  occupied
pursuant  to  perpetual  easements.  E&H also  has 688  pole miles  of
overhead electric distribution primary voltage lines and approximately
74  cable miles  of underground  primary voltage  lines. The  electric
distribution lines  are located  in, on  or under  public highways  or
private lands pursuant to lease, easement, permit, municipal  consent,
tariff conditions, agreement or license, expressed or implied  through
use by E&H without objection by  the owners.  In the  case of  certain
distribution lines, E&H owns only a part  interest in  the poles  upon
which its wires are installed, the remaining interest  being owned  by
telephone and telegraph companies.
     Certain physical properties of E&H and its franchises are subject
to  the  lien  of  its Indenture  of Mortgage  and Deed  of Trust,  as
supplemented,  under  which the  respective series  of First  Mortgage
Bonds of E&H are outstanding.
     FG&E owns a propane gas plant and leases an LNG plant, both of
which are located on land owned by it in fee. The Company has  entered
into agreements for joint ownership with others of one nuclear and two
fossil fuel generating facilities. At December 31, 1995, the  electric
properties  of  the  Company  consisted  principally  of  70 miles  of
transmission lines, 18 transmission and distribution substations  with
a total capacity of 383,275 KVA  and 656 miles of distribution  lines.
Electric transmission  facilities (including  substations) and  steel,
cast iron and plastic gas mains owned by the Company  are, with  minor
exceptions, located on land owned by the  Company in  fee or  occupied
pursuant  to  perpetual  easements.  The  Company  leases its  service
building, and its combustion  turbine electric  peaking generator  and
LNG facility. (See Business -  Electric Operations  and Energy  Supply
and  Gas  Operations  and  Supply  above  for  additional  information
regarding  the  Company's  plants,  facilities  and   gas  mains   and
services.)
     Unitil Realty currently owns 12 acres of land in fee, which is
located in the Town of Hampton, New Hampshire.  This  land, which  was
purchased  during  1995,  is  the  site of  Unitil's future  corporate
headquarters building.  This facility, which began construction during
the fall of  1995, is scheduled to be completed during  the summer  of
1996,  with  occupancy  by the  Company to  follow completion.     The
Company believes that its facilities are currently adequate for  their
intended uses. 
     Unitil Realty was, until February 13, 1995, the owner of the
Company's corporate headquarters and 36 acres of related land  located
in the Town of Exeter, New Hampshire. On that date, the  State of  New
Hampshire (the "State") took title to and possession of  the land  and
building through eminent domain. The building is to  be demolished  in
connection with the State's Route 101 highway expansion. (See  Capital
Requirements  under  Item  1.  of  this  Report).   The  State of  New
Hampshire  is currently  renting this  facility back  to the  Company,
until  the Company  completes the  construction of  its new  corporate
headquarters building. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     In June, 1993, E&H was served with a complaint from Zeabrook
Associates, the owner of an apartment complex. In that complaint filed
in the New Hampshire Superior Court for Rockingham  County, the  owner
asserts that the Company improperly imposed a cash deposit requirement
for  new  residential customers  in the  claimant's apartment  complex
resulting in lost rental income and damages to reputation. The Company
believes that  these claims  are entirely  without merit,  and it  has
continued  to  defend  itself  against  them.  The  likelihood  of  an
unfavorable outcome  or extent  of loss  cannot be  estimated at  this
time.  
     The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative
proceedings and claims of various types  which arise  in the  ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of the Company's management,  based
upon  information  furnished  by  counsel  and  others,  the  ultimate
resolution of these  claims will  not have  a material  impact on  the
Company's  financial position.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations

Earnings and Dividends

    Unitil's earnings were $1.88 per common share for the year ending
December 31, 1995, an increase over the prior year record earnings per
share achieved in 1994 and 1993 of $1.83 and $1.75, respectively.  The
average return on common equity in 1995 was 13.1%. 1995's earnings'
performance primarily reflects increased electric base revenue from
higher energy sales by Unitil's retail operating companies as well as
the continued ability to effectively manage and control the System's
operating costs.
    In 1995, Unitil continued its history of steadily increasing its
dividend. Common stock dividends in 1995 were $1.28 per share, an
increase of 3.2% over the 1994's annual dividend and a dividend payout
ratio of 68%. At its January 1996 meeting, the Unitil Board of
Director's increased the quarterly dividend by 3.1% to $0.33 per
share, resulting in the current effective annualized dividend of $1.32
per share. 

Year in Review

    The System's total electric base revenue was up by 2.5% in 1995
due to an overall increase in kilowatt-hour sales and kilowatt billing
demands of 3.2% and 4.4%, respectively. This increase was mainly due
to continuing growth in the demand for energy by the System's largest
industrial and commercial customers. In 1995, kilowatt-hour sales grew
by 7.9% to this group of customers. In addition, extreme seasonal
weather patterns in 1995 also played a significant role on sales to
the more weather-sensitive residential and commercial customer groups.
In the third quarter, electric sales used for cooling purposes was
supported by one of the hottest third quarters on record in New
England.  In contrast, there was a significant decline in
weather-sensitive energy sales during the first quarter of the year,
during one of the mildest winter heating seasons in 30 years. The
weather in this quarter, as measured by heating degree days, was 16%
warmer than the same period last year.  As a result, electric
kilowatt-hour sales to residential customers, whose usage was impacted
most by the mild first quarter, remained relatively unchanged from the
prior year.
    The following table details total kilowatt -hour sales in each of
the last three years by customer group:

KWH Sales (000's)                      
                               1995       1994       1993
                                       
Residential                  507,233    507,071    495,395
                                               
Commercial                   381,292    374,769    375,413

Other Sales                   11,822     11,968     12,053 
                                       
Total KWH Sales            1,401,292  1,358,165  1,302,848


    The mild winter in the first quarter of 1995 also had a negative
impact on gas sales for the year. In 1995, gas base revenue decreased
by 3.3% due to lower gas firm therm sales compared to the prior year.
The bulk of the decrease in firm therm sales was caused by a decrease
of more than 6% in sales to residential customers, reflecting the
extremely mild winter heating season. The following table details
total firm therm sales in each of the last three years by customer
group: 

Firm Therm Sales (000's)                                        
                         1995    1994    1993
                                       
Residential            12,523  13,345  13,399 
Commercial              6,208   5,892   5,642 
Industrial              3,572   3,820   3,722 
                                       
Total Therm Sales      22,303  23,057  22,763 


    With more normal winter weather, growth of both electric and gas
sales in the first quarter of 1996 should show marked improvement over
1995. In addition, electric energy sales to industrial and commercial
customers are also expected to continue to increase in 1996 as new
businesses look to Unitil for their energy services and existing
customers expand their operations. In particular, the Company will be
aggressively marketing its  Energy BankTM program throughout 1996.
Energy BankTM  is an innovative economic development program designed
to bring low-cost energy to new and expanding industrial customers.
With rates in the range of 5 cents/KWH this program offers electric
energy at a price that is equal to the National Average industrial
rate and is 40% below the current average industrial rate in New
England. 
    The System's operations-related costs (not including fuel,
purchased power and conservation program costs, which are normally
recovered from customers through periodic cost recovery adjustment
mechanisms) were relatively unchanged in 1995 compared to 1994,
reflecting the continued success of the Company's disciplined approach
to cost management practices and procedures.  Local property taxes
increased 13.2% in1995, compared to prior year levels, mainly
reflecting annual property tax increases on utility property.

    Electric Operating Revenue increased by approximately $4.0
million, or 3%, in 1995 compared to 1994. Total electric operating
revenue is comprised of electric base revenue, fuel and purchased
power revenue and conservation and load management program revenue. 
Fuel and purchased power revenue are collected from customers through
the operation of periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms. Changes
in this component of operating revenue do not affect net income as
they normally mirror corresponding changes in fuel and purchased power
costs. Conservation and load management program revenue is also
collected from customers through a periodic cost recovery mechanisms,
reflecting underlying changes in conservation and load management
program costs. Electric base revenue is that portion of electric
operating revenue that has a direct impact on net income. In 1995,
electric base revenue rose by approximately $1.0 million. This 2.5%
increase in electric base revenue was due to the continued growth in
the System's electric energy sales to its customers.
    In 1994, the System's electric operating revenue increased by
approximately $1.3 million, or 1% with the electric base revenue
portion increasing by approximately 2.2%. This increase in electric
base revenue in 1994, compared to 1993, was due to the growth in the
System's total electric kilowatt-hour sales and kilowatt billing
demands of 4.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Partially offsetting this
comparative year-over-year increase in electric base revenue was the
full-year impact of a voluntary base rate reduction that was
implemented by the Company's Massachusetts retail operating subsidiary
in December 1993.
    Gas Operating Revenue decreased by about $1.1 million, or 5.7%, in
1995 compared to 1994. Gas operating revenue is comprised of three
components: cost of gas revenue, interruptible revenue and gas base
revenue. Cost of gas revenue is collected from customers through the
operation of a cost of gas adjustment mechanism. Changes in this
component of gas operating revenue does not affect net income as it
reflects corresponding changes in gas supply costs. Interruptible
revenue increased by about $900,000, an increase of more than 64%, due
to very favorable spot market prices for gas in 1995. Margins earned
on interruptible gas sales are used to directly lower rates to firm
customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism and do not
directly impact the Company's net income. Gas base revenue is that
portion of gas operating revenue that has a direct impact on net
income. In 1995, gas base revenue decreased approximately $243,000
based on an overall decrease of 3.3% in firm therm sales, due to an
extremely mild heating season.
    In 1994, total gas operating revenue increased by about $200,000,
or 1%, as compared to 1993. Interruptible revenue increased more than
29%, reflecting an improvement in the competitive pricing of gas a
fuel choice for duel-fuel interruptible customers in 1994, as compared
to 1993. Gas base revenue increased slightly in 1994 due to an
increase of 1.3% in therm sales to firm customers. Partially
offsetting this comparative year-over-year increase in gas base
revenue was a full year impact of a voluntary base-rate reduction that
was implemented by the Company's Massachusetts retail operating
subsidiary in December 1993.
    Other Revenue of $940,954 in 1995 and $624,560 in 1994 was
principally derived from Unitil Resources, the Company's energy
consulting subsidiary, which began providing consulting services to
non-affiliate companies in mid-1993. These consulting services have
chiefly related to the provision of administrative, management, and
power brokering services. One of Unitil Resources principal customers
terminated its  service agreement with the Company as of December 31,
1995, which will reduce Unitil Resource's contributions to earnings in
1996, unless new agreements are entered into to replace the revenue
that was billed under this former agreement.

OPERATING EXPENSES 

    Fuel and Purchased Power reflects the cost of fuel used in
electric generation and wholesale energy and capacity purchased to
meet the Unitil System's electric energy requirements. Fuel and
purchased power expenses (normally recoverable from customers through
periodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms) increased $2.0 million,
or 2.2% in 1995 compared to 1994. The change reflects an increase in
the System's total energy requirements in 1995, partially offset by
reduction in the average unit cost of the System's power supply
portfolio. Power supply markets continued to be very competitive in
1995, providing many opportunities to achieve cost savings through
active participation in the market and management of the System's
resource portfolio. The combined resource portfolio of the Unitil
System is comprised of a variety of power supply sources, including
owned generation, utility purchase power contracts and purchases from
non-utility generators. The Unitil System's total energy supply
resources for 1995 were comprised of: 16% from subsidiary-owned
generation; 61% from various utility-purchased power contracts; and
23% representing purchases from non-utility generation units. 
    In 1994 compared to 1993, fuel and purchase power expenses were
relatively unchanged reflecting favorable pricing of existing
long-term power supply commitments and competitive short-term power
supply markets. 
    Purchased Gas reflects gas purchased and made to supply the
System's total gas energy requirements. Purchased Gas decreased by
approximately $617,000 or 5.5% in 1995 as compared to 1994.
Significant decreases in gas prices due to favorable gas supply
markets more than offset the 10.5% increase in therms purchased
(including gas purchased for interruptible sales). Purchased Gas
increased by almost $44,000, or 0.4% in 1994 as compared to 1993,
based on an increase of 7.2% in therms purchased, offset by a lower
unit cost of gas. Purchased Gas is normally recoverable from customers
through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism. 
   Under Order 636, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
has allowed gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently incurred costs
resulting from the transition into a deregulated environment.  The
Company's combination gas & electric utility operating subsidiary, has
been incurring FERC-approved transition charges from its natural gas
pipeline supplier since 1992.  Through the end of 1995, the amount of
transition costs incurred by the Company totaled approximately
$2,200,000.  These costs are being recovered directly from gas
customers customers through the cost of gas adjustment mechanism.  On
the basis of estimates included in rate filings before the FERC and
other publicly available information, the Company currently estimates
that it may incur up to an additional $1,200,000 of transition costs
in future years. The Company  expects full recovery of these costs
through billings to customers. 
    Operation and Maintenance expense increased by about $900,000, or
4.2% in 1995 compared to 1994. This increase primarily reflects higher
 conservation and load management program expenditures (which are
recoverable from customers through periodic cost recovery mechanisms).
In 1995, expenditures on this component of operation and maintenance
expenses was over $2.1 million -- a 30% increase over 1994's
conservation and load management program expenditure level. Excluding
these costs, the System's total operating and maintenance costs were
relatively unchanged in 1995 compared to 1994. This performance
primarily reflects the success of the Company's disciplined approach
to cost management practices and procedures. 
    In 1994, Operation and Maintenance expense increased by almost
$900,000 million, or 4.3%. Almost one-third of the increase in
Operating and Maintenance was due to a 20% rise in expenditures on
demand-side management and conservation programs during 1994, as
compared to 1993. The remaining increase in 1994's Operating and
Maintenance reflects modest overall growth of about $500,000, or 2.7%
in the System's operation and maintenance costs.  The majority of this
increase was due to extensive gas distribution system maintenance and
repairs conducted in 1994.

DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION and TAXES

    Depreciation and Amortization expense increased more than 3% for
both 1995 and 1994 over the prior year due primarily to a higher level
of plant in service.

    Amortization of the Cost of Abandoned Properties principally
relates to the abandonment of an investment in the Seabrook Nuclear
Power Plant by the Company's Massachusetts retail operating
subsidiary. A portion of the former investment in this project is
being recovered in rates to electric customers as allowed by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.

    Federal and State Income Taxes  remained relatively unchanged in
1995 compared to 1994 despite an increase in net income before taxes
of approximately $309,000, or 2.5%.  This result primarily reflects
non-recurring tax benefits realized by the Company from a donation of
land to the Park 2000 project in Fitchburg, Massachusetts and the tax
loss realized on the State of New Hampshire's taking by eminent domain
 of the Company's corporate headquarters in Exeter, New Hampshire.
Federal and State Income Taxes increased by $462,000 or 12.5% in 1994
due to higher net income before taxes of approximately $900,000.

    Local Property Taxes increased $353,956, or 13.2%, in 1995. This
increase mainly reflects the annual property tax increases set by
local communities. Local Property taxes increased in 1994, compared to
1993 by 14.4%.

NON-OPERATING EXPENSES

    For 1995, Non-Operating Expenses increased by approximately
$152,700, primarily reflecting  a  $141,000 non-operating loss as a
result of the State of New Hampshire's taking by eminent domain of the
Company's corporate headquarters in Exeter,  New Hampshire.

INTEREST EXPENSE

    Interest Expense, Net  remained relatively unchanged in 1995 over
1994, as  interest income and reduced short-term borrowing costs
offset increased long-term debt related interest costs.  Higher
long-term debt interest costs in1995, compared to the prior year,
reflect the conversion of short-termdebt into long-term debt in late
1994 by the Company's New Hampshire retail operating subsidiaries.
    Interest Expense decreased approximately 12% in 1994 compared to
1993, due primarily to the refinancing of long-term debt at lower
interest rates. Also contributing to lower interest costs was the
general decline in short-term borrowing costs during this period.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY

    The Unitil System companies require capital for the acquisition of
property, plant and equipment in order to improve, protect, maintain
and expand their electric and gas operating systems. Capital necessary
to meet these requirements are derived primarily from the Company's
retained earnings and through the System's Dividend Reinvestment and
Common Share Purchase Plan. When internally-generated funds are not
available, it is the Company's policy to borrow interim funds on a
short-term basis to meet the capital requirements of its subsidiaries
and, when necessary, to repay short-term debt through the issuance of
permanent financing on an individual company basis. The size and
timing of such financings depend on developments in the securities
markets, the ability to meet certain financing covenants and the
receipt of appropriate regulatory approval. The Company attempts to
maintain a conservative capitalization structure, which contributes to
both the stability of Unitil and its ability to market new securities.
The Company has been able to access the financial markets to meet its
capital requirements and does not anticipate a change in its access
to, or the availability of, capital in the coming year.

 Operating Activities (in $000's):
                                      1995     1994     1993
Net Cash Provided by                   
                                                
  Operating Activities              $17,018  $16,349  $12,989
                                      


    Cash flow from operations increased by $0.7 million in 1995 after
increasing by $3.4 million in 1994. These larger cash flow balances in
recent years reflect increased earnings by the Company and  changes in
its working capital requirements, as detailed in the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statements. 

 Investing Activities (in $000's):
                                        1995     1994     1993
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities $12,645   $8,943   $7,714
                                   

    Cash flow from investing activities increased approximately $3.7
million in 1995 as a result of planned spending for utility system
improvements, as well as the State of New Hampshire's taking by
eminent domain of the Company's current headquarters and the
associated commencement of construction of a new corporate
headquarters. Total capital expenditures increased by $5.7 million in
1995, to $14.6 million, reflecting increased spending of approximately
$2.3 million for normal utility system improvements and $3.4 million
for the construction on a new corporate headquarters. These increases
in capital expenditures were offset by proceeds of $2.0 million from
the taking of the Company's corporate headquarters.
    In February 1995 Unitil's corporate headquarters located in
Exeter, New Hampshire was taken by the State of New Hampshire through
eminent domain, in connection with the State's Route 101 highway
expansion project. While the impact of this transaction has been fully
recognized in the financial results for 1995, Unitil is currently
appealing the valuation placed upon its land and building by the State
during the taking process and is seeking additional compensation. As a
result of this taking, the Company purchased land in Hampton, New
Hampshire during 1995 and began construction of a new corporate
headquarters, which is scheduled for completion during the summer of
1996.
    In 1996, total capital expenditures are expected to approximate
$18.9 million. This projection reflects capital expenditures of
approximately $14.8 million for normal utility system expansions,
replacements and other improvements and capital expenditures of
approximately $4.1 million related to the completion of construction
of its new corporate headquarters.

 Financing Activities (in $000's):
                                       1995     1994     1993
Net Cash Used In Financing Activities                      
 Financing                           $4,785   $5,301   $5,789

    The change in  cash flows from financing activities in 1995
compared to 1994 primarily reflects increases in the System's
short-term borrowings and capitalized lease obligations at year end as
detailed in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.  Short term
borrowing requirements are met through Unitil's committed credit
facilities with three different banks, which currently total $10
million. 
    No long-term debt was issued by any of the Unitil System companies
during 1995, however during both 1994 and 1993 Unitil's three retail
operating companies  completed private placements of long-term debt.
The funds generated by these transactions were primarily used to repay
the short-term indebtedness incurred by each System company to fund
their ongoing construction programs, and  to redeem higher coupon
long-term debt issues prior to their maturity. The impact of these
transactions has been to lower the average cost of the System's
long-term debt portfolio.
    The Company does expect to undertake a long-term financing for
Unitil Realty Corp. during 1996, following the completion of
construction on its new corporate headquarters. The purpose of this
financing will be to repay short-term debt incurred to finance
construction of the building.
    During 1995, the Company raised $1,009,499 of additional common
equity capital through the issuance of 58,457 shares of common stock
in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Tax Deferred Savings
and Investment plans.  The Company raised $1,037,809 of additional
common equity capital in 1994 and $880,154 of additional equity
capital in 1993, through the respective issuance of 58,229 and 46,291
shares of common stock in connection with these plans. The Company
also issued shares during each of the years from 1993 through 1995 as
a result of the exercise of options granted under the Company's Key
Employee Stock Option Plan (KESOP). The total number of shares issued
under the KESOP plan in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 3,291 shares, 4,110
shares and 6,966 shares, respectively.

REGULATORY MATTERS

    At the state level in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and at
the federal level, recent regulatory activity has focused on
determining how to deregulate the retail sale of electricity to allow
for a more competitive market.  As the trend continues towards
competition in the electric utility industry, Unitil has actively
participated in industry, legislative and regulatory proceedings on
the issues of competition and industry restructuring at both the
federal and state levels, favoring a reasonable and orderly transition
to competition and more choice for all customers.  
    Both the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (the "NHPUC")
and the New Hampshire Legislature have been involved in discussions
and analysis relative to competition in the industry.  Early in 1995,
the NHPUC  issued an order in response to a petition by a power
marketer seeking to sell to certain industrial customers of an
investor-owned New Hampshire utility.  In that order the NHPUC ruled
that utilities in New Hampshire do not have exclusive franchise
territories as a matter of law and directed the marketer to seek a
declaratory order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
regarding its proposed transactions.  This decision has been appealed
to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  In June 1995  New Hampshire
Senate Bill 168 (SB 168), was signed into law. SB 168 establishes a
legislative committee to consider changes in the structure of the
electric utility industry.  The act also directs the NHPUC to begin a
retail competition pilot program and to act within five months to
establish standards for utility discounts to industrial customers. 
The legislative committee and its subcommittees met regularly during
the summer and fall of 1995.  Several members sponsored new
legislation, including legislation currently being debated that would
require utilities to file restructuring plans with the NHPUC by June
1996, with statewide retail competition by June 1998. The NHPUC has
issued its preliminary guidelines for the retail wheeling pilot
program incorporating implementation by May 1996 and is expected to
issue its final guidelines in March 1996. The NHPUC issued its final
guidelines on discount rates for industrial customers in November
1995.  The NHPUC aproved the Company's Energy BankTM  program in
accordance with these guidelines in December 1995.
    During 1995, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (the
"MDPU") concluded the initial hearings in an electric industry
restructuring docket and has issued an order requiring the three
largest Massachusetts' electric utilities to file restructuring plans
in February1996 and the remaining Massachusetts' electric utilities
(including FG&E) to file restructuring plans three months after the
MDPU issues orders regarding the first three plans.
    CECo, E&H, and FG&E have all received regulatory approval for the
Company's Energy BankTM  program.  Energy Bank is an innovative
economic development program designed to bring low-cost energy to new
and expanding industrial customers. With rates in the range of 5
cents/KWH this program offers electric energy at a price that is equal
to the National Average industrial rate and is 40% below the current
average industrial rate in New England.  In addition to providing
substantial benefits to new and expanding industrial customers in the
form of very competitive and responsive market pricing, Energy Bank
will also provide significant benefits to all the System's customers
in the form of local economic development activity, reduced power
costs, and lower costs to all customers through the issuance of Power
Dividends.
    The last formal regulatory hearings to increase base rates for
Unitil's three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in 1985 for
Concord Electric Company, 1984 for Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light
Company and 1981 for Exeter & Hampton Electric Company.  A majority of
the System's operating revenues are collected under various periodic
rate adjustment mechanisms including: fuel, purchased power, cost of
gas and conservation program cost recovery mechanisms.

ENVIRONMENTAL 

    The Company continues to work with federal and state environmental
agencies to assess the environmental contamination in the vicinity of
former gas manufacturing sites operated by Fitchburg Gas and Electric
Light Company, the Company's  combination gas and electric operating
subsidiary.  Based on information developed over the last several
years, it has been discovered that there is environmental
contamination at a former gas manufacturing plant in Fitchburg, MA
(the Sawyer Passway site).  In December 1995 the Company accepted a
Tier 1B permit from the Massachusetts Department of  Environmental
Protection (DEP) to address the site pursuant to the requirements of
the Massachusetts Contingency Plan.  Further investigations are
necessary to assess the extent and nature of the contamination, and to
evaluate potential remedies.  Reports on those investigations are due
to be filed with the DEP in early 1997. Because these investigations
are at an early stage management cannot, at this time, predict the
costs of future analysis and remediation. The costs of such
assessments and any remedial action determined to be necessary will
initially be funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered
from customers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the MDPU. 
The Company also has a number of liability insurance policies that may
provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

    Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121)
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived
Assets to be Disposed of," will require the Company to  review 
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable.  It is expected that the adoption of this standard will
not have a material impact on the results of operations. financial
condition, or cash flows of the Company.
    Effective for fiscal 1996, SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," is required to be implemented.  This
statement provides the Company with the choice to continue with its
current method of accounting for stock-based compensation or to adopt
a new "fair value" method contained in SFAS No. 123.  The Company
expects to continue with its current method of accounting for
stock-based compensation and to provide the SFAS No. 123 required
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations--- The Company is registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a holding company (with subsidiaries
providing electric service in New Hampshire, electric and gas service
in Massachusetts and consulting services on energy related
matters)under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (1935
Act), and it and its subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the
1935 Act. In addition, the Company and several of its wholly-owned
utility operating subsidiaries; Concord Electric Company (CECo),
Exeter & Hampton Electric Company (E&H), Fitchburg Gas and Electric
Light Company (FG&E), and Unitil Power Corp. (Unitil Power), are
subject to regulation by various other agencies. With respect to their
rates and accounting; two of the retail subsidiaries, CECo and E&H,
are subject to regulation by the New Hampshire Public Utilities
Commission (NHPUC), FG&E is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities (MDPU) and Unitil Power is regulated by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). CECo, E&H, FG&E and
Unitil Power conform with generally accepted accounting principles, as
applied in the case of regulated public utilities, and conform with
the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory
authorities having jurisdiction.

Principles of Consolidation --- Unitil Corporation (the Company) is
the parent company of the Unitil System (the System). The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use of Estimates --- The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition --- The Company's operating subsidiaries record
electric and gas operating revenues based upon the amount of
electricity and gas delivered to customers through the end of the
accounting period. 

Depreciation --- Depreciation provisions for the Company's utility
operating subsidiaries are determined on a group straight-line basis.
Provisions for depreciation were equivalent to the following composite
rates, based on the average depreciable property balances at the
beginning and end of each year: 1995 - 3.48 percent; 1994 - 3.49
percent, and 1993 - 3.53 percent.

Amortization of Abandoned Properties --- FG&E is recovering a portion
of its former investment in the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in rates
to its' customers through a Seabrook Amortization Surcharge as ordered
by the MDPU.

Federal Income Taxes --- Income taxes are accounted for in accordance
with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS
No. 109") "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and
are measured by applying tax rates applicable to the taxable years in
which those differences are expected to reverse.
    The Tax Reduction Act of 1986 eliminated investment tax credits.
Investment tax credits generated prior to 1986 are being amortized,
for financial reporting purposes, over the productive lives of the
related assets.

New Accounting Standards --- Effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 121 (SFAS 121) "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and For Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," will require a review of
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. It is expected that the adoption of this standard will
not have a material impact on the cash flows, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.
    Effective for fiscal 1996, SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," is required to be implemented.  This
statement provides the Company with the choice to continue with its
current method of accounting for stock-based compensation or to adopt
a new "fair value" method contained in SFAS No. 123.  The Company
expects to continue with its current method of accounting for
stock-based compensation and to provide the SFAS No. 123 required
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.

Reclassifications --- Reclassification of amounts are made
periodically to previously issued financial statements to conform with
the current year presentation.
Note 2: Common Stock

New Shares Issued --- During 1995, the Company raised $1,009,499 of
additional common equity capital through the issuance of 58,457 shares
of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan and Employee 401(k)Tax Deferred Savings and Investment
Plan.  The Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan provides
participants in the plan a method for investing cash dividends on the
Company's Common Stock and cash payments in additional shares of the
Company's Common Stock. The Employee 401(k)Tax Deferred Savings and
Investment Plan is described  in Note 9 below. In 1994, the Company
raised $1,037,809 of additional common equity capital through the
issuance of 58,229 shares of common stock in connection with these
plans. 
    The Company maintains a Key Employee Stock Option Plan (KESOP ),
which provides for the granting of options to key employees.  The
number of shares granted under this plan, as well as the terms and
conditions of each grant , are determined by the Board of Directors,
subject to plan limitations. All options granted under the KESOP
expire within ten years of the grant date, and no option can be issued
under the current plan after 1999.  The plan provides for dividend
equivalents on options granted, which are recorded as compensation
expense.  The total compensation expenses recorded by the Company with
respect to this plan were $248,127, $180,475 and $177,425 for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
    Share Option Activity of the KESOP is presented in the following
table:

                                   1995          1994         1993

Range of Option Grant Price    $12.11-$14.93 $12.11-$17.74 $12.11-$17.74
 per Share


Restrictions on Retained Earnings ---Unitil Corporation has no
restriction on the payment of common dividends from retained earnings.
Its three retail distribution subsidiaries do have restrictions. Under
the terms of the First Mortgage Bond Indentures, CECo and E&H had
$5,402,238 and $8,031,846, respectively, available for the payment of
cash dividends on their common stock at December 31, 1995. Under the
terms of long-term debt Purchase Agreements, FG&E had $11,500,927 of
retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends on its
common stock at December 31, 1995.

Note 3: Preferred Stock

    Certain of the Unitil subsidiaries have redeemable Cumulative
Preferred Stock outstanding and one subsidiary, CECo, has a
Non-Redeemable, Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock issue outstanding. All
such subsidiaries are required to offer to redeem annually a given
number of shares of each series of Redeemable Cumulative Preferred
Stock and to purchase such shares that shall have been tendered by
holders of the respective stock. All such subsidiaries may redeem, at
their option, the Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock at a given
redemption price, plus accrued dividends.
    The aggregate purchases of Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock
during 1995, 1994 and 1993 were: 1995 - $94,700; 1994 - $104,100; and
1993 - $78,800. The aggregate amount of sinking fund requirements of
the redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock for each of the five years
following 1995 are $206,000 per year. 

Note 4: Long-Term Debt

    On October 14, 1994, CECo arranged for the private placement, at
par, of $6,000,000 of 30-year Series I First Mortgage Bonds, bearing a
fixed annual interest rate of 8.49% and maturing in 2024. The proceeds
of this financing were utilized to repay short-term indebtedness and
to redeem two higher coupon long-term debt issues prior to their
maturity. The redemption's included $930,000 of Series D First
Mortgage Bonds, 8.70%, due November 15, 2001, and $1,500,000 of Series
G First Mortgage Bonds, 9.85%, due October 15, 1997.
    On October 14, 1994, E&H arranged for the private placement, at
par, of $9,000,000 of 30-year Series K First Mortgage Bonds, bearing a
fixed annual interest rate of 8.49% and maturing in 2024. The proceeds
of this financing were utilized to repay short-term indebtedness and
to redeem three higher coupon long-term debt issues prior to their
maturity. The redemption's included $1,235,000 of Series F First
Mortgage Bonds, 8.70%, due November 15, 2001, $930,000 of Series G
First Mortgage Bonds, 8.875%, due April 1, 2004, and $1,400,000 of
Series I First Mortgage Bonds, 9.85%, due October 15, 1997.
    Under the terms of both CECo's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of
Trust and the supplemental indenture thereto relating to long-term
debt, the sinking fund requirements of CECo's Series C  Bonds may be
satisfied by certifying to the Mortgage Trustee net additional
property in lieu of making cash redemptions.  In 1995 and 1994, CECo
satisfied its requirements with respect to its Series C Bonds by
certifying to the Mortgage Trustee net additional property. In 1995,
sinking fund payments relating to long-term debt amounted to $112,000.

    Certain of the loan agreements contain provisions which, among
other things, limit the incurrence of additional long-term debt.
    The aggregate amount of sinking fund requirements and normal
scheduled redemptions for each of the five years following 1995 are:
1996-$1,294,000; 1997-$1,294,000; 1998-$4,307,000; 1999-$2,290,000,
and 2000-$2,290,000.
    The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based
on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities. In management's opinion,  the carrying value of the debt
approximated its fair value at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

Note 5: Credit Arrangements

    At December 31, 1995, the Company had unsecured committed bank
lines for short-term debt aggregating $10,000,000 with three banks for
which it pays commitment fees.  At December 31, 1995, the unused
portion of the committed credit lines outstanding was $7,300,000.  The
average interest rates on all short-term borrowings were  6.59% and
4.43% during 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Note 6: Leases

    The Company's subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations
in leased facilities and also lease some of their operations and
office equipment. FG&E has a facility lease for twenty-two years which
began in February 1981. The lease allows five, five-year renewal
periods at the option of FG&E. The equipment leases include a
twenty-five-year lease, which began on April 1, 1973, for a combustion
turbine and a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporization facility.
This lease provides for a ten-year renewal period at the option of
FG&E. In addition, FG&E leases some equipment under operating leases.

    At December 31, 1995, the Company has the following deferred tax
assets and liabilities recorded for temporary differences which
originated as a result of the application of the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation"; a regulatory asset of approximately
$22,400,000 which is included in Other Deferred Assets, a regulatory
liability of approximately $7,500,000 which is included in Other
Deferred Liabilities, and additional deferred tax liabilities of
approximately $14,900,000 which are included in certain of the amounts
listed below.
    SFAS No. 109, adopted on January 1, 1993,  requires the use of the
asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes on
all temporary differences. The major temporary differences which give
rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 1995, are
as follows:

               Deferred Income Taxes for the Year Ended December 31,

Note 8: Joint Ownership Units

    FG&E is participating, on a tenancy-in-common basis with other New
England utilities, in the ownership of three generating units. New
Haven Harbor is a dual-fired oil-and-gas station, and Wyman Unit No. 4
is an oil-fired station. They have been in commercial operation since
August 1975 and December 1978, respectively. Millstone Unit No. 3, a
nuclear generating unit, has been in commercial operation since April
1986. Kilowatt-hour generation and operating expenses of the joint
ownership units are divided on the same basis as ownership. FG&E's
proportionate costs are reflected in the 1995 Consolidated Statements
of Earnings. Information with respect to these units is set forth in
the table below:

Note 9:  Benefit Plans

Pension Plans --- Four of the Company's subsidiaries have Retirement
and Pension plans and related Trust Agreements to provide retirement
annuities for participating employees at age 65. These subsidiaries
follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, Employer's Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87). The entire cost
of the plans is borne by the respective subsidiaries.

    Plan assets are invested in common stock, short-term investments
and various other fixed income security funds.
    The weighted-average discount rates used in determining the
projected benefit obligation in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 7.75%, 8.25%,
and 7.75%, respectively, while the rate of increase in future
compensation levels was   4.50 %, 4.50%, and 4.50%, respectively. The
expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9.50% in each of the
years 1995, 1994 and 1993.
    Effective January 1, 1987, Unitil Service Corp. adopted a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is an unfunded
retirement plan with participation limited to executives selected by
the Board of Directors. The cost associated with the SERP amounted to
$60,000; $53,000; and $53,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively. 

Employee 401(k) Tax Deferred Savings Plan--- The Company sponsors a
defined contribution plan ((under Section 401 (k) of the Internal
Revenue Code)) covering substantially all of the Company's employees.
Participants may elect to defer from 1% to 12% of current compensation
to the plan. The Company matches contributions, with a maximum
matching contribution of 3% of current compensation. Employees may
direct the investment of their savings plan balances into a variety of
investment options, including a Company common stock fund.
Participants are 100% vested once completing three years of service in
contributions made on their behalf. The Company's share of
contributions to the plan were $308,454; $284,248; and $266,645 for
the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Post-Retirement Benefits --- Effective as of January 1, 1993, the
Company's subsidiaries significantly modified the duration of
post-retirement health care benefits. From that date forward, all
current retirees were offered such benefits only for an additional
twelve-month period and all future retirees will be entitled to such
benefits for a twelve-month period following their retirement. The
Company's subsidiaries continue to provide life insurance coverage to
retirees by making monthly premium payments to a life insurer. Life
insurance and limited health care post-retirement benefits required
the Company to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 106,"Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement
Benefits Other than Pensions --- (SFAS 106). For 1995 and 1994, the
costs associated with providing health care and life insurance
benefits under this arrangement were $86,522 and $82,625. This
statement requires accrual accounting for postretirement benefits
during the employee's years of service with the Company and the
recognition of the actuarially determined total postretirement benefit
obligation earned by existing retirees. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (transition
obligation) was approximately $364,000 and $385,000, respectively,
under SFAS 106. This obligation is being recognized on a delayed basis
over the average remaining service period of active participants and
such period will not exceed 20 years. The Company has omitted certain
disclosures relating to SFAS 106, as the accumulated post-retirement
benefit obligation (transition obligation) is not material.

Note 10:  Commitments and Contingencies

Environmental Matters --- The Company continues to work with federal
and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental
contamination in the vicinity of former gas manufacturing sites
operated by Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, the Company's 
combination gas and electric operating subsidiary.  Based on
information developed over the last several years, it has been
discovered that there is environmental contamination at a former gas
manufacturing plant in Fitchburg, MA (the Sawyer Passway site).  In
December 1995 the Company accepted a Tier 1B permit from the
Massachusetts Department of  Environmental Protection (DEP) to address
the site pursuant to the requirements of the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan.  Further investigations are necessary to assess the extent and
nature of the contamination, and to evaluate potential remedies. 
Reports on those investigations are due to be filed with the DEP in
early 1997. Because these investigations are at an early stage
management cannot, at this time, predict the costs of future analysis
and remediation. The costs of such assessments and any remedial action
determined to be necessary will initially be funded from traditional
sources of capital and recovered from customers under a rate recovery
mechanism approved by the MDPU.  The Company also has a number of
liability insurance policies that may provide coverage for
environmental remediation at this site. 

Regulatory ---  At the state level in both New Hampshire and
Massachusetts, and at the federal level, recent regulatory activity
has focused on determining how to deregulate the retail sale of
electricity to allow for a more competitive market.  As the trend
continues towards competition in the electric utility industry, Unitil
has actively participated in industry, legislative and regulatory
proceedings on the issues of competition and industry restructuring at
both the federal and state levels, favoring a reasonable and orderly
transition to competition and more choice for all customers. 
Both the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (the "NHPUC") and
the New Hampshire Legislature have been involved in discussions and
analysis relative to competition in the industry.  Early in 1995, the
NHPUC  issued an order in response to a petition by a power marketer
seeking to sell to certain industrial customers of an investor-owned
New Hampshire utility.  In that order the NHPUC ruled that utilities
in New Hampshire do not have exclusive franchise territories as a
matter of law and directed the marketer to seek a declaratory order
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding its proposed
transactions.  This decision has been appealed to the New Hampshire
Supreme Court.  In June 1995  New Hampshire Senate Bill 168 (SB 168),
was signed into law. SB 168 establishes a legislative committee to
consider changes in the structure of the electric utility industry. 
The act also directs the NHPUC to begin a retailcompetitionpilot
program and to act within five months to establish standards for
utility discounts to industrial customers.  The legislative committee
and its subcommittees met regularly during the summer and fall of
1995, and several members sponsored new legislation, including
legislation currently being debated that would require utilities to
file restructuring plans with the NHPUC by June 1996, with statewide
retail competition by June 1998. The NHPUC has issued its preliminary
guidelines for the retail wheeling pilot program incorporating
implementation by May 1996 and is expected to issue its final
guidelines in March 1996. The NHPUC issued its final guidelines on
discount rates for industrial customers in November 1995.  The NHPUC
aproved the Company's Energy Bank program in accordance with these
guidelines in December 1995.
During 1995, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (the
"MDPU") concluded the initial hearings in an electric industry
restructuring docket and has issued an order requiring the three
largest Massachusetts' electric utilities to file restructuring plans
in February1996 and the remaining Massachusetts' electric utilities
(including FG&E) to file restructuring plans three months after the
MDPU issues orders regarding the first three plans.
CECo, E&H, and FG&E have all received regulatory approval for the
Company's Energy Bank program.  Energy Bank is an innovative economic
development program designed to bring low-cost energy to new and
expanding industrial customers. With rates in the range of 5 cents/KWH
this program offers electric energy at a price that is equal to the
National Average industrial rate and is 40% below the current average
industrial rate in New England.  In addition to providing substantial
benefits to new and expanding industrial customers in the form of very
competitive and responsive market pricing, Energy Bank will also
provide significant benefits to all the System's customers in the form
of local economic development activity, reduced power costs, and lower
costs to all customers through the issuance of Power Dividends.
The last formal regulatory hearings to increase base rates for
Unitil's three retail operating subsidiaries occurred in 1985 for
Concord Electric Company, 1984 for Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light
Company and 1981 for Exeter & Hampton Electric Company.  A majority of
the System's operating revenues are collected under various periodic
rate adjustment mechanisms including: fuel, purchased power, cost of
gas and conservation program cost recovery mechanisms.

Litigation --- The Company is also involved in other legal and
administrative proceedings and claims of various types which arise in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of the Company's
management, based upon information furnished by counsel and others,
the ultimate resolution of these claims will not have a material
impact on the Company's  financial position.

Purchased Power and Gas Supply Contracts --- FG&E and Unitil Power
have commitments under long-term contracts for the purchase of
electricity and gas from various suppliers. Generally, these contracts
are for fixed periods and require payment of demand and energy
charges. Total costs under these contracts are included in Electricity
and Gas Purchased for Resale in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. These costs are normally recoverable in revenues under
various cost recovery mechanisms.

The status of the electric purchased power contracts at December 31,
 1995, was as follows:

	A three year Agreement made and entered into this 25th day of
June, 1995 by and between EXETER & HAMPTON ELECTRIC COMPANY, a New Hampshire
corporation hereinafter referred to as the "Company," and LOCAL UNION
NO. 1837, Unit #1 of the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS,
and the EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY who have designated Local Union No. 1837,
Unit #1, of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to act for
them as their collective bargaining agent, all hereinafter referred to as
the "Union,"

	WHEREAS, the Union represents a majority of the employees of the
Company in the Line Department (including lineworkers, utility plant
inspector, stock and plant clerks),

Meter Department and meter readers and has been designated by said majority
to be the exclusive representative of all employees of the said departments
for the purpose of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages,
hours of work, and other conditions of employment and,

	WHEREAS, both the Company and the Union desire to promote harmony
and efficiency in the working forces so that the employees and the Company
may obtain mutual economic advantage consistent with the duty of the Company,
as a public utility, at all times to provide an adequate and uninterrupted
supply of electric service in the territory and communities which it serves,

	NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements hereinafter set forth, it is agreed as follows:



                       ARTICLE I:  RECOGNITION OF UNION

	The Company recognizes the Union to be the exclusive representative
of all the employees in the Line, Plant Records and Inspection, Meter, and
Stores Departments holding the positions set forth on the attached "Schedule
Of Wages," for the purposes of collective bargaining.


ARTICLE II

A.	Union Security

1.All employees who are at present members of the Union or may
  hereafter become members of the Union shall remain members in good standing
  in the Union during the term of this Agreement as a condition of their
  employment by the Company.  New employees covered by the Agreement shall be
  required to apply for membership in the Union at the end of ninety (90) days
  of continuous employment and remain members in good standing in the Union as
  a condition of their continued employment during the term of the Agreement
  and the Union agrees to accept such new employees into membership in the
  Union in accordance with its By-Laws.  The term "member in good standing" is
  understood to be a Union member whose dues are paid in accordance with the
  By-Laws and Constitution of the Union.

2.The Company shall not use outside contractors to perform work
  regularly done by its regular employees if so doing would result in any
  regular employee being discharged, laid off, or transferred to another job.


B.	No Discrimination

The Company and the Union agree that the operation or application of various
provisions of the Agreement shall in no way serve to discriminate against
any individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment or otherwise affecting status as an employee
because of such individual's age, race, color, creed, sex or national origin.  


C.	Safety

1.The Company will continue to make reasonable regulations for the
  safety and health of its employees during their hours of employment.  The
  Company's Safety Program shall provide for the involvement of the Union in
  its various aspects, including courses of action to avoid personal injury
  and damage to equipment, the proper use of materials, review of safety
  instructions, accidents, first aid measures, and to provide input through
  the Company Safety Committees for modification and/or adoption of safety
  instructions.

2.Whenever an Accident Investigation Report is made, as to an accident
  in which an employee represented by the Union is involved, the employee and
  the Chief Steward will receive a copy of the Investigation Report.

   
D.	Payroll Deductions for Union Dues

The Company agrees to make weekly payroll deductions for Union dues upon
written authorization of employees who are Union members with their
signatures properly witnessed and to forward monthly the amounts so
deducted to the Union.



ARTICLE III:  WAGES AND HOURS

  life of this Agreement.

2.The Company may hire new employees in any job classification at any
  rate of pay down to 15% below the straight-time hourly rate for such job
  classification as shown on the attached Schedule of Wages; provided, however,
  that if retained in service, the employee must be increased to the straight
  time hourly rate of pay for the job classification within six (6) months of
  the date of hire or at such earlier date that the employee becomes fully
  qualified to perform the duties of the job classification.

3.An employee promoted to another job classification will be paid
  during the first six (6) months in the new job classification at an hourly
  rate which is the average of the rates shown on the attached Schedule of
  Wages for the employee's prior job classification and the new job
  classification.

4.The hourly rate for the Lead Lineworker job classification is set by
  adding one ($1.00) dollar to the Lineworker-First Class hourly rate.

5.The hourly rate for Lineworkers when performing 34.5 kV rubber
  gloving is set by adding one dollar ($1.00) per hour to the similar
  lineworker's wage.  If assigned this higher wage rate for two (2) hours or
  more, the employee shall receive this rate for the normal eight (8) hours
  of the day.

6.The hourly rate for Utility Lineworkers and Lineworkers temporarily
  filling the position is set by adding forty ($.40) cents per hour to the
  similar Lineworker's hourly rate.

7.The hourly rate for Utility Clerks or Assistant Utility Clerks is
  set by adding forty ($.40) cents per hour to the similar clerks rate.

8.The hourly rate for Lead Meter Mechanic job classification is set by
  adding one ($1.00) dollar to the Meter Mechanic Class I hourly rate.

			

B.	Working Hours

1.The normal work week shall be forty (40) hours, and the normal work
  day shall be eight (8) hours, 7 AM to 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday, with
  one-half hour out for lunch, the normal lunch period being from 12 noon to
  12:30 PM.  These hours do not apply to the Utility Lineworker or to the
  Utility Clerk except during training periods.  Employees working off the

  by mutual agreement, take a 20 minute lunch break and will be paid overtime
  for the normal 30 minute lunch period at the appropriate rate.

2.Utility Lineworkers shall rotate shifts equally on a monthly cycle.
  Other shift rotations may be agreed to by management, provided the cycles
  are of equal duration.

   a.The normal work week of the Utility Lineworker on Shift A shall be
     forty (40) hours and the normal work day shall be eight (8) hours on

  shall be the regular 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM work day, Monday through Friday.



C.	Standby Clause

One qualified lineworker will be assigned to standby duty each week during
the year.  Standby duty consists of a qualified lineworker remaining within
reach of a telephone or pager so that an employee on standby duty may be
notified to report for work in cases of emergency outside of regularly
scheduled working hours.  Standby duty does not require any interruption of
employee's normal life except to the extent of making arrangements so that
the employee can be reached by telephone or pager within a reasonable driving
time from the place the employee normally reports for work. 

1.Standby duty shall be for the hours beginning at 3:30 PM Friday
  extending through the following Friday and ending at 7:00 AM Monday.
  Employees assigned to standby duty shall be paid fourteen (14) hours
  straight-time pay, plus three (3) hours straight-time pay for a week in which
  a holiday falls and the Lineworker is on standby the full twenty-four (24)
  hours of that holiday.  The hours beginning 7:00 AM Friday and ending
  11:00 PM Saturday will be excluded from the second Lineworkers standby.   

D.	Overtime

1.Double time shall be paid for all hours worked on Sunday and holidays
  and time and one-half paid for all other hours worked outside of the normal
  work day or week.

2.When called out from their homes at time other than regular working
  hours employees shall receive an amount not less than that equal to four (4)
  hours straight-time pay when called out before midnight, and an amount not
  less than that equal to six (6) hours straight-time pay when called out
  after midnight.  However, these call out minimums shall not apply when the
  hours worked are concurrent or connects with the employees beginning or end
  of their normal working hours.
  Time will begin immediately upon traveling to report to work and end
  upon returning home or their first stop upon being released from work not to
  exceed thirty (30) minutes each way unless such time is continuous with the
  regular work day or employee takes meal time while in route.  Employees are
  expected to be fair and reasonable when charging for travel time.

3.When practicable, overtime work will be distributed equally among
  all employees of the department concerned.  All overtime shall be included
  for the purposes of tracking employee unscheduled and scheduled overtime
  work.  The Company shall not, however, be required to schedule overtime or
  to modify overtime schedules to accommodate employees whose normal work week
  is other than 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday.

4.Employees assigned to work on planned weekend overtime will be
  notified as to the hours to be worked on the immediately preceding Friday
  by 3:30 PM, but only after being alerted on the immediately preceding
  Thursday of the anticipated Saturday work.  The above mentioned Saturday
  planned weekend overtime relates to normal Company work and not customer
  related requests or other unforeseen circumstances.
  In the event of inclement weather, employees shall be dismissed
  immediately and if this dismissal occurs before or at the first half hour
  of work, employees shall be paid four (4) hours at straight time pay.  If
  dismissal due to weather should take place after the first half hour of
  work the employees shall receive the greater of, four hours at straight pay
  or time and one half for hours worked.

5.The Company reserves the right to limit and assign the number of
  employees to any planned and scheduled overtime provided the current
  overtime list is followed.

6.If a holiday falls on one (1) of the first five (5) days that an
  employee is regularly scheduled to work during a payroll week, in addition
  to holiday pay he will receive double time for each hour worked.

7.If an employee is required to work sixteen (16) or more consecutive
  hours, a period of eight (8) hours off will be allowed before returning
  to work unless an emergency arises which makes it necessary for the Company
  to call the employee back to work before the expiration of the eight-hour (8)
  period.  Employees working over sixteen (16) consecutive hours will be paid
  double time for the consecutive hours worked beyond sixteen (16).  Any part
  of the eight-hour (8) period which extends into the employee's normal work
  schedule will be paid for at normal straight-time rates.  
 	Time allowed off for meals will not prevent the hours worked from
  being considered as consecutive.  If an employee is called and reports for
  work within two (2) hours of the time the employee went off duty or in the
  case where prior consecutive hours worked were sixteen (16) or greater,
  within eight (8) hours of the time of going off-duty, the time off will not
  prevent the hours worked thereafter from being considered as consecutive
  with the previous hours worked.

8.Unless an emergency arises, an employee who is required to work
  during unscheduled hours between midnight and the beginning of the normal
  work schedule, the employee will be entitled to a minimum aggregate of
  seven (7) hours of rest time between midnight and the beginning of the
  normal work schedule.  If such rest time extends into the employee's normal
  workday, no reduction in pay will be made for the hours overlapping the
  normal workday. Rest time extending into the normal work schedule and having
  a duration of three (3) hours or less may be taken at the end of, rather
  than the beginning of, the normal work day, provided 50% of time worked
  occurred after 3:30 AM.  If more than 50% of time worked occurred before
  3:30 AM, rest time must be taken at the beginning of the workday.  For the
  purposes of this overtime section, unscheduled is defined as unanticipated
  call outs from an employees home, otherwise, overtime is considered planned
  and scheduled.



E.	Holidays

1.Unless assigned to work, employees shall not be required to work on
  holidays set forth herein when such days come, or are celebrated, in their
  scheduled work week, and if not assigned to work, shall be paid for each
  such day an amount equal to eight (8) hours straight-time. Holidays shall
  be considered to be the following days:  New Year's Day, Washington's
  Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans'
  Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

2.Two (2) additional days each year will be designated as "Floating
  Holidays", one of which shall be taken between January 1 and June 30,
  subject to the same provisions of this Agreement as any other designated
  holiday. The date of the floating holidays for each individual employee may
  be taken upon such day as the employee may elect upon a minimum of two (2)
  weeks notice in writing provided that, in the judgment of the Company, the
  absence on such day will not impair the Company's operation and further
  provided that the floating holidays will not be granted during the
  employee's scheduled vacation.

3.If a holiday falls on a day on which an employee is not regularly
  scheduled to work and the employee does not work on such a holiday, the
  employee shall receive holiday pay (an amount equal to eight [8] hours
  straight-time pay) or at the discretion of the Company, a day off in lieu
  of such holiday pay; provided, however, that the Company shall have no
  obligation to grant a particular day off if the granting of such day off
  would require the Company to pay a premium rate of pay to another employee
  to fill in for the employee taking the day off.


F.	Friday After Thanksgiving

The Friday after Thanksgiving will be a day off with pay (an amount equal
to eight [8] hours straight-time pay) and will be treated as a Saturday for
all other provisions of the Agreement.


G.	Vacations

Vacation is an accrued time off from work with pay benefit.  Individual
vacation time is accrued within the same calendar year that the vacation is
taken and accrues only during the full-pay periods.  The rate of accrual is
based upon length of employment.  Vacation time can only be converted into
dollars when an employee terminates or retires and has not taken accrued
vacation time.  Vacation pay will be equal to the amount the employee would
have received if regular hours had been worked during the same time period
(does not include overtime).

		Vacation time: (Subject to the provisions above)

		         A new employee hired prior to June 1, upon completion of six (6) 
           months of employment, is entitled to one (1) week of vacation 
           within the calendar year hired.
           An employee who is expected to complete one (1) full year of 
           employment by December 31 of any calendar year will be entitled 
           to two (2) weeks of vacation during the calendar year until the 
           fifth (5th) year of employment.
           An employee who is expected to complete at least five (5) years 
           of employment by December 31 of any calendar year will be entitled
           to three (3) weeks of vacation during the calendar year until the 
           tenth (10th) year of employment.
           An employee who is expected to complete at least ten (10) years 
           of employment by December 31 of any calendar year will be entitled
           to four (4) weeks of vacation during the calendar 
           year until the eighteenth (18th) year of employment.
           An employee who is expected to complete at least eighteen (18)
           years of employment by December 31 of any calendar year will
           be entitled to five (5) weeks of vacation during the calendar year.

           An employee who terminates is entitled only to that percentage of
vacation that is equivalent to the percentage of the calendar year in which 
the person was an employee and receiving full pay.

	Employees retiring from active employment under a Company retirement
plan during any calendar year shall be entitled to receive the same vacation
benefit as that which would have been allowed if active employment had
continued for the full calendar year in which retirement takes place.

	Vacation time has to be scheduled in advance with the employee's
immediate supervisor.  Because of scheduling difficulties and work load
requirements, the Company reserves the right to schedule any vacation time
in excess of two (2) weeks.

	In the event an employee is unable to take earned vacation because
of sickness, injury (work or non-work related), or Company work requirements,
such earned unused vacation shall be carried over into the next calendar
year.  Except for those situations, vacation time cannot be carried over
into the following year.

	In the event that an employee suffers a serious illness or injury
(verified by a physician) during their scheduled vacation and notifies their
supervisor of such as soon as possible, that portion of vacation period
during which the employee is incapacitated may be rescheduled at the option
of the Company to another time during the same calendar year.  Vacation will
continue to accrue during jury duty and two-week (2) military reserve duty.



H.	Classification Changes	

1.	Reclassification

   a.	When an employee is temporarily assigned to a higher wage 
      classification for a period of two (2) hours, or more, the employee 
      shall receive the rate for such classification under Schedule of Wages 
      attached.  

   b.	When a line crew composed of two or more employees is performing
      work during other than normal working hours which requires employee
      supervision at the work site, the senior qualified employee on the crew
      shall be the employee in charge of the other employee or employees unless
      otherwise designated and shall receive the premium as set forth in the 
      temporary foreman mutual working agreement.

2.	Retrogression Pay

   a.	If a regular full-time employee becomes partially incapacitated by
      reason of age or disability (provided that such disability [1] did not
      arise during the course of or as a result of employment by an employer
      other than the Company who is subject to Worker's Compensation statutes,
      or [2] did not arise during the course of or as a result of the employee's
      activity as an independent contractor on a regular basis, or [3] was not
      deliberately caused by or contributed to by the voluntary act of the
      employee) and thus is unable to perform fully the duties of the job
      classification, the Company will endeavor to give other work by placing
      the employee in the highest classification in which the employee is able
      to perform the work assigned and in which there is an available opening.
      The employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity for training to fill
      an available job which carries a rate of pay more nearly equal to the
      original rate, and if the employee becomes qualified for such available
      job, shall be placed in the classification.
      An assignment made under this Article shall continue until the 
      employee's normal retirement date, provided that the employee remains
      qualified to perform the duties required of the job classification.  
      During the period of assignment under this Article, employees shall be 
      paid at the maximum rate for the classifications to which they are 
      assigned, except those employees who have completed ten (10) or more 
      years of continuous service at the time of assignment shall be paid 
      not less than the percentage of their former rates indicated below, 
      such percentage to remain the same for the balance of each employee's 
      active employment.  When rates of pay are adjusted by a general wage 
      adjustment, employees so classified will receive an adjustment in pay 
      in the amount by which the employee's retrogressed classification is 
      adjusted.
 
   b.	Subject to the restrictions imposed by this Article relating to the
      availability of a job opening and the ability of the employee to perform
      the job, an employee suffering an occupational disability resulting from
      sickness or injury contracted in the course of Company employment, shall
      have the option of receiving a rate determined in accordance with the
      following table or such compensation as may be determined by the operation
      of the applicable Worker's Compensation law.

               		Years of Service at
                	Time of Assignment    	Percentages

                     			25 or more     	    100%

                        10 - 14              75%

   c.	The provisions of the foregoing Article shall not impair the right of
      the Company to require an employee to retire under the Company's 
      Pension Plan.

3.	Termination Pay

   a.	If an employee's employment with the Company is terminated due to a
      reduction in work force resulting from automation or the closing of an
      operation, the employee shall, unless retired with pension benefits under
      the Pension Plan, be entitled to receive one-week's (1) pay for each 
      six (6) months (calculated to the nearest six-month (6) period) of 
      service with the Company; provided, however, that an employee receiving
      termination pay shall not be entitled to be rehired under the provisions
      of ARTICLE VII of this contract.  The employee may have the option to 
      take termination pay for up to one (1) full year.

conditions make such work unsafe, or as defined in "a" or "b" below,
employees are expected to perform outdoor work during inclement weather.
As the severity of inclement weather varies and whether or not work can

conditions are such that it warrants cessation of work, consistent with
safety.  The Employer's representative on the job site will be instructed
as to what constitutes inclement weather.  Employees shall not lose any
regular pay because of failure to work outdoors due to inclement weather,

   in the opinion of the Company, interfere with the Company's operations or
   cause undue hardships to other employees, and (b) provided that the request
   for such time off shall be made as far in advance as possible, but in no
   case less than two (2) weeks in advance, and (c) the current Company's
   vacation policy and procedure will be used to establish the number of
   employees within a department that can be off at any one time.  Maximum
   duration per occurrence would be one (1) week. 

3. Leave of Absences to Attend Funerals - In the event of the death of
   a member of the immediate family of an employee, the Company will grant

   to the re-employment of those of its employees who have left or will leave
   their employment with the Company to enter upon service with the armed
   forces of the United States.  When such absence from their duties is

   the period of absence from their duties with this Company of those
   re-employed under this Article, within ninety (90) days of discharge provided
   employee does not re-enlist after compulsory military 	requirements have 
   terminated or no longer exist, shall be computed as part of their total 
   term of service with the Company in determining their seniority, vacation,
   sickness disability benefits, termination pay, and the amount of 
   retirement pension.  The parties interpret said laws as applying with 
   equal force to all members of said armed forces, including the Merchant 
   Marine regardless of the manner by which they may have become members 
   thereof.

2.	The Company agrees to pay to a regular employee, while on National
   Guard or Reserve annual two-week (2) tour of duty, the difference between

EXETER & HAMPTON ELECTRIC COMPANY

                                RETIREMENT PLAN



	A retirement plan is provided for employees and is briefly outlined
        below.



	The word "wages" as hereinafter used, shall mean straight-time wages,
        and shall include no daily or weekly overtime.



Eligibility



	Any employee of the Company shall or may retire on a retirement
benefit subject to the provisions and conditions hereinafter set
forth:



       1. An employee who has attained the Normal Retirement Date (first day
          of the month in which occurs and employee's 65th birthday) and
          ceases active service with the Company shall be entitled to a
          pension.



       2. An employee shall be entitled to retire before attaining the age
          of sixty-five (65) years if the employee becomes unable to perform
          such employee's work for the Company because of a permanent
          disability.  In order to be eligible for a disability pension the
          employee must:



           a.  Be totally disabled.

           b.  The disability must continue for at least six (6) months.

           c.  The employee must have completed at least fifteen (15) years
               of  Credited Service (excluding Credited Service completed
               prior to age 18).

           d.  He must qualify for disability benefits under the Social
               Security Act in effect at the time.

           e.  The disability must not have been incurred while the employee
               was engaged in:

                   (1)     criminal act 

                   (2)     service in the armed forces

                   (3)     habitual drunkenness or addiction to a narcotic

                   (4)     intentional self-inflicted injury

                   (5)     act or disease resulting during the course of
                           employment with an employer other than the Company.





RETIREMENT PLAN (cont.')



       Further, that the disability pension may be discontinued should the
       employee refuse to be examined by a physician designated by the plan.
       The pension would be computed on the basis of the accrual to date of
       such retirement with no actuarial reduction.

       3. An employee with fifteen (15) years of Credited Service and who
          has attained age fifty-five (55) may elect to retire on an Early
          Retirement Date, which may be the first day of any month thereafter
          prior to the employee's Normal Retirement Date. The Company
          requests that the employee notify the Company in writing at least
          ninety (90) days prior to such date of intention to retire early.



Determination of Amount of Normal Retirement Benefit



	A.	Basis:
                The basis for the computation of the amount of the retirement
                benefit shall be the employee's average monthly wage for the
                last five (5) years of Credited Service or the employee's
                average monthly wages for any consecutive five-year period
                during the employee's last twenty (20) years of Credited
                Service, whichever amount is larger.



	B.	Amount:
                Based upon average monthly wages determined as above stated,
                the employee shall be eligible for a monthly retirement
                benefit payable in advance, computed as follows:



                1. For each of the first twenty full years of Credited
                   Service - 2% of said average monthly wages, plus

                2. For each full year of Credited Service in excess of twenty
                   full years and not in excess of thirty full years - an
                   additional 1% (one percent) of said average monthly wages,
                   plus

                3. For each full year of Credited Service in excess of
                   thirty years - an additional 1/2 of 1% (one-half percent)
                   of said average monthly wages, such sum to be reduced by:

                4. Fifty (50%) percent of such employee's Primary Social
                   Security Benefit payable under the Federal Social Security
                   Act in effect on December 31, 1970: such reduced sum to be
                   further reduced by:

Normal Form of Benefits



	A.	Monthly Annuity for Life

               An employee who is unmarried at retirement will receive a
               retirement benefit as a monthly annuity for as long as the
               employee lives.  Upon death, no death benefits will be
               payable to any beneficiary.

        B.      Joint and Survivor Annuity with Spouse

                An employee who is married at retirement and who does not
                elect to receive the retirement benefit as a monthly annuity
                for life will receive an actuarially reduced benefit for as
                long as the employee lives with fifty (50%) percent of such
                reduced benefit payable after death to the employee's spouse
                for as long as such spouse lives.  The reduction is based
                upon the life expectancies of the employee and spouse on the
                employee's retirement date.

RETIREMENT PLAN (cont.')



Optional Form of Benefits



	A.	Contingent Annuitant Option
 
                An employee may elect, instead of his retirement benefit as
                heretofore provided, to have reduced retirement benefits made
                commencing on the employee's retirement date and after death
                such reduced payments, or any lesser amount selected by the
                employee, will be continued to the designated beneficiary, if
                living after the employee's death, for the beneficiary's
                lifetime.

        B.      Ten (10) Year Certain and Life Annuity

                An employee may elect that the retirement benefit, payable
                on the retirement date, be reduced with the guarantee that
                not less than one hundred and twenty (120) monthly payments
                will be made either to the employee or the named surviving
                beneficiary who survives him.

        C.      Five (5) Year Certain and Life Annuity

                An employee may elect that the retirement benefit, payable on
                the retirement date, be reduced with the guarantee that not
                less than sixty (60) monthly payments will be made either to
                the employee or the named surviving beneficiary.



                If any of the above options are elected, the provisions for
                a minimum annual retirement benefit shall only apply prior
                to any reductions under the above options.



Minimum Company Contribution to Retirement Benefit



	In no event will the Company pay any employee who retires with
fifteen years of Credited service an annual normal retirement benefit of
less than $1,200 in addition to such sums, if any, as the employee may
receive as "Primary Insurance Benefits" under the Federal Social Security
Act.



Spouse's Benefit



	A Spouse's Benefit shall be payable to an employee's spouse in the
event of the employee's death prior to the Normal Retirement Date, provided
at least fifteen (15) years of Credited Service was completed and the
employee has been married to the surviving spouse for at least one (1) year.





RETIREMENT PLAN (cont.')



	The monthly amount of the Spouse's Benefit shall be one-half of the
amount of Retirement Benefit which would have been payable had the deceased
employee retired, rather than died, on the day before death, reduced,
however, by one (1%) percent for each full year in excess of two (2) by which
the deceased employee's age exceeds his Spouse's age.



	A minimum of fifty ($50.00) dollars per month shall be payable.



	Spouse's Benefit payments shall terminate with the last payment
due preceding death.



Deferred Termination Benefit



	An employee who terminated his employment after five (5) or more
years of Credited Service shall be entitled to a Deferred Termination Benefit
equal to that portion of his Normal Retirement Benefit accrued to the date
employment terminates.

	A Deferred Termination Benefit shall commence on an employee's Normal
Retirement Date, provided, however, that a terminated employee who has
attained age fifty-five (55) and completed fifteen (15) years of Credited
Service may elect to have his benefit commence as of the date such age is
attained and completes such years of Credited Service.

	The specific details of the retirement plan will be as described in
the retirement plan documents.  While the Company expects to continue
indefinitely the benefits provided for under the retirement plan, it agrees
to continue them only for the term of the Contract with the employees of the
Exeter & Hampton Electric Company covered by the Agreement and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Local Union No. 1837,
Unit #1, dated June 25, 1995.

TEMPORARY FOREMAN



The purpose of this agreement is to set guidelines for Temporary Foreman's
pay.



      A. Non-supervisory employees assigned the responsibility of performing
         the duties of a Supervisor shall be designated Temporary Foreman
         and paid an additional 60 cents per hour.

      B. Employees designated as Temporary Foremen will continue to receive
         the rate of pay through the duration of continuous work time as
         long as the conditions for assignment continue to exist.



Temporary Foreman's Pay for Lineworkers



      A. DURING NORMAL WORK HOURS AND SCHEDULED OVERTIME

         A line crew composed of two (2) or more employees, performing work
         during normal working hours or scheduled overtime shall have an
         employee responsible for the vehicle and the project.  This employee
         will be a permanent Lead Lineworker or Temporary Lead Lineworker
         (no Temporary Foreman's pay).  Projects requiring two (2) or more
         line crews shall have an employee responsible for the project.  The
         employee will either be a Permanent Foreman or a person designated
         as a Temporary Foreman.   If the project has four (4) or more
         workers and there are two (2) or more permanent Lead Lineworker
         working together, one (1) will be designated Temporary Foreman.



        A line crew is two (2) or more employees performing electrical system
        maintenance or construction and is working as an individual unit.



    EXAMPLES of projects not requiring a temporary foreman:



	1. Substation work
	2. Running wire
	3. Snow removal
	4. Painting
	5. Second vehicle used as convenience to crew





<PAGE>
TEMPORARY FOREMAN (cont.')



    B. OUTSIDE NORMAL WORK HOURS OR SCHEDULED OVERTIME
       Temporary Foreman

       When a line crew composed of two (2) or more employees is performing
       work during other than normal working hours or scheduled overtime and
       employee supervision is required at the work site, the senior
       qualified employee on the crew shall be the employee in charge of the
       other employee or employees unless otherwise designated and shall
       receive the premium of $.60 (cents) per hour.  This would normally be
       when a crew is on a trouble call without direct supervision at the
       plant.



             EXAMPLE
                                             
                                                                    Temporary
                                                                     Foreman 

                 1. Trouble call - no supervision at plant.
                      a) No Lead Lineworker on crew.                   YES
                      b) One or more Lead Lineworker on crew.          YES

                 2. Trouble call - supervision at plant.
                      a) No Lead Lineworker on crew.                   YES
                      b) One or more Lead Lineworker on crew.           NO

EQUAL SHIFT ROTATIONS


The purpose of this Agreement is to temporarily modify the provisions of
Article III, Section B, 2, concerning equal shift rotations.  This temporary
change shall be in effect through May 30, 1998, the day the present contract
ends unless either party shall provide thirty (30) days written notice to
the other party that it wishes to revert to the actual contract language.
This Working Agreement shall be void on the 30th day after such notice.  

The parties agree that the language of Article III, B, 2, which requires
that Utility Lineworkers rotate shifts equally, shall be modified in
accordance with this Agreement to permit an unequal rotation between
Utility Lineworkers.  Specifically, unless notice as set forth above is
provided so as to cancel this Working Agreement, the parties agree that a
Utility Lineworker may be assigned to the night shift (Shift B) for nine (9)
months and to the day shift (Shift A) for three (3) months while another
Utility Lineworker be assigned the day shift (Shift A) for nine (9) months
and the night shift (Shift B) for three (3) months. The parties may continue
this assignment or other unequal assignments that may be acceptable to the
Company for so long as this Working Agreement is in effect. 


The parties further agree as follows:

  1. Whichever Utility Lineworker is assigned to the day shift (Shift A)
     shall replace, as necessary or as directed by the Company, a night
     shift (Shift B) Utility Lineworker who is on vacation or absent from
     work for other reasons. The rate of pay shall be the replacement
     employees regular straight time pay.
  
  2. Whichever Utility Lineworker is assigned to the night shift (Shift B)
     shall replace, as necessary or as directed by the Company, a day shift
     (Shift A) Utility Lineworker who is on vacation or absent from work for
     other reasons.  The rate of pay shall be the replacement employees
     regular straight time pay.

  3. If the current employees (George Plante and Anthony Travia) filling the
     position of Utility Lineworker either change positions within the
     Company or leave the Company, this agreement shall be considered null
     and void.

  4. A schedule reflecting the unequal shifts for each current Utility
     Lineworker shall be provided to the Company on a yearly basis for the
     term of this Agreement.<PAGE>

METER READING



The purpose of this Agreement is to set guidelines for the completion of
reading assigned meter reading routes.

Employees reading meters must finish their assigned routes each day, unless
weather or other unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion, and
provided the employees have advance knowledge of the route assigned.  If
completion is not feasible, the employee must notify the supervisor or their
designee that completion is not feasible and the circumstances involved.  The
supervisor will consider all relevant factors in determining when work will
cease and make any special arrangements that may be necessary.  With the
exception of Article III, paragraph J., B. of the Labor Agreement, assigning
routes and determining whether or not routes shall or shall not be read; in
part or whole, rests solely with the Company's supervisor or their designee.  





This mutual working agreement will be effective from the date of
execution until May 30, 1998.

OVERTIME


Due to the nature of the Company's business, employees who have the
requirement to be available and/or respond to emergencies are required to
work a reasonable amount of overtime.

Employees in the Line and Meter Departments who are unavailable and/or
unresponsive for a reasonable amount of unscheduled call outs and do not
work a reasonable amount of overtime on a consistent basis shall be subject
to being charged refusals and corrective actions.         

Employees who have obligations out of their immediate control or have
obligations of the legal requirement nature which may affect their
availability and/or response are urged to inform their supervisor or
manager of these special circumstances in advance.

The Company shall periodically (on a minimum of a ninety (90) day period)
review calls made to employees.   Consideration will be given to the number
of opportunities and calls made to employees, the total number of overtime
hours worked,  and the reasons for lack of response. If, as a result of this
review, the Company considers that an employee's lack of availability or
response is excessive a formal meeting will be held with the employee (with
Union representation) in order to address the problem.  A record of this
meeting shall be produced, placed in the employee's personnel file and will
be considered a verbal warning subject to progressive steps as outlined in
the Company's policy (C.03.22 (G), section 4).  

The deterimination as to what is considered excessive shall be when an
employee has worked twenty-six percent (26%) less than the average amount
of overtime hours within their department and the lack of response or
availability is less than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of calls
made to the employee.  Due to the fact that Utility Lineworkers are not
assigned standby duty the determination as to what is considered excessive
regarding the amount of overtime hours worked shall be less than fifty
percent (50%) of the average amount of overtime hours.

         Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants


Administrator of The UNITIL Corporation 
  Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan


          We have audited the accompanying statements of net
assets available for benefits of The UNITIL Corporation Tax
Deferred Savings and Investment Plan as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the related statements of changes in net assets
available for benefits for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free  of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets
available for benefits of The UNITIL Corporation Tax Deferred
Savings and Investment Plan as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the changes in net assets available for benefits for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

    The UNITIL Corporation Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                   December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993


NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

 The following description of The UNITIL Corporation and subsidiaries
 (the "Company") Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan (the
 "Plan") provides only general information.  Participants should
 refer to the Plan agreement for a more complete description of the
 Plan's provisions.

   General

    The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering substantially
    all full-time employees of the Company and its' wholly owned
    subsidiaries UNITIL Service Corporation, Concord  Electric
    Company, Exeter and Hampton Electric Company and Fitchburg Gas
    and Electric Light Company (the "subsidiaries"), who satisfy  the
    eligibility requirements.

   Contributions

    A member may authorize a Basic Employee Contribution from 1% to
    12% with a maximum contribution not to exceed $9,240 in any one
    year.

    The Employer shall contribute as of December 31, of each plan
    year from current or accumulated net  profits on  behalf of each
    member participating in the Plan on December 31, of each plan
    year, an amount equal to 100% of the first 3% of salary the
    employee puts into the plan (except Fitchburg  Gas and Electric
    Light Company Union Employees whose matching is as follows:  
    first year 1%, second year 2%, third year and after 3%).

   Participant Accounts

    Each participant's account is credited with the participant's
    contribution and allocations of (a) the Company's contribution
    and, (b) Plan earnings, and charged (as applicable) with an
    allocation of administrative expenses.  Allocations are based on
    participant earnings or account balances, as defined.  The
    benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that
    can be provided from the participant's vested account.  The Plan
    administrator will pay for substantially all expenses of the
    Plan.

   Vesting

    Participants are immediately vested in their contributions plus
    actual earnings thereon.  Vesting in the Company's matching and
    discretionary contribution portion of their accounts plus actual
    earnings thereon is based on years of continuous  service.  A
    participant is 100 percent vested after three  years of credited
    service. If a participant terminates employment for any reason
    other than disability or retirement, he will be entitled to the
    full amount of contributions he has deposited, plus a percentage
    of his account balance derived from employer contributions based
    upon the following schedule:

    A member will become 100% vested in his account as a result of
    disability, death or retirement.

   Participant Loans Receivable

    Participants may borrow from their fund accounts a minimum of
    $1,000 up to a maximum equal to the lesser of $50,000  or 50% of
    their account balance.  Net loan transactions are treated as a
    transfer to (from) the investment fund from (to) the Participant
    Loans fund.  Loan terms range from 1-5  years.  The loans are
    secured by the balance in the participant's account and bear
    interest at a rate of prime plus one percent (1%).  Principal and
    interest is paid ratably through monthly payroll deductions.

   Payment of Benefits

    On termination of service due to death, disability or retirement,
    a participant may elect to receive either a lump-sum amount equal
    to the value of the participant's vested interest in  his or  her
    account, or annual installments over a fixed number of calendar
    quarters or years.

   Valuation of Investments

    Investments are held by a bank-administered trust fund.  The
    Plan's investments (including investments bought, sold and held
    during the year) are carried at current fair value.  The
    difference between current fair value and the cost of investments
    are reflected in the statement of changes in net assets available
    for plan benefits as unrealized appreciation or (depreciation) in
    fair value of investments.
   
   Guaranteed Insurance Contracts

    The Plan's deposit administration contracts with various
    insurance companies are valued at contract value.  Contract value
    represents contributions made under the  contract, plus  interest
    at the contract rate, less funds used to purchase annuitiesand
    pay administration expenses charged by insurance companies.

 Payment of Benefits

   Benefits are recorded when paid.

 Investment Contract with Insurance Company
   
   The Plan entered into an investment contract with three insurance
   companies (the "Companies").  The Companies maintain the
   contributions in a pooled account.  The account is credited with
   earnings on the underlying investments and charged for Plan
   withdrawals and administrative expenses charged by the insurance
   companies.  The contract is included in the financial statements at
   contract value, as reported to the Plan by the Companies. Contract
   value represents contributions made under the contract, plus
   earnings, less Plan withdrawals and administrative expenses.

   Employees are eligible for membership on either January 1 or July 1
   coincident with or the next day following on which they have both:

    (1)  Attained the age of 18, and
    (2)  Completed 1000 hours of credited service

   reaches his 65th birthday or, if later, the 10th anniversary of the
   date he becomes a participant.

 Forfeitures

   A member who terminates his employment prior to becoming eligible
   for benefits and does not have a 100% vested right to Company
   contributions, forfeits the amounts not vested.  Such forfeited
   amounts are used to reduce future Company contributions.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF PLAN PROVISIONS - Continued

   Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has
   the right under the Plan to terminate the Plan at any time subject
   to the provision of ERISA with respect to its  employees by a
   written resolution with a copy delivered to the trustee.  In the
   event of a Plan termination, participants will become fully vested
   in their accounts.


NOTE C - INVESTMENT PROGRAMS

 The investment programs of the Plan are as follows:

 Participant contributions - upon enrollment and reenrollment, each
 participant shall direct that his contributions are to be invested
 in accordance with any of the following investment options.

 In  the Guaranteed Investment Fund (GIC), which will be invested
    primarily in guaranteed insurance contracts with various
    insurance companies.  At December 31, 1995, there were 186
    participants.

 In the Fidelity Puritan Fund, a Conservative Investment Fund.  This
    fund will be invested in various investments including stocks and
    bonds placing emphasis on income and stability.  At December  31,
    1995, there were 180 participants.

 In the Fidelity Magellan Fund, an Aggressive Investment Fund.  This
    fund will be invested in stocks placing more emphasis on
    investment return and less on stability.  At  December 31, 1995,
    there were 261 participants.

 In The UNITIL Corporation Common Stock Fund (UNITIL Corporation, no
    par value common stock).  At December 31, 1995, there were 217
    participants.

 In any combination of the above funds

 The total number of participants in the plan was 386 at December 31,
 1995, which is less than the sum of the number of participants
 listed above because many were participating in more than one fund.

 Participants may change their investment options quarterly.

 The loan fund had new loans approximating $174,500 and $173,100  and
 repayments on loans approximating $164,000 and $111,100 for 1995 and
 1994, respectively.

   The Board of Directors met five times in 1995.  During 1995,
Directors attended an average of 99% of all meetings of the Board
of Directors held and of all meetings held by all Committees of
the Board on which they served, if any.  

   Section 17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 require
the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more
than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity
securities, to file certain reports of ownership and changes in
share ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the American Stock Exchange and to furnish the Company with copies of
all Section 17(a) and Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based
solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or
written representations from certain reporting persons that such
forms were not required for those persons, the Company believes
that all filing requirements applicable to its officers and
directors during 1995 and through March 1, 1996 were met, except
that G. Arnold Haynes, a director of the Company, filed a Form 4
to report the purchase of 100 shares of Common Stock of the Company
approximately 30 days after such form was required to be filed.

                     Compensation of Directors

   Members of the Board of Directors who are not officers of
Unitil or any of its subsidiaries receive an annual retainer fee of
$7,000 and $500 for each Board meeting attended. Members of the
Executive Committee, who are not officers of Unitil or any of its
subsidiaries, receive an annual retainer fee of $2,000 and $400
for each meeting attended.  Members of the Audit Committee and
Compensation Committee receive an annual retainer fee of $1,000
and $400 for each meeting attended. Those Directors of Unitil who
also serve as Directors of CECo, E&H or FG&E and who are not officers

   In 1992, the Company entered into a Senior Advisory Agreement
with Charles H. Tenney II.  Mr. Tenney was Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board of the Company until his retirement in
1992. The agreement, which is reviewed on an annual basis,
provides that Mr. Tenney will be compensated $105,000 per annum for his
role as Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of the
Company, as well as for other advisory services which he will provide.  In
consideration of this Agreement, Mr. Tenney is waiving all
Board-related fees and retainers that he is otherwise entitled to
receive as a Director of the Company.

    Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

   Charles H. Tenney II served as the Chairman of the
Compensation Committee during fiscal 1995.   Mr. Tenney is  the former
Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, serving as such until his retirement in April 1992.  He
currently has a Senior Advisory Agreement with the Company (see
"Compensation of Directors") and is also Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.

                         Director Emeritus

   The Company has a directors' advisory council composed of
retired members of the Company's Board of Directors.  Each
member, known as a Director Emeritus, is appointed yearly by the Board of
Directors to render advisory services to the Board.  Directors
Emeriti have no vote with respect to any matter acted upon by the
Board, nor is their presence counted for purposes of determining
a quorum. Directors Emeriti Richard L. Brickley, Philip H. Bradley,
Theodore C. Haffenreffer, Jr. and Endicott Smith were initially
appointed to their positions in 1992, 1993, 1994,  and 1995,
respectively.  Directors Emeriti receive an annual retainer of
$7,000 and $500 for each Board meeting attended, as well as
reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with
attendance at any meeting.

               Report of the Compensation Committee
             
   The overall objective of the Company's Board of Directors, and
specifically this Compensation Committee, in setting compensation
for Unitil's executive officers is to foster excellence in the
management of the assets of the Company.  To help meet this
objective, the Committee believes it is important for the Company
to provide compensation to its executive officers which varies
directly with the performance of the Company and to make payment
of annual compensation with both cash and Company stock in place of
all-cash.

   Accordingly, the Company pays both "base" and "variable"
compensation to its officers.  The base component of compensation
is determined under the Unitil System's salary matrix which is
reviewed from time to time by outside consultants as to its
competitiveness.  Variable compensation is based on factors that
measure the success of the Company for any given year and is
governed by the System's Management Performance Compensation Plan
("MPCP") and the profitability of the System's non-utility
subsidiary, Unitil Resources.  The factors under the MPCP relate
to the earnings of the Company and the rate of return achieved on
shareholder-provided equity as well as cost control and the
competitiveness of the rates charged to the Unitil System's
utility customers.  In addition, to further bolster ownership in the
Company by the executive officers, the Company, in 1989,
instituted a "Key Employee Stock Option Plan" with the approval of the
Company's shareholders.  This plan was tailored to emphasize
dividend and stock value growth as a prerequisite to the
maximization of value to the participants.  

   The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Peter
J. Stulgis, is governed by these same plans and objectives.  The
base compensation for Mr. Stulgis was increased by approximately
3.4% in 1995 which reflected the percentage increase in the
Unitil System's salary matrix which covers all non-bargaining unit
employees.  The variable compensation paid to Mr. Stulgis in 1995
was based upon the Unitil System's operating results for 1994
under the MPCP discussed above and a distribution from a performance
pool related to the 1995 results of the System's newly formed
non-utility subsidiary, Unitil Resources.  Under the MPCP, Mr.
Stulgis received a payment in cash and Company stock which
represented 25% of his total compensation.  This MPCP payment is
formula-driven and reflected the achievement in 1994 of earnings
which were above target levels; a rate of return which was in the
89th percentile of peer companies; cost control results which
were at the 100th percentile of peer companies; and residential
utility rates which were at the 97th percentile of the peer group. The
distribution from the Unitil Resources 1995 performance pool was
based upon its contribution to System earnings and was equal to
9.2% of his total compensation.  In setting the compensation of
Mr. Stulgis for 1995, the Committee independently reviewed the
current compensation data for over fifty companies which included all of
the companies used as the peer group in the Stock Performance
Graph shown below.  Based upon this review, the Committee found that
the total compensation to be paid to the CEO fell within the same
range of compensation paid to the CEO's of companies of like size,
location and industry, and believes it was appropriately linked
to corporate performance.

   The Committee also approved the compensation of Unitil's other
executive officers for 1995 following the principles and
procedures outlined in this report.

NOTES:
   (1)The Option Plan authorizes the Committee to provide in
      the award agreements that the participant's right to
      exercise the options provided for therein will be accelerated upon
      the occurrence of a "Change in Control" of Unitil. The term
      "Change in Control" is defined in substantially the same
      manner as in the Severance Agreements as defined below. 
      All of the award agreements entered into with participants in
      the Option Plan to date contain such a "Change in Control"
      provision. Each award agreement also provides that, upon
      the exercise of an option on or after a Change in Control,
      Unitil shall pay to the optionee, within five business days, a
      lump sum cash amount equal to the economic benefit of the
      optionee's outstanding options and associated dividend
      equivalents that the optionee would have received had the
      option remained unexercised until the day preceding the
      expiration of the grant.
   
   (2)Amounts listed in column (d) in the table above do not
      include non-preferential dividend equivalents associated
      with options outstanding.
   

     Unitil maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension
plan and related trust agreement (the "Retirement Plan"), which
provides retirement annuities for eligible employees of Unitil and its
subsidiaries.  Since the Retirement Plan is a defined benefit
plan, no amounts were contributed or accrued specifically for the
benefit of any officer of Unitil under the Retirement Plan. Directors of
Unitil who are not and have not been officers of Unitil or any of
its subsidiaries are not eligible to participate in the
Retirement Plan.

    The table below sets forth the estimated annual
benefits (exclusive of Social Security payments) payable to participants
in the specified compensation and years of service classifications,
assuming continued active service until retirement.  The average
annual earnings used to compute the annual benefits are subject
to a $150,000 limit.  
                           PENSION PLAN TABLE

Average Annual Earnings                 ANNUAL PENSION
  Used for Computing     10 Years    20 Years    30 Years    40 Years
       Pension          of Service  of Service  of Service  of Service

       $100,000          20,000       40,000      50,000      55,000
       $125,000          25,000       50,000      62,500      68,750
       $150,000          30,000       60,000      75,000      82,500

   The present formula for determining annual benefits under the
Retirement Plan's life annuity option is (i) 2% of average annual
salary (average annual salary during the five consecutive years
out of the last twenty years of employment that give the highest
average salary) for each of the first  twenty years of benefit
service, plus (ii) 1% of average annual salary for each of the
next ten years of benefit service and (iii) 1/2% of average annual
salary for each year of benefit service in excess of thirty,
minus (iv) 50% of age 65 annual Social Security benefit (as defined in
the Retirement Plan), and (v) any benefit under another Unitil
retirement plan of a former employer for which credit for service
is given under the Retirement Plan. A participant is eligible for
early retirement at an actuarially reduced pension upon the
attainment of age 55 with at least 15 years of service with
Unitil or one of its subsidiaries. A participant is 100% vested in his
benefit under the Retirement Plan after 5 years of service with
Unitil or one of its subsidiaries.  As of January 1, 1996,
Executive Officers Stulgis, Dalton, Siart, Daly and Gantz  had
16, 28, 13, 7 and 12 credited years of service, respectively, under
the Retirement Plan.
    
      Unitil Service also maintains a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan ("SERP"), a non-qualified defined benefit plan.
SERP provides for supplemental retirement benefits to executives
selected by the Board of Directors of Unitil Service (the "UNITIL
Service Board"). At the present time, Messrs. Stulgis and Dalton
are eligible for SERP benefits upon attaining normal or early
retirement eligibility. Annual benefits are based on a
participant's final average earnings less the participant's
benefits payable under the Retirement Plan, and less other
retirement income payable to such participant by Unitil. Early
retirement benefits are available to a participant, with the
Unitil Service Board's approval, if the participant has attained age 55
and completed 15 years of service. Should a participant elect to
begin receiving early retirement benefits under SERP prior to
attaining age 62, the benefits are reduced by 2% for each year
that commencement of benefits precedes attainment of age 62. If a
participant terminates employment for any reason prior to
retirement, the participant will not be entitled to any benefits.
Under the SERP, Messrs. Stulgis and Dalton would be entitled to
receive an annual benefit of $155,533 and $53,452, respectively,
assuming their normal retirement at age 65 and that their final
average earnings are equal to the average of their respective
three consecutive years of highest compensation prior to the date
hereof.

      Unitil and certain subsidiaries maintain severance
agreements (the "Severance Agreements") with certain management employees,
including Executive Officers. The Severance Agreements are
intended to help assure continuity in the management and operation of
Unitil and its subsidiaries in the event of a proposed "Change in
Control". Each Severance Agreement only becomes effective upon
the occurrence of a Change in Control of Unitil as defined in the
Severance Agreements. If an employee's stipulated compensation
and benefits, position, responsibilities and other conditions of
employment are reduced during the thirty-six month period
following a Change in Control, the employee is entitled to a severance
benefit. 

      The severance benefit is a lump sum cash amount equal to
(i) the present value of three years' base salary and bonus; (ii) the
present value of the additional amount the employee would have
received under the Retirement Plan if the employee had continued
to be employed for such thirty-six month period; (iii) the present
value of contributions that would have been made by Unitil or its
subsidiaries under the 401(k) if the employee had been employed
for such thirty-six month period; and (iv) the economic benefit on
any outstanding Unitil stock options and associated dividend
equivalents, assuming such options remained unexercised until the
day preceding the expiration of the grant, including the spread
on any stock options that would have been granted under the Option
Plan if the employee had been employed for such thirty-six month
period. Each Severance Agreement also provides for the
continuation of all employee benefits for a period of thirty-six months,
commencing with the month in which the termination occurred. In
addition, pursuant to each Severance Agreement, Unitil is
required to make an additional payment to the employee sufficient on an
after-tax basis to satisfy any additional individual tax
liability incurred under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, in respect to such payments.

           AS TO OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING

      The Board of Directors does not intend to bring before the
meeting any matters other than the one referred to above and
knows of no other matters which may properly come before the meeting.
If any other matters or motions come before the meeting, it is the
intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy
to vote such proxy in accordance with their judgment on such matters
or motions, including any matters dealing with the conduct of the
meeting.

      The Board of Directors has selected and employed the firm
of Grant Thornton as Unitil's independent certified public
accountants to audit Unitil's financial statements for the fiscal year 1996. 
A representative of the firm will be present at the meeting and
will be available to respond to appropriate questions. It is not
anticipated that such representative will make a prepared statement
at the meeting; however, he will be free to do so if he so chooses.

      Any proposal submitted by a shareholder of Unitil for
inclusion in the proxy material for the 1997 annual meeting of
shareholders must be received by Unitil at its Corporate
Headquarters not later than December 18, 1996.


            Solicitation, Revocation and Use of Proxies
             
      Shares of Unitil Common Stock represented by properly
executed proxies received by Unitil prior to or at the meeting
will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the instructions
specified on the proxies. If no instructions are specified on
such proxies, shares will be voted FOR the election of the nominees
for Directors.  Abstentions and non-votes will have the same effect
as negative votes.

      Any Unitil shareholder who executes and returns a proxy has
the power to revoke such proxy at any time before it is voted by
filing with the Secretary of Unitil, at the address of Unitil set
forth above, written notice of such revocation or a duly executed
proxy bearing a later date, or by attending and voting in person
at the meeting.  Attendance at the meeting will not in and of itself
constitute a revocation of a proxy.

      Unitil will bear the costs of solicitation by the Board of
Directors of proxies from Unitil shareholders.  In addition to
the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by the Directors,
officers and employees of Unitil by personal interview,
telephone, telegram or otherwise. Such Directors, officers and employees
will not be additionally compensated, but may be reimbursed for
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such solicitation. 
Arrangements also will be made with brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of
solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of
record by such persons, and Unitil may reimburse such custodians,
nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith.


                                By Order of the Board of Directors,

                                Gail A. Siart
                                Secretary

Unitil will furnish without charge to any shareholder entitled to
vote and to any beneficial owner of shares entitled to be voted
at the annual meeting of common shareholders, to be held April 18,
1996, a copy of its annual report on Form 10-K, including
financial statements and schedules thereto, required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year 1995, upon
written request to Gail A. Siart, Chief Financial Officer, Unitil
Corporation, 216 Epping Road, Exeter, NH   03833-4571.
