Item 1. Business

  General Development of Business

Washington National Corporation (WNC) was incorporated as a general
business corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law on
February 26, 1968, for the initial purpose of becoming the parent
company and sole shareholder of Washington National Insurance
Company (WNIC), an Illinois insurance corporation dating back to
1911. WNC was organized in order to permit diversification into the
broader field of financial services and is admitted to do business
in Delaware, Indiana, and Illinois. Its executive offices are
located at 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069-3665.

The primary operating companies of WNC are WNIC and United
Presidential Life Insurance Company (UPI). As of December 31, 1994,
WNC and its affiliates had 976 employees.

In 1989, WNC and its affiliates completed a strategic plan and began
restructuring their operations. The strategic plan called for the
divestiture of the home service and direct response lines of
business at WNIC and a subsidiary, Washington National Life
Insurance Company of New York (WNNY). WNIC sold the direct response
and home service product lines and WNNY in 1989, 1990, and 1991,
respectively. The organization is now focused on three lines of
business: health (primarily medical) insurance (both individual and
group) and disability insurance for educators (underwritten by
WNIC), and individual life insurance and annuities (underwritten by
UPI). In 1994, the Company started a broad review of corporate
strategy. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," in Part II, Item 7, for futher
information.

In the third quarter of 1993, WNC issued 2.1 million new shares of
common stock in a public offering that raised $47.3 million.

    GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
                                  
WNC is an insurance holding company which, through WNIC and UPI,
provides life, annuity, health, disability, and specialty insurance
products to individuals and groups in carefully targeted markets.
Effective December 31, 1994, WNC redefined its reporting segments,
merging the previous individual health insurance and group products
segments to better align them with its operating organization. WNC
has three segments:  life insurance and annuities; health insurance;
and corporate and other. The redefined segments are in line with
WNC's current operating structure. The corporate and other segment
is comprised of the operations of WNC that do not specifically
support the other segments.

See Item 8, under the caption "Note M - Segment Information," for 
further information about WNC's three business segments. WNIC's group 
products premiums which are included in the health insurance segment 
were 32%, 35%, and 38% of WNC's total revenues in 1994, 1993, and 1992, 
respectively. Premiums for WNIC's disability insurance for educators 
accounted for 10% of WNC's revenues for each of the years 1994, 1993, 
and 1992.

                DESCRIPTION OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

  Washington National Insurance Company

WNIC is a legal reserve stock life insurance company organized under
the laws of Illinois in 1926 and is the successor to other companies
dating back to 1911. WNIC's home office is located at 300 Tower
Parkway, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069-3665. WNIC is licensed to do
business in all states of the United States (except New York) and
the District of Columbia.

WNIC underwrites health insurance for individuals and groups and
disability insurance for educators. As part of the 1989 corporate
strategic plan, the decision was made to write life insurance and
annuity business solely at UPI. Therefore, as of November 1989, WNIC
ceased writing individual life insurance policies and annuities,
except for home service life products, which WNIC ceased writing in
March 1990; however, WNIC retained its existing life insurance and
annuity business which is reported as part of the life insurance and
annuities segment.

WNIC's health insurance business consists of individual, group and
disability products. The individual health business includes major
medical and hospital-surgical policies. Group health consists
primarily of employer-sponsored health and associated life
insurance, stop-loss insurance, and administrative services only for
employers with from 2 to 1,000 employees. Disability products
include employee-paid disability insurance and other specialty
insurance products for educators. The individual and group health
business, along with the disability insurance products for educators
business, is reported as the health insurance segment.

WNIC's insurance products are primarily sold by salaried group
insurance representatives and field marketing organizations. The
sector of WNIC's field force that distributes group health and
educator disability products consists of 78 field representatives,
including 17 managers, all of whom are salaried employees of WNIC.
Their activities are supported by 47 other field employees. WNIC
markets individual health products through brokers who are employed
by field marketing organizations under standard brokerage contracts.
At December 31, 1994, WNIC had approximately 80,000 brokers employed
by 68 field marketing organizations who sell insurance for other
companies as well as for WNIC.

  United Presidential Life Insurance Company

UPI, an Indiana life insurance company, began business in 1965 and
currently is licensed to do business in 45 states and the District
of Columbia. UPI's parent company, United Presidential Corporation
(UPC), was incorporated in 1961 as an Indiana corporation for the
purpose of becoming the parent company and sole shareholder of UPI
and is 71% owned by WNIC and 29% owned by WNC. Prior to the fourth
quarter of 1993, UPC was 100% owned by WNIC. Both UPC and UPI have
executive offices located at One Presidential Parkway, Kokomo,
Indiana 46904-9006. UPI's primary business is the marketing and
underwriting of individual life insurance and annuities. Its primary
marketing focus is interest-sensitive products such as universal
life insurance and annuities. UPI's operating results are reported
in the life insurance and annuities segment.

Sales are made through approximately 5,000 insurance agents and
brokers having an independent contractor relationship with UPI. Such
persons may also be independent insurance brokers. UPI has no
internal or captive sales force and accordingly, has negligible
training, maintenance, or financing expenses. This marketing system
facilitates sales force expansion without significant cost, provided
that product lines remain competitive with those being offered by
other companies.

  New Products of the Segments

In the life insurance and annuities segment, UPI introduced in 1994
a new annuity series and a low premium universal life insurance
product designed for permanent coverage. In 1995, UPI will introduce
at least two new universal life insurance products built to fit
within its existing portfolio.

In the health insurance segment, WNIC introduced in 1994 new
disability and short-term, major medical products for individuals
and a long-term care product, disability income enhancements, and a
small group product for groups. New products anticipated in 1995 for
the health insurance segment are new disability income and accident-
only products for individuals and new dental, term life, disability,
and managed care products for groups.

  Competitive Conditions of the Segments

The insurance subsidiaries, along with other insurance companies
with whom they are in competition, are subject to regulation and
supervision by the state insurance departments in each jurisdiction
in which they are licensed to do business, greatly affecting the
competitive environment in which they operate. The state insurance
departments have broad administrative powers, including those
relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact
business, licensing of agents, approval of policy forms,
establishing reserve requirements, the form and content of required
financial statements, conducting of periodic examinations, and the
investment laws and regulations of their states of incorporation.
This regulation and supervision is primarily for the protection of
policyowners and not shareholders.

WNIC's individual health insurance business faces competition from
approximately 45 companies. There are approximately 90 group
employee benefits insurers and less than 30 insurers of disability
insurance for educators in competition with WNIC. UPI competes for
the sale of life insurance and annuity products with approximately
300 U.S. life insurance companies, including stock and mutual
companies.

Recently, the environment for WNC's group and individual major
medical health insurance products has become more competitive as
other insurance companies have priced their products more
aggressively in order to obtain additional market share in these
product lines. As a result of this sales environment, WNC expects an
increase in the level of policy lapses in the health insurance
segment and an increase in the benefit ratio over the next 1-2
years.
                                  
          FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

Neither WNC nor any affiliated company is licensed to do business
outside of the United States.

Item 2. Properties

WNC's home office building is a five-story, 175,000 square-foot
office building located at 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire,
Illinois, that was first occupied by WNC in May, 1993. The building
is being leased for a period of twenty years from a joint venture
partnership in which Washington National Development Company (WNDC),
a subsidiary of WNIC, has a one-third interest.

WNDC has a fifty percent interest in a joint venture partnership
that owns a 22,000 square-foot data center in Vernon Hills,
Illinois, that is leased and occupied solely by WNIC. WNIC first
occupied the property in April, 1993 and signed a twenty-year lease.

WNIC also owns a 335,000 square-foot office building in Evanston,
Illinois. WNIC occupies approximately 8 percent of this building and
leases the remainder to nonaffiliated commercial enterprises. At
December 31, 1994, the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan
secured by this property was $1,907,000. WNIC also occupies 25 field
offices throughout the country, all of which are leased.

UPI's home office is a 102,000 square-foot office building that UPI
owns, and is located on a thirty-acre site in Kokomo, Indiana.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

WNC and certain affiliated companies have been named in various
pending legal proceedings considered to be ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business of such companies. A number of
other legal actions have been filed which demand compensatory and
punitive damages aggregating material dollar amounts. WNC believes
that such suits are substantially without merit and that valid
defenses to them exist. WNC's management and its chief legal officer
believe that such litigation will not have a material effect on
WNC's  results of operations or consolidated financial position. The
amount involved in any proceeding, or group of proceedings
presenting in large degree the same issues, does not exceed the
materiality standard for disclosure contained in Instruction 2 to
Item 103 of Regulation  S-K.

In September, 1994, two retired employees filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
against WNC, WNIC, and the three individual trustees of the
Washington National Insurance Company Home Office Group Insurance
Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs purport to act as members of a
class consisting of all employees of WNC and WNIC who retired or
tendered their irrevocable notice of retirement on or before July
24, 1989, and who are eligible to receive benefits under the Plan.

The complaint is brought under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) and alleges that WNC, WNIC, and the trustees
have taken and threatened to take actions to modify, amend or
terminate the Plan in violation of written and oral promises and
representations, and the terms of the Plan. The alleged violations
include changing the method for computing claims payable under the
Plan, requiring retired employees to contribute to the payment of
premiums for their Medicare supplemental health insurance coverage
and maintaining that WNC, WNIC, and the trustees have reserved the
right to modify or terminate benefits under the Plan. Plaintiffs
seek a declaration of their rights under the Plan, with respect to
these actions, an award of attorneys' fees and other relief, and a
certification of the class.

WNC, WNIC, and the individual trustees believe that valid defenses
exist and intend to contest vigorously the allegations made in the
complaint.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during

Overview

Washington National Corporation (WNC or the Company) is an
insurance holding company that is engaged primarily in marketing and
underwriting life insurance, annuities, medical, disability, and specialty
insurance for individuals and groups. The major operating subsidiaries of the
Company are Washington National Insurance Company (WNIC) and United
Presidential Life Insurance Company (UPI).
   
The Company targets markets that it believes are underserved by other insurance
companies. It has a decentralized operating structure and utilizes distinct
distribution systems to access each of its targeted markets and to provide
timely, individualized service to its customers. The Company emphasizes the sale
of market-driven products, a profit-oriented, rather than a volume-oriented
approach to underwriting, tight expense controls, and a proactive approach to
market and regulatory changes. It continually evaluates new products and markets
in order to capitalize on potential opportunities and to anticipate and respond
effectively to business and regulatory changes.

The Company believes these factors contributed to a substantial improvement in
operations thus far in the 1990s. From 1990 to 1994, pretax operating income
increased from $4.6 million to $46.3 million.

Corporate Restructuring and Strategy

In 1988, the Company began restructuring to narrow its focus on
fewer businesses, reduce its work force, and recruit new operating managers with
significant insurance industry experience. Since that time, the operating
businesses have continually adjusted their specific strategies to remain
competitive and profitable. Late in 1994, the Company began a broad review of
its corporate strategy which it expects to complete in 1995.

Year Ended December 31, 1994 Compared to 
Year Ended December 31, 1993

Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges. Insurance premiums
and policy charges increased $29.6 million, or 6.7%, from $438.8 million in 1993
to $468.4 million in 1994. The change was primarily due to an increase of $23.5
million in premiums in the health insurance segment, the result of higher
premiums from individual health reinsurance transactions, partially offset by a
decline in group products premiums. In addition, insurance premiums and policy
charges in the life insurance and annuities segment increased by $6.9 million
due to an increase in life insurance in force and an increase in policy charges.
See "Segment Information - Health Insurance and Life Insurance and Annuities,"
below.

Net Investment Income. Net investment income decreased $1.7 million, or 0.9%,
to $182.0 million in 1994 from $183.7 million in 1993. The decrease was due
primarily to a decline in the Company's portfolio yield (based on amortized
cost) from 8.0% in 1993 to 7.7% in 1994.

Realized Investment Losses. Realized investment losses before taxes for 1994
were $1.6 million compared to $0.4 million in 1993. In 1994, realized losses of
$1.7 million on fixed maturity investments and $2.0 million on real estate and
mortgage loans were partially offset by gains on equity securities and other
invested assets of $2.1 million. In 1993, realized gains of $8.2 million on
fixed maturity investments and equity securities were offset by losses of $8.5
million on real estate investments, mortgage loans, and other invested assets.
The Company's income taxes included tax benefits of $2.8 million and $3.2
million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, from previous years' realized investment
losses.

Insurance Benefits Paid or Provided. Insurance benefits paid or provided
increased $15.4 million, or 3.7%, from $420.4 million in 1993 to $435.8 million
in 1994. The increase was primarily due to higher benefits of $17.0 million in
the health insurance segment primarily due to additional business from
individual health reinsurance transactions which also increased premium
revenues.

Insurance and General Expenses. Insurance and general expenses increased $6.9
million, or 5.3%, from $131.5 million in 1993 to $138.4 million in 1994,
primarily due to higher expenses in the health insurance segment of $13.3
million principally related to the individual health reinsurance transactions.

Income Taxes. Income taxes on operations increased $2.6 million to $16.1
million in 1994 compared to $13.5 million in 1993 primarily due to increased
operating income.

Change in Accounting Principle. In the first quarter of 1993, the Company
recorded a one-time charge of $1.6 million after taxes for the adoption of a new
accounting standard, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. The
adoption did not have a material impact on income before accounting changes.

Net Income. Net income for 1994 was $31.3 million compared to $26.7 million
in 1993. The improvement in net income resulted from increased earnings from
operations and the charge in the first quarter of 1993 relating to the adoption
of the new accounting standard described above.

Segment Information

Effective December 31, 1994, the Company redefined its
reporting segments, merging the previous individual health insurance and group
products segments to better align them with its operating organization. All
prior years' segment information has been restated to be comparable.

The Company has two operating business segments. The life insurance and
annuities segment consists of universal life insurance and other interest-
sensitive life insurance and annuity products marketed to individuals and small
businesses by UPI and closed blocks of similar business at WNIC. The health
insurance segment consists primarily of employer-sponsored health and associated
life insurance, stop-loss insurance, and administrative services only for
employers with from 2 to 1,000 employees, employee-paid disability insurance and
other specialty insurance products for educators, and individual health
insurance products, primarily major medical and hospital indemnity coverage for
persons under the age of 65 without employer-sponsored insurance. The third
segment, corporate and other, includes the non-insurance operations of the
Company.

Life Insurance and Annuities. Revenues for the life insurance and annuities
segment for 1994 were $229.7 million, compared to $229.0 million for 1993. The
improvement was attributable to higher insurance premiums and policy charges of
$6.9 million, primarily due to an increase in life insurance in force and policy
charges at UPI, mostly offset by a $4.6 million decrease in investment income
resulting primarily from a lower portfolio yield. UPI's increase in insurance
premiums and policy charges was offset in part by a decline at WNIC where no new
policies are being sold in this segment.

Pretax operating income for the life insurance and annuities segment increased
$5.6 million, or 20.0%, to $33.2 million in 1994 from $27.6 million in 1993, due
to improved interest rate spreads (as the interest credited on account balances
was reduced more than the decrease in the yield on invested assets), a reduction
in operating expenses at UPI, and the improvement in revenues.

Generally, in an environment of rising interest rates, the Company may have
difficulty maintaining the spread between the rates credited to policyholders
and the rate earned on its investment portfolio, resulting in lower profit
margins for this segment. While the Company was able to maintain its spread for
1994 as market interest rates rose, the Company expects spreads to decline in
1995. For 1994, maintenance of interest rate spreads higher than the Company's
long-term spread assumptions resulted in additional pretax income of
approximately $5 million. The future profitability of the Company's closed
blocks of life insurance and annuities is highly dependent upon maintaining a
minimum expected interest rate spread and level of persistency. A significant
deterioration in policy persistency would reduce future profits.

Health Insurance. Revenues for the health insurance segment were $421.0
million in 1994 compared to $394.6 million in 1993, an increase of $26.4
million, or 6.7%. The improvement was primarily due to two individual health
reinsurance transactions that added $61.0 million of revenues in 1994, compared
to $23.4 million of revenues in 1993. The increase was also due in part to
average rate increases of approximately 6% in 1994 on the direct portion of the
individual health insurance in force, offset in part by a decline of 2.1% in the
total number of policies in force for this part of the business. The increase in
revenues from the reinsurance transactions was partially offset by a reduction
in group products premiums of $14.8 million primarily due to policy lapses,
including the termination of a large group life insurance contract in 1993, with
approximately $6 million of premium revenues in 1993. The termination of the
large group life contract, which had approximately $3 billion of life insurance
in force, did not materially affect net income as there was a corresponding
decrease in benefits and expenses.

The health insurance segment reported pretax operating income of $5.9 million in
1994 compared to $11.5 million in 1993. The decrease was primarily due to an
increase in the benefit ratio (insurance benefits divided by insurance premiums)
of the group products portion of this segment.

Effective in the 1993 second quarter, the Company entered into a reinsurance
agreement with The Harvest Life Insurance Company (Harvest Life) that provides
that the Company reinsures 100% of a block of individual major medical business
issued by Harvest Life. In 1994, the Company entered into a reinsurance
agreement with National Casualty Company (National Casualty), whereby the
Company reinsures 50% and administers 100% of a block of individual major
medical health insurance.

The combined effect of these reinsurance transactions was to increase revenues
and benefits and expenses by $61.0 million and $55.5 million, respectively, in
1994, compared to $23.4 million and $22.3 million, respectively, in 1993.
Because these two reinsurance transactions are comprised of closed blocks of
business, revenues and income from these transactions are expected to decline
over the next several years.

Over the last several quarters, the sales environment for the Company's group
and individual major medical health insurance products has become more
competitive as other insurance companies have priced their products more
aggressively in order to obtain additional market share in these product lines.
As a result of the sales environment, the Company expects an increase in the
level of policy lapses in the segment and an increase in the benefit ratio over
the next 1-2 years.
   
The Company prices its products to emphasize maintaining desired profit margins
and, as a result, has seen a decline in new business sold. To help offset the
decline, the Company has expanded its distribution network. As part of the
reinsurance transactions, the Company is utilizing the sales force of Harvest
Life, whose agents generated approximately 10% of 1994 new sales. In addition,
National Casualty agents began marketing the Company's individual health
products in the first quarter of 1995 and are expected to add significantly to
new sales volume.
   
Corporate and Other. For 1994, the corporate and other segment had pretax
operating income of $7.2 million compared to a loss of $0.6 million in 1993.
The improvement was due to increased investment income on the Company's surplus
funds in 1994 and expenses in 1993 related to the relocation of the Company's
headquarters.
   
In 1995, the Company plans to change its allocation to the operating segments of
income and expense items in this segment to more accurately reflect these
savings. This will result in lower earnings for this segment and higher earnings
for the other segments but will have no affect on net income.

Year Ended December 31, 1993 Compared to 
Year Ended December 31, 1992
 
Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges. Insurance premiums
and policy charges increased $57.8 million, or 15.2%, from $381.0 million in
1992 to $438.8 million in 1993. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
health insurance segment premiums arising from individual health insurance
premiums of $52.3 million, offset in part by a decline in group products
premiums. The premium decline was due primarily to policy lapses, including the
termination of a large contract with approximately $6 million of both premium
revenue and benefits and expenses in 1993 and $11 million of premium revenue and
expenses in 1992. See "Segment Information - Health Insurance," below.

Net Investment Income. Net investment income decreased $3.4 million, or 1.8%,
to $183.7 million in 1993 from $187.1 million in 1992. The decrease was due to a
general decline in market interest rates that caused a decline in the Company's
portfolio yield from 8.6% in 1992 to 8.0% in 1993.

Realized Investment Losses. Realized investment losses for 1993 were $0.4
million compared to $4.6 million in 1992. In 1993, realized gains of $8.2
million on fixed maturity investments and equity securities were offset by
losses of $8.5 million on real estate investments, mortgage loans, and other
invested assets. In 1992, realized gains of $5.6 million on fixed maturity
investments were offset by losses of $4.9 million on mortgage loans on real
estate, $3.6 million on real estate investments, and $1.7 million on equity
securities. The Company's 1993 income taxes included a tax benefit of $3.2
million from previous years' realized investment losses.

Insurance Benefits Paid or Provided. Insurance benefits paid or provided
increased $10.6 million, or 2.6%, from $409.8 million in 1992 to $420.4 million
in 1993. The increase was primarily due to higher health insurance benefits of
$27.2 million resulting primarily from the individual health reinsurance
transaction entered into in 1993. Partially offsetting this was a decline in
life insurance and annuities benefits of $16.6 million resulting from a decrease
in interest credited on interest-sensitive products, improved mortality
experience, and the annual review of benefits assumptions, discussed in
"Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs," below.

Insurance and General Expenses. Insurance and general expenses increased
$24.4 million, or 22.8%, from $107.1 million in 1992 to $131.5 million in 1993.
Included in 1993 were expenses of $6.9 million related to the individual health
reinsurance transaction, charges of  $1.7 million for the combination of the
individual health and employee benefits divisions, and $1.6 million related to
reengineering in the life insurance and annuities segment. Also included in 1993
were move-related costs, primarily due to the relocation of the Company's
headquarters.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs. Amortization of deferred
acquisition costs increased $10.8 million, or 39.9%, from $27.1 million in 1992
to $37.9 million in 1993. The change was primarily due to increased amortization
of $3.5 million in the health insurance segment resulting from an increase in
the block of in force individual health insurance business and $3.6 million due
to the annual review of amortization assumptions in the life insurance and
annuities segment, partially offset by the decrease in benefits, described
above.

Income Before Income Taxes and Changes in Accounting Principles. Income
before income taxes and changes in accounting principles increased $12.3
million, or 46.7%, to $38.7 million in 1993 compared to $26.4 million in 1992.
The increase was due to improvement in the operations of all of the Company's
segments.

Income Taxes. Income taxes increased $1.0 million to $10.5 million in 1993
compared to $9.5 million in 1992, primarily due to improved income from
operations. Also in 1993, the Company's federal income tax rate increased from
34% to 35%.
   
Changes in Accounting Principles. In 1993, the Company recorded a one-time
charge of $1.6 million after taxes for the adoption of a new accounting standard
on accounting for postemployment benefits. The adoption did not have a material
impact on income before accounting changes. 1992 included a $22.8 million after-
tax charge relating to the 1992 adoption of new accounting standards, related to
postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

Net Income (Loss). Net income for 1993 was $26.7 million compared to a net
loss of $6.0 million in 1992. The improvement in net income resulted primarily
from the charges in the first quarter of 1992 relating to the adoption of two
new accounting standards described above and improved operations from all three
of the Company's segments, partially offset by a charge relating to the new
accounting standard in the first quarter of 1993.

Segment Information

Life Insurance and Annuities. Revenues for the life
insurance and annuities segment for 1993 were $229.0 million, compared to $233.5
million in 1992. A decline in investment income of $5.8 million resulted from
lower portfolio yield rates, offset in part by an increase in invested assets. A
$1.5 million improvement in insurance revenues was primarily due to an increase
in life insurance in force combined with increased policy charges at UPI, offset
in part by a decline in insurance revenues on the closed blocks of business at
WNIC.

Pretax operating income for the life insurance and annuities segment increased
26.5% to $27.6 million in 1993 from $21.9 million in 1992. The increase was
primarily due to improved interest rate spreads and favorable mortality
experience. Also contributing to the improvement was a charge of $2.8 million
for anticipated guaranty fund assessments recorded in 1992 compared to $0.5
million in 1993. Partially offsetting these increases were charges in 1993 of
$1.6 million to combine the Company's data centers, implement work flow
reengineering at UPI, and transfer the administration of WNIC's closed block of
life insurance to UPI.

Health Insurance. Revenues for the health insurance segment were $394.6
million in 1993 compared to $338.8 million in 1992, an increase of 16.5%. The
increase was due to an individual health reinsurance transaction that added
$23.4 million of revenue, an increase in the amount of business in force in the
education product line resulting from sales in 1992 and 1993, and premium rate
increases averaging 7% in group products. The increase in revenues was partially
offset by a decline of approximately $6 million of premium revenue from the
termination of a large group life insurance contract in 1993. The annual
premiums and related benefits related to this contract were each approximately
$11 million in 1992. The termination of the large group life insurance contract,
which had approximately $3 billion of life insurance in force, did not
materially affect net income.

The health insurance segment reported pretax operating income of $11.5 million
in 1993 compared to $7.0 million in 1992. The increase in pretax income was due
to an improved ratio of claims to premiums in 1993 over 1992, offset in part by
increased expenses.

Corporate and Other. For 1993, the pretax operating loss was $0.6 million
compared to a loss of $1.9 million in 1992. The improvement was primarily due to
an increase in investment income on the Company's surplus funds from the
secondary stock offering of 2.1 million shares in 1993 which generated $47.3
million.

Investment Portfolio

The Company's investment portfolio is managed by an experienced
staff of in-house investment professionals, primarily at WNIC, and outside
investment advisors, primarily the insurance investment management group at
Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc. Investments are made pursuant to strategies and
guidelines approved by the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors. The Company selects investments that match the needs of the
businesses that the assets support in the areas of yield, liquidity, asset
quality, and duration. The Company pursues a conservative investment philosophy
by balancing a variety of objectives, including high credit quality, liquidity,
high current income, preservation of capital, and protection against market
interest rate risk. The Company's investment portfolio consists principally of
investment grade, publicly-traded fixed maturity investments, and mortgage loans
on real estate. All investments made by WNIC and UPI are governed by Illinois
and Indiana insurance laws and regulations, respectively.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had invested assets with a carrying value of
$2.3 billion. Certain information about the Company's investment portfolio as of
that date follows (dollars in millions):

On January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." As a result, most of the Company's fixed maturity investments are
classified as available for sale and carried at fair value at December 31, 1994.
The remaining fixed maturity investments are classified as held to maturity and
carried at amortized cost, less write-downs for other-than-temporary
impairments. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

Fixed Maturity Investments
The carrying value of fixed maturity investments at December
31, 1994 was $1.8 billion, or 77.1% of the Company's invested assets. The
amortized cost of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio increased $120 million
to $1.9 billion at December 31, 1994 from $1.8 billion at December 31, 1993. Due
to the increase in market interest rates in 1994, the carrying value of the
Company's fixed maturity investments compared to amortized cost declined,
resulting in an unrealized loss on fixed maturity investments of $119.5 million.

The Company's policy for rating fixed maturity investments is to use the rating
determined by Standard & Poor's Company or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. for
publicly-traded investments. For privately-traded securities, the ratings of
Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company and Fitch Investors Service, Inc. are also
recognized in defining rated securities. If an investment has a split rating
(i.e., different ratings from the rating services) the Company categorizes the
investment under the lowest rating. For those investments that do not have a
rating from these services, the Company categorizes those investments on ratings
assigned by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), whose
ratings are as follows:  NAIC Class 1 is considered equivalent to a AAA/Aaa,
AA/Aa, or A rating; NAIC Class 2, BBB/Baa; and NAIC Classes 3-6, BB/Ba and
below. At December 31, 1994, 7% of fixed maturity investments were rated with
comparable NAIC ratings, the majority of which is $61.7 million of BBB-rated and
$45.0 million of investments rated BB and lower.

The composition of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 1994,
based on ratings follows (dollars in millions):

The carrying value of the Company's high-yield investments (rated BB and lower)
at December 31, 1994, was $90.9 million or 4.0% of the Company's invested
assets, essentially unchanged from December 31, 1993. The Company does not
anticipate any significant new investments in high-yield fixed maturity
investments.
   
At December 31, 1994, 26.9% of the Company's invested assets were in mortgage-
backed fixed maturity investments, including collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs) and mortgage-backed pass-through securities. Mortgage-backed
securities generally are collateralized by mortgages backed by the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal National Mortgage 
Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, all of which are
agencies of the U.S. Government. Only GNMA mortgages are backed by the full 
faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Agency mortgage-backed securities
are considered to have a AAA credit rating.

</TABLE>

In some instances, the Company invests in non-agency mortgage-backed securities,
primarily highly-rated CMOs. At December 31, 1994, $20.2 million, or 88.2%, of
the Company's non-agency CMOs were rated AAA. The credit risk associated with
non-agency mortgage-backed securities is generally greater than that of agency
mortgage-backed securities.
   
Certain mortgage-backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk.
This is due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates, mortgages
may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as individuals refinance higher-rate
mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. As a result, holders of mortgage-
backed securities may receive large prepayments on their investments that cannot
be reinvested at interest rates comparable to the rates on the prepaid
mortgages. Conversely, in periods of rising interest rates, mortgage prepayments
may slow down which would result in holders of mortgage-backed securities having
less funds to reinvest at higher rates.
   
Planned amortization class and target amortization class tranches, which
together comprised 11.3% of the Company's invested assets at December 31, 1994,
are designed to amortize in a manner that shifts the primary risk of prepayment
of the underlying collateral to investors in other tranches of the CMO.
   
Sequential classes, which comprised 0.8% of the Company's invested assets at
December 31, 1994, may have prepayment characteristics similar to mortgage-
backed pass-through securities. Accrual classes, which comprised 0.5% of the
Company's invested assets at December 31, 1994, have prepayment characteristics
similar to sequential classes when receiving principal payments. Support
classes, which comprised 0.2% of the Company's invested assets at December 31,
1994, are the most sensitive to prepayment risk.

The Company had investments in mortgage
loans of $357.6 million at December 31, 1994 compared to $391.7 million at
December 31, 1993. Investments in mortgage loans declined primarily due to
prepayments and amortization of the mortgage loan portfolio during 1994. Of the
outstanding loans at December 31, 1994, loans with a carrying value of $1.6
million (net of allowances of $0.3 million) or 0.5% were delinquent 60 days or
more as to interest or principal, far better than recent industry averages.

The Company actively manages its non-current investments through restructuring
of mortgages and sales and leasing of foreclosed real estate in order to achieve
the highest current return as well as to preserve capital. Restructured loans,
where modifications of the terms of the mortgage loan have generally occurred
and which are considered current investments, had a carrying value of $16.6
million at December 31, 1994 compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 1993.

In the first quarter of 1994, the Company decided that in order to provide
better matching between the characteristics of its assets and liabilities to no
longer make new investments in mortgage loans except for purchase money loans
and expansion of the Company's properties. The Company will retain its existing
mortgage loans.

Real Estate

The Company's real estate investments totaled $27.0 million
(net of allowances of $2.5 million) at December 31, 1994 compared to $39.1
million (net of allowances of $8.6 million) at December 31, 1993. At December
31, 1994, $4.7 million of the real estate investments were acquired through
mortgage loan foreclosure, compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 1993. The
decline was primarily due to sales of foreclosed real estate investments. The
Company does not anticipate any new acquisition of real estate other than
through foreclosure of mortgage loans.

Equity Securities

At December 31, 1994, the Company had investments in common
stocks and nonredeemable preferred stocks of $1.7 million that are carried at
fair value. The remaining $11.3 million of equity securities is the Company's
investment in its Separate Account and is carried at cost. The Company does not
anticipate any significant change in the size of its equity securities
portfolio.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows. During 1994, the Company's operating activities
generated cash of $84.3 million compared to $104.7 million in 1993. The decrease
in cash provided by operations in 1994 resulted primarily from increased
benefits, the return of funds held for a terminated group life insurance
contract, and an increase in income taxes paid.

Investing activities (purchases and sales of investments) used cash of $48.4
million in 1994 compared to $130.8 million in 1993, primarily for the purchase
of fixed maturity investments in both periods. Sales of short-term securities
partially funded these purchases.  The decrease in purchases was primarily due
to the use of cash by financing activities combined with the decrease in cash
generated by operating activities discussed above.

Financing activities used cash of $39.1 million in 1994 and provided cash of
$27.1 million in 1993. In 1993, $48.2 million of cash was provided by the sale
of the Company's Common Stock, partially offset by the payment of $17.4 million
of short-term notes payable and $9.5 million of mortgage and other notes
payable. The decrease in cash from financing was also caused by increased
policyholder withdrawals primarily at WNIC, where the Company maintains a closed
block of interest-sensitive business.

Liquidity. The fair value of the Company's investment portfolio, primarily
fixed maturity investments, is affected by changing interest rates. When
interest rates rise, the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investments
declines. In addition, the value of the Company's policy liabilities decreases.
In periods of declining interest rates, the fair value of the Company's fixed
maturity investments increases, accompanied by an increase in the value of its
policy liabilities. The Company estimates that a one percentage point change in
market interest rates would have an inverse effect on the fair value of its
fixed maturity investments of approximately 6%.

In addition, rising interest rates could result in increased surrenders of life
insurance policies and annuities (as current policy and contract holders seek
higher returns elsewhere) causing the Company to sell fixed maturity investments
below cost. In order to minimize the need to sell fixed maturity investments
below cost, the Company seeks to maintain sufficient levels of cash and short-
term investments.

The Company held cash and short-term investments of $59.7 million at December
31, 1994. Management believes the balance of cash and short-term investments
plus cash inflow from premium revenues, investment income, and investment
maturities is more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company and
its subsidiaries.
   
Dividends. The Company's primary sources of funds to pay dividends to
shareholders are investments held at the parent and dividends from WNIC. These
dividends are subject to restrictions set forth by the Illinois Insurance
Department. Illinois regulations limit the amount of cash that can be withdrawn
from WNIC to the greater of the previous year's statutory earnings or 10% of
statutory capital and surplus.

UPI is wholly owned by United Presidential Corporation, an insurance holding
company that is 71% owned by WNIC and 29% owned by WNC. UPI is not considered a
source of funds for dividends to shareholders of the Company for the foreseeable
future in order to conserve capital at that subsidiary.
Stock Offering. During the third quarter of 1993, the Company issued
2,133,000 shares of Common Stock in a secondary stock offering. The sale of the
additional shares resulted in an increase in shareholders' equity of $47.3
million and a decrease in 1993 primary earnings of 4.3% or $.11 per share.

Health Care Reform

Congress adjourned in the fall of 1994 without passing a health
care reform proposal. However, the Company expects that health care reform will
again be an issue before Congress in 1995. With the make-up of the new Congress
decidedly different than last year, there is speculation that the legislature
would attempt steps at insurance reform, as opposed to large-scale health care
reform.

In addition to reform proposals on a national basis, legislative efforts to
reform health care at the state level may intensify. The potential reform plans
at the federal and state levels may:  (i) partially or fully replace products
sold by insurers; (ii) limit the ability of insurers to charge higher rates to
or decline to cover insureds who present greater risks; (iii) limit the ability
of insurers to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions; (iv) mandate the
types of insurance benefits to be provided in certain instances; (v) impose
insurance rate regulation or additional taxes on insurance premiums or benefits;
(vi) increase competition by expanding employee choice of insurance plans and by
requiring the employee to bear the full cost increment for higher priced plans;
or (vii) establish programs run by the government that would compete with or
replace business written by the Company.

The Company has monitored and will continue to monitor all aspects of the
developments surrounding this issue and is preparing strategic responses to its
possible outcomes. The Company's health businesses have begun to diversify into
product areas, such as supplemental insurance products and disability products,
that the Company believes are consistent with its targeted market focus and may
be less affected or unaffected by health care reform. Health care reform at the
federal and state levels may have a material adverse effect on the Company's
operating results and financial position, but it is not possible at this time to
predict the nature and effects of health care reform or how soon its measures
will be adopted and implemented.

A.M. Best Ratings

The ability of an insurance company to compete successfully
depends, in part, on its financial strength, operating performance, and claims-
paying ability as rated by A.M. Best and other rating agencies. The Company's
insurance subsidiaries are each currently rated "A- (Excellent)" by A.M. Best,
based on their 1993 statutory financial results and operating performance.

A. M. Best's 15 categories of rating for insurance companies currently range
from "A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)." According to A. M. Best, an "A"
or "A-" rating is assigned to companies which, in A. M. Best's opinion, have
achieved excellent overall performance when compared to the standards of the
life insurance industry and generally have demonstrated a strong ability to meet
their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. Many of the
Company's competitors have A.M. Best ratings of "A-" or lower, and the Company
believes the insurance subsidiaries' A.M. Best ratings are adequate to enable
them to compete successfully. A.M. Best ratings are based upon factors of
concern to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are directed toward the
protection of policyholders, not investors.

A. M. Best uses a variety of qualitative and quantitative measures in
determining a company's rating and surplus adequacy. The Company expects that
both WNIC and UPI will continue to meet A.M. Best's standards for an "A-" rating
based on 1994 results.

Inflation and Changing Prices

Inflation and changing prices are anticipated by the Company in
the pricing of its insurance products. Significant components of health
insurance benefits are the medical care inflation rate, policyholder utilization
of medical services, and cost-shifting, which is the transfer of medical care
provider expenses that are not reimbursed by governmental plans and HMOs to
private insurers. WNIC's health insurance pricing assumptions regarding these
factors declined significantly in 1994 reflecting a decline in medical care
inflation and stability in the general inflation rate. For the first quarter of
1995, these assumptions have not changed materially.

The effect of inflation on operating expense has not been significant.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A
Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
include the accounts and operations of Washington National Corporation and its
subsidiaries (WNC or the Company). Significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 1993 and 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.
 
New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 1994, WNC adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in
1993. The statement requires the Company to segregate its fixed maturity
portfolio into three separate classifications: investments held to maturity,
trading securities, and investments available for sale.
   
Investments held to maturity are those fixed maturities that
the Company has a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. These
securities are carried at amortized cost less write-downs for other-than-
temporary impairments. Trading securities consist of those fixed maturity and
equity securities held for short periods of time and are carried on the balance
sheet at fair value, with any change in value reported as a component of income.
Available for sale investments consist of those securities that do not meet the
criteria of either investments held to maturity or trading securities and are
carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair values of available
for sale securities, after adjustment of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), are
reported as unrealized gains or losses directly in shareholders' equity and,
accordingly, have no effect on net income. The DAC offsets represent valuation
adjustments or reinstatements of DAC that would have been required as charges or
credits to operations had such unrealized amounts been realized. The effect of
the adjustment to fair value and the change to DAC is tax effected. If a
decrease in the value of fixed maturity investments is other-than-
temporary, the loss is recognized as a realized loss. The effect of the
adoption of this standard on shareholders' equity is as follows:

<TABLE>

<S>                                        <C>            <C>
Fair value adjustment to available
  for sale fixed maturity securities       $(118,728)     $  74,273
DAC adjustment                                33,000        (18,630)
Deferred tax adjustment                       24,543        (13,999)
Net unrealized gain(loss) on
  fixed maturities available for sale      $ (61,185)     $  41,644
</TABLE>
   
At December 31, 1994, the unrealized loss was primarily due to
the increase in interest rates in 1994.
   
In 1993, these securities were primarily classified as held for
sale and carried at the lower of market or amortized cost less write-downs for
other- than-temporary impairments.
   
The Company foresees that this standard will continue to result
in an increase in the volatility of shareholders' equity as the standard does
not permit a corresponding adjustment to the liabilities that these assets
support.
   
In October 1994, the FASB issued SFAS 119, "Disclosure about
Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments." The
statement requires additional disclosure of information on derivative financial
instruments such as forward, futures, swap, and option contracts. The Company
does not have any such instruments. However, the Company does have certain
financial commitments to extend credit and fund investments that are included in
the disclosure requirements of this statement and these are discussed in Note H.
   
Effective December 1994, the Company adopted the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 
94-5, "Disclosure of Certain Matters in the Financial Statements of Insurance
Enterprises." This SOP requires additional disclosure on statutory accounting
that is included in Note I.
   
SFAS 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,"
and its amendments, will be adopted by the Company effective January 1, 1995.
The standard provides measurement criteria for determining the carrying value
when it is probable that a loan has been impaired and for disclosing of
information about investments in impaired loans. A loan is considered impaired
when it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the
contractual terms. The impairment is recognized by a valuation allowance which
may be subsequently increased or decreased based on changes in the measurement
criteria. The statement applies to essentially all loans in the Company's
mortgage loan portfolio. The adoption will not have a material impact on the
financial statements.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes

Net income in 1993 includes a one-time cumulative effect adjustment
of $1,550,000, net of taxes of $834,000, for the adoption of SFAS 112
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." Net income in 1992 includes
one-time cumulative effect adjustments of $20,126,000, net of taxes of
$10,368,000, for the adoption of SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," and $2,693,000 for the adoption of
SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Investments

Fixed Maturities. Fixed maturity investments are securities that
mature more than one year after issuance. They include bonds, notes, and
redeemable preferred stocks. Investments in fixed maturities are intended to be
used by WNC as part of its asset/liability matching strategy. Effective in 1994
with the adoption of SFAS 115, the Company classifies its fixed maturity
investments as either available for sale investments or held to maturity
investments.
   
Equity Securities. Equity securities include an investment
of Washington National Insurance Company's (WNIC) funds in its Separate Account,
nonredeemable preferred stocks, and common stocks. The Separate Account
investment is carried at cost. The stocks of non-related companies are carried
at fair value derived from either a major securities exchange or the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System. Unrealized gains
and losses on  these securities  are recorded directly in shareholders' equity.
Other-than-temporary declines below cost are recorded as realized losses.
   
Mortgage Loans on Real Estate. Mortgage loans on real estate
are carried at unpaid principal net of unearned discount and allowance for
possible loan losses. Allowance for mortgage loan losses is based on an
evaluation of the mortgage loan portfolio, past credit loss experience, and
current economic conditions. Loans considered permanently impaired are written
down to their net realizable value.
   
Real Estate Investments. Real estate investments are
principally carried at cost less allowances for depreciation and possible
losses. Foreclosed real estate is considered available for sale and is recorded
at the lower of current carrying value or fair value less estimated costs of
disposal.
   
Other Long-term Investments. Other long-term investments
consist principally of venture capital investments and are carried at cost less
other-than-temporary impairments.
   
Short-term Investments. Short-term investments include
commercial paper, variable demand notes, and money market funds and are carried
at cost, which approximates fair value.
   
Investment Income. Interest on fixed maturities, loans, and
notes is recorded as income as it is earned. Income is adjusted for any
amortization of premium or discount on these investments including adjustments
resulting from prepayments or expected changes in prepayments on mortgage-backed
securities. Income on impaired loans, real estate, and other long-term
investments is recorded principally on a cash basis. Dividends are recorded as
income on ex-dividend dates. Investment expenses are accrued as incurred.
   
Realized Investment Gains or Losses. When an investment is
sold, its selling price may be higher or lower than its carrying value. Using
the specific identification method, the difference between the selling price and
the carrying value is recorded as a realized gain or loss. Investments that have
declined in fair value below cost, for which the decline is judged to be other-
than-temporary, are written down to their estimated fair value. Write downs and
allowances for losses on mortgage loans are included in realized investment
losses.

Depreciation

Provisions for depreciation of real estate investments and home
office properties are computed using primarily the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives. Accumulated depreciation on real estate investments at
December 31 was $25,086,000 and $24,184,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Accumulated depreciation on home office property and equipment at December 31
was $2,434,000 and $1,101,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges

Insurance premiums  and  policy  charges include reinsurance
premiums assumed and are net of reinsurance ceded. Health insurance premiums are
earned and recognized pro rata over the terms of the policies. Premiums for
traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due.
Revenues for certain interest-sensitive products consist of charges earned and
assessed against policy account balances during the period for the cost of
insurance, policy initiation fees, policy administration expenses, and surrender
charges.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

Costs directly associated with the acquisition of new business are
generally deferred and amortized. For traditional life insurance and health
insurance products, costs are amortized over the premium-paying period of the
products based on assumptions used in calculating policy benefit reserves. For
certain interest-sensitive products, costs are generally amortized over the
estimated lives of the products in relation to the present value of estimated
gross profits from surrender charges and investment, mortality, and expense
margins. Amortization for the products is adjusted periodically to reflect
differences in actual and assumed gross profits.
   
DAC is increased for the estimated effect of realizing
unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing
unrealized investment gains. The offset to these amounts is recorded
directly to shareholders' equity.
   
The unamortized cost of purchased insurance in force is
included in DAC. Amortization is primarily in relation to the present value of
estimated gross profits over the estimated twenty-two year remaining life of the
related insurance in force with interest rates ranging from 7.5% to 8.5%.
   
The changes in the unamortized cost of purchased insurance in
force for the years ended December 31 follow:

</TABLE> 
 
Policy Liabilities

Liabilities for future policy benefits for traditional life
insurance products are determined using the present value of future net
premiums, benefits and expenses, and the net level valuation method, based on
estimates of future investment yield, mortality, and withdrawal rates, adjusted
to provide for possible adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions are graded
and ranged from 4.5% to 7.5%. Withdrawal assumptions are based principally on
experience and vary by issue age, type of coverage, and duration.
   
Liabilities for future policy benefits of certain interest-
sensitive products are policy account balances before applicable surrender
charges, certain deferred policy initiation fees that are recognized as income
over the term of the policies, and a provision for the return of the cost of
insurance charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense
include interest credited to policy account balances, benefit claims incurred in
the period in excess of related policy account balances, and provision for the
return of the cost of insurance charges. Credited interest rates for these
products ranged from 4.0% to 7.3% at December 31, 1994.
   
Liabilities for policy and contract claims are determined using
case-basis evaluations and statistical analyses. These liabilities represent
estimates of the ultimate expected cost of incurred claims. Any required
revisions in these estimates are included in operations in the period when the
revisions are made.

Goodwill

The cost of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired
is reported as goodwill and is  amortized on a straight-line basis, generally
over thirty-five years. Goodwill is evaluated based on the prospect of continued
growth and the long-term nature of the insurance policies sold. The asset value
is considered appropriate. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was
$6,842,000 and $6,023,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
Separate Account

Separate Account assets and liabilities are principally carried at
fair value and represent funds that are separately administered for annuity
contracts for which the contract holders bear the investment risk. Investment
income and realized gains and losses allocable to Separate Accounts generally
accrue to the contract holders and are excluded from the Consolidated Statement
of Operations.
 
Income Taxes

The accounting policies of WNC result in deferred taxes being
provided for significant temporary differences between financial statement and
tax return bases, using the asset and liability method. These differences result
primarily from policy reserves, DAC, certain investments, and reserves for
postretirement benefits. WNC and its subsidiaries file a consolidated
life/nonlife federal income tax return.

Reinsurance

The insurance subsidiaries of WNC reinsure a portion of their life
insurance, annuity, and health insurance risks with other insurance companies to
minimize their exposure to loss. The Company's policy on claim exposure for the
life insurance and annuity business is to retain a maximum of $300,000 of life
insurance exposure on any one individual ($400,000 with accidental death
coverage). For group insurance products, the Company limits its paid-claim
exposure in any one calendar year to $750,000 per claim for major medical
coverage and $250,000 per claim for individual stop-loss. The Company retains a
maximum of 50% of each long-term disability and long-term care claim, and limits
its group term life insurance exposure to $200,000 per life ($400,000 with
accidental death coverage). The Company's reinsurance for individual health
insurance claims is designed to protect the Company from an excessive amount of
claims over $250,000 on an individual claim basis.
   
Substantially all of the reinsurance ceded by the Company is to
entities rated "A" or better by A. M. Best, or to entities required to maintain
assets in an independent trust fund whose fair value is sufficient to discharge
the obligations of the reinsurer. To the extent that any reinsurance company is
unable to meet its obligations under the agreements, WNC's insurance
subsidiaries remain liable.
   
Benefit amounts paid directly by the Company for insurance
claims covered under reinsurance ceded agreements are recorded as reinsurance
recoverables to the extent not already reimbursed. The cost of reinsurance
related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the
underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to
account for the underlying policies.
   
Substantially all of the reinsurance assumed by the Company as
of December 31, 1994, relates to individual health insurance. It is on a 50% or
100% coinsurance basis and is accounted for in a manner similar to the direct
business.

The nature of WNC's deferred tax assets and liabilities is such
that the general reversal pattern for these temporary differences is expected to
result in a full realization of WNC's deferred tax assets other than capital
gain or loss items.
 
At December 31, 1994, WNC had capital loss carryforwards for
tax return purposes of $1,510,000 that expire in 1996. For financial reporting
purposes, a valuation allowance of $15,706,000 has been recognized to offset the
deferred tax assets related to those carryforwards, investment loss reserves,
and other capital-loss-related deferred tax assets not expected to be realized.
The valuation allowance was increased by $803,000 in 1994 and reduced by
$3,272,000 in 1993.
 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 changed WNC's
prevailing federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993.
 
The following reconciles the difference between the actual tax
provision and the amounts obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax
rates of 35% for 1994 and 1993 and 34% for 1992 to the income before income 
taxes and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles:

Prior to 1984, WNC's life insurance subsidiaries were required
to accumulate certain untaxed amounts in a memorandum "policyholders' surplus
account." Under the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the "policyholders' surplus account"
balances were "capped" at December 31, 1983 and the balances will be taxed only
to the extent distributed to shareholders or when they exceed certain prescribed
limits. WNC's life insurance subsidiaries do not intend to make any taxable
distributions or exceed the prescribed limits in the foreseeable future;
therefore, no income tax provision has been made for those purposes. However, if
such taxes were assessed, the amount of tax payable would be $19,851,000. As of
December 31, 1994, the combined "policyholders' surplus account" of WNC's life
insurance subsidiaries approximates $56,717,000.
   
Under current and prior law, income of WNC's life insurance
subsidiaries taxed on a current basis is accumulated in a shareholders' surplus
account and can be distributed without tax to WNC. At December 31, 1994, this
shareholders' surplus was $256,043,000.
   
Federal income taxes paid by WNC were $8,120,000, $4,100,000,
and $8,700,000 in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively. WNC has a nonlife net
operating loss carryforward for tax purposes of $451,000 that will begin to
expire in 2008.
 
 
Note D
Capital  Stock

Convertible Preferred Stock

WNC has 10,000,000 authorized shares of $5 par value Preferred
Stock that is designated as $2.50 Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share is
entitled to a cumulative annual dividend of $2.50 and a preference of $50 in the
event of involuntary liquidation of WNC and $55 in the event of voluntary
liquidation of WNC. Further, each share is convertible at any time into 1.875
shares of Common Stock at the option of the holder and is redeemable at $55 at
the option of WNC. Each holder is entitled to one vote for each share held and,
except as otherwise provided by law, the $2.50 Convertible Preferred Stock and
the Common Stock vote together as one class.

Stock Purchase Rights

WNC has one outstanding Common Stock Purchase Right for each
outstanding share of Common Stock. The Rights will become exercisable only if a
person or group acquires 20% or more of WNC's Common Stock or announces a tender
offer following which it would hold 30% or more of such Common Stock. If the
Rights become exercisable, a holder will be entitled to buy from WNC one share
of WNC Common Stock at a price of $100 per share. If, after the Rights become
exercisable, WNC is acquired in a merger or other business combination or more
than 50% of WNC's assets or earning power are sold, each Right will entitle its
holder to buy that number of shares of Common Stock of the acquiring company
having a fair value of twice the exercise price of the Right. Alternatively, if
a 20% WNC shareholder acquires WNC by means of a merger in which WNC and its
Common Stock survive or that shareholder engages in self-dealing transactions
with WNC, each Right not owned by the 20% holder would become exercisable for
that number of shares of WNC Common Stock which have a fair value of twice the
exercise price of the Right. Until the Rights become exercisable, one additional
Right will be distributed with each share of WNC Common Stock issued in the
future. The Rights will expire in January 1997. The Rights may be redeemed by
WNC at $.01 per Right prior to the time that 20% or more of WNC's Common Stock
has been accumulated by a person or group or within ten days thereafter under
certain circumstances.

Common Stock

WNC has 60,000,000 authorized shares of $5 par value Common Stock
including treasury shares. At December 31, 1994, 13,768,000 shares of WNC's
Common Stock were reserved for future issuance. Of this amount, 12,163,000
shares were reserved for future exercises of Purchase Rights, 271,000 shares
were reserved for conversion of outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock,
1,314,000 shares were reserved for exercise of options to purchase Common Stock
and for use in connection with the restricted stock grants, and 20,000 shares
were reserved for issuance of Common Stock in connection with the dividend
reinvestment plan. The annual dividend paid on WNC Common Stock in 1994, 1993,
and 1992 was $1.08 per share.

Earnings Per Share

The number of shares used in computing earnings per share follows:

</TABLE>

Primary and fully diluted earnings per share were the same for
1992 because the computation of fully diluted earnings per share resulted in a
smaller loss per share.

Reinsurance

The effect of reinsurance on premiums and policy charges for the
years ended December 31 follows:

</TABLE>   
   
Reinsurance benefits ceded were $22,850,000, $22,685,000, and
$22,516,000, in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.
   
As a result of past divestitures, the Company reinsures 100% of
certain supplemental health insurance, life insurance, and annuity business with
unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 1994, 50% of WNC's total reinsurance
recoverables were ceded to Combined Life Insurance Company of America, and 16%
were ceded to American Founders Life Insurance Company. In addition, 16% of
reinsurance ceded was to UNUM Life Insurance Company in the normal course of
business.
   
For 1994, 42% and 57% of reinsurance premiums assumed were from
Harvest Life Insurance Company (Harvest Life) and National Casualty Company
(National Casualty), respectively. These reinsurance agreements provide that the
Company will reinsure blocks of individual major medical business issued by
National Casualty and Harvest Life on a 50% and 100% coinsurance basis,
respectively. The Company also administers 100% of the National Casualty
business.
   
The Company uses yearly renewable term reinsurance at its
subsidiary United Presidential Life Insurance Company (UPI) to maintain
statutory profitability and other statutory financial requirements while
sustaining UPI's growth. At December 31, 1994, such reinsurance, all entered
into prior to 1994, net of related taxes, had contributed $9,044,000 of
statutory capital to UPI. These transactions do not materially impact the
Company's GAAP financial statements.

Stock Benefit Plan

WNC has a stock benefit plan under which the compensation committee of WNC's
Board of Directors may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, and
shares of restricted stock. The following summarizes the changes in the shares
of Common Stock of WNC under the Plan:

to $21.70 per share. Exercise prices on stock options outstanding ranged from
$10.21 to $27.29 per share.
   
Shares of restricted stock may be granted either separately or
in tandem with the grant of a stock option to key employees and others and are
subject to certain terms and conditions defined in the plan. Options for 7,500
restricted shares granted in tandem with options were granted in 1992.


Note G
Defined Benefit and Contribution Plans

Retirement Plans

The Company has three qualified defined contribution retirement
plans:  a non-contributory money-purchase retirement plan, a non-contributory
discretionary profit sharing plan, and a contributory 401(k) plan. The plans
cover substantially all employees who have met the prescribed requirements for
participation. The Company contribution to the money-purchase retirement plan is
3% of each employee's compensation plus an additional 3% of compensation in
excess of the Social Security wage base. The Company contribution to the profit
sharing plan is at the discretion of the insurance subsidiaries' Boards of
Directors in consultation with the WNC Board of Directors and is based on
financial performance. Employees' may contribute up to 12% of compensation to
the 401(k) plan. The Company matches employee contributions dollar for
dollar up to a maximum of 3% of compensation. The net pension expense for
the defined contribution plans in 1994, 1993, and 1992 was $3,006,000,
$3,760,000, and $2,808,000, respectively. The Company has a non-qualified
supplemental retirement plan under which benefits are paid to certain employees
equal to the amounts by which the qualified plan benefits are reduced due to
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). At December 31, 1994 and 1993,
the unfunded liability for the supplemental retirement plan was immaterial.
   
Both WNIC and UPI have a defined benefit retirement plan that
covers certain grandfathered employees and agents. Both plans have been amended
to terminate the accrual of future benefits which resulted in the Company
recording a curtailment gain. Benefits are based principally on years of service
and compensation. Generally, the funding policies are to contribute
annually at least the minimum amounts required by the IRC. Contributions are
intended to provide benefits attributed to service to date.
   
A summary of the components of the net periodic pension expense
(income) for the defined benefit retirement plans follows:

</TABLE>
 
The unrecognized transition asset in the preceding schedule is
the amount by which the plans' net assets exceeded the actuarial present value
of projected benefit obligations, net of amortization, as of January 1, 1985,
the date current pension accounting standards were adopted. The transition asset
is being amortized by credits to income over a fourteen-year period. In
addition, the excess of actual investment and actuarial gains and losses
realized over those expected are deferred and, when the cumulative deferred
amounts exceed certain limits, will be amortized at a rate consistent with a
fourteen-year amortization period. Costs created by plan amendments that are
associated with prior employee service are also deferred and amortized over
fourteen years.
 
GAAP requires employers to recognize a minimum liability at
least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation. When the accrued or
prepaid pension cost is less than the minimum liability, an adjustment is made
to the liability with the offset directly to shareholders' equity. At December
31, 1994 and 1993, the pretax  adjustment was $2,769,000 and $3,033,000,
respectively.
   
The weighted-average discount rates used in calculating the
projected benefit obligations at December 31, 1994 and 1993 were 7.5% and 6.7%,
respectively. The expected weighted-average rate of return on plan assets was
7.6% in 1994 and 7.5%  in 1993 and 1992.
 
Plan assets are invested principally in mutual funds, bonds,
and stocks. Assets of the WNIC retirement plan include Common and Preferred
Stock of WNC of $8,580,000 and $10,863,000, at fair value, at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively. Dividends of $492,000 were received on the WNC Common
and Preferred Stock in both 1994 and 1993. No WNC shares were purchased or sold
during 1994 or 1993.

Postretirement Benefits

In addition to WNC's retirement programs, WNIC provides medical and
life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees under the WNIC Group
Insurance Plan. The plan was amended effective December 31, 1992 to limit future
eligibility. Active WNIC employees who were at least age 50 on December 31, 1992
are eligible for medical and life insurance benefits after reaching a
combination of age and service requirements. The plan pays a stated percentage
of most medical expenses reduced for deductibles and payments made by government
programs or other group coverage. Retirees contribute to the plan based on a
schedule which averages 13% for single coverage and 21% for dependent coverage
of the benefits paid. Active WNIC employees who were not at least age 50 on
December 31, 1992 are eligible for $10,000 of life insurance benefits under the
plan after reaching a combination of age and service requirements.  The 1992
plan curtailment resulted in a gain of $4,033,000 recorded as part of
operations in that year. The Company has reserved the right to change or
eliminate these benefits at any time.
   
In December 1993, the Company established a Voluntary
Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust under section 501(c)(9) of the
IRC. Prior to this time, postretirement benefits were unfunded. In December 1994
and 1993, the Company contributed $1,600,000 and $1,100,000, respectively, to
the VEBA trust. The amounts funded were based on the difference between the net
periodic postretirement benefit expense as measured by statutory accounting
rules and the retiree medical claims incurred during the respective periods,
subject to certain IRC limitations. Assets of the VEBA trust were invested in
two-year U.S. Treasury notes and corporate demand notes at December 31, 1994.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is based on
actuarial assumptions for the weighted-average discount rate and the health care
cost trend rate. The weighted-average discount rate was 7.5% in 1994 and 7.0% in
1993. The health care cost trend rate used in 1994 was 12% for pre-65 and 10%
for post-65 participants, graded evenly to 5% in 15 years. The health care cost
trend rate in 1993 was 14% graded evenly to 6% in 29 years. The weighted-average
of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets net of estimated taxes
on investment income was 4.62% in 1994.  The estimated income tax rate for the
VEBA trust was 34% in 1994. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the trend rate by 1% per
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$2,215,000 and $2,825,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the net periodic
postretirement benefit expense for 1994 and 1993 by $196,000 and $200,000,
respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

WNC has noncancelable operating leases primarily for office space
and office equipment, the most significant of which is a twenty-year lease of
WNIC's home office building with a related party as lessor. Future minimum lease
payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 1994 follow:

Financial Commitments and Guarantees

The Company has entered into financial guarantees which are
financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk. The exposure to credit
risk is represented by the amount the Company, under certain circumstances,
would contractually have to pay out. These financial instruments were entered
into for the fee income and the potential to share in future capital
appreciation of the underlying assets.
   
A financial guarantee is a conditional commitment to guarantee
the payment of an obligation by an unrelated entity to a third party. At
December 31, 1994, the Company had two financial guarantees totaling $15,206,000
which are collateralized by the underlying real estate and related assets
compared to financial guarantees totaling $24,132,000 at December 31, 1993. In
the event of a sale or refinancing, the Company is entitled to share in the
appreciation of the collateral.
   
The financial guarantees are scheduled to expire in 1995 and
1997. The Company has not funded any of its financial guarantees to date and
feels it has adequate reserves for potential losses in the future.

Litigation

WNC and certain affiliated companies have been named in various
pending legal proceedings considered to be ordinary routine litigation
incidental to the business of such companies. A number of other legal actions
have been filed that demand compensatory and punitive damages aggregating
material dollar amounts. WNC believes that such suits are substantially without
merit and that valid defenses exist. WNC's management and its chief legal
officer believe that such litigation will not have a material effect on WNC's
consolidated results of operations or financial position.
   
In September 1994, two retired employees filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against WNC,
WNIC, and the three individual trustees of the Washington National Insurance
Company Home Office Group Insurance Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs purport to
act as members of a class consisting of all employees of WNC and WNIC who
retired or tendered their irrevocable notice of retirement on or before July 24,
1989 and who are eligible to receive benefits under the Plan.
   
The complaint is brought under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act and alleges that WNC, WNIC, and the trustees have taken and
threatened to take actions to modify, amend, or terminate the Plan in violation
of written and oral promises and representations and the terms of the Plan. The
alleged violations include changing the method for computing claims payable
under the Plan, requiring retired employees to contribute to the payment of
premiums for their Medicare supplemental health insurance coverage, and
maintaining that WNC, WNIC, and the trustees have reserved the right to modify
or terminate benefits under the Plan. Plaintiffs seek a declaration of their
rights under the Plan, with respect to these actions, an award of attorneys' 
fees and other relief, and a certification of the class.
   
WNC, WNIC, and the trustees believe that valid defenses exist
and intend to contest vigorously the material allegations made in the complaint.

Health Care Reform

See Management's Discussion and Analysis, page 26, for a discussion
of health care reform and its possible effect on the Company's business.

State Guaranty Funds

Under insolvency or guaranty laws in most states in which the
Company's insurance subsidiaries operate, insurers can be assessed for
policyholder losses incurred by insolvent insurance companies. At present, most
insolvency or guaranty laws provide for assessments based on the amount of
insurance underwritten in a given jurisdiction. The Company's insurance
subsidiaries paid $2,850,000, $2,500,000, and $1,800,000 in state guaranty fund
assessments in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively, and had accrued liabilities
of $3,128,000 and $2,800,000 for future assessments at December 31, 1994 and
1993, respectively. Mandatory assessments can be partially recovered through a
reduction in future premium taxes in some states.
   
The Company's accounting policy with regard to payments to
state guaranty funds is to treat as an asset any such payments in those states
where current law allows an offset against future premium taxes. At December 31,
1994 and 1993, other assets included $5,464,000 and $5,100,000, respectively, of
deferred payments to state guaranty funds. Generally, these amounts will be used
to offset future premium tax payments over periods from five to ten years. In
the event of a change in the state laws pertaining to prior tax offsets, such
amounts might become unrecoverable.


Note I
Statutory Financial Information

WNC's insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles and practices prescribed or permitted
by the insurance department of their state of domicile. Prescribed statutory
accounting practices currently include state laws, regulations, and general
administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a
particular state, as well as practices described in National Association of
Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) publications. Permitted practices include
practices not prescribed, but allowed, by the domiciliary state insurance
department. The prescribed and permitted statutory accounting practices followed
by WNC's insurance subsidiaries differ from GAAP. 
   
Current statutory practice does not address reserves for
certain endowment features of several life insurance products marketed by one of
the Company's subsidiaries. The subsidiary uses a practice permitted by its
state of domicile and discounts the future benefit using mortality and interest
rate assumptions.
   
The NAIC is currently working on a project to codify statutory
accounting practices (SAP). This process will result in a single source of SAP,
possibly eliminating the concept of permitted practices.

Dividends From Subsidiaries

Regulatory restrictions limit the dollar amount of dividends
available for distribution to WNC from its insurance subsidiaries without prior
approval by regulatory authorities. The amount of dividends available is based
on the greater of: a) 10% of the insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and
surplus as of the preceding year end; or b) the insurance subsidiaries'
statutory net income from operations for the preceding year. Based on these
restrictions, WNC's insurance subsidiaries are permitted a maximum of
$22,127,000 in dividend distributions to WNC in 1995. In 1994, WNC received
dividends of $5,975,000 from WNIC.

Borrowings and Credit Arrangements

Borrowings

Borrowings of $1,907,000 at December 31, 1994 are for a mortgage on
investment real estate with an interest rate of 6.5% that matures in April,
1998. Payments of $504,000, $672,000, $655,000,  and $296,000 will be required
in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. The property, with a carrying value
of $11,922,000, is pledged as collateral.
   
Interest paid on borrowings by WNC was $406,000, $1,673,000,
and $1,313,000, in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

Credit Arrangements

WNC has a line of credit with one bank available for short-term
borrowings amounting to $10,000,000, all unused at December 31, 1994. The line
of credit arrangement is renewable annually, but credit can be withdrawn at the
bank's option.
   
In addition, WNC has seven letters of credit with varying terms
and conditions totaling $4,895,000. As of December 31, 1994, the entire amount
was unused.

Note L
Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Valuation Methods and Assumptions

The disclosure of fair value information about certain financial
instruments is based primarily on quoted market prices. In cases where quoted
market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using
present value or other valuation techniques. These estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not
be realized in the immediate settlement of the instrument.
   
The fair values of short-term investments, venture capital
partnerships, and accrued investment income approximate the carrying amounts
reported in the balance sheets.
   
Fair values for fixed maturity and equity securities are based
on quoted market prices where available. For fixed maturity securities not
actively traded, fair values are estimated using values obtained from
independent pricing services or, in the case of private placements, are
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate
applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the investments.
   
Fair values for mortgage loans and policy loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on interest rates currently being 
offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. A pricing 
cap is put on mortgage loans that carry significant above-market interest 
rate yields to reflect the prepayment risk.
   
Fair values for liabilities under investment-type insurance
contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on
interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with similar
maturities.
   
The fair value of the mortgage payable is estimated by
discounting cash flows, using current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements.
   
Fair values for real estate development guarantees are based on
estimates of fees to guarantee similar developments. Fair values for lending
commitments are based on the commitment fees of the loans in question.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of certain financial instruments along with their
corresponding carrying values at December 31, 1994 and 1993 follow. As the fair
value of all WNC's assets and liabilities are not presented, this information in
the aggregate does not represent the underlying value of WNC. WNC does not own
any financial instruments held or issued for trading purposes.

Segment Information

WNC has three business segments: life insurance and annuities;
health insurance (previously reported as the individual health insurance and
group products segments); and corporate and other. The segments are based on

We consent to the incorporation by reference in this Annual
Report (Form 10-K) of Washington National Corporation of our
report dated February 13, 1995, included in the 1994 Annual
Report to Shareholders of Washington National Corporation.

Our audit also included the financial statement schedules of
Washington National Corporation listed in Item 14(a). These
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In
our opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. As discussed in Note A, the
Company changed its method of accounting for certain investments
in debt and equity securities in 1994, postemployment benefits in
1993, and income taxes and postretirement benefits other than
pensions in 1992.

We also consent to the incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statements pertaining to the stock benefit plan
(Form S-8 Numbers 33-28858, 33-10179, and 2-83640) and automatic
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan (Form S-3 Number 2-
72599) of Washington National Corporation and the related
Prospectuses of our report dated February 13, 1995, with respect
to the financial statements incorporated herein by reference, and
our report included in the preceding paragraph with respect to
the financial statement schedules included in this Annual Report
(Form 10-K) of Washington National Corporation.
