ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General Development of Business

Washington National Corporation (WNC) was incorporated as a general
business corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law on
February 26, 1968, for the initial purpose of becoming the parent
company and sole stockholder of Washington National Insurance
Company (WNIC), an Illinois insurance corporation dating back to
1911. WNC was organized in order to permit diversification into the
broader field of financial services and is admitted to do business
in Delaware, Indiana, and Illinois. Its executive offices are
located at 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069-3665.

The primary operating companies of WNC are WNIC and United
Presidential Life Insurance Company (UPI). As of December 31, 1993,
WNC and its affiliates had 971 employees.

In 1989, WNC and its affiliates completed a strategic plan and began
restructuring their operations. The strategic plan called for the
divestiture of the home service and direct response lines of
business at WNIC and a subsidiary, Washington National Life
Insurance Company of New York (WNNY). WNIC sold the direct response
and home service product lines and WNNY in 1989, 1990, and 1991,
respectively. The organization is now focused on four lines of
business: individual health insurance, group employee benefits,
disability insurance for educators (all underwritten by WNIC), and
individual life insurance and annuities (underwritten by UPI).

In the third quarter of 1993, WNC issued 2.1 million new shares of
common stock in a public offering that raised $47.3 million.

    GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
                                  
WNC is an insurance holding company which, through WNIC and UPI,
provides life, annuity, health, disability, and specialty insurance
products to individuals and groups in carefully targeted markets.
The business segments related to WNC's business are a life insurance
and annuities segment, an individual health insurance segment, a
group products segment, and a corporate and other segment. The
corporate and other segment includes realized investment gains and
losses, as well as the operations of divested lines of business and
the gain or loss on the sales thereof. In addition, this segment
includes the operations of WNC that do not specifically support one
of the other segments.

Further information about WNC's four business segments can be found in 
Item 8, under the caption "Note K - Segment Information."

Washington National Insurance Company

WNIC is a legal reserve stock life insurance company organized under
the laws of Illinois in 1926 and is the successor to other companies
dating back to 1911. WNIC's home office is located at 300 Tower
Parkway, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069-3665. WNIC is licensed to do
business in all states of the United States (except New York) and
the District of Columbia.

WNIC underwrites individual health insurance, group employee
benefits, and disability insurance for educators. As part of the
corporate strategy plan, the decision was made to write life
insurance and annuity business solely at UPI. Therefore, as of
November 1989, WNIC ceased writing individual life insurance
policies and annuities, except for home service life products, which
WNIC ceased writing in March 1990; however, WNIC continues to
administer existing life insurance and annuity business.

WNIC's individual health line of business includes major medical
and hospital-surgical policies. Group employee benefits consists of
term life, major medical, disability income, and dental insurance
policies. Disability insurance for educators generally is sponsored
by school districts or educational associations for voluntary
purchase by employees of public school systems.

In 1993, 2% of WNIC's insurance premiums and other policy charges
were derived from products in the life insurance and annuities
segment. A total of 40% of WNIC's 1993 insurance premiums and other
policy charges were derived from products in the individual health
insurance segment. A total of 58% of WNIC's 1993 insurance premiums
and other policy charges were derived from products in the group
products segment, of which 16% and 84% were from life insurance and
health insurance, respectively. Group health insurance premiums were
29%, 30%, and 35% of WNC's total revenues in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.

Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois account for approximately 33% of
WNIC's annual premium revenue. Arizona, Louisiana, Florida, and
Missouri also account for a significant portion of WNIC's premium
revenue, with a combined 20% of the total premium revenue.

WNIC's insurance products are primarily sold by salaried group
insurance representatives and field marketing organizations. The
sector of WNIC's field force that distributes group employee
benefits and disability insurance for educators consists of 65 field
representatives, including 12 managers, all of whom are salaried
employees of WNIC. Their activities are supported by 110 other field
employees. WNIC markets individual health products through brokers,
who are employed by field marketing organizations under standard
brokerage contracts. At December 31, 1993, WNIC had approximately
40,500 brokers employed by 66 field marketing organizations, who
sell insurance for other companies as well as for WNIC.

United Presidential Life Insurance Company

UPI, an Indiana life insurance company, began business in 1965 and
currently is licensed to do business in 45 states and the District
of Columbia. UPI's parent company, United Presidential Corporation
(UPC), was incorporated in 1961 as an Indiana corporation and,
effective during the fourth quarter of 1993, is 71% owned by WNIC
and 29% owned by WNC. Prior to fourth quarter 1993 UPC was owned
100% by WNIC. Both UPC and UPI have executive offices located at One
Presidential Parkway, Kokomo, Indiana 46904-9006. UPI's primary
business is the marketing and underwriting of individual life
insurance and annuities. Its primary marketing focus is interest-
sensitive products such as universal life insurance, excess-interest
whole life insurance, and annuities. UPI's operating results are in
the life insurance and annuities segment.

California, Indiana, and Michigan account for approximately 29% of
UPI's 1993 premiums and other charges. However, several other states
make significant contributions to premiums and other charges,
including Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Minnesota.

Sales are made through approximately 8,000 insurance agents and
brokers having an independent contractor relationship with UPI. Such
persons may also be independent insurance brokers. UPI has no
internal or captive sales force and accordingly, has negligible
training, maintenance, or financing expenses. This marketing system
facilitates sales force expansion without significant cost, provided
that product lines remain competitive with those being offered by
other companies.

New Products of the Segments

For the life insurance and annuities segment, UPI introduced in 1993
two new universal life insurance products to meet the demands and
needs of the marketplace. In 1994, UPI will introduce a low premium
permanent life insurance product and an update to its annuity
portfolio of products.

The individual health insurance segment introduced in 1993 new
versions of its major-medical and in-hospital products. New products
anticipated in 1994 are an individual disability product and a
cancer insurance product.

The group products segment introduced in 1993 a cancer insurance
product and several enhancements for disability insurance for
employees of employer-sponsored groups. New products anticipated in
1994 are long-term care insurance and further enhancements to
disability insurance.

Competitive Conditions of the Segments

The insurance subsidiaries, along with other insurance companies
with whom they are in competition, are subject to regulation and
supervision by the supervisory agency in each jurisdiction in which
they are licensed to do business, greatly affecting the competitive
environment in which they operate. These supervisory agencies have
broad administrative powers, including those relating to the
granting and revocation of licenses to transact business, licensing
of agents, approval of policy forms, establishing reserve
requirements as well as the form and content of required financial
statements, and conducting of periodic examinations. The companies
must meet the standards and tests established by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners and, in particular, the
investment laws and regulations of their states of incorporation.
This regulation and supervision is primarily for the protection of
policyowners and not stockholders.

WNIC's individual health insurance line of business faces
competition from approximately 45 companies. There are approximately
90 group employee benefits insurers and less than 30 insurers of
disability insurance for educators in competition with WNIC's group
products segment. UPI competes for the sale of life insurance and
annuity products with approximately 300 U.S. life insurance
companies, including stock and mutual companies.

          FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

Neither WNC nor any affiliated company is licensed to do business
outside of the United States.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

WNC's home office building is in a five-story, 175,000 square-foot
office building located at 300 Tower Parkway, Lincolnshire,
Illinois. The building is leased from a joint venture partnership in
which Washington National Development Company (WNDC), a subsidiary
of WNIC, has a one-third interest. WNC first occupied the property
in May, 1993 and WNIC signed a twenty-year lease to occupy the
building.

WNDC has a fifty percent interest in a joint venture partnership
that owns a 22,000 square-foot data center in Vernon Hills,
Illinois, that is leased and occupied solely by WNIC. WNIC first
occupied the property in April, 1993 and signed a twenty-year lease.

WNIC also owns a 335,000 square-foot office building in Evanston,
Illinois. WNIC occupies approximately 7 percent of this building and
leases the remainder to nonaffiliated commercial enterprises. At
December 31, 1993, the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan
secured by this property was $2,434,000. WNIC also occupies 28 field
offices throughout the country, all of which are leased.

UPI's home office is a 102,000 square-foot office building that UPI
owns, and is located on a thirty-acre site in Kokomo, Indiana.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WNC and certain affiliated companies have been named in various
pending legal proceedings considered to be ordinary routine
litigation incidental to the business of such companies. A number of
other legal actions have been filed against WNC's subsidiaries which
demand compensatory and punitive damages aggregating material dollar
amounts. WNC believes that such suits are substantially without
merit and that valid defenses exist. WNC's management is of the
opinion that such litigation will not have a material effect on
WNC's consolidated financial position. No proceedings, or group of
proceedings presenting in large degree the same issues, exceed the
materiality standard for disclosure contained in Instruction 2 to
Item 103 of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION            
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Overview
Washington National Corporation (WNC or the Company) is an insurance
holding company that, through its two principal operating subsidiaries,
Washington National Insurance Company (WNIC) and United Presidential Life
Insurance Company (UPI), provides life, annuity, health, disability, and
specialty insurance products to individuals and groups in carefully
targeted markets that the Company believes are underserved by other
insurance carriers. In 1991, the Company completed a three-year corporate
restructuring that narrowed its focus to three core businesses, improved
its operating performance, and in management's view, positioned the Company
for profitable expansion.

The Company's three core businesses are: (i) life insurance and annuities:
universal life insurance and other interest-sensitive life insurance and
annuity products marketed to individuals and small businesses; (ii) group
products: employee-paid disability and other specialty insurance products
for teachers and other employers with 100 to 1,000 employees; and (iii)
individual health: individual health insurance products, primarily major
medical and hospital coverage for persons under the age of 65 without
employer-sponsored insurance.

The Company employs a decentralized operating structure and utilizes
distinct distribution systems to access each of its targeted markets and to
provide timely, individualized service to its customers. The Company
emphasizes the sale of market-driven products, a profit-oriented rather
than a volume-oriented approach to underwriting, tight expense controls,
and a proactive approach to market and regulatory changes. The Company
continually evaluates new products and markets in order to capitalize on
potential opportunities and to anticipate and respond effectively to
business and regulatory changes.

Corporate Restructuring
In 1988, the Company commenced a major restructuring effort to narrow its
focus to three core businesses, reduced its work force by over two-thirds,
and recruited new operating managers with many years of insurance industry
experience. The Company decentralized decision-making and implemented
performance-based management compensation in order to promote greater
accountability at the operating business level. The Company also invested
approximately $40 million in its operating businesses to improve computer
systems, technical expertise, administrative facilities, and distribution
systems. In addition, the Company implemented underwriting and pricing
changes in its three core businesses to improve profitability, and upgraded
the quality of its investment portfolio.

Strategy
The Company's current focus is on continuing the improvement in its
operating performance, principally through a strategy of disciplined
revenue growth in each of the three core businesses along with further
reductions in expense ratios. The Company seeks to achieve revenue growth
primarily by expanding its sale of existing and new products and services
within targeted markets that are underserved by other insurance carriers.
The Company anticipates that additional revenue growth may result from
certain cross-marketing opportunities within its businesses and selected
acquisitions of profitable blocks of business. Additionally, the Company
believes that its life insurance and annuities business complements the
Company's more cyclical health businesses, thereby providing greater
stability to the Company's earnings base. The Company seeks to achieve
reductions in its expense ratios through infrastructure improvements,
ongoing work flow re-engineering, and revenue growth.

The Company is closely monitoring developments concerning health care
reform and is preparing strategic responses to different possible outcomes.
In anticipation of health care reform, the Company's health businesses have
begun to diversify into product areas that the Company believes are
consistent with its targeted market focus and may be less affected, or
unaffected, by health care reform. The Company's strategy regarding health
care reform is discussed in more detail under the caption "Health Care 
Reform."

Year Ended December 31, 1993 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1992

Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges. Insurance premiums and policy
charges increased $57.8 million, or 15.2%, from $381.0 million in 1992 to
$438.8 million in 1993. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
individual health insurance premiums of $52.3 million and group products
premiums of $4.1 million resulting from an increased amount of business in
force and rate increases for both segments and $23.2 million of premium
revenues from an individual health reinsurance transaction entered into in
the second quarter of 1993. See "Segment Information - Group Products" and
"Segment Information - Individual Health," below.

Net Investment Income.  Net investment income decreased $3.4 million, or
1.8%, to $183.7 million in 1993 from $187.1 million in 1992. The decrease
was due to a general decline in market interest rates which caused a
decline in the Company's portfolio yield from 8.6% to 8.0%, offset in part
by an increase in invested assets. Invested assets at December 31, 1993
increased $122.4 million from December 31, 1992, principally due to
deposits on life insurance policies and annuity contracts exceeding
withdrawals combined with proceeds from a secondary stock offering in the
third quarter of 1993.

Realized Investment Losses. Realized investment losses for 1993 were $0.4
million compared to $4.6 million in 1992. In 1993, realized gains of $7.8
million, $2.0 million, and $0.4 million on fixed maturity investments,
mortgage loans on real estate, and equity securities, respectively, were
offset by losses of $10.6 million on real estate investments. In 1992,
realized gains of $5.6 million on fixed maturity investments were offset by
losses of $4.9 million on mortgage loans on real estate, $3.6 million on
real estate investments, and $1.7 million on equity securities.

Insurance Benefits Paid or Provided. Insurance benefits paid or provided
increased $10.6 million, or 2.6%, from $409.8 million in 1992 to $420.4
million in 1993. The increase was primarily due to increased individual
health insurance benefits of $29.2 million resulting from an increase in
the block of in force business and the reinsurance transaction referred to
above. Partially offsetting this was a decline in life insurance and
annuities benefits of $16.6 million resulting from a decrease in interest
credited on interest-sensitive products, favorable mortality experience,
and the annual review of benefits assumptions, discussed below in
"Amortization of Deferred Insurance Costs."

Insurance and General Expenses. Insurance and general expenses increased
$24.4 million from $107.1 million in 1992 to $131.5 million in 1993.
Included in 1993 are expenses of $6.9 million related to an individual
health reinsurance transaction. See "Segment Information - Individual
Health," below. Additionally, 1993 includes charges of $1.6 million related
to re-engineering in the life insurance and annuities segment and $1.7
million for the combination of the individual health and employee benefits
divisions. 1993 also includes move related costs, primarily due to the
closing of the Company's previous headquarters.

Amortization of Deferred Insurance Costs. Amortization of deferred
insurance costs increased $10.8 million, or 39.9%, in 1993 to $37.9 million
from $27.1 million in 1992. The change was primarily due to increased
amortization of $3.5 million in the individual health insurance segment
resulting from an increase in the block of in force business and $3.6
million due to the annual review of amortization assumptions in the life
insurance and annuities segment, partially offset by the decrease in
benefits, discussed above.

Income Before Income Taxes and Changes in Accounting Principles. Income
before income taxes and changes in accounting principles increased $12.3
million, or 46.7%, to $38.7 million in 1993 compared to $26.4 million in
1992. The increase was due primarily to improved operations in the
Company's individual health and life insurance and annuities segments,
offset in part by lower pretax income from the group products segment.

Income Taxes. Income taxes increased $1.0 million to $10.5 million in 1993
compared to $9.5 million in 1992, primarily due to improved income from
operations. Included in income taxes for 1993 is a tax credit of $3.2
million related to realized investment losses. Also in 1993, the Company's
federal income tax rate increased from 34% to 35%, retroactive to January
1, 1993, due to legislation enacted in August, 1993.

Changes in Accounting Principles (Net of Taxes).  The Company recorded a
one-time charge of $1.6 million after taxes effective the first quarter
1993 for the adoption of a new accounting standard on accounting for
postemployment benefits. The adoption did not have a material impact on
income before accounting changes. 1992 included a $22.8 million after-tax
charge relating to the first quarter 1992 adoption of new accounting
standards, related to postretirement benefits other than pensions and
income taxes.

Net Income (Loss). Net income for 1993 was $26.7 million compared to a net
loss of $6.0 million in 1992. The improvement in net income resulted
primarily from the charges in the first quarter of 1992 relating to the
adoption of two new accounting standards described above and improved
operations in the individual health and life insurance and annuities
segments, partially offset by a decline in group products operating income
and the charge relating to the new accounting standard in the first quarter
of 1993.

Segment Information
Life Insurance and Annuities. Revenues for the life insurance and annuities
segment, which is comprised of new business sold by UPI to individuals and
small businesses and closed blocks of life insurance and annuities written
by WNIC prior to 1990, were $229.0 million for 1993, down from $233.5
million in 1992. A decline in investment income of $5.8 million resulted
from lower portfolio yield rates, offset in part by an increase in invested
assets. A $1.5 million improvement in insurance revenues was primarily due
to an increase in life insurance in force combined with higher policy
charges at UPI, offset in part by a decline in insurance revenues on the
closed blocks of business at WNIC.

Pretax income for the life insurance and annuities segment increased 28.7%
to $28.1 million in 1993 from $21.9 million in 1992. The increase was
primarily due to improved interest rate spreads, as the interest credited
on account balances was reduced more than the reduction in the yield on
invested assets, and favorable mortality experience. Also contributing to
the improvement was a charge of $2.8 million for anticipated guaranty fund
assessments recorded  in 1992 compared to $0.5 million in 1993. Partially
offsetting these increases were charges in 1993 of $1.6 million to combine
the Company's data centers, implement work flow re-engineering at UPI, and
transfer the administration of WNIC's closed block of life insurance to
UPI.

Group Products. Revenues for the group products segment were $234.6 million
in 1993 compared to $231.2 million in 1992, an increase of 1.5%. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of business in
force in the education product line resulting from sales in 1992 and 1993
and premium rate increases averaging 7% in the employee benefits product
line. These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately
$6 million from the termination of a large group life insurance contract,
with approximately $3 billion of life insurance in force, in the third
quarter of 1993. The annual premiums and related benefits related to this
contract were each approximately $11 million. The termination of this
contract will not materially affect net income.

Pretax income for the group products segment was $6.1 million in 1993
compared to $10.2 million in 1992. The decline was primarily due to higher
medical claims, less favorable mortality experience, and increased
operating expenses, including the receipt in the first quarter of 1992 of
an expense refund of $1.8 million in connection with a withdrawal from a
partnership. Also included in operating expenses in 1993 were charges of
$1.7 million related to the combination of the individual health and
employee benefits divisions. These increases were partially offset by
favorable disability claims experience in 1993.

Individual Health. Revenues for the individual health insurance segment
increased 48.7% to $159.9 million in 1993 compared to $107.6 million in
1992. Revenues for this segment increased in part as a result of a
reinsurance transaction that added a total of $23.2 million of premium
revenue in 1993. In addition to the reinsurance transaction, the amount of
business in force (based on the average number of policies in force)
increased approximately 13% in 1993 compared to 1992 and premium rates
increased an average of 7% in 1993.

Sales of individual health policies declined in 1993 compared to 1992 in
part due to a decision to maintain pricing margins in spite of increased
pricing competition. The Company expects such increased pricing competition
to continue in 1994. However, as a result of an expanded sales force from
the reinsurance agreements described below, the Company expects new sales
will increase in 1994.

Pretax income for the individual health insurance segment was $5.4 million
for 1993 compared to a loss of $3.2 million in 1992. The improvement was
primarily due to a larger premium base over which to spread fixed operating
expenses.

Effective in the 1993 second quarter, the Company entered into a
reinsurance agreement with The Harvest Life Insurance Company (Harvest
Life) that provides that the Company will reinsure 100% of a block of major
medical business issued by Harvest Life. Harvest Life will continue to
administer this business for a period of at least three years. As part of
the reinsurance agreement, Harvest Life has agreed to market the Company's
major medical products in place of its own major medical products through
Harvest Life's career agent sales force. Harvest Life agents sell to
insureds in rural areas, primarily farming communities. In addition to
$23.2 million of premium revenue and $0.2 million of other income recorded
in 1993, insurance benefits of $15.5 million and insurance and general
expenses of $6.9 million were attributable to the reinsurance agreement.

In 1994, the Company entered into a reinsurance agreement with National
Casualty Company, a subsidiary of Nationwide Corporation, whereby the
Company will reinsure 50% of a block of individual major medical health
insurance, effective January 1, 1994. The block had approximately $60
million of premium revenue in 1993. Beginning in 1994, the Company will
administer the entire block of business for a fee paid by National
Casualty. In addition, WNIC will market its products through the existing
National Casualty Company sales force.

The Company will carefully consider entering into additional, similar
reinsurance transactions as they arise.

Corporate and Other.  The corporate and other segment includes realized
investment gains and losses, the operations of non-insurance lines of
business, and corporate expenses. For 1993, the pretax loss was $0.9
million compared to a loss of $2.5 million in 1992. The improvement was
primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in realized investment
losses.

Revenues for this segment are expected to increase slightly in 1994 due to
investment income on a portion of the proceeds from the third quarter 1993
stock offering.

Year Ended December 31, 1992 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1991

Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges. Insurance premiums and policy
charges decreased $5.8 million, or 1.5%, from $386.8 million in 1991 to
$381.0 million in 1992. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $36.5
million decline in the group products segment's premiums which was
primarily due to the termination and restructuring of certain group health
contracts resulting from rate increases in 1991 and a decrease of $3.4
million of premiums and policy charges resulting from the 1991 sale of
discontinued lines. These declines were offset in part by increases in
individual health premiums and policy charges of $24.2 million due to an
increase in the block of in force business from higher sales of and premium
rate increases on individual health policies and by increased policy
charges on life and annuity contracts of $9.8 million.

Net Investment Income. Net investment income decreased $12.3 million, or
6.1%, from $199.4 million in 1991 to $187.1 million in 1992. The decrease
was due to a lower average yield on invested assets in 1992, which
decreased from 9.1% in 1991 to 8.6% in 1992, resulting from a general
decline in interest rates combined with the Company's reinvestment of
assets in higher quality, lower yielding securities.

Realized Investment Losses. Realized investment losses decreased $15.0
million, or 76.5%, from $19.6 million in 1991 to $4.6 million in 1992.
Results in 1992 included gains of $5.6 million on the sale of fixed
maturity investments and losses on mortgage loans on real estate and real
estate investments of $4.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, combined
with losses on equity securities of $1.7 million. Results in 1991 included
a $10.0 million loss related to bonds backed by guaranteed investment
contracts issued by Executive Life Insurance Company as well as losses on
mortgages loans on real estate of $6.6 million and real estate investments
of $3.2 million.

Loss on Divestitures.  The 1991 pretax net loss consisted of a $1.8 million
loss on the sale of a subsidiary, partially offset by a gain on blocks of
business sold by WNIC. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information.

Insurance Benefits Paid or Provided. Insurance benefits paid or provided
decreased $20.5 million, or 4.8%, from $430.3 million in 1991 to $409.8
million in 1992. The decrease was due to a $26.0 million decline in the
group products segment's benefits resulting from the termination and
restructuring of certain group health policies and a $7.5 million decline
in benefits related to the 1991 sale of discontinued lines, offset in part
by an $11.8 million rise in individual health benefits directly associated
with the increased business in force discussed above.

Insurance and General Expenses. Insurance and general expenses, including a
$4.0 million gain from the reduction of postretirement benefits, decreased
$19.9 million, or 15.7%, from $127.0 million in 1991 to $107.1 million in
1992. The decline resulted primarily from the elimination of $3.7 million
of expense from the sale of discontinued lines and a $7.7 million planned
decrease in operating expenses in the group products segment.

Amortization of Deferred Insurance Costs. Amortization of deferred
insurance costs increased $6.0 million, or 28.4%, from $21.1 million in
1991 to $27.1 million in 1992, due primarily to additional amortization
resulting from the early recognition of investment income caused by the
prepayment of certain mortgage-backed securities combined with the increase
in the individual health block of business.

Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Changes in Accounting Principles.
Income (loss) before income taxes and changes in accounting principles
increased $26.8 million from a pretax loss of $0.4 million in 1991 to
pretax income of $26.4 million in 1992. The largest items contributing to
the increase were the $10.6 million improvement in the individual health
segment's pretax income and the $15.0 million decrease in realized
investment losses.

Income Taxes. Income taxes increased $6.9 million from $2.6 million in 1991
to $9.5 million in 1992 due primarily to the higher level of pretax income
of $26.4 million in 1992, versus a pretax loss of $0.4 million in 1991.

Changes in Accounting Principles (Net of Taxes).  Effective January 1,
1992, the Company adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and SFAS 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting
standards was a charge of $20.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively.

Net Loss. Net loss increased $3.0 million from $3.0 million in 1991 to $6.0
million in 1992. The change was primarily as a result of the $22.8 million
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles described above,
partially offset by the increase in income before such changes of $19.8
million.

Segment Information
Life Insurance and Annuities. Revenues for the life insurance and annuities
segment were $233.5 million in 1992 compared to $227.1 million in 1991. The
increase was primarily due to increased policy revenues and investment
income at UPI, offset in part by declines in revenues in the closed blocks
of business at WNIC.

Pretax income for the life insurance and annuities segment decreased 8.9%
to $21.9 million in 1992 compared to $24.0 million in 1991. The decline was
primarily due to 1992 accruals for anticipated guaranty fund assessments of
$2.8 million.

Group Products.  Revenues for the group products segment were $231.2
million in 1992 compared to $268.0 million in 1991. The decline was
attributable to terminated cases and the conversion of several cost plus
cases to a minimum premium basis.

Pretax income for the group products segment declined 24.2% to $10.2
million in 1992 compared to $13.5 million in 1991. The decline was
primarily due to a decline in premium revenues and an increase in the
claims ratio for 1992.

Individual Health. Revenues for the individual health insurance segment
increased 30.5% to $107.6 million in 1992 compared to $82.4 million in
1991. Revenues for this segment primarily increased due to an increase in
the amount of business in force and an increase in premium rates.

Pretax loss for the individual health insurance segment declined $10.6
million to $3.2 million for 1992 compared to a loss of $13.8 million in
1991. The decline in the loss from 1991 was primarily due to a larger
premium base over which to spread fixed operating expenses for this segment
and an improved ratio of claims to premium revenues in 1992.

Corporate and Other. The pretax loss for the corporate and other segment in
1992 was $2.5 million compared to a loss of $24.1 million in 1991. In 1992
realized investment losses were $4.6 million compared to losses of $19.6
million in 1991, which included losses of $10.0 million related to fixed
maturity investments backed by guaranteed investment contracts. 1991 also
included a loss of $1.2 million related to divestitures.

Investment Portfolio
The Company's investment portfolio is managed by an experienced staff of in-
house investment professionals, primarily at WNIC, and outside investment
advisors, primarily the investment management group at Scudder, Stevens &
Clark, Inc. Investments are made pursuant to strategies and guidelines
approved by the Finance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The
Company selects investments that match the needs of the businesses that the
assets support in the areas of yield, liquidity, asset quality, and
duration. The Company pursues a conservative investment philosophy by
balancing a variety of objectives, including high credit quality,
liquidity, high current income, preservation of capital, and protection
against market and interest rate risk. The Company's investment portfolio
consists primarily of investment grade, publicly-traded fixed maturity
investments and mortgage loans on real estate. All investments made by WNIC
and UPI are governed by Illinois and Indiana insurance laws and
regulations, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had invested assets of $2.4 billion. The
following table sets forth certain information about the Company's
investment portfolio as of that date:

Fixed Maturity Investments
The carrying value of fixed maturity investments at December 31, 1993 was
$1.8 billion, or 74.7% of the Company's invested assets. This amount
increased from $1.6 billion, or 69.5% of the Company's invested assets at
December 31, 1992 primarily due to the Company making new investments
principally in investment grade fixed maturity securities. At December 31,
1993 and December 31, 1992, the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity
investments exceeded the carrying value by $82.3 million and $56.9 million,
respectively.

The Company's policy for rating fixed maturity investments is to use the
rating on such investments as determined by Standard & Poor's Company
(S&P's) or Moody's Investor Service, Inc. (Moody's). If an investment has a
split rating (i.e., different ratings from the two rating services) the
Company categorizes the investment under the lower rating. For those
investments that do not have a rating from either S&P's or Moody's, the
Company categorizes those investments on ratings assigned by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), whose ratings are as
follows: NAIC Class 1 is considered equivalent to a AAA/Aaa, AA/Aa, or A
rating; NAIC Class 2, BBB/Baa; and NAIC Classes 3-6, BB/Ba and below. Fixed
maturity investments that are not rated by S&P's or Moody's (unrated
private placements), but instead rated with comparable NAIC ratings,
comprise 0.4% of AAA-rated investments, 1.7% of AA-rated, 4.1% of A-rated,
23.2% of BBB-rated, and 50.2% of investments rated BB and lower at December
31, 1993.

The composition of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, based on S&P's
and Moody's ratings at December 31, 1993, was as follows:

The carrying value of the Company's high-yield investments (investments
rated BB and lower) at December 31, 1993 was $94.0 million or 4.0% of the
Company's invested assets compared to $108.3 million or 4.8% of invested
assets at December 31, 1992. The fair value of this portfolio exceeded the
carrying value by $6.2 million at December 31, 1993 and $6.1 million at
December 31, 1992. The decline in the size of the high-yield portfolio in
1993 was primarily due to redemptions and sales, partially offset by
downgrades.

At December 31, 1993, 29.5% of the Company's invested assets were in
mortgage-backed fixed maturity investments, including collateralized
mortgage obligations (CMOs) and mortgage-backed pass-through securities.
Mortgage-backed securities generally are collateralized by mortgages
backed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC), all of which are agencies of the U.S. Government. Only
GNMA mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of
the U.S. Government. Agency mortgage-backed securities are considered to
have a AAA credit rating.

In some instances, the Company invests in non-agency mortgage-backed
securities. At December 31, 1993, 89.1% of the Company's non-agency CMOs
were rated AAA. The credit risk associated with non-agency mortgage-backed
securities is generally greater than that of agency mortgage-backed
securities.

The following details the carrying value and fair value of the Company's
mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 1993:

</TABLE>

Certain mortgage-backed securities are subject to significant prepayment
risk. This is due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates,
mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as individuals
refinance higher-rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. As a
result, holders of mortgage-backed securities may receive large prepayments
on their investments that cannot be reinvested at interest rates comparable
to the rates on the prepaid mortgages.

Planned amortization class (PAC) and target amortization class (TAC)
tranches, which together comprised 12.4% of the Company's invested assets
at December 31, 1993, are designed to amortize in a manner that shifts the
primary risk of prepayment of the underlying collateral to investors in
other tranches of the CMO. The PAC and TAC instruments tend to be less
sensitive to prepayment risk.

Sequential classes, which comprised 1.5% of the Company's invested assets
at December 31, 1993, may have prepayment characteristics similar to
mortgage-backed pass-through securities. Support classes, which comprised
1.0% of the Company's invested assets at December 31, 1993, are the most
sensitive to prepayment risk.

Mortgage Loans and Real Estate
The Company had investments in mortgage loans of $391.7 million at December
31, 1993 compared to $452.0 million at December 31, 1992. Investments in
mortgage loans declined primarily due to prepayments and amortization of
the mortgage loan portfolio. Of the outstanding loans at December 31, 1993,
$3.7 million (net of allowances of $3.9 million), or 0.9%, were delinquent
60 days or more as to interest or principal.

At December 31, 1993, the Company's insurance subsidiaries had a delinquent
mortgage loan ratio (mortgage loans overdue 60 days or in foreclosure,
before allowances, as compared to the total mortgage portfolio before
allowances) of 1.1% compared to 2.2% at December 31, 1992. The industry
average delinquent mortgage loan ratio for residential and commercial
mortgages, as measured by the American Council of Life Insurance, was 4.5%
at December 31, 1993.

The following summarizes the additions and deductions to the Company's
mortgage loan allowance:

</TABLE>
             
The Company actively manages its non-current investments through
restructuring of mortgages and sales and leasing of foreclosed real estate
in order to achieve the highest current return as well as to preserve
capital. Restructured loans, where modifications of the terms of the
mortgage loan have generally occurred and which are considered current
investments, were $16.9 million at December 31, 1993 compared to $18.2
million at December 31, 1992. At December 31, 1993, the Company's mortgage
loan portfolio included $6.9 million of mortgage loans, before allowances,
overdue at least three months and on which no interest income was being
accrued. The Company does not expect the non-current investments to have a
material adverse effect on its liquidity or ability to hold its other
investments to maturity. This is primarily due to the relatively small
amount of these non-current investments as compared to total invested
assets and to the total amount of high quality, liquid investments.

The Company's mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 1993 was diverse with
respect to geographic distribution, principal repayment schedule dates, and
property type as outlined below:

The Company's real estate investments totaled $39.1 million (net of
allowances of $8.6 million) at December 31, 1993 compared to $60.0 million
(net of allowances of $14.2 million) at December 31, 1992. The change was
primarily due to sales of real estate investments. At December 31, 1993,
$14.6 million of real estate investments were acquired through mortgage
loan foreclosure, compared to $20.2 million at year-end 1992.

Current and expected conditions in many real estate markets are depressed,
with high vacancy rates and flat or declining rental rates. Moreover, the
availability of financing is currently restricted as banks, insurance
companies, and other lenders have reduced their exposure to real estate
loans. In such an environment, the number of defaults on mortgage loans
would be expected to remain at higher than historical average levels as
borrowers' cash flows are insufficient to cover expenses. Additionally, the
ability to rent investment real estate at favorable rates diminishes and
properties may become vacant.

Equity Securities
At December 31, 1993, $7.0 million or 0.3% of the Company's invested assets
consisted of common stocks and common stock mutual funds, $3.5 million or
0.2% of invested assets consisted of nonredeemable preferred stocks, and
$5.4 million or 0.2% of invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and
money-market mutual funds. Nonredeemable preferred stocks, common stocks,
and common stock mutual funds are carried on the Company's balance sheet at
fair value. The Company does not anticipate any significant change in the
size of its equity securities portfolio.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows
During 1993, the Company's operating activities generated cash of $104.7
million compared to $93.3 million in 1992. The increase in cash provided by
operations in 1993 primarily resulted from improved insurance operations in
1993 compared to 1992.

Investing activities (principally purchases and sales of investments) used
cash of $130.8 million in 1993 compared to $140.0 million in 1992,
primarily for the purchase of fixed maturity investments in both periods.

Financing activities provided cash of $27.1 million and $49.7 million, in
1993 and 1992, respectively. In 1993, $47.3 million of cash was provided by
the sale of 2.1 million new shares of common stock and $18.1 million was
provided by net receipts from universal life insurance and annuity
policies. Partially offsetting these amounts in 1993 was the payment of
$17.4 million of short-term notes payable, $9.5 million of mortgage and
other notes payable, and $12.2 million of dividends to stockholders. In
1992, $46.0 million of cash was provided by net receipts from universal
life insurance and annuity policies and net proceeds from debt, offset in
part by $11.1 million of dividends to stockholders.

The fair value of the Company's investment portfolio, primarily fixed
maturity investments, is affected by changing interest rates. When interest
rates rise, the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investments
declines. In addition, the value of the Company's policy liabilities
decreases. In periods of declining interest rates, the fair value of the
Company's fixed maturity investments increases, accompanied by an increase
in the value of its policy liabilities. The Company estimates that a one
percentage point increase in market interest rates would result in a
decrease in the fair value of its fixed maturity investments of
approximately 5 percent, and a one percentage point decrease in market
interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of its fixed
maturity investments of approximately 5 percent. In addition, rising
interest rates could result in increased surrenders of life insurance
policies and annuities causing the Company to sell fixed maturity
investments below cost. In order to minimize the need to sell fixed
maturity investments below cost, the Company seeks to maintain sufficient
levels of cash and short-term investments.

The Company held cash and short-term investments of $85.7 million at
December 31, 1993, compared to $60.2 million at December 31, 1992. The
balance of cash and short-term investments plus cash inflow from premium
revenues, investment income, and investment maturities is considered to be
more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

Stock Offering
During the third quarter of 1993, the Company issued 2,133,000 shares of
Common Stock in a secondary stock offering. The sale of the additional
shares resulted in an increase in stockholders' equity of $47.3 million and
a decrease in 1993 primary earnings of 4.3% or $.11 per share. See Note E
for additional information.

Dividends
The Company's primary sources of funds to pay dividends to stockholders are
investments held at the parent and dividends from WNIC. These dividends are
subject to restrictions set forth by the Illinois Insurance Department.
Illinois state regulations limit the amount of cash that can be withdrawn
from WNIC to the greater of the previous year's statutory earnings or 10%
of statutory capital and surplus. See Note E for further information.

UPI is wholly owned by United Presidential Corporation, an insurance
holding company which in turn is 71% owned by WNIC and 29% owned by WNC.
UPI is not considered a source of funds for dividends to stockholders of
the Company. Management expects UPI to pay no dividends in the foreseeable
future in order to conserve capital at that subsidiary.

Health Care Reform
On September 22, 1993, President Clinton provided the outline of the
Administration's proposal for health care reform and delivered to Congress
a more detailed package of the proposal in mid-October. The proposal relies
heavily on a federally guaranteed package of health care benefits and
medical services, primarily through an employer-based program for working
Americans. In addition, the Administration's outline provides for health
care coverage for non-working Americans. The Administration's proposal
could have the following effects on insurers: (i) partially or fully
replace products sold by insurers; (ii) limit the ability of insurers to
charge higher rates to or decline to cover, insureds who present greater
risks; (iii) limit the ability of insurers to exclude coverage for pre-
existing conditions; (iv) mandate the types of insurance benefits to be
provided in certain instances; (v) impose insurance rate regulation or
additional taxes on insurance premiums or benefits; or (vi) increase
competition by expanding employee choice of insurance plans and by
requiring the employee to bear the full cost increment for higher priced
plans.

In addition to the Administration's plan, a number of members of Congress
have proposed alternative health care reform plans. These plans rely, in
some instances, more on market-driven reform rather than on government
mandated reform and several aspects of the Administration's proposal, such
as universal coverage and employer mandates, are being challenged by these
alternative plans.

The Company has monitored and will continue to monitor all aspects of the
developments surrounding this issue and is preparing strategic responses to
its possible outcomes. The Company's health businesses have begun to
diversify into product areas, such as supplemental insurance products and
disability products, that the Company believes are consistent with its
targeted market focus and may be less affected or unaffected by health care
reform. Such products may not be a component of a mandated benefits package
and may be supplementally purchased by consumers. Health care reform at the
federal and state levels may have a material adverse effect on the
Company's operating results and financial position, but it is not possible
at this time to predict the nature and effects of health care reform or how
soon its measures will be adopted and implemented.

During the 1993 fourth quarter, the Company announced that it had combined
its individual health division and employee benefits division at WNIC. The
combination is designed to accelerate the Company's positioning for
strategic business opportunities under health care reform.

A.M. Best Ratings
The ability of an insurance company to compete successfully depends, in
part, on its financial strength, operating performance, and claims-paying
ability as rated by A.M. Best and other rating agencies. The Company's
insurance subsidiaries are each currently rated "A- (Excellent)" by A.M.
Best, based on their 1992 statutory financial results and operating
performance.

A.M. Best's 15 categories of ratings for insurance companies currently
range from "A++ (Superior)" to "F (In Liquidation)." According to A.M.
Best, an "A" or "A-" rating is assigned to companies which, in A.M. Best's
opinion, have achieved excellent overall performance when compared to the
standards of the life insurance industry and generally have demonstrated a
strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long
period of time. In evaluating a company's statutory financial and operating
performance, A.M. Best reviews the company's statutory profitability,
leverage, and liquidity, as well as the company's spread of risk, quality
and appropriateness of its reinsurance program, quality and diversification
of assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves and surplus, capital
structure, and the experience and competency of its management. A.M. Best
ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents, and
intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors.

In June 1993, the Company was advised by A.M. Best that, after review of
the 1992 statutory financial results and operating performance, both WNIC
and UPI were assigned ratings of "A- (Excellent)," an adjustment from their
previous ratings of "A (Excellent)." Many of the Company's competitors have
A.M. Best ratings of "A-" or lower, and the Company believes that its A.M.
Best ratings are adequate to enable its insurance subsidiaries to compete
successfully.

In communicating its most recent rating, A.M. Best advised WNIC that, if
current trends persist, further rating adjustments may be required.  The
Company believes that the trends referred to by A.M. Best are (i) a decline
in WNIC's statutory capital and surplus and (ii) increased net statutory
operating losses on certain health insurance products of WNIC as calculated
using statutory accounting practices. WNIC's statutory operating income in
recent years has been adversely affected by the payment of first year
commissions on new sales of certain health insurance products and
investments in infrastructure improvements. The Company believes that as
renewal business increases as a percentage of total revenues, statutory
operating income for these products will improve. For 1993, statutory net
operating income improved to $19.9 million from $5.8 million in 1992, and
net income improved to $11.0 million from $36 thousand in 1992. Statutory
capital and surplus increased $9.2 million, or 5.1%, to $188.3 million in
1993 versus a decrease of $9.1 million, or 4.8%, in 1992.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that A.M. Best
will maintain the ratings of the Company's insurance subsidiaries at their
present levels. A rating downgrade at either WNIC or UPI could have a
materially adverse effect on the ability of that subsidiary to write and
retain business.

Inflation and Changing Prices
Inflation and changing prices are anticipated by the Company in the pricing
of its insurance products. Significant components of health insurance
benefits are the medical care inflation rate, policyholder utilization of
medical services, and cost-shifting, which is the transfer of medical care
provider expenses that are not covered by governmental plans and HMOs to
private insurers. As a result of relatively stable general and medical care
inflation rates in 1993, WNIC's health insurance pricing assumptions
regarding these factors were essentially unchanged from the prior year. For
the first quarter of 1994, these assumptions have also not changed
materially.

The effect of inflation on operating expenses has not been significant.
However, if inflation increases significantly, operating expenses would be
expected to increase.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A
Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include
the accounts and operations of Washington National Corporation and its
subsidiaries (WNC or the Company). Significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 1992 and 1991 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1993 presentation.

Investments

Fixed Maturities.

Fixed maturity investments are securities that mature more than one year
after issuance. They include bonds, notes, and redeemable preferred stocks.
All fixed maturities are intended to be used by WNC as part of its
asset/liability matching strategy.  Effective March 31, 1993, the Company
reclassified its fixed maturity investments into investments that are "held
for sale" and investments that are "held to maturity." Fixed maturity
investments held to maturity generally are carried at amortized cost, less
write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments. Fixed maturity
investments that are held for sale are those securities that may be sold in
response to unanticipated policy surrenders, policy loan demand, or
infrequent transactions. These fixed maturity investments are carried, on
an aggregate basis, at the lower of amortized cost, less write-downs for
other-than- temporary impairments and an allowance for below-investment
grade securities, or fair value. Unrealized losses in aggregate on fixed
maturity investments held for sale would be recorded in stockholders'
equity, net of applicable deferred income taxes. At December 31, 1993 and
1992, the fair value of all fixed maturity investments exceeded carrying
value by $82,332,000 and $56,894,000, respectively.

Equity Securities.

Equity securities represent investments in mutual funds, nonredeemable
preferred stocks, and common stocks. These securities are carried at fair
value which is determined primarily through published quotes of trading
values. Changes in the valuation allowance necessary to adjust the carrying
amount of the equity securities for temporary changes in fair value are
reported directly in stockholders' equity. Other-than-temporary declines
below cost are recorded as realized losses.

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate.

Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at unpaid principal, less
unearned discount and allowance for possible losses. An allowance for
mortgage loan losses is established based on an evaluation of the mortgage
loan portfolio, past credit loss experience, and current economic
conditions.

Real Estate Investments.

Real estate investments are principally carried at cost, less allowances
for depreciation and possible losses. Foreclosed real estate is considered
held for sale and is recorded at the lower of current carrying value or
fair value, less estimated costs of disposal.


Other Long-term Investments.

Other long-term investments consist principally of venture capital
investments which are carried at cost, less other- than-temporary
impairments.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments include commercial paper, variable demand notes, and
money market funds, and are carried at cost.

Investment Income.

Interest on bonds, loans, and notes is recorded in income as earned. Income
is adjusted for any amortization of premium or discount on these
investments. Any excess cash flows arising from prepayments are booked as
adjustments to the carrying value of the investment. Income on real estate
and other long-term investments is recorded principally on a cash basis.
Dividends are recorded as income on ex-dividend dates.

Realized Gains or Losses.

When an investment is sold, its selling price may be higher or lower than
its carrying value. The difference between the selling price and the
carrying value is recorded as a realized gain or loss, using the specific
identification method. Investments that have declined in fair value below
cost, and for which the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, are
written down to their estimated fair value. Write-downs and allowances for
losses on mortgage loans and below-investment grade bonds are included in
realized investment losses.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about certain
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. The
fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including
the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The derived fair
value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in the immediate
settlement of the instrument. As the fair value of all of WNC's assets and
liabilities is not presented, the aggregate fair value of the amounts
presented does not represent the underlying value of WNC.

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, short-term
investments, short-term borrowings, and accrued investment income
approximate their fair values.

Fair values for fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market
prices, where available. For fixed maturity securities not actively traded,
fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing
services or, in the case of private placements, are estimated by
discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate
applicable to the yield, credit quality, and maturity of the investments.

Fair values for mortgage loans and policy loans are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on interest rates currently being
offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings.

A pricing cap is put on mortgage loans that carry significant above-market
interest rate yields to reflect the illiquid nature of the mortgage loans
and the risk that such loans could be prepaid.

Fair values for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts are
estimated using discounted cash flow calculations, based on interest rates
currently being offered for similar contracts with similar maturities.

The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

Fair values for real estate development guarantees, to the extent
practicable, are based on estimates of fees to guarantee similar
developments. Fair values for lending commitments are based on the
commitment fee of the loans in question.

Depreciation

Provisions for depreciation of real estate investments and home office
properties are computed using primarily the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives. Accumulated depreciation on real estate investments
at December 31, was $24,184,000 in 1993 and $10,834,000 in 1992.
Accumulated depreciation on home office properties at December 31, was
$1,122,000 and $13,495,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively. In 1993, the
Company's previous home office real estate and related accumulated
depreciation were transferred to investment real estate.

Insurance Premiums and Policy Charges

Health insurance premiums are earned pro rata over the terms of the
policies. For traditional life insurance products, premiums are recognized
as revenues when due. Revenues for certain interest-sensitive products
consist of charges earned and assessed against policy account balances
during the period for the cost of insurance, policy initiation fees, policy
administration expenses, and surrenders.

Policy Liabilities

Liabilities for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance
products are determined using the present value of future net premiums,
benefits and expenses, and the net level valuation method, based on
estimates of future investment yield, mortality, and withdrawal rates,
adjusted to provide for possible adverse deviation. Interest rate
assumptions are graded and range from 4.5% to 7.5%. Withdrawal assumptions
are based principally on experience and vary by issue age, type of
coverage, and duration.

Liabilities for future policy benefits of certain interest-sensitive
products represent policy account balances before applicable surrender
charges plus certain deferred policy initiation fees that are recognized as
income over the term of the policies and a provision for the return of cost
of insurance charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to
expense include interest credited to policy account balances, benefit
claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances,
and a provision for the return of cost of insurance charges. Credited
interest rates for these products ranged from 3.0% to 7.5% at December 31,
1993.

The liabilities for policy and contract claims are determined using case-
basis evaluations and statistical analyses. These liabilities represent
estimates of the ultimate expected cost of incurred claims and the related
claim adjustment expenses. Any required revisions in these estimates are
included in operations in the period when such adjustments become
determinable.

The carrying amounts, net of deferred insurance costs, for investment-type
insurance contracts, principally included with future policy benefits of
annuities were $1,226,238,000 and $1,197,340,000, at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively. The estimated fair values at December 31, 1993 and 1992
were $1,224,550,000 and $1,176,435,000, respectively.

The fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into
consideration in WNC's overall management of interest rate risk, which
minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of
investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

Deferred Insurance Costs

Costs directly associated with the acquisition of new business are deferred
and amortized. For traditional life insurance and health insurance
products, costs are amortized over the premium-paying period of the
products based on assumptions that are used in calculating policy benefit
reserves. For certain interest-sensitive products, costs are generally
amortized over the estimated lives of the products in relation to the
present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges and
investment, mortality, and expense margins.

The unamortized cost of purchased insurance in force is included in
deferred insurance costs. Amortization is in relation to the present value
of estimated gross profits over the estimated remaining life of the related
insurance in force of 23 years, with interest rates ranging from 7.5% to
8.5%.


The following summarizes the changes in the unamortized cost of purchased
insurance in force for the years ended December 31:

The estimated percentage of the December 31, 1993 balance to be amortized
over the next five years is as follows:

     1994    13.9%

     1997    11.4%
     1998    10.1%
</TABLE>
           

Goodwill

The cost of purchased businesses in excess of net assets is reported as
goodwill and amortized on a straight-line basis, generally over thirty-six
years. Goodwill is evaluated based on the prospect for continued growth and
the long-term nature of the insurance policies sold. The asset value is
considered appropriate. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $6,023,000
and $5,204,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Separate Account

Separate Account assets and liabilities are principally carried at fair
value and represent funds that are separately administered for annuity
contracts and for which the contract holders bear the investment risk.
Investment income and realized gains and losses allocable to Separate
Accounts generally accrue to the contract holders and are excluded from the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income Taxes

In 1992, WNC adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." The accounting policies of WNC result in deferred taxes being
provided for significant temporary differences between financial statement
and tax return bases, using the asset and liability method. These
differences result primarily from policy reserves, insurance acquisition
costs, and reserves for postretirement benefits. WNC and its subsidiaries
file a consolidated life/nonlife federal income tax return.

Reinsurance

The insurance subsidiaries of WNC reinsure a portion of their life,
annuity, and health risks with other insurance companies to minimize their
exposure to loss. In particular, for the life insurance and annuity
business, the Company's policy is to retain a maximum of $300,000 of life
insurance exposure on any one individual ($400,000 with accidental death).
For the group products business, the Company limits its paid-claim exposure
in any one calendar year to $750,000 per claim for major medical coverage
and $250,000 per claim for individual stop-loss. The Company retains a
maximum of 50% of each employee benefits long-term disability claim, and
limits its group term life exposure to $200,000 per life ($400,000 with
accidental death). The Company's reinsurance for individual health claims
is designed to protect the Company from an excessive amount of claims in
excess of $250,000 on an individual claim basis.

Substantially all of the reinsurance ceded by the Company is to entities
rated "A" or better by A. M. Best, or to entities required to maintain assets
in an independent trust fund whose fair value is sufficient to discharge
the obligations of the reinsurer. To the extent that any reinsurance
company is unable to meet its obligations under the agreements, WNC's
insurance subsidiaries would remain liable.

Amounts paid or deemed to have been paid for ceded reinsurance contracts
are recorded as reinsurance recoverables. The cost of reinsurance related
to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying
reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account
for the underlying policies.

Substantially all of the reinsurance assumed by the Company as of December
31, 1993 is on a 100% coinsurance basis and is accounted for in a manner
similar to the direct business.

New Accounting Standards

In 1992, the FASB issued SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," which WNC adopted effective January 1, 1993. This standard
requires employers to recognize the costs and obligations of all types of
postemployment benefits provided to former or inactive employees, their
beneficiaries, and covered dependents. Under the standard, vested benefits
are to be accrued over the relevant service period rather than expensed as
they are paid, as was the practice. For postemployment benefits that do not
vest or accumulate, employers are to accrue a liability and recognize the
expected cost when it is probable that a benefit obligation has been
incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. The adoption resulted in a
one-time cumulative adjustment of $1,550,000, net of taxes of $834,000,
relating to benefits previously recorded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The
adoption of SFAS 112 did not have a material effect on 1993 pretax income
and is not expected to have a material impact on future years' earnings.

Effective January 1, 1993, WNC adopted SFAS 113, "Accounting and Reporting
for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts." The
statement requires that reinsurance recoverables, including amounts related
to claims incurred but not reported and prepaid reinsurance premiums, be
reported as assets instead of net of the related liabilities. The adoption
resulted in an increase in total assets and liabilities of $58,173,000 and
$60,266,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The adoption had
no impact on net income or stockholders' equity.

In June 1993, the FASB issued two new accounting standards. SFAS 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," must be adopted by the
Company by January 1, 1995. The standard will require the Company to
measure an impaired loan at (i) the present value of expected future cash
flows, discounting those cash flows at the loan's effective interest rate,
(ii) the fair value of the collateral of an impaired collateral dependent
loan, or (iii) an observable market price. The impairment is recognized by
a valuation allowance which may be subsequently increased or decreased
based on changes in the measurement criteria. The Company is in the process
of determining the effect the new standard will have on net income and
stockholders' equity but does not expect the effect to be material.

The second standard, SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities," which the Company must adopt prospectively effective
January 1, 1994, requires the Company to segregate its fixed maturity
portfolio into three separate classifications on the balance sheet:
investments held to maturity, trading securities, and investments available
for sale. Investments held to maturity will include only those fixed
maturities that the Company has a positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity. These securities will be carried at amortized cost less write-
downs for other-than-temporary impairments. Trading securities will consist
of those fixed maturity and equity securities held for short periods of
time and will be carried on the balance sheet at fair value, with any
change in value reported as a component of income. Investments available
for sale will consist of those securities that do not meet the criteria of
investments held to maturity or trading securities and will be carried on
the balance sheet at fair value, with any change in value recognized as an
unrealized gain or loss in stockholders' equity. If a decrease in value of
fixed maturity investments is other than temporary, the loss is recognized
immediately as a realized loss. In addition, stockholders' equity will be
reduced by the estimated amortization of deferred insurance costs that the
realization of the unrealized gains would produce. The adoption of this
standard at January 1, 1994 will result in an increase in stockholders'
equity of approximately $43,000,000. This is the result of changing the
carrying value of the current held for sale fixed maturities to fair value,
a reduction in deferred insurance costs of $19,000,000, and a related
increase in deferred taxes of $14,000,000. There will not be an income
statement effect for adoption as the Company does not have a trading
portfolio.

The Company foresees that this standard will result in added volatility to
stockholders' equity as the standard does not permit a corresponding
adjustment to the liabilities that these assets support.

$88,953,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. At December 31, 1993,
gross unrealized gains (losses) on investments in equity securities
amounted to $386,000 and $(429,000), respectively.

Other

During 1993, 1992, and 1991, non-cash investing activities consisted of
real estate acquired through foreclosure of mortgage loans which totaled
$4,869,000, $14,302,000, and $3,829,000, respectively.

The fair value of investments in mortgage loans was estimated to be
$411,250,000 and $471,082,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The fair value of policy loans was estimated to be $50,340,000 and
$48,246,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Borrowings and Other Credit Arrangements

Borrowings

Borrowings of $2,434,000 at December 31, 1993 consist of a mortgage on
investment real estate with an interest rate of 6.5% that matures in March
1998. Payments of $526,000, $562,000, $599,000, $613,000 and $134,000 will
be required in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively. The property
is pledged as collateral.

Interest paid on borrowings by WNC was $1,673,000, $1,313,000, and
$2,130,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

The fair value of WNC's mortgage and long-term notes payable at December
31, 1993 and 1992 was estimated to be $2,438,000 and $14,107,000,
respectively.

Credit Arrangements

WNC has a line of credit arrangement for short-term borrowings with one
bank amounting to $10,000,000, all of which was unused at December 31,
1993. The line of credit arrangement can be renewed annually, but credit
can be withdrawn at the bank's option.

In addition, WNC has three letters of credit available from one bank
totaling $1,892,000 with varying terms and conditions. As of December 31,
1993, the entire amount was unused.

Note D

Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1992, WNC adopted SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Amounts prior to 1992 are presented under the previous accounting
rules.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 changed WNC's prevailing
federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% effective January 1, 1993. The
application of the 35% tax rate to the December 31, 1992 deferred income
tax liability balance resulted in a $38,000 increase in federal income tax
expense for 1993.

Components of WNC's deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 are
as follows:

</TABLE>

The net deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to the future taxable
temporary differences for deferred insurance costs. The net deferred tax
assets relate primarily to the future deductible temporary differences for
policy liabilities and liabilities for employee benefits items. The nature
of WNC's deferred tax assets and liabilities is such that the general
reversal pattern for these temporary differences should result in a full
realization of WNC's deferred tax assets other than capital gain or loss
items.

The components of the provision for deferred income taxes for the year
ended December 31, 1991 are as follows:

At December 31, 1993, WNC had capital loss carryforwards for tax return
purposes of $7,404,000 that expire in 1996. For financial reporting
purposes, a valuation allowance of $14,903,000 has been recognized to
offset the deferred tax assets related to those carryforwards, investment
loss reserves, and other capital loss related deferred tax assets not
expected to be realized. The valuation allowance was reduced by $3,272,000
and $500,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31 are as
follows:

At December 31, 1993, up to $19,851,000 (at a 35% tax rate) would be
required for possible federal income taxes that might become due in future
years, in whole or in part, if any portion of $56,717,000 of the insurance
companies' gains from operations which accumulated under pre-1984 income
tax laws, presently included in earned untaxed surplus and identified as
tax "Policyholders' Surplus," becomes includable in taxable income. Also,
distribution of amounts in excess of taxable "Shareholders' Surplus"
($221,591,000 at December 31, 1993) by the insurance companies under
certain conditions may require payment of additional federal income taxes.
However, WNC does not  expect or intend that these taxable events will
occur and, as such, the related deferred income taxes are not required to
be provided.

Federal income taxes paid by WNC were $4,100,000, $8,700,000, and
$5,300,000 in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. WNC has a nonlife net
operating loss carryforward for tax purposes of $2,222,000 that will begin
to expire in 2005.

Stockholders' Equity

Convertible Preferred Stock

WNC has 10,000,000 shares of $5 par value Preferred Stock authorized that
is designated as $2.50 Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share is entitled
to a cumulative annual dividend of $2.50, and a preference of $50 in the
event of involuntary liquidation and $55 in the event of voluntary
liquidation of WNC. Further, each share is convertible at any time into
1.875 shares of Common Stock at the option of the holder and is redeemable
at $55 at the option of WNC. Each holder is entitled to one vote for each
share held and, except as otherwise provided by law, the $2.50 Convertible
Preferred Stock and the Common Stock vote together as one class.

Stock Purchase Rights

WNC has one outstanding Common Stock Purchase Right for each outstanding
share of Common Stock. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person
or group acquires 20% or more of WNC's Common Stock or announces a tender
offer following which it would hold 30% or more of such Common Stock. If
the Rights become exercisable, a holder will be entitled to buy from WNC
one share of WNC Common Stock at a price of $100 per share. If, after the
Rights become exercisable, WNC is acquired in a merger or other business
combination or more than 50% of WNC's assets or earning power are sold,
each Right will entitle its holder to buy that number of shares of Common
Stock of the acquiring company having a market value of twice the exercise
price of the Right. Alternatively, if a 20% WNC stockholder acquires WNC by
means of a merger in which WNC and its Common Stock survive or that
stockholder engages in self-dealing transactions with WNC, each Right not
owned by the 20% holder would become exercisable for that number of shares
of WNC Common Stock which have a market value of twice the exercise price
of the Right. Until the Rights become exercisable, one additional Right
will be distributed with each share of WNC Common Stock issued in the
future. The Rights will expire in January 1997. The Rights may be redeemed
by WNC at $.01 per Right prior to the time that 20% or more of WNC's Common
Stock has been accumulated by a person or group or within ten days
thereafter under certain circumstances.

Common Stock

WNC has 60,000,000 authorized shares of $5 par value Common Stock including
treasury shares. In the third quarter of 1993, the Company completed a
public offering of 2,133,000 newly issued shares for $23.75 per share.
Capital contributions of $14,000,000 were made to a subsidiary out of the
net proceeds. In addition, short-term indebtedness was reduced $11,000,000.
The remainder is being used for other general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 1993, 13,768,000 shares of WNC's Common Stock were reserved
for future issuance. Of this amount 12,118,000 shares were reserved for
future exercises of Purchase Rights, 271,000 shares were reserved for
conversion of outstanding Convertible Preferred Stock, 1,344,000 shares
were reserved for exercise of options to purchase Common Stock and for use
in connection with the restricted stock grants, and 35,000 shares were
reserved for issuance of Common Stock in connection with the dividend
reinvestment plan. The annual dividend paid on WNC Common Stock in 1993,
1992, and 1991 was $1.08 per share.

The number of shares used in computing primary earnings per share for 1993,
1992, and 1991 was 10,755,000, 9,989,000, and 9,980,000, respectively.
These consisted of average shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive
stock options totalling 112,000 shares in 1993 and 97,000 shares in 1992. No
effect was given to stock options in 1991 because the effect would have
decreased the loss per share.

The number of shares used in computing fully diluted earnings per share for
1993 was 11,026,000. This included average shares outstanding plus 383,000
shares of common stock equivalents consisting of dilutive stock options and
the assumed conversion of preferred stock.

Primary and fully diluted earnings per share were the same for 1992 and
1991 because the computation of fully diluted earnings per share resulted
in a smaller loss per share.

Retained earnings at December 31, 1993 includes $125,000,000 in excess of
the statutory unassigned surplus of the insurance subsidiaries.

Defined Benefit and Contribution Plans

Retirement Plans

Washington National Insurance Company (WNIC) and an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary, United Presidential Life Insurance Company (UPI), each have a
defined benefit retirement plan covering substantially all employees who
have met the prescribed requirements for participation. Both plans have
been amended to terminate the accrual of future benefits. Benefits are
based principally on years of service and compensation. Generally, the
funding policies are to contribute annually amounts required by the
Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Contributions are intended to provide benefits
attributed to service to date.

Effective January 1, 1991 for WNIC, and March 31, 1993 for UPI, the Company
established two defined contribution retirement plans, a money-purchase
retirement plan and a discretionary profit sharing plan. Neither plan
allows employee contributions. These two plans, in addition to the
contributory 401(k) plan, collectively represent the current retirement
benefit program. The plans now cover substantially all WNIC and UPI
employees who have met the prescribed requirements for participation. The
contribution to the 401(k) plan matches employee contributions dollar for
dollar up to a maximum of 3% of compensation. The contribution to the money-
purchase retirement plan is 3% of each employee's compensation and an
additional 3% of compensation in excess of the Social Security wage base.
The contribution to the profit sharing plan is at the discretion of the
insurance subsidiaries' Boards of Directors in consultation with the Board
of Directors of WNC and is based on financial performance. WNC also has
supplemental retirement plans under which benefits are paid equal to any
amount by which benefits are reduced for any participant in the defined
contribution or defined benefit retirement plans due to provisions of the
IRC. The liabilities for the supplemental retirement plans at December 31,
1993 and 1992 were immaterial. The net pension expense for the defined
contribution plans in 1993, 1992, and 1991 was $2,777,000, $2,110,000, and
$1,866,000, respectively.

A summary of the components of the net periodic pension expense for the
defined benefit retirement plans follows:

</TABLE>
         
The unrecognized transition gain in the preceeding schedule is the amount
by which the plans' net assets exceeded the actuarial present value of
projected benefit obligations as of January 1, 1985, net of amortization,
the date on which current pension accounting standards were adopted. The
transition gain is being amortized by credits to income over a fourteen-
year period. In addition, the excess of actual investment and actuarial
gains and losses realized over those expected are deferred and, when the
cumulative deferred amounts exceed certain limits, will be amortized at a
rate consistent with a fourteen-year amortization period. Costs created by
plan amendments that are associated with prior employee service are also
deferred and amortized over fourteen years.

Accrued pension cost and the various net gains and losses not recognized in
the consolidated financial statements are compared annually to the plans'
funded status. The comparison is made using the plans' accumulated benefit
obligations. When a deficiency exists, an adjustment is made for the amount
of the deficiency to recognize a minimum liability. At December 31, 1993
and 1992, the pretax  adjustment was $3,033,000 and $1,269,000,
respectively. The liability and subsequent changes had no effect on net
periodic pension expense and were reported directly in stockholders'
equity.

In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the discount rate used was
6.7% and 6.9%, respectively. The rate of increase in compensation levels
used in 1992 was 5% for the UPI plan. The expected rate of return on plan
assets was 7.5% for 1993, 1992, and 1991.

Assets of the defined benefit plans are invested principally in mutual
funds, bonds, and stocks. Assets of the WNIC retirement plan include Common
and Preferred Stock of WNC of $10,863,000 and $10,332,000, at fair value,
at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Dividends of $492,000 were
received on the WNC Common and Preferred Stock in 1993 and 1992. No shares
were purchased or sold during 1993.

Postretirement Benefits

In addition to WNC's various retirement programs, WNIC provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees.
Employees generally have become eligible for these benefits after reaching
age 55 with 20 years of service or after reaching age 65 with 10 years of
service. Generally, the health plans pay a stated percentage of most
medical expenses reduced for deductibles and any payments made by
government programs or other group coverage. Retirees contribute to the
plan according to a schedule which averages 16% of the benefits paid.
Effective January 1, 1992, WNC adopted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Prior to December 1993, these
benefits were unfunded. In December 1993, the Company contributed
$1,100,000 to a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust.
The amount funded to the VEBA trust was based on the difference between the
net periodic postretirement benefit expense and the retiree medical claims
incurred during the period, subject to certain IRC limitations. Assets of
the VEBA trust were invested in short-term variable demand notes at
December 31, 1993.

Effective December 31, 1992, the WNIC plan was changed to limit future
eligibility. Active employees who were not at least age 50 as of December
31, 1992 and whose combination of age and years of service did not total at
least 65 as of that date are not eligible for postretirement health
insurance benefits and are only eligible for $10,000 of postretirement life
insurance benefits. This curtailment resulted in a gain of $4,033,000
recorded as part of operations in the fourth quarter of 1992.

The net periodic postretirement benefit expense includes the following
components at December 31:

obligation with amounts recognized in WNC's consolidated balance sheets at
December 31:

</TABLE>

The health care cost trend rate used in 1993 and 1992 was 15% grading to 6%
evenly over thirty years. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. Increasing the trend rate by 1%
per year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
by $2,825,000 at December 31, 1993 and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit expense
for 1993 by $200,000.

Reinsurance

The effect of reinsurance on premiums and policy charges for the years
ended December 31 was as follows:

Reinsurance ceded              (62,817)    (62,174)    (61,860)
Premiums and policy charges   $438,822    $380,970    $386,815

</TABLE>          

Reinsurance benefits ceded were $22,685,000, $22,516,000, and $17,372,000
in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

As a result of past divestitures, the Company reinsures 100% of certain
blocks of supplemental health insurance, life insurance, and annuity
business with unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 1993, approximately
50% of WNC's total reinsurance recoverables were ceded to Combined Life
Insurance Company of America and approximately 19% was ceded each to
American Founders Life Insurance Company and UNUM Life Insurance Company.
Of these three, two are related to divestitures. Also at December 31, 1993,
89% of reinsurance premiums assumed were from Harvest Life Insurance
Company. The reinsurance agreement provides that the Company will reinsure
a block of individual major medical business issued by Harvest Life on a
100% coinsurance basis.

The Company also uses yearly renewable term reinsurance at UPI to maintain
statutory profitability and other financial requirements at UPI while
sustaining growth. At December 31, 1993, such reinsurance, net of related
taxes had contributed $9,300,000 of statutory capital to UPI. These
transactions do not materially impact the Company's GAAP financial
statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

WNC has noncancelable operating leases primarily for office space and
office equipment, the most significant of which relates to a twenty-year
lease of WNIC's home office building with a related party as lessor. Future
minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31,
1993 are as follows:

<TABLE>
(000s omitted)

<S>                                <C>
1994                                 $7,668
1995                                  7,096
1996                                  6,733
1997                                  6,453
1998                                  4,575
Thereafter                           49,462
Total minimum lease commitments     $81,987

</TABLE>
            

Rental expenses were $6,900,000, $2,871,000, and $3,039,000 in 1993, 1992,
and 1991, respectively.

Financial Commitments and Guarantees

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
in the normal course of business. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit, commitments to fund investments, standby
purchase commitments, and financial guarantees related to various
investments in real estate and joint ventures. These instruments involve,
to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.

The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other
party to the financial instrument for the aforementioned commitments and
guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.
The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and
conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. If
funded, the commitments and guarantees would be collateralized by the
related real estate investments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to an entity as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. An entity's credit worthiness is
evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the amount of collateral obtained
upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the
counterparty. Collateral held would include the related real estate
investment properties. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, commitments to extend
credit were $6,425,000 and $11,049,000, respectively. These commitments
principally expire by July 1994.

Commitments to fund investments primarily for venture capital and fixed
maturity investments amounted to $358,000 and $14,398,000 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. These commitments are on call and do not have
a formal expiration date.

Standby purchase commitments and financial guarantees are conditional
commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of an
unrelated entity to a third party. These purchase commitments and
guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing
arrangements, including bond financing and letters of credit, and expire in
1994, 1995, and 1996. The Company does not hold collateral for these
conditional commitments; however, in the event of nonperformance by the
entity, the Company would be entitled to the underlying collateral,
principally commercial real estate properties. In addition, the Company is
entitled to share in the appreciation of the collateral on the conditional
commitments at the time of sale or refinancing. Management is not aware of
any material losses on these conditional commitments. At December 31, 1993
and 1992, standby purchase commitments and guarantees were $24,323,000 and
$34,126,000, respectively.

The Company issued financial guarantees on two real estate investments and
received $676,000 of consideration, principally in 1986. The estimated fair
value at December 31, 1993 of these guarantees is less than $500,000.

The Company also entered into financial guarantees that are integral and
inseparable components of real estate and mortgage loan transactions. No
consideration was received for these guarantees which relate primarily to
the guarantee of debt repayment on three joint venture real estate
investments. Accordingly, the fair value of these financial guarantees is
zero.

Litigation

WNC and certain affiliated companies have been named in various pending
legal proceedings considered to be ordinary routine litigation incidental
to the business of such companies. A number of other legal actions have
been filed against the Company that demand compensatory and punitive
damages aggregating material dollar amounts. Management believes that such
suits are substantially without merit and that valid defenses exist and are
of the opinion that such litigation will not have a material effect on
WNC's consolidated financial position.

Health Care Reform

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition
And Results Of Operations - Health Care Reform" for a discussion of health 
care reform and its possible effect on the Company's business.

State Guaranty Funds

Under insolvency or guaranty laws in most states in which the Company's
insurance subsidiaries operate, insurers can be assessed for policyholder
losses incurred by insolvent insurance companies. At present, most
insolvency or guaranty laws provide for assessments based on the amount of
insurance underwritten in a given jurisdiction. The Company's insurance
subsidiaries paid $2,500,000, $1,800,000, and $2,000,000 in state guaranty
fund assessments in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively and had accrued
liabilities of $2,800,000 for future assessments at December 31, 1993 and
1992. Mandatory assessments can be partially recovered through a reduction
in future premium taxes in some states.

The Company's accounting policy with regard to payments to state guaranty
funds is to treat as a deferred asset any such payments in those states
where current law allows an offset against future premium taxes. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, other assets included $5,100,000 and $4,000,000
of deferred payments to state guaranty funds. Generally, this amount will
be used to offset future premium tax payments over periods from five to ten
years. In the event of a change in the law pertaining to prior tax offsets,
such amounts might become unrecoverable.

Note J

Divestitures

In the third quarter of 1991, WNC completed the sale of its New York-based
life insurance subsidiary. A pretax loss of $16,000,000 was recorded on
this sale in 1990. An additional pretax loss of $1,826,000 was recognized
in the second quarter of 1991. At June 30, 1991, this subsidiary had
assets, principally investments, of $200,000,000 and liabilities,
principally policy liabilities, of $176,000,000. In the consolidated
statement of operations for 1991, total revenues of $12,200,000 are
attributable to this subsidiary.

In the second and third quarters of 1991, WNIC sold blocks of universal
life insurance and annuities for a pretax gain of $668,000. The gain is
included in net loss on divestitures. The operations of these blocks of
business are included in the life insurance and annuities segment. These
blocks of business had policy-related assets, principally deferred
insurance costs, of $13,000,000 and policy liabilities of $110,000,000.

Note K

Segment Information

WNC has four business segments: life insurance and annuities; group
products; individual health insurance; and corporate and other. The
segments are based on WNC's insurance products. The corporate and other
segment includes realized investment gains and losses, a curtailment gain
in 1992 of $4,033,000 resulting from a change to WNIC's postretirement
health benefits program, operations that do not specifically support one of
the other segments, and the operations and the net loss on divestitures in
1991. See Note J for further information on divestitures. Assets not
individually identifiable by segment are allocated based on the amount of
segment liabilities. Depreciation expense and capital expenditures are not
considered material. Revenues, income or loss before income taxes and
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and assets by
segment for the years ended and as of December 31 are as follows:

* The average amount outstanding during the period was computed by dividing the total of
  month-end outstanding principal balances by 12.

**The weighted average interest rate during the period was computed by dividing the actual
   interest expense by average short-term borrowings outstanding.

Notes payable to banks are comprised of borrowings under line of credit borrowing arrangements,
(1992 and 1991 only), collateral loans due within one year, and the current portion of a
mortgage payable. The line of credit arrangements generally have no termination date but credit
can be withdrawn at the banks' option.

We consent to the incorporation by reference in this Annual Report (Form 
10-K) of Washington National Corporation of our report dated February 9, 
1994, included in the 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders of Washington 
National Corporation.

Our audit also included the financial statement schedules of Washington
National Corporation listed in Item 14(a). These schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, the financial
statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note A, in
1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for postemployment
benefits, and as discussed in Notes D and G, in 1992, the Company changed
its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement benefits other
than pensions.

We also consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statements pertaining to the stock benefit plan (Form S-8 Numbers 33-28858,
33-10179, and 2-83640) and automatic dividend reinvestment and stock
purchase plan (Form S-3 Number 2-72599) of Washington National Corporation
and the related Prospectuses of our report dated February 9, 1994, with
respect to the financial statements incorporated herein by reference, and
our report included in the preceding paragraph with respect to the
financial statement schedules included in this Annual Report (Form 10-K) of
Washington National Corporation.
