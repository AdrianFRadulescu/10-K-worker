Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

(a) General Development of Business
    -------------------------------

H.D. Vest, Inc. (the "Company"), founded by Herb D. Vest, was formed on December
17, 1986, as a Texas corporation.  The Company is a financial services company,
organized for the purpose of investing in financial service companies and
providing management services to such companies as well as other entities.  The
Company also conducts operations under the corporate assumed name of H.D. Vest
Financial Services.  Effective February 15, 1987, the Company issued four shares
of its Common Stock in exchange for each of the then outstanding shares of H.D.
Vest Investment Securities, Inc. ("HDVIS"), a Texas corporation formed in 1983.
The Company also owns all the outstanding shares of H.D. Vest Business Valuation
Services, Inc. ("HDVBVS"), H.D. Vest Collateral Management Company ("HDVCMC"),
H.D. Vest Advisory Services, Inc. ("HDVAS"), H.D. Vest Corporate Finance, Inc.
("HDVCF") and H.D. Vest Mortgage Services, Inc. ("HDVMS").  The Company has
Facilities and Service Agreements with all of its subsidiaries and H.D. Vest
Insurance Services ("HDVIns"), a sole proprietorship owned by Herb D. Vest,
Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder.

The Company's primary asset is its investment in HDVIS.  HDVIS is a securities
broker-dealer, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and securities regulatory commissions in all fifty (50) states, the District of
Columbia and the Puerto Rico territory.  HDVIS is a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD"), Securities Investors Protection
Corporation ("SIPC") and the Securities Industry Association ("SIA").  HDVIS had
approximately 4,485 fully licensed Representatives and approximately 928 at
various stages of the licensing process as of September 30, 1995.  The
Representatives are primarily tax professionals located throughout the United
States who provide their clients with a wide range of financial services
consisting of such investments as mutual funds, unit investment trusts, limited
partnership interests, stocks and bonds. The Company utilizes the Representative
base of HDVIS to market other services provided by the Company through its
subsidiaries and an affiliated entity, which include insurance, business
valuation services, financial planning, investment planning, and other services.

In May 1987, the Company completed a private placement of 39,500 shares (79,000
after adjusting for a two-for-one stock split in July 1987) pursuant to
Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.

Under a public stock offering that closed July 15, 1988, the Company issued
214,787 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
The proceeds were used primarily to retire short-term obligations of the
Company.

In September 1991, the Company issued 166,667 shares of non-voting Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $6.00 in exchange for $1,000,002 in
principal amount on a note payable to a financial services company.  The Company
issued an additional 83,400 shares of non-voting Series A Preferred Stock at a
price of $6.00 in exchange for $500,400 in cash to a second financial services
company.  The preferred stock pays a dividend at an annual rate of 8.5 percent
and is payable quarterly.  The Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable by the
Company upon certain conditions as discussed in the Second Amendment to the
Articles of Incorporation.

On November 21, 1991, the Company completed a stock offering consisting of
700,000 units at a price per unit of $5.50.  Each unit contained one share of
common stock and one A warrant and one B warrant.  In April 1992, 25,000 of the
A warrants were exercised by investors resulting in additional capital of
$151,250.  The remaining A warrants and B warrants expired unexercised in May
1993 and November 1994, respectively.

In connection with the offering discussed above, the Company sold 70,000
warrants (net of now expired A and B warrants) to the Underwriter for $100.  The
exercise price for the warrants is $6.60 per share and the warrants will be
exercisable at any time during the four-year period commencing October 4, 1992.
The warrants contain certain demand and piggyback registration rights as
defined.  The warrants are protected against dilution upon the occurrence of
certain events.  The warrants issued to the Underwriter may not be transferred
or assigned except to officers or shareholders of the Underwriter.  These
warrants were registered pursuant to the Underwriter's agreement in amendment
number two to Form S-1 filed in May, 1995.

Regional Support System

The Company has developed a local support system designed to provide
Representatives assistance in all aspects of financial planning including sales
and marketing training, time management, practice management, financial
products, and case studies.  The Regional Support System (RSS) also provides a
network for Representatives to consult with each other and analyze actual client
situations.  This system operates on the philosophy that the Representatives
will learn from other Representatives who have successfully added financial
planning services to their practice.

Each RSS group is led by a successful H.D. Vest Representative. This
Representative has met specific criteria and attended extensive training before
assuming this important role in the training of fellow H.D. Vest
Representatives.  The Regional Support System is made up of Foundations,
Chapters and Summit teams.

   Foundations -  Foundations teams are designed for Representatives who are
   willing to commit to a 12 month individualized intensive training program.
   The Foundation teams were created for those Representatives who want to
   integrate financial planning into their practice with the goal and commitment
   of achieving $25,000 in their 12-month rolling gross revenues.  Foundation
   teams are made up of 10-15 participants and have monthly meetings.
   Individual training is offered based on needs.

   Chapters - All Representatives whose 12-month rolling gross revenues are
   under $25,000, who are not a Foundation participant, are eligible to attend
   Chapter workshops in their area.  Chapters provide local H.D. Vest
   Representatives six monthly standardized workshop programs between the months
   of June and December.  Each Chapter is made up of approximately thirty
   Representatives.

   Summit - All Representatives with 12-month rolling gross revenues greater
   than $25,000 are members of a Summit team. Monthly Summit meetings give
   Representatives the opportunity to network and share ideas with each other.
   In addition, all Summit members will have the opportunity to attend regional
   conferences designed specifically for the more advanced technical needs of
   higher producing Representatives.

                                       7

Educational Services

The Company's educational staff develops educational programs and seminars to
enhance the technical skills and knowledge necessary for each successful
Representative.  Self-study courses, marketing materials, newsletters,
promotional pieces, and software are a few of the tools used to train and
educate the Company's Representatives and their clients.


Representative Recruiting

The Company recruits Representatives for its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDVIS and
HDVAS.  Since its inception, the Company has developed a recruiting process
which the Company believes results in a larger network for distribution of
financial products.  Based on its experience in this area, the Company plans to
use the methods that have been proven to be the most effective in the past in
order to gain market share.  These methods include the following:

1.   Direct Mail.  The Company has developed a database with over 300,000 tax
     and accounting professionals.  Specially designed marketing letters are
     more successful from each mailing when strategically and consistently used.
     Each respondent receives an H.D. Vest information package ("Opportunity
     Package"), follow-up calls, and invitations to recruiting seminars and H.D.
     Vest conferences.

2.   Recruiting Seminars.  The Company holds seminars (qualified for CPE)
     designed to promote the benefits of adding financial planning services to
     the tax professional's practice.  These seminars also teach the tax
     professional how to select a financial services support firm.

3.   Telemarketing.  Once contact has been made with an interested professional
     via the Company's direct mail efforts, the recruiting staff follows up by
     phone.  The recruiting staff has been very effective in its follow up
     efforts utilizing its proprietary follow up system.

4.   Trade Shows.  The Company regularly exhibits at numerous national seminars
     and training events held for tax professionals.

5.   Referral Incentive Programs.  The Company offers its current
     Representatives, who refer their colleagues to the Company, override
     compensation for their efforts in this area.

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
6.   Trade Publication Advertising.  The Company periodically places
     advertisements to industry publications and other publications read by tax
     professionals.

7.   Educational Events.  Accounting and tax professionals are continually
     invited to attend the Company's comprehensive financial planning seminars.
     Participants receive continuing education credit, which provides the tax
     professional additional incentive to attend.

8.   Regional Offices.  The Company intends to open local support offices on a
     regional basis as the size of the Representative base and the number of
     Regional Support System Representatives increases.  To date the
     effectiveness of local support offices has not been proven.


Representative Development

The Representative Development process is the cornerstone of the Company's
concept of providing the client with the most qualified professional available.
The Company has made a significant investment in the development of programs to
ensure that new recruits and veteran Representatives of the Company are provided
with a high level of training to keep them apprised of financial opportunities
for their clients.

The Company requires its Representatives to obtain specific licenses, complete
training programs, and follow prescribed procedures in adding financial planning
and implementation services to their practice.

The Company offers the following training and marketing support to assist its
Representatives:

1.   Software Support.  The Company provides its Representatives with computer
     software programs to assist them in the financial planning and
     implementation process.  These currently include an asset allocation
     program based on the Company's study of how asset classes historically
     perform under varying economic scenarios and a tax analysis program which
     recommends specific areas that need review based on the client's Internal
     Revenue Service Form 1040.  Each program is designed to help the
     Representative with the implementation of financial planning products.

2.   Educational Events.   The Educational Services Division of the Company
     continually improves and develops new training and educational materials to
     keep up with the industry and to meet the needs of its Representatives.
     The educational events developed by the Company are as follows:

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
     RSS meetings - During the educational season (from June through December),
     ------------
     monthly, hands-on training sessions are held in major metropolitan cities.
     These meetings provide Representatives with training in technical issues,
     products, and sales ideas. A total of 600 RSS group meetings were held in
     110 cities throughout the United States in fiscal 1995, with 1,100 RSS
     group meetings planned for fiscal 1996.

     Summit meetings - Held regionally, these two-day events cover in-depth
     ---------------                                                       
     financial planning topics that train the Representative to identify
     financial planning problems, develop financial planning solutions, and
     implement products.

     National Conferences - H.D. Vest holds two major training conferences per
     --------------------                                                     
     year.  The Vest Fest is held in the spring and the Annual National
     Conference is held in the winter.

3.   Marketing System.  Based on research results, the Company has developed a
     step-by-step marketing system which provides new Representatives with the
     tools necessary to increase their product sales to clients.  The Company
     has developed a marketing system for Representative development which
     consists of the following:

     investment services. This provides a new source of prospective clients for
     the most proactive and successful Representatives and enables the Company
     to capitalize on the opportunity represented by clients whose needs are
     currently untapped by their primary Representatives.


Representative Systems

The Information Services Division provides computer systems for both the Company
and its Representatives.  The division is responsible for developing and writing
all of the programs and hardware that supports the Company's operations.
Information Services is developing a Representative Desktop which is intended to
provide H.D. Vest Representatives with an integrated office management system.
Currently, the Company offers the Representatives computer software programs to
assist them with the implementation of financial planning products.  The
Information Services Division intends to continue development of both the
Company's operating system and the Representative Desktop in fiscal 1996.


Insurance Agency Management Services

The Company provides management services to an affiliated insurance agency, H.D.
Vest Insurance Services ("HDVIns").  HDVIns represents a diversified spectrum of
national insurance companies offering life, health, disability, long-term care,
and variable and fixed annuity products for both individuals and businesses.
Representatives of the Company are licensed through HDVIns to sell insurance
products.  These Representatives are paid a commission on such sales by HDVIns.
The Company does not receive any portion of these commissions, however, a
facility and service fee is received for management and other services rendered
by the Company.

Customer accounts for trading of stocks and bonds are cleared on a fully
disclosed basis through National Financial Services Corporation, 161 Devonshire
Street, Mail Stop D6, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.  National Financial Services
Corporation as the clearing agent for HDVIS, reflects all stock, bond and option
transactions of HDVIS's customers on its own books.  Mutual funds and direct
participation programs are handled directly with the product distributors.


Representative Licensing

both their securities, insurance and Registered Investment Advisor licenses,
including educational programs for exams and complete administrative processing
with the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD"), the securities

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
licensing agent, and the state agencies that supervise insurance licensing.


Compliance and Due Diligence Services

The Company requires that all Representatives follow the Company's Professional
Code of Ethics and Compliance and Supervisory Procedures.  To that end, the
Company's Compliance Department is responsible for Representatives' compliance
with rules of the regulatory bodies that supervise the financial services
industry. Due to the strict regulation of the financial services industry by
federal and state agencies, it is important that the Company keep abreast of the
activities of its Representatives and internal staff.  The Company's Compliance
Department supervises the activities of all Representatives.


Professional Investment Advisory Services

H.D. Vest Advisory Services, Inc. ("HDVAS") conducts all of the investment
advisory activities of the Company.  HDVAS, formed in 1987, as a Texas
corporation, is registered as an investment advisor with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and various state regulatory agencies as well as a member of
the Investment Company Institute.  The Company's Representatives can register as
Investment Advisor Representatives under HDVAS, giving them the capability of
providing fee-based financial planning services to their clients.  As of
September 30, 1995, there were approximately 1,517 Representatives registered
with HDVAS.

The VestPremiere Investment Program is a fee-based service of HDVAS. This
service, designed for clients with over $100,000 of current investable dollars,
allows individual investors, foundations, endowments, retirement plans, and
trusts to access comprehensive and independent consulting services that
historically were reserved for only large institutional investors.  Through its
expert team of Certified Investment Management Analysts, Chartered Financial
Analysts, Certified Financial Planners, Chartered Financial Consultants, and
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants-Accredited Personal Financial
Specialists, this service helps investors in the asset allocation decision and
in choosing the proper money managers to manage various portions of their
investment portfolio.  A quarterly report is provided to each client detailing
investment performance.  As of September 30, 1995, there were approximately 604
client accounts utilizing the services of the VestPremiere Investment Program.

The VestFlex Investment Program is a service introduced by HDVAS during July
1993.  The program is designed to provide clients with

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
as little as $10,000 of investable assets with the rewards of asset allocation
and professional monitoring. Individual investment objectives and risk
tolerances are utilized to select the optimal portfolio in order to meet the
client's needs. Each portfolio is invested in a family of mutual funds and
diversified into different asset classes. A quarterly report is provided to each
client detailing investment performance. As of September 30, 1995, there were
approximately 1,759 client accounts in the VestFlex Investment Program.

In October 1995, the Company began its Vest Advisor program.  This program will
accommodate clients with a minimum of $25,000 of current investment dollars.
These investments will be managed by the client's Representative according to
the portfolio goals established between the Representative and the client.  Each
client's investment will be held in a single brokerage account.  A quarterly
report will be provided to each client detailing investment performance.



Seasonality

As a result of the Company's Representatives consisting primarily of tax
professionals, a majority of the Company's revenues (approximately 51% in fiscal
1995) are generated during tax season (December through May).  Tax season is the
time of year that the Company's Representatives have the most contact with the
greatest number of clients.



Government Regulation

H.D. Vest Investment Securities, Inc. ("HDVIS")  -  The securities industry in
- --------------------------------------------------                            
the United States is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state
laws.  The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal
securities laws.  Much of the regulation of broker-dealers such as HDVIS,
however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations such as the NASD.
The NASD conducts periodic examinations of member broker-dealers. Securities
firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the
states in which they are registered.  HDVIS is currently registered as a broker-
dealer in all fifty states, the District of Columbia and the Puerto Rico
territory.

The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of the
securities business, including sales methods, representative supervision, trade
practices among broker-dealers, capital structure of securities firms, record
keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.  Additional

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC and by self-regulatory
organizations, and changes in the interpretation of enforcement of existing laws
and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of
broker-dealers.  The SEC and the self-regulatory organizations may conduct
administrative proceedings which can result in censure, fine, suspension or
expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees.  The principal purpose
of regulations and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers
and the securities markets rather than protection of creditors and stockholders
of broker-dealers. See "Item 3 Legal Proceedings".

HDVIS is a member of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation ("SIPC").
SIPC provides protection to customers (but not shareholders) if a SIPC member
fails financially.  Customers (not including investors in the stock of the
Company) of HDVIS that have securities and/or cash on deposit with HDVIS, would
be protected up to a maximum of $500,000, including up to $100,000 on claims for
cash.

HDVIS is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which
requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and requires that the ratio of
aggregate indebtedness to net capital, both as defined, shall not exceed 15 to
1.  Minimum net capital can never be lower than $250,000 or 6 2/3% of Aggregate
Indebtedness, as defined, whichever is greater.  In computing net capital under
the Uniform Net Capital Rule, various adjustments are made to net worth to
exclude assets which are not readily convertible into cash and to conservatively
state other assets, such as a firm's position in the securities that it holds in
its own account.  To that end, a deduction is made against the market value of
such securities to reflect the possibility of a market decline prior to their
disposition.  For each dollar that net capital is reduced, by means of such
deductions or otherwise (for example, through operating losses or capital rules,
which are unique to the securities industry), financial restrictions are imposed
upon the Company which are more severe than those imposed on corporations
engaged in certain other types of business (see "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results  of Operations-Liquidity and Capital
Resources").  HDVIS had net capital, required net capital, and excess net
capital for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1994, and 1995, as follows:

H.D. Vest Advisory Services, Inc. ("HDVAS")  -  The financial planning industry
- ----------------------------------------------                                 
is subject to federal regulation under the Investment Advisor Act of 1940,
requiring those providing fee-based investment advice to register with the SEC.
Most states also have registration and reporting requirements.  HDVAS is
registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and 49 state regulatory
agencies.


H.D. Vest, Inc.  (the "Company") -  The Company and its subsidiaries' regulatory
- ----------------------------------                                              
environment, which consists of various areas of securities, investment advisory,
and accountancy law, is extremely complex.  In recognition of this reality, the
Company has found it prudent to open the channels of communication between
Company officials and the politicians and regulators who influence its business.
Several Company officers volunteer their personal time and money in connection
with their own political interests, and the Company occasionally contributes
funds to the administrative accounts of political parties.  The Company
contributed such funds totaling approximately $103,321 for the year ended
September 30, 1995.  All such activities and contributions are carefully
reviewed by the Company's legal counsel to ensure that they comply with the law.



Competition

There is intense competition in the brokerage and insurance industry from large,
diversified, well-capitalized brokerage firms, financial institutions, and other
organizations.  Retail oriented financial service providers and other financial
institutions are employing substantial funds in advertising and direct
solicitation of customers to increase their market share, and in many cases the
Company is directly competing with such organizations for the same market share.



Uniqueness

The Company was established to meet the growing demand for professional
financial services.  The Company's management believes that the tax professional
is uniquely qualified to give confidential, professional financial advice and
implement financial plans due to the tax professional's in depth knowledge of
his or her clients' financial situation.  The Company offers the tax
professional the means to provide personalized financial services to the
consumer.

Tax professionals registered with the Company include CPAs, CFPs, Enrolled
Agents (EA), PhDs, CFAs, Registered Investment Advisors,

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
tax attorneys, and other tax professionals. Many hold state or national offices
in CPA societies, EA organizations and public accounting societies.


Employees

At September 30, 1995, the Company employed 126 full-time employees who provide
support services to Representatives of the Company. The number of employees is
expected to increase in areas that provide Representative support during the
fiscal year ending September 30, 1996.

Item 2.  Properties
- -------------------

The Company occupies approximately 30,000 square feet of office space in Irving,
Texas.  During May 1993, the Company renegotiated its lease on the office space
replacing Herb Vest as the lessee and naming the Company as lessee.  The
Company's lease expires in May 1998.  The 30,000 square feet consists of the
third floor and portions of the first, second, eighth, and ninth floors of the
Waterway Tower, located at 433 East Las Colinas Blvd., Irving, Texas.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) began an investigation of the Company's wholly-owned broker-
dealer subsidiary, H.D. Vest Investment Securities, Inc. (HDVIS), relating to
the activities of a former Representative.  In July 1995, concurrent with an
administrative proceeding instituted against HDVIS, the SEC and HDVIS entered
into a settlement agreement.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, HDVIS
(i)paid a monetary sanction of $50,000 and (ii)agreed to modify its supervisory
and compliance procedures in accordance with the recommendations of an
independent consultant retained by the Company.

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
Additionally, during fiscal 1994, in connection with the matter described above,
a group of clients of the former Representative commenced a civil action against
HDVIS and the former Representative alleging violations of securities laws,
fraud, conversion and related causes of action. In June 1995, the Company paid
for the benefit of the plaintiffs, approximately $450,000 as reimbursement of
what the Company believes represents actual out-of-pocket losses plus interest.
The Company believes a fidelity bond issued in favor of HDVIS will cover actual
out-of-pocket losses, up to an aggregate of $250,000 incurred by the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs seek an additional amount of actual and punitive damages, some of
which they allege are related to their actual economic losses. HDVIS is
vigorously contesting the plaintiffs' right to recover any of these additional
alleged damages. As of September 30, 1995, the Company has accrued approximately
$139,400, net of the fidelity bond, related to legal expenses and costs
associated with expert consultants.

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen
in the ordinary course of its business and have not been finally adjudicated.

Management believes, based on the advice of legal counsel responsible for such
matters, that these actions, when finally concluded and determined, will not
have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of
operations of the Company.


Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------

The annual meeting of shareholders of the Company was held on May 31, 1995, at
the Buena Vista Palace in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Matters voted on and
approved by the Company's Shareholders at the meeting included the re-election
of Herb D. Vest as Chairman of the Board of Directors, the re-election of
Barbara Howard-Vest, Kenneth E. Reynolds, Jack B. Strong, Jerry M. Prater,
Phillip W. Mayer, and Lynn R. Niedermeier as Directors of the Company. Arthur
Andersen LLP was approved as the Company's independent public accountants for
the ensuing year.

</TABLE>

As of September 30, 1995, there were 842 holders of record of the Company's
common stock.

The NASDAQ Qualifications Standards requires any company wishing to remain
listed to have net tangible assets of $2,000,000, capital and surplus of
$1,000,000, public float of shares of 100,000 (which are shares not held
directly or indirectly by any officer, director or beneficial owner of more than
10% of the total shares outstanding), market value of public float of $200,000,
minimum bid for outstanding shares of $1.67, 300 shareholders, and 2 market
makers.

If the Company was subsequently delisted from the NASDAQ National Market System,
such delisting would materially limit the public market for the Company's common
stock through loss of news coverage, possible decline in share price and
possible difficulty in obtaining subsequent financing.  In such event, a
stockholder might encounter difficulty in selling his or her common stock.

                                       19

The Company has paid no dividends on its common stock since incorporation and
does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable
future.  The Company intends to continue to devote  its  earnings,  if any, to
the growth and development of the Company.  Any dividends in the future will
depend upon substantial earnings, the Company's financial requirements and other
factors.


Potential Future Sales Pursuant to the SEC's Rule 144 -

Of the 5,423,341 shares of common stock currently outstanding, 4,152,754 shares
of common stock are "restricted securities," as that term is defined in Rule
144.  A person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) not affiliated with the
issuer who has satisfied a two-year holding period may, under certain
circumstances, sell within a three-month period a number of shares which does
not exceed the greater of 1% of the shares outstanding or the average weekly
trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. Rule 144 also
permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of shares without any quantity
limitation by a person who is not an affiliate of the Company and who has
satisfied a three-year holding period.  After a three-year holding period, if a
person is not an affiliate and has not been an affiliate for the last three
months, then the person can sell his or her shares without any restrictions
applicable to Rule 144. Herb D. Vest, the Chairman of the Board owns 2,544,255
shares of which 2,478,092 shares are restricted and Barbara Howard-Vest, a
Director of the Company owns 1,519,746 shares of which 1,487,808 are restricted.
Mr. Vest acquired the majority of his shares in February 1987.  Ms. Howard-Vest
acquired the majority of her shares pursuant to a divorce agreement with Mr.
Vest in June, 1991. Future sales under Rule 144 may have a depressive effect on
the price of the Company's common stock.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operations
- -------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At September 30, 1995, the Company had working capital of $1,293,871, an
increase of $281,855 from the $1,012,016 of working capital at September 30,
1994.

The Company's cash flows provided by operations decreased by $755,018 to
$1,019,917 for the year ended September 30, 1995 compared to the year ended
September 30, 1994.  The decrease in cash provided by operations is primarily
due to:  (i) a decrease in amounts due on clearing transactions resulting from
regulatory changes that reduced from five days to three days the time that funds
may be remitted on investment trades and (ii) continuing payments on severance
agreements with former officers.

Cash used for investing activities of $485,804 and $934,010 for the years ended
September 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively, includes costs of $95,145 and
$407,299 incurred for furniture, fixtures and computer equipment for those same
years, respectively.  The $390,659 of funds used for investing activities for
the purchase of other assets during the year ended September 30, 1995 includes
costs incurred for software development, designed to improve the productivity of
the Company's Representatives, and costs related to the formation of the
Deferred Compensation Plan.

Cash used for financing activities of $1,344,293 during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1995 included net advances on the lines of credit with Mr. Vest of
$879,290 in principal and $163,145 of accrued and unpaid interest, net payments
from Ms. Howard-Vest of $53,884 in principal and $1,754 of accrued and unpaid
interest, and payments for capital lease obligations and preferred stock
dividends.  Cash used for financing activities of $1,872,119 during the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1994 include net advances on the lines of credit with
Mr. Vest of $1,120,710 in principal and $23,210 of accrued and unpaid interest
and with Mrs. Howard-Vest of $350,000 in principal and $9,561 of accrued and
unpaid interest, payments for capital lease obligations and preferred stock
dividends.

The Company's historical growth has been financed from inception via loans,
private placements of preferred and common stock, public offerings of common
stock and cash flows from operations.  For the period from inception through
September 30, 1995, amounts from

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
these sources have been approximately $2.5 million, $2.6 million, $5.1 million
and $3.1 million, respectively.

In July 1995, the Company began accepting contributions for the Deferred
Compensation Plan ("the Plan") for its Representatives. Pursuant to the Plan,
Representatives may forego current compensation, thus postponing recognition of
income otherwise currently taxable, and subsequently receive the deferred
compensation plus a Company matching contribution, as defined in the Plan.  As
of September 30, 1995 approximately $73,000 had been deferred under the Plan.

Matching contributions of amounts deferred under the Plan must be accrued as
additional commission expense on a straight-line basis from the period deferred
until the Representative is paid the deferral amount and matching contribution.
Accordingly, participation in the Plan by Representatives will have the effect
of increasing commission expense in the years in which commissions are earned
and deferred by participants.  Such increases in commission expense will have an
adverse effect on the net income of the Company.  To the extent that
Representatives elect to defer receipt of compensation under the Plan, such
compensation will ultimately be paid to the participant in the form of cash. The
Company accrued matching contributions of approximately $1,000 for the fiscal
year ended 1995.

The Company continually monitors the capital markets for opportunities to obtain
financing to meet its growth needs. Historically, the Company has significantly
increased its recruiting and development activities upon obtaining such
financing.  The Company must expense all costs related to these activities.
Additionally, in periods of extensive recruiting and development activities, the
Company has experienced higher general and administrative costs as overhead has
increased to support the recruiting and development activities.  Consequently,
the Company has generated substantial net losses subsequent to obtaining
financing needed to fund further growth.  Should the Company obtain future
financing to fund its growth plans, it is likely the Company would generate net
losses in the period subsequent to obtaining such financing.

Results of Operations

Revenues

The Company's revenues for the year ended September 30, 1995, were $44,670,051,
a 11% decrease over the year ended September 30, 1994. Management believes that
revenues were negatively impacted by

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
interest rates which made interest-bearing investments attractive to investors. 
Additionally, the Company has begun to place increased emphasis on its
fee-based business. As Representatives switch their investment strategies for
their clients from front-end sales charge investments (i.e. mutual funds) to
fee-based investments, commission revenue will be replaced by portfolio
management fees. In the short term, the decrease in commission revenue will be
greater than the increase in portfolio management fees.  However, portfolio
management fees will be earned annually on client funds that remain invested in
fee-based programs, compared to a one-time front- end sales charge on mutual
fund investments.  The Company's revenues for the years ended September 30,
1994 and 1993, were $50,287,196 and $46,007,817, respectively, a 9% and 30%
increase over the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Commission revenue as a percentage of gross product sales have declined from
approximately 4% in 1986 to approximately 3% in 1995. This decline is due to an
industry-wide reduction in commissions on mutual funds and unit investment
trusts.  These products comprise a majority of the revenues generated by HDVIS,
the Company's main operating subsidiary.  To the extent that these commissions
continue to decline, HDVIS must increase the volume of products sold to maintain
historical commission revenue levels.

Due to the declining trend of commission revenue as a percentage of gross
product sales, the Company has devoted significant resources to further
development of its fee-based programs. Portfolio management fees from these
programs were $3,219,574 for the year ended September 30, 1995, a 92% increase
over the year ended September 30, 1994.  Portfolio fee revenues for the years
ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, were $1,680,889 and $791,764, respectively, a
112% increase and 2% decrease over the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The reasons for changes in the Company's revenues in the years ended September
30, 1993, 1994, and 1995 are summarized in the following table:

(1)  Revenues have increased in 1993 and 1994 due to increases in product sales
     resulting from the growth in the number of Representatives and the training
     programs provided by the Company.  Revenues in 1995 have decreased due to
     rising interest rates which have made interest-bearing investments
     attractive to investors.
(2)  Revenues have increased due to the increase in the number of
     Representatives licensed to offer this product and market conditions which
     have made this product a better investment.
(3)  Revenues decreased due to a decline in demand for this type of product due
     to changes in tax laws and the economic viability of these products.
(4)  Revenues have increased in 1993 and 1994 due to increases in product sales
     resulting from the growth in the number of Representatives and the training
     programs provided by the Company.  Revenues in 1995 have decreased due to
     rising interest rates which have made interest-bearing investments
     attractive to investors.
(5)  Revenues increased during 1994 and 1995 due in part to the an increase in
     the number of Representatives licensed to offer

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
     this product and the development of additional fee-based services. During
     1993 several accounts were transferred to a competing investment company
     started by a former officer of the Company. The division has continued to
     grow with the addition of new accounts and a new service, VestFlex
     Investment Program. During 1994 and 1995, the Company has devoted
     significant resources to further develop fee-based programs.
(6)  Facility and Service Fees decreased in 1994 due to a decrease in the
     resources available to support this product line.  Fees in 1993 and 1995
     increased due to the allocation of more resources used to support this
     product line.
(7)  Revenues in 1993 and 1994 increased due to increases in sales and the
     expansion of the educational programs and seminars provided by the Company.
     Product sponsors assist in the funding of our educational services.
     Revenues in 1995 decreased as a direct result of a sluggish market, which
     reduced the receipts from sponsors.
(8)  Effective November 15, 1989, the Company began charging a transaction fee
     of $10.50 for each transaction processed by the Company, subject to certain
     limitations.  This policy was discontinued in the first quarter of fiscal
     year 1995. Transaction fees for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1994,
     and 1995 were $775,735, $845,436, and $64,586 respectively.

During 1995, the Company developed programs designed to increase future
revenues.  Each of these programs is discussed in summary below.

Regional Support System (RSS)
- -----------------------------

The RSS program is designed to provide Representatives with local support in all
aspects of financial planning including sales and marketing training, and time
and practice management.  Each RSS group is led by an H.D. Vest Representative.
The RSS program is built around Foundation Teams (for Representatives seeking to
achieve $25,000 in rolling 12-month gross revenues), Chapters (which are similar
to the Foundation Teams except that they are held in larger workshop formats)
and Summit Teams (for Representatives above the $25,000 rolling 12-month gross
revenue threshold).  Each month 110 Chapter and 52 Foundation team meetings are
held nationwide.

Total Client Commitment (TCC)
- -----------------------------

The TCC program reflects the Company's belief that H.D. Vest Representatives
have a continuing obligation to provide comprehensive, knowledge-based services
to their clients in a professional and ethical manner.  To support the
Representatives in

                                       26
<PAGE>
 
fulfilling this obligation, the Company is providing a wide range of educational
tools including newsletters, audiotapes, direct marketing programs and success
training. Additional programs include Client Appreciation Week, Client Service
Awards, and the H.D. Vest Merit Scholarship program for children of H.D. Vest
investment clients.

Partners for Success (PfS)
- --------------------------

The PfS program offers successful H.D. Vest Representatives the opportunity to
work with low-producing Representatives to generate a new source of revenue,
while providing the low-producing Representatives the opportunity to increase
their revenue stream with little effort, time or money.

The Rep Desktop
- ---------------

The Rep Desktop program is designed to provide H.D. Vest Representatives with an
innovative and integrated office management system.  Key components of the
program rolled out through September 30, 1995 include an automated contact
management system and new Representative communication system which will be the
cornerstones of the new Rep Desktop.



Net Income (Loss)

Net income for the year ended September 30, 1995 was $1,329,001 compared to a
net loss of $(369,901) and net income of $2,934,722 for the years ended
September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 1995, were
$10,810,892, a decrease of $2,893,060 from the prior year total of $13,703,952.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 1994
increased by $2,857,819 from the $10,846,133 reported at September 30, 1993.  A
substantial amount of the Company's expenses are variable and controllable.
Consequently, as revenues decline during the year, the Company was able to
reduce certain expenses to maintain profitability. Additionally, the reduction
for fiscal 1995, is partially a result of a credit to expense of $381,331
related to the cancellation of an officer's severance agreement. The increase in
fiscal 1994 was primarily the result of severance agreements with former
officers, professional fees, settlement charges related to litigation with two
former officers and accrued expenses related to a case involving questionable
trading practices of a former Representative (see Note 4 "Commitments and
Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements).

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
Representative development costs for the year ended September 30, 1995, were
$4,526,637, a decrease of $411,490 over the prior year. Representative
development costs for the year ended September 30, 1994 were $4,938,127, a
$1,648,299 increase over the $3,289,828 for the year ended September 30, 1993.
The decrease in development costs for 1995 is generally due to reduced levels of
variable and controllable expenses consistent with the current year revenue
decrease. However, Representative development costs have not decreased at the
same rate as other expense categories, because continued training and
development of Representatives must continue to be emphasized (i) even in down
markets to mitigate the revenue impact of the down market and (ii) to ensure
that appropriate training and educational materials are made available to
Representatives as financial planning techniques and investment products
proliferate and become more complicated.

Representative recruiting costs for the year ended September 30, 1995, were
$398,837, a decrease of $120,339 over the prior year. Representative recruiting
costs for the year ended September 30, 1994, were $519,176, an increase of
$204,771 from the expense of $314,405 for the year ended September 30, 1993. The
decrease in recruiting costs for fiscal 1995 is related to the curtailment of
the direct mailing activities of the Company.  Recruiting activities for fiscal
1995 and 1994 focused on the use of a referral program through which existing
Representatives received incentives for recruiting new Representatives and the
newly implemented RSS program.  The increase in fiscal 1994 is the result of an
increased use of direct mail to find prospective Representatives.  To the extent
that the Company decides in the future to devote significant resources to
rapidly expand its Representative base through aggressive recruiting activities,
future profitability would likely be negatively impacted.

Currently, most state boards have regulations prohibiting CPAs from receiving
commissions for the sale or referral of products or services to their clients.
Since 1990, twelve states have changed their rules to allow commission income by
CPAs and several other states have proposed rule changes.  In California,
Mississippi and Louisiana, where commissions are prohibited, CPA Representatives
have been challenged by their state regulatory boards.  The Company has chosen
to vigorously support these Representatives.  In Louisiana and Mississippi a
lower court found in favor of the Representative and these cases are on appeal.
The California litigation has not reached trial.  The Company incurred legal
costs of approximately $464,000, $573,000 and $156,000 for the years ended
September 30, 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively, to support

                                       28

these Representatives. Mississippi's board has changed its rule to allow
commissions effective January 1, 1996.

                     Report of Independent Public Accountants



  To the Shareholders and Directors of H.D. Vest, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
  position of H.D. Vest, Inc. (a Texas Corporation) as of September 30, 1994 and
  1995, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
  investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
  September 30, 1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
  Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
  financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
  standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
  material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
  also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
  estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
  statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
  for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
  present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of H.D. Vest,
  Inc. as of September 30, 1994 and 1995, and the results of its operations and
  its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
  1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

continuous full time basis for one year and work a minimum of 40 hours per week.
The Company matches contributions made by employees at a rate of 20%, up to an

and $46,568 respectively.


3)   Notes Payable

the Company may borrow up to a maximum of $500,000. The line bears interest,
payable monthly, at prime plus 1% (9.50% as of September 30, 1995).  The line is
secured by a $250,000 Certificate of Deposit held by H.D. Vest Investment
Securities, Inc. ("HDVIS").  Additionally, the Company's two largest
shareholders have pledged a portion of their holdings as collateral for the
line.  The line of credit is intended for working capital purposes and expires

Rent expense for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1994 and 1995 was
approximately $583,325, $552,463 and $594,756 respectively. The future minimum
rental payments under the current leases are as follows:  1996 - $684,081; 1997
- - $696,966; and 1998 - $481,824.

(b)  Litigation and Contingencies  -  During the fiscal year ended September 30,
1994, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation of the
Company's wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, H.D. Vest Investment
Securities, Inc. (HDVIS), relating to the activities of a former Representative.
In July 1995, concurrent with an administrative proceeding instituted against
HDVIS, the SEC and HDVIS entered into a settlement agreement.  Pursuant to the
settlement agreement, HDVIS (i)paid a monetary sanction of $50,000 and
(ii)agreed to modify its supervisory and compliance procedures in accordance
with the recommendations of an independent consultant retained by the Company.

Additionally, during fiscal 1994, in connection with the matter described above,
a group of clients of the former Representative commenced a civil action against
HDVIS and the former Representative alleging violations of securities laws,
fraud, conversion and related causes of action. In June 1995, the

                                      F-10
<PAGE>
 
Company paid for the benefit of the plaintiffs, approximately $450,000 as
reimbursement of what the Company believes represents actual out-of-pocket
losses, plus interest. The Company believes a fidelity bond issued in favor of
HDVIS will cover actual out-of-pocket losses, up to an aggregate of $250,000
incurred by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek an additional amount of actual
and punitive damages, some of which they allege are related to their actual
economic losses. HDVIS is vigorously contesting the plaintiffs' right to recover
any of these additional alleged damages. As of September 30, 1995, the Company
has accrued approximately $139,400, net of the fidelity bond, related to legal
expenses and costs associated with expert consultants.

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen
in the ordinary course of its business and have not been finally adjudicated.

Management believes, based on the advice of legal counsel responsible for such
matters, that these actions, when finally concluded and determined, will not, in
the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the financial
position of the Company.


5)  Severance Agreements

In April 1994, an Executive Vice President resigned her position with the
Company. The Company and the officer entered into a severance agreement that
provided for the payment of severance of $16,667 per month commencing on May 1,
1994 and continuing for 30 months, in exchange for an agreement restricting the
use of Company materials and information for a period of 48 months. Subsequent
to September 30, 1994, the former officer rejoined the Company as President. In
connection with the officer's return, the Company and the officer agreed to
terminate the severance agreement. In December 1994, the Company credited the
remaining amount of $381,331 to general and administrative expenses. In October
1995, the Company granted the officer a medical leave of absence, discontinued
monthly payments and monthly stock awards under her existing employment
agreement, and agreed to pay her $16,600 per month until the earlier of 
October 1, 1996 or when the officer resumes her normal duties with the Company.
Upon her return, compensation to the officer would resume under her existing
employment agreement.

In June 1994, an Executive Vice President resigned his position with the
Company.  The Company and the former officer entered into a severance agreement
that provided for the payment of severance of $16,667 per month commencing on
September 15, 1994 and continuing for 30 months, in exchange for an agreement
restricting the use of Company materials and information for a period of 48
months.

                                      F-11

related liabilities at September 30, 1994 and 1995 were $883,331 and $283,329,
respectively.

Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $6.00 in exchange for $1,000,002 in
principal amount on a note payable to a financial services company. The Company
issued an additional 83,400 shares on non-voting Series A Preferred Stock at a

registration rights as defined.  The warrants are protected against dilution
upon the occurrence of certain events.  The warrants issued to the Underwriter
may not be transferred or assigned except to officers or shareholders of the
Underwriter. These warrants were registered pursuant to the Underwriter's
agreement in amendment number two to Form S-1 filed in May, 1995.

 
7)   Net Capital Requirements

The Company's main operating subsidiary, H.D. Vest Investment Securities, Inc.
("HDVIS") is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission Uniform Net
Capital  Rule (Rule 15c3-1), which requires the maintenance of minimum net
capital and requires that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital,

The Company's tax effected net temporary differences result in a deferred tax
asset reflecting a benefit expected to be utilized in the future.  However, the
Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance against this asset.  Management
currently estimates that it is more likely than not that no future benefit will
be received from this asset due to historical fluctuations in net income.

As of September 30, 1995, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $731,000, which will begin to expire  in 2007 if not utilized
earlier.  As of September 30, 1995, the Company has alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards available of approximately $100,487, which are available as
a credit against future regular income taxes payable.

 
10)   Stock Option Plans

The Company has a nonqualified stock option plan for all employees.  The
Company has reserved 800,000 shares of common stock for the plan. The option
price at the date of grant cannot be less than the fair market value of the
common stock at that date.  As of September 30, 1995, 142,257 options had  been
granted under the plan at an exercise price of $8.50 per share.  No stock
options were  exercisable  at  September 30, 1995, nor  were  any exercised
during the year ended September 30, 1995.

                                      F-16
<PAGE>
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1992, the Company issued 460,000
stock options to certain officers and advisors to the board of directors.
380,000 of these options remain outstanding as of September 30, 1995.  The
exercise price on the majority of the options is $5.00 (which was the fair
market value of the Company stock at the date of grant).  At September 30, 1995,
no options had been exercised.

In November 1992, the Company resolved that each independent director would
receive stock options of 2,000 shares of common stock to be exercisable at the
price of the common stock on the date of issuance and to be issued quarterly to
the independent directors.  At September 30, 1995, 22,000 options have been
issued and remain outstanding.


11)   Deferred Compensation Plan

In July 1995 the Company began accepting contributions for the Deferred
Compensation Plan ("the Plan") for its Representatives. Pursuant to the Plan,
Representatives may forego current compensation, thus postponing recognition of
income otherwise currently taxable, and subsequently receive the deferred
compensation plus a Company matching contribution as defined in the Plan.
Amounts deferred as of September 30, 1995 were approximately $73,000.

Matching contributions of amounts deferred under the Plan must be accrued as
additional commission expense on a straight-line basis from the period deferred
until the Representative is paid the deferral amount and matching contribution.
Accordingly, participation in the Plan by Representatives will have the effect
of increasing commission expense in the years in which commissions are earned
and deferred by participants.  Such increases in commission expense will have an
adverse effect on the net income of the Company.  To the extent that
Representatives elect to defer receipt of compensation under the Plan, such
compensation will ultimately be paid to the participant in the form of cash.
Matching contributions accrued for the fiscal year ended 1995 approximated
$1,000.

Executive Officer Compensation Plan

During April 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Executive
Officers Compensation Plan.  The purpose of the Executive Officers Compensation
Plan is to provide additional compensation to a select group of management
employees of the Company in order to motivate and retain them, as well as to
provide them an incentive to guide the Company in attaining higher revenue
goals.  The Company will provide this additional compensation under the
Executive Officers Compensation Plan in the form of salary, restricted stock,
incentive cash, and restricted stock bonuses, as well as severance and change-
in-control benefits.

As an unfunded plan of deferred compensation, it is administered by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company, who is presently Herb D. Vest.  Eligibility to
participate in the Executive Officers Compensation Plan is determined in the
sole and absolute discretion of the Company, which establishes eligibility
provisions of the officers Plan which it may change at any time in its sole and
absolute discretion.

Currently, to be eligible to participate in the Executive Officers Compensation
Plan, the individual must be an executive employee of the Company, have
completed at least two (2) full years of service with the Company, and be part
of a select group of management employees as designated by the Board of
Directors of the Company. The individual employee must also sign an Officers
Deferred Compensation Agreement and an Officer Agreement as a condition
precedent to becoming a participant in the Executive Officers Compensation Plan.

Under the Restricted Stock portion of the Executive Officers Compensation Plan,
a number of shares of restricted stock is determined by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company as allocable to a particular participant.  This
restricted stock is credited to the participant's account and will be vested and
distributable upon the first to occur of the following events: (1) Long term
disability, death of the participant or attaining the preselected Deferral Date;
or (2) The date of a "change-in-control" of the Company (as that term is defined
in the officers Plan).  No stock was earned under the Executive Officers
Compensation Plan for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995. Under the
Executive Officers Compensation Plan, the Board of Directors also annually sets
three revenue goals - a threshold, target, and maximum goal. If attained, the
revenue goals will

                                       37
<PAGE>
 
generate a set cash bonus for the participant, payable unless certain losses are
also incurred.

In addition, bonus stock will be credited to participants' accounts in the form
of restricted stock on the basis of the Company's attaining three year
cumulative revenue goals.  Each year these goals are set by the Board of
Directors for the upcoming three years and are based in part on the previous
years goals that consist of a threshold, a target, and a maximum cumulative
revenue goal.  Upon attaining one of these goals, bonus stock credited in the
form of restricted stock to the participant's plan vests and will become
distributable only upon retirement, long term disability, or death of the
participant, or the date of a "change-in-control" of the Company (as that term
is defined in the Executive Officers Compensation Plan).  No awards were earned
under the officers plan in 1994 or 1995.


Stock Options

The Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan as of October
1, 1987, in order to attract, retain, motivate, and encourage stock ownership by
employees, officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Stock Option Plan is administered by a stock option committee
("Committee"), appointed by the Chief Executive Officer, consisting of one to
three members.  The members of the Committee shall be eligible to receive
options under the Stock Option Plan.

The Committee currently consists of one member, Herb D. Vest. Options granted
under the Stock Option Plan are not intended to qualify as Incentive Stock
Options under Section 422a of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from
time to time.  The Company has reserved up to 800,000 shares of its common stock
for options under the Stock Option Plan.  The options must be paid in cash,
unless otherwise permitted by the Committee.  The exercise price of any options
granted in the future will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant.

The Committee, at the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, may amend,
modify or terminate the Stock Option Plan provided; however, no action of the
Committee, without approval of the Chief Executive Officer and the shareholders
of the Company may:

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
(a) Increase the total number of shares covered by the Stock Option Plan.

(b) Change the manner for determining the option price.

(c) Shorten the period which must lapse before options are eligible to be
    exercised.

(d) Permit options to be granted which expire beyond the period provided in the
    Stock Option Plan.

(e) Withdraw administration of the Stock Option Plan from the Committee.

(f) Permit granting of options at less than the option price.

Anti-dilution provisions in the Stock Option Plan provide for adjustment of the
Option exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise to prevent dilution of their value upon the occurrence of certain
events.

Options covering 191,497 shares were granted at an option price of $8.50 per
share as of October 1, 1987 to employees; 142,257 of these options remain
outstanding as of September 30, 1995.

During 1992, options covering 460,000 shares were granted at an option price of
$5.00 per share to employees and certain advisors to the Company's Board of
Directors.  380,000 of these options remain outstanding as of September 30,
1995.

In November 1992, the Company resolved that the independent directors receive
stock options for 2,000 shares of common stock to be exercisable at the price of
the common stock on the date of issuance and to be issued quarterly to the
independent directors. At September 30, 1995, 22,000 options have been issued
and remain outstanding.

As a result of the foregoing, options covering 270,748 shares of common stock,
with exercise price ranging from $5.00 to $8.50 per share have been issued to
officers of the Company.  The following table provides information with respect
to the named officers concerning the exercise of options during the last fiscal
year ending September 30, 1995:

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
- --------------------------------------------------------

Management Agreements

The Company has an agreement with Herb D. Vest (majority shareholder) for
management services to the Company. During April 1994, the Company amended the
agreement with Herb D. Vest and provided for a management fee of $500,000 per
year plus an annual bonus based on the Company's performance related to revenue
and net income goals established by the Board of Directors.  The annual bonus
for fiscal 1995, ranged from $0 to $500,000.  No bonus was accrued or paid under
the amended plan for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994 or 1995.  A bonus
of $88,778 was paid during fiscal 1994 related to a previous plan.  Management
fees under these agreements were $830,000, $632,528 and $500,000 for the years
ended September 30, 1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively.

During fiscal 1994, the Company modified Ms. Howard-Vest's consultant contract
to receive $16,667 per month pursuant to the agreement.  For the years ended
September 30, 1994 and 1995, fees under this agreement totaled $200,000 each.


H.D. Vest Insurance Services

                                       41
<PAGE>
 
sell insurance products to their clients. The Company, in accordance with the
terms of a facilities and services agreement, provides certain management and
other services to HDVIns and is paid a fee for these services. The value of
these services, for fiscal year ended 1995, has been determined based on the
prorata portion of certain relevant expenses as a percentage of HDVIns revenues
to total consolidated revenues. To the extent the Company renders services to
HDVIns for which it is not compensated; such action could constitute a conflict
of interest since Mr. Vest is both the majority shareholder and Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Company.

The services provided are as follows:

Management, accounting, referral data base, client tracking services,
solicitation, tracking of renewal policies of insurance, collection of premiums
and commissions, processing of insurance transactions, payment of salaries and
other expenses, cost of recruiting, training and reporting to agents and other
services as deemed appropriate by the Company.  In accordance with this
agreement the Company has charged HDVIns $316,289, $314,196 and $551,379 for the
years ended September 30, 1993, 1994, and 1995 respectively, for management
services rendered.

<PAGE>
 
the use of Company materials and information for a period of 48 months.

In connection with these agreements the Company charged $1,000,000 to general

time basis for one year and work a minimum of 40 hours per week.  The Company
matches contributions made by employees at a rate of 20%, up to an annual limit
of $1,848 per employee, paid at the time the employee makes the deferral.
