Item 1.       Business.

Formation

WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P.,  formerly known as Integrated  Medical Venture
Partners 2, L.P. (the "Partnership" or the "Registrant"),  is a Delaware limited
partnership  organized in April 1988. In July 1988, the  Partnership  elected to
operate as a business  development  company under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Partnership's  investment objective is to
achieve  long-term  capital  appreciation  from its portfolio of venture capital
investments,  consisting of companies engaged in the health-care  industry.  The
Partnership considers this activity to constitute the single industry segment of
venture capital investing.

The  general  partners  of the  Partnership  consist of three  individuals  (the
"Independent  General  Partners")  and WestMed  Venture  Management  2, L.P.,  a
Delaware  limited  partnership  (the "Managing  General  Partner").  The general
partner  of the  Managing  General  Partner is Medical  Venture  Holdings,  Inc.
("MVH"), a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
("Opco").

The Partnership  publicly offered 60,000 units of limited  partnership  interest
(the "Units") at $500 per Unit. The Units were  registered  under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended,  pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File
No.  33-21281)  which was declared  effective on August 5, 1988. The Partnership
held its initial and final  closings on  September  1, 1988 and October 1, 1989,
respectively,  and  terminated the offering on February 15, 1990. As a result of
the public  offering,  the  Partnership  accepted  subscriptions  for a total of
38,727  Units.  Gross capital  contributions  to the  Partnership  in connection
therewith  totaled  $19,559,091;  $19,363,500  from the  limited  partners  (the
"Limited  Partners" and  collectively  with the Managing  General  Partner,  the
"Partners") and $195,591 from the Managing General Partner.

The Venture Capital Investments

From its inception through December 31, 1994, the Partnership had invested $13.5
million in ten portfolio  companies  (including  venture  capital fees and other
acquisition  costs totaling  $873,000).  At December 31, 1994, the Partnership's
investment  portfolio  consisted of eight active investments with a cost of $8.4
million and a fair value of $6.3 million.  From its inception  through  December
31, 1994, the Partnership had liquidated  investments  with an aggregate cost of
$5.1  million.  These  liquidated  investments  returned  $2.2  million  to  the
Partnership resulting in a cumulative net realized loss of $2.9 million.  During
the year ended December 31, 1994, the Partnership  invested $1.4 million in four
existing portfolio  companies.  The venture capital investments made during 1994
and other events affecting the  Partnership's  portfolio  investments are listed
below.

During the year,  AGIS  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  changed  its name to Sennes Drug
Innovations, Inc. ("Sennes"). On January 20, 1994, the Partnership exercised its
warrant to purchase  2,500,000  shares of preferred  stock of Sennes at $.40 per
share  and  purchased  an  additional  250,000  preferred  shares  of  Sennes by
investing $750,000 in cash and exchanging  promissory notes aggregating $350,000
in face value.  Also during the year, the  Partnership  exercised its warrant to
purchase  412,500 shares of common stock of Sennes for $4,125.  The  Partnership
paid venture  capital fees  totaling  $45,700 to the  Managing  General  Partner
relating to these investments.

On March 11, 1994, the Partnership purchased 96,550 shares of preferred stock of
Hepatix,  Inc. for $275,168.  The Partnership paid a $16,675 venture capital fee
to the Managing General Partner relating to this investment.

On May 20, 1994,  Targeted  Genetics,  Inc. ("TGI") completed its initial common
stock public offering. In connection with the offering, TGI effected a 1-for-2.5
reverse split of its common stock. As a result,  the  Partnership  exchanged its
396,826 preferred shares for 158,731 shares of common stock of TGI.

On May 20, 1994, the Partnership purchased an 8.5% promissory note from La Jolla
Pharmaceutical  Company ("La  Jolla") for  $125,000.  On June 3, 1994,  La Jolla
completed  its initial  common stock public  offering.  In  connection  with the
offering,  La Jolla effected a one-for-ten reverse split of its common stock. As
a result,  the Partnership  exchanged its 753,070 shares of preferred and common
stock for 75,307 shares of common stock of La Jolla. Also in connection with the
offering,  the  Partnership  converted its $125,000  promissory note and $384 of
accrued  interest  into 25,076  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase
12,538 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. Additionally,  under the terms
of the note  agreement,  the  Partnership  received a warrant to purchase  5,015
shares of common stock of La Jolla at $5.00 per share.  The  Partnership  paid a
$7,598 venture  capital fee to the Managing  General  Partner  relating to these
transactions.

On July 29, 1994,  the  Partnership  purchased  100,000  preferred  shares and a
warrant to purchase an additional 100,000 preferred shares of Gliatech, Inc. for
$150,000.  The  Partnership  paid a $9,090  venture  capital fee to the Managing
General Partner relating to this investment.

Competition

The  Partnership  encounters  competition  from other  entities  having  similar
investment  objectives.  Primary competition for venture capital investments has
been from venture  capital  partnerships,  venture  capital  affiliates of large
industrial  and financial  companies,  small business  investment  companies and
wealthy  individuals.  Competition has also been from foreign investors and from
large industrial and financial  companies investing directly rather than through
venture  capital  affiliates.  The Partnership has frequently been a co-investor
with other  professional  venture  capital groups and these  relationships  have
expanded the Partnership's access to investment opportunities.

Employees

The Partnership has no employees.  The Managing General Partner,  subject to the
supervision  of the  Independent  General  Partners,  manages and  controls  the
Partnership's   venture  capital  investments.   The  Managing  General  Partner
performs,  or arranges for others to perform,  the management and administrative
services  necessary for the operation of the  Partnership and is responsible for
managing the Partnership's short-term investments.

Item 2.       Properties.

The Partnership does not own or lease physical properties.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

The Partnership is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                    PART II

Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

There is no  established  public  trading  market  for the  Units  and it is not
anticipated  that any public  market for the Units will  develop.  The number of
individual holders of Units at December 31, 1994 was approximately 4,000.

The Partnership did not make any cash distributions to Partners during the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  Cumulative cash  distributions  paid to
Partners from inception through December 31, 1994 totaled $278,000;  $275,000 to
the  Limited  Partners,  or  approximately  $7.00  per Unit,  and  $3,000 to the
Managing General Partner.

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement"),  the  Partnership's  net  income  and net  realized  gains from all
sources  are  allocated  to  all  Partners,   in  proportion  to  their  capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been  allocated an amount (the "Priority
Return")  equal  to 6% per  annum,  simple  interest,  on their  total  Adjusted
Invested  Capital;  i.e.,  original  capital  contributions  reduced by previous
distributions.  Thereafter,  net income  and net  realized  gains  from  venture
capital  investments  in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return
are  allocated  20% to the Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in
proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Any net income  from  non-venture
capital investments in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority Return is
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. Realized
losses  are   allocated  to  all  Partners  in   proportion   to  their  capital
contributions.  However, if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the
80-20 ratio,  then losses are  allocated in the reverse  order in which  profits
were allocated.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended December 31, 1994, the  Partnership  invested $1.4 million
(including  venture  capital fees totaling  $79,000) in four existing  portfolio
companies.  From its inception  through  December 31, 1994, the  Partnership had
invested an aggregate of $13.5  million in ten  portfolio  companies  (including
acquisition costs and venture capital fees totaling  $873,000).  At December 31,
1994,  the  Partnership  had invested  approximately  78% of its original  $17.3
million of net proceeds received from the offering of Units.

At December 31, 1994,  the  Partnership  held $7 million in cash and  short-term
investments;  $6.4 million in short-term securities with maturities of less than
one year and $529,000 in an  interest-bearing  cash  account.  Such  investments
provide the  Partnership  with the liquidity  necessary to make  investments  in
venture situations as opportunities for investment arise. The Partnership earned
interest totaling $288,000,  $276,000 and $391,000 from such investments for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Interest earned from
short-term   investments  in  future  periods  is  subject  to  fluctuations  in
short-term  interest rates and changes in funds available for investment.  It is
anticipated that funds needed to cover the Partnership's  future investments and
operating expenses will be obtained from existing cash reserves, interest earned
from its short-term  investment portfolio and proceeds realized from the sale of
portfolio investments.

Results of Operations

Investment Income and Expenses - For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and
1992,  the  Partnership  had a  net  investment  loss  (investment  income  less
operating expenses) of $88,000, $125,000 and $29,000,  respectively. The reduced
net  investment  loss for the 1994  period  compared  to the 1993 period was the
result of a $35,000  decrease  in  operating  expenses,  primarily  general  and
administrative  expenses and  professional  fees for the 1994 period.  Operating
expenses  declined  from  $413,000  in 1993 to  $378,000  in 1994.  General  and
administrative  expenses  declined $21,000 and professional fees declined $8,000
for the 1994  period  compared to the 1993  period due to certain  cost  control
measures  implemented by the Managing  General Partner during the fourth quarter
of 1993.

The  increase in net  investment  loss for the 1993 period  compared to the 1992
period primarily was the result of a $134,000  decline in investment  income for
the 1993 period.  Interest earned from short-term  investments declined $115,000
due to a decline in short-term interest rates and a decline in funds invested in
short-term securities during the 1993 period.  Interest and dividend income from
portfolio  investments declined $19,000 for the 1993 period compared to the 1992
period  due  to  the  reduction  of  income  producing  securities  held  by the
Partnership  during the 1993 period.  The $134,000 decline in investment  income
was  partially  offset by a $38,000  decrease in operating  expenses,  primarily
management fees, for the 1993 period.  The Partnership's  operating expenses for
1992 were $451,000 compared to $413,000 in 1993.

The  management  fee paid to the Managing  General  Partner under the management
agreement  between  the  Partnership  and  the  Managing  General  Partner  (the
"Management Agreement") for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was
$272,000,  $279,000 and  $301,000,  respectively.  To the extent  possible,  the
management  fee and other  operating  expenses are paid with funds provided from
operations.  Funds provided from operations are obtained from interest  received
from  short-term  investments,  interest  and  dividend  income  from  portfolio
investments and proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments.

Realized  Gains and Losses from  Portfolio  Investments - There were no realized
gains or losses from portfolio investments for the year ended December 31, 1994.

For the year ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a  $111,000  net
realized gain from portfolio investments.  In October 1993, the Partnership sold
11,000 common shares of Immune Response, Inc. for $142,000,  realizing a gain of
$110,000.  These shares were received by the  Partnership in connection with the
settlement of a dispute  relating to a potential  investment in a privately-held
company.  The  Partnership  also  realized a nominal  gain from the receipt of a
liquidation  payment relating to its investment in Biotronic Systems Corporation
("Biotronic") which had been written-off in 1992.

For the year ended  December 31, 1992,  the  Partnership  had a $2.1 million net
realized  loss from  portfolio  investments  relating  to the  write-off  of its
investment in Biotronic which ceased operations during the year.

Unrealized   Gains  and  Losses  and  Changes  in  Unrealized   Appreciation  or
Depreciation  of Portfolio  Investments - For the year ended  December 31, 1994,
the  Partnership  had a net  unrealized  loss from its portfolio  investments of
$198,000   resulting  from  the  net  downward   revaluation  of  its  portfolio
investments during 1994.

For the year  ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a $1.3  million
unrealized loss resulting from the downward revaluation of its investment in IVF
America,  Inc. due to the reduced  public market price of the  company's  common
stock during 1993.

For the year ended  December  31,  1992,  the  Partnership  had a  $339,000  net
unrealized  loss from its  portfolio  investments  resulting  from the  downward
revaluation of IVF America, Inc. Additionally,  the Partnership transferred $2.1
million from  unrealized  loss to realized loss relating to the write-off of its
investment  in Biotronic,  as discussed  above.  The $2.1 million  transfer from
unrealized loss to realized loss,  partially  offset by the additional  $339,000
unrealized  loss  for  1992,  resulted  in  a  $1.7  million  reduction  in  the
Partnership's net unrealized depreciation of investments for 1992.

Net Assets - Changes in net assets  resulting  from  operations are comprised of
(i) net realized gain or loss from operations and (ii) changes in net unrealized
appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments.   At  December  31,  1994,  the
Partnership's  net assets were $13.1 million,  a decrease of $286,000 from $13.4
million at December  31,  1993.  This  decrease  resulted  from the $198,000 net
unrealized  depreciation  of investments  and the $88,000 net realized loss from
operations for 1994.

At  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership's  net assets were $13.4  million,  a
decrease of $1.3 million from $14.8 million at December 31, 1992.  This decrease
resulted from the $1.3 million net unrealized  depreciation  of investments  and
the $14,000 net realized loss from operations for 1993.

At  December  31,  1992,  the  Partnership's  net assets were $14.8  million,  a
decrease of $368,000  from $15.1  million at December  31, 1991.  This  decrease
resulted  from the $2.1  million net  realized  loss from  operations  partially
offset by the $1.7 million net unrealized appreciation of investments for 1992.

The net asset value per $500 Unit,  including an  allocation  of net  unrealized
depreciation of investments,  at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $336, $343
and $378,  respectively.  Such per Unit amounts are based on average allocations
to all Limited Partners and do not reflect specific Limited Partner allocations,
which are determined by the original closing date associated with the Units held
by each Limited Partner.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P.:

We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheets of WestMed Venture Partners 2,
L.P. (the "Partnership"),  including the schedules of portfolio investments,  as
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related  statements of  operations,  cash
flows,  and  changes in  partners'  capital  for each of the three  years in the
period  ended   December  31,  1994.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 1994 and 1993 by correspondence
with the custodian;  where  confirmation  was not possible,  we performed  other
audit  procedures.  An audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects, the financial position of WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P. at December
31,  1994 and 1993,  and the results of its  operations,  its cash flows and the
changes in its partners' capital for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements  include  securities valued at
$6,252,798  and  $5,067,177  at  December  31,  1994  and  1993,   respectively,
representing  48% and 38% of net assets,  respectively,  whose  values have been
estimated   by  the  Managing   General   Partner  in  the  absence  of  readily
ascertainable  market  values.  We  have  reviewed  the  procedures  used by the
Managing General Partner in arriving at its estimate of value of such securities
and have  inspected  underlying  documentation,  and, in the  circumstances,  we
believe  the  procedures  are  reasonable  and  the  documentation  appropriate.
However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty  of  valuation,  those  estimated
values may differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.

WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS 2, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     Organization and Purpose

WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P. (the  "Partnership")  was formed under Delaware
law in April 1988. The Partnership  operates as a business  development  company
under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended.  The  Partnership  is a
closed-end partnership and accordingly its units of limited partnership interest
("Units") are not  redeemable by the  Partnership.  A total of 38,727 Units were
sold to limited  partners  ("Limited  Partners"  and together  with the Managing
General Partner (as hereinafter defined), the "Partners") at $500 per Unit.

The  general  partners  of  the  Partnership   include  three  individuals  (the
"Independent  General  Partners")  and the  managing  general  partner,  WestMed
Venture  Management  2, L.P.,  a Delaware  limited  partnership  (the  "Managing
General Partner" and collectively  with the Independent  General  Partners,  the
"General  Partners").  The general  partner of the Managing  General  Partner is
Medical  Venture  Holdings,   Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation   affiliated  with
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.  ("Opco").  The limited partners of the Managing General
Partner are  Oppenheimer  Holdings,  Inc.,  MVP Holdings,  Inc. and BSW, Inc., a
Delaware corporation owned by John A. Balkoski, Philippe L. Sommer and Howard S.
Wachtler.  Messrs. Sommer and Wachtler are principally  responsible for managing
the investments of the Partnership.

Opco, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange,  the National Association of
Securities Dealers,  Inc., and all principal United States securities exchanges,
is a diversified investment banking and securities firm, a registered investment
advisor and Futures  Commission  Merchant providing a broad range of services to
individual,  corporate, and institutional clients. Opco operates in the capacity
of broker and dealer for its  customers,  as well as trader for its own account.
The services provided by Opco and its subsidiaries,  and the activities in which
it is engaged,  include  securities  brokerage,  securities  research,  customer
financing,  securities  trading,  corporate  finance,  mergers and acquisitions,
underwriting and investment advisory services.

The Partnership's  objective is to achieve  long-term capital  appreciation from
its portfolio of venture capital investments, consisting of companies engaged in
the health care industry.  The Partnership is scheduled to terminate on December
31,  1998.  However,  the  General  Partners  can  extend the term for up to two
additional  two-year periods,  if they determine that such extensions are in the
best interest of the Partnership.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Valuation of  Investments - Portfolio  investments  are carried at fair value as
determined  quarterly by the Managing  General  Partner under the supervision of
the Independent  General  Partners.  The fair value of  publicly-held  portfolio
securities is adjusted to the average  closing  public market price for the last
five trading days of each quarter  discounted  for sales  restrictions.  Factors
considered in the determination of an appropriate discount include,  underwriter
lock-up or Rule 144 trading restrictions, insider status where the

<PAGE>


WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS 2, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Partnership either has a representative serving on the board of directors of the
portfolio  company  under  consideration  or is  greater  than a 5%  shareholder
thereof,  and  other  liquidity  factors  such as the size of the  Partnership's
position  in a given  company  compared  to the  trading  history  of the public
security.   Privately-held  portfolio  securities  are  carried  at  cost  until
significant  developments  affecting the portfolio  company  provide a basis for
change in  valuation.  The fair value of private  securities  is adjusted (i) to
reflect  meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private market and (ii) to
reflect  significant  progress or slippage in the  development  of the company's
business  such that cost is no longer  reflective  of fair  value.  As a venture
capital investment fund, the Partnership's  portfolio investments involve a high
degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses. The
Managing  General Partner  considers such risks in determining the fair value of
the Partnership's portfolio investments.

Investment  Transactions - Investment  transactions  are recorded on the accrual
method. For portfolio  investments,  transactions are recorded on the date which
the Partnership obtains an enforceable right to demand the securities or payment
thereof.  Realized  gains  and  losses on  investments  sold are  computed  on a
specific identification basis.

Statements  of  Cash  Flows  - Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  short-term
interest-bearing   investments  in  commercial  paper  and  other  money  market
investments.  The Partnership  considers its interest bearing cash account to be
cash equivalents.

Income Taxes - No provision  for income taxes has been made since all income and
losses are  allocable  to the partners for  inclusion  in their  respective  tax
returns.  The Partnership's net assets for financial  reporting  purposes differ
from its net  assets  for tax  purposes.  Net  unrealized  depreciation  of $2.1
million at  December  31,  1994,  which was  recorded  for  financial  statement
purposes, was not recognized for tax purposes.  Additionally,  from inception to
December 31, 1994,  other timing  differences  totaling $2.2 million,  primarily
relating  to  original  sales  commissions  paid and other  costs of selling the
Units, have been recorded on the Partnership's financial statements but have not
yet been deducted for tax purposes.

Reclassifications  - Certain  reclassifications  were made to the 1992 financial
statements to conform to the current period presentation.

3.     Allocations of Partnership Profits and Losses

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership (the "Partnership
Agreement"),  the  Partnership's  net  income  and net  realized  gains from all
sources  are  allocated  to  all  Partners,   in  proportion  to  their  capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been  allocated an amount (the "Priority
Return")  equal  to 6% per  annum,  simple  interest,  on their  total  Adjusted
Invested  Capital;  i.e.,  original  capital  contributions  reduced by previous
distributions.  Thereafter,  net income  and net  realized  gains  from  venture
capital

<PAGE>


WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS 2, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


investments  in  excess of the  amount  used to cover the  Priority  Return  are
allocated  20% to the  Managing  General  Partner  and  80% to all  Partners  in
proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Any net income  from  non-venture
capital investments in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority Return is
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. Realized
losses  are   allocated  to  all  Partners  is   proportion   to  their  capital
contributions.  However, if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the
80-20 ratio,  then losses are  allocated in the reverse  order in which  profits
were  allocated.  From its inception to December 31, 1994, the Partnership had a
$2.7 million net realized loss from its venture capital investments.

4.     Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,  the Managing General Partner is entitled
to receive a one-time venture capital fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds from
the sale of Units. Such fee is incurred as portfolio investments are made in the
proportion of the cost of each portfolio investment to the net proceeds from the
sale of Units. Venture capital fees incurred are recorded as a cost of acquiring
the portfolio  investments.  The  Partnership  incurred  venture capital fees of
$79,000,  $59,000 and $146,000 for the years ended  December 31, 1994,  1993 and
1992,  respectively.  Cumulative venture capital fees incurred from inception to
December 31, 1994 totaled $774,000.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner,  the Managing General Partner performs,  or arranges for others
to perform,  the  management,  administrative  and certain  investment  advisory
services necessary for the operation of the Partnership.  For such services, the
Managing  General Partner  receives a management fee at the annual rate of 2% of
the lesser of the net assets of the Partnership or the net  contributed  capital
of the Partnership; i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of
selling commissions and organizational expenses) reduced by capital distributed.
Such fee is determined and payable quarterly.

For services rendered to the Partnership,  each of the three Independent General
Partners  receives a $5,000 annual fee and  reimbursement  for all out-of-pocket
expenses relating to attendance at meetings of the General Partners.

exemptive  order  declaring that Messrs.  Elliott,  Taylor and White,  the three
Independent General Partners of the Partnership, are not "interested persons" of
the  Partnership  as  defined  in the 1940 Act  solely by reason of their  being

Item 11.      Executive Compensation.

Each Independent  General Partner receives an annual fee from the Partnership of
$5,000  together  with all  out-of-pocket  expenses  relating to  attendance  at
meetings of the General Partners.

For a  description  of the  allocation  and  distribution  of the  Partnership's
profits  and losses to the  Managing  General  Partner,  see Item 5.  Market for
Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

For the years ended  December 31,  1994,  1993 and 1992,  the  Managing  General
Partner  was  allocated  $3,000,  $13,000  and $4,000 of the  Partnership's  net
decrease in net assets from operations for each of the respective periods.

Pursuant to the Management Agreement,  the Managing General Partner performs, or
arranges  for others to  perform,  the  management,  administrative  and certain
investment advisory services necessary for the operation of the Partnership. For
such services,  the Managing  General  Partner  receives a management fee at the
annual rate of 2% of the lesser of the net assets of the  Partnership or the net
contributed capital of the Partnership; i.e., gross capital contributions to the
Partnership (net of selling commissions and organizational  expenses) reduced by
capital distributed. Such fee is determined and payable quarterly. For the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Managing  General  Partner  received
management fees of $272,000, $279,000 and $301,000, respectively.

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,  the Managing General Partner is entitled
to receive a one-time venture capital fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds from
the sale of Units. Such fee is incurred as portfolio investments are made in the
proportion of the cost of each portfolio investment to the net proceeds from the
sale of Units. Venture capital fees incurred are recorded as a cost of acquiring
the portfolio investments. For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
the Managing General Partner  received venture capital fees of $79,000,  $59,000
and $146,000, respectively.

beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Units. The Independent  General Partners
and the directors, officers and employees of MVH do not own any Units.

Item 13.      Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
