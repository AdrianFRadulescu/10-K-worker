                                     PART I

Item 1.       Business.

Formation

WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P. (the  "Partnership"  or the  "Registrant") is a
Delaware  limited  partnership  organized  in  April  1988.  In July  1988,  the
Partnership  elected  to operate as a  business  development  company  under the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The  Partnership's
investment  objective  is to achieve  long-term  capital  appreciation  from its
portfolio of venture capital investments, consisting of companies engaged in the
health-care industry.  The Partnership considers this activity to constitute the
single industry segment of venture capital investing.

The  general  partners  of the  Partnership  consist of three  individuals  (the
"Independent  General  Partners")  and WestMed  Venture  Management  2, L.P.,  a
Delaware  limited  partnership  (the "Managing  General  Partner").  The general
partner  of the  Managing  General  Partner is Medical  Venture  Holdings,  Inc.
("MVH"), a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
("Opco").

The Partnership  publicly offered 60,000 units of limited  partnership  interest
(the "Units") at $500 per Unit. The Units were  registered  under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended,  pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form N-2 (File
No.  33-21281)  which was declared  effective on August 5, 1988. The Partnership
held its initial and final  closings on  September  1, 1988 and October 1, 1989,
respectively,  and  terminated the offering on February 15, 1990. As a result of
the public  offering,  the  Partnership  accepted  subscriptions  for a total of
38,727  Units.  Gross capital  contributions  to the  Partnership  in connection
therewith  totaled  $19,559,091;  $19,363,500  from the  limited  partners  (the
"Limited  Partners" and  collectively  with the Managing  General  Partner,  the
"Partners") and $195,591 from the Managing General Partner.

The Venture Capital Investments

From its inception through December 31, 1995, the Partnership had invested $14.2
million in ten portfolio  companies  (including  venture  capital fees and other
acquisition  costs totaling  $912,000).  At December 31, 1995, the Partnership's
investment  portfolio  consisted of eight active  investments  with a cost of $9
million and a fair value of $6.1 million.  From its inception  through  December
31, 1995, the Partnership had liquidated  investments  with an aggregate cost of
$5.2  million.  These  liquidated  investments  returned  $2.2  million  to  the
Partnership  resulting  in a  cumulative  net  realized  loss of $3 million.  At
December 31, 1995,  the  Partnership  had a cumulative net loss from its venture
capital  investments  totaling  $2.8 million,  including  $248,000 of cumulative
interest  and other  income from  portfolio  investments.  During the year ended
December 31, 1995, the Partnership  invested $688,000 in two existing  portfolio
companies.  The venture  capital  investments  made during 1995 and other events
affecting the Partnership's portfolio investments are listed below.

During 1995, the Partnership made follow-on  investments in convertible notes of
Hepatix, Inc. totaling $419,171,  including $23,951 of venture capital fees paid
to the Managing General Partner. In connection with a financial restructuring of
Hepatix,  Inc.,  completed in October 1995, such notes totaling $395,220,  along
with $3,480 of accrued interest,  were exchanged for a new convertible note with
a face value of $398,700,  maturing on June 30, 1997,  and a warrant to purchase
797,399 common shares of Hepatix at $.01 per share.  Finally,  in December 1995,
the  Partnership  wrote-off  $90,696 of accrued  acquisition  costs and  venture
capital fees associated with its investment in Hepatix.

On July 13,  1995,  the  Partnership  made a $265,150  follow-on  investment  in
Targeted  Genetics  Corporation,  acquiring  66,664 shares of common stock and a
warrant to purchase an  additional  16,666  shares of common  stock at $4.68 per
share.  The  Partnership  paid a $15,150  venture  capital fee  relating to this
investment.

In July 1995,  KeraVision,  Inc.  completed  its  initial  public  offering  and
effected a 1-for-2.5  reverse split of its outstanding  stock. As a result,  the
Partnership  exchanged its 171,821  shares of preferred  stock of KeraVision for
68,728 shares of the company's common stock.

On October 18, 1995,  Gliatech,  Inc. completed its initial public offering.  In
connection with the offering,  Gliatech  effected a 5-for-1 reverse split of its
common stock.  As a result,  the  Partnership  exchanged  its 600,000  preferred
shares  of  Gliatech  for  120,000   shares  of  the  company's   common  stock.
Additionally,  in connection with the offering,  the  Partnership  exchanged its
warrant to purchase  100,000  shares of  preferred  stock of Gliatech  for 4,210
common shares of the company in a non-cash  transaction,  pursuant to a cashless
exercise provision in the warrant agreement.

On December 13, 1995, Synaptic Pharmaceutical  Corporation completed its initial
public offering.  In connection with the offering and a 1-for-2 reverse split of
the company's  common stock,  the  Partnership  exchanged its 432,870  shares of
Synaptic preferred stock for 96,395 shares of the company's common stock.

Competition

The  Partnership  encounters  competition  from other  entities  having  similar
investment  objectives.  Primary competition for venture capital investments has
been from venture  capital  partnerships,  venture  capital  affiliates of large
industrial  and financial  companies,  small business  investment  companies and
wealthy  individuals.  Competition has also been from foreign investors and from
large industrial and financial  companies investing directly rather than through
venture  capital  affiliates.  The Partnership has frequently been a co-investor
with other  professional  venture  capital groups and these  relationships  have
expanded the Partnership's access to investment opportunities.

Employees

The Partnership has no employees.  The Managing General Partner,  subject to the
supervision  of the  Independent  General  Partners,  manages and  controls  the
Partnership's   venture  capital  investments.   The  Managing  General  Partner
performs,  or arranges for others to perform,  the management and administrative
services  necessary for the operation of the  Partnership and is responsible for
managing the Partnership's short-term investments.

Item 2.       Properties.

The Partnership does not own or lease physical properties.

Item 3.       Legal Proceedings.

The Partnership is not a party to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security  holders during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year covered by this report.

                                     PART II

Item 5.   Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

There is no established public trading market for the Partnership's Units and it
is not  anticipated  that any  public  market for the Units  will  develop.  The
approximate  number of  individual  holders of Units at  December  31,  1995 was
4,000.

The Partnership did not make any cash distributions to Partners during the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.  Cumulative cash  distributions  paid to
Partners from inception through December 31, 1995 totaled $278,000;  $275,000 to
the  Limited  Partners,  or  approximately  $7.00  per Unit,  and  $3,000 to the
Managing General Partner.

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership,  as amended (the
"Partnership  Agreement"),  the  Partnership's net income and net realized gains
from all sources are allocated to all  Partners,  in proportion to their capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been allocated an amount equal to 6% per
annum, simple interest, on their total Adjusted Invested Capital; i.e., original
capital contributions reduced by previous distributions (the "Priority Return").
Thereafter,  net income and net realized gains from venture capital  investments
in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return are  allocated 20% to
the  Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in  proportion  to their
capital  contributions.  Any net income from non-venture  capital investments in
excess of the  amount  used to cover the  Priority  Return is  allocated  to all
Partners in  proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Realized  losses are
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions, provided
that,  if  realized  gains had been  previously  allocated  in the  80-20  ratio
discussed above, then losses are allocated in the reverse order in which profits
were allocated.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended  December  31, 1995,  the  Partnership  invested  $688,000
(including  venture  capital fees  totaling  $39,000) in two existing  portfolio
companies.  From its inception  through  December 31, 1995, the  Partnership had
invested an aggregate of $14.2  million in ten  portfolio  companies  (including
acquisition costs and venture capital fees totaling  $912,000).  At December 31,
1995,  the  Partnership  had invested  approximately  82% of its original  $17.3
million of net proceeds received from the offering of Units.

At December 31, 1995, the  Partnership  held $6.2 million in cash and short-term
investments;  $5.7 million in short-term securities with maturities of less than
three months and $528,000 in an interest-bearing  cash account. Such investments
provide the  Partnership  with the liquidity  necessary to make  investments  in
venture situations as opportunities for investment arise. The Partnership earned
interest totaling $375,000,  $288,000 and $276,000 from such investments for the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Interest earned from
short-term   investments  in  future  periods  is  subject  to  fluctuations  in
short-term  interest rates and changes in funds available for investment.  It is
anticipated that funds needed to cover the Partnership's  future investments and
operating expenses will be obtained from existing cash reserves, interest earned
from its short-term  investment portfolio and proceeds realized from the sale of
portfolio investments.

Results of Operations

Investment Income and Expenses - For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993,  the  Partnership  had a  net  investment  loss  (investment  income  less
operating expenses) of $63,000, $88,000 and $125,000, respectively.

The reduced net  investment  loss for 1995  compared to 1994 was the result of a
$99,000  increase in  investment  income,  primarily  resulting  from an $87,000
increase in interest earned from short-term  investments during 1995,  partially
offset by a $73,000  increase in  operating  expenses.  The increase in interest
earned from  short-term  investments was the result of an increase in short-term
interest  rates  during  1995 as  compared to 1994.  The  increase in  operating
expenses for 1995  compared to 1994  included a $58,000  increase in general and
administrative  expenses and a $27,000 increase in professional fees offset by a
$12,000   reduction  in  the  management   fee.  The  increase  in  general  and
administrative  expenses for 1995 compared to 1994  resulted from  directors and
officers liability insurance which was initiated in August 1994.

The reduced net  investment  loss for 1994  compared to 1993 was the result of a
$35,000 decrease in operating  expenses,  primarily  general and  administrative
expenses and professional  fees. Total operating expenses declined from $413,000
in 1993 to  $378,000  in 1994.  General  and  administrative  expenses  declined
$21,000 and  professional  fees declined $8,000 for 1994 compared to 1993 due to
certain cost control measures implemented by the Managing General Partner during
the fourth quarter of 1993.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner, the Managing General Partner is responsible for the management,
administrative  and  certain  investment  advisory  services  necessary  for the
operation of the  Partnership.  For such services,  the Managing General Partner
receives a management  fee at the annual rate of 2% of the lesser of (1) the net
assets of the Partnership or (2) the net contributed capital of the Partnership;
i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of selling commissions
and  organizational  expenses)  reduced  by  capital  distributed.  Such  fee is
determined and payable  quarterly.  For the years ended December 31, 1995,  1994
and 1993 the management fee was $260,000,  $272,000 and $279,000,  respectively.
The  decrease  in the  management  fee for the  respective  periods was due to a
decrease in the net assets of the Partnership  during each respective period. To
the extent  possible,  the management fee and other operating  expenses are paid
with funds provided from operations. Funds provided from operations are obtained
from interest received from short-term investments, interest and dividend income
from portfolio investments and proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments.

Realized  Gains and  Losses  from  Portfolio  Investments  - For the year  ended
December 31, 1995, the  Partnership  had a $91,000  realized loss from portfolio
investments  resulting  from the  write-off  of  acquisition  costs and  venture
capital fees relating to its investment in Hepatix, Inc.

There were no realized gains or losses from portfolio  investments  for the year
ended December, 1994.

For the year ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a  $111,000  net
realized gain from portfolio investments.  In October 1993, the Partnership sold
11,000 common shares of Immune Response, Inc. for $142,000,  realizing a gain of
$110,000.  These shares were received by the  Partnership in connection with the
settlement of a dispute  relating to a potential  investment in a privately-held
company.  The  Partnership  also  realized a nominal  gain from the receipt of a
liquidation  payment relating to its investment in Biotronic Systems Corporation
which had been written-off in 1992.

Unrealized   Gains  and  Losses  and  Changes  in  Unrealized   Appreciation  or
Depreciation of Portfolio Investments - For the year ended December 31, 1995 the
Partnership had an $800,000 net unrealized  loss from its portfolio  investments
resulting from a $1.5 million  downward  revaluation of Hepatix,  Inc. which was
partially  offset by a $712,000  net  upward  revaluation  of the  Partnership's
publicly-held   securities.   As  a  result,  net  unrealized   depreciation  of
investments increased by $800,000 for 1995.

For the year ended December 31, 1994, the  Partnership had a net unrealized loss
from its  portfolio  investments  of $198,000  resulting  from the net  downward
revaluation of its portfolio investments during 1994.

For the year  ended  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership  had a $1.3  million
unrealized loss resulting from the downward revaluation of its investment in IVF
America,  Inc. due to the reduced  public market price of the  company's  common
stock during 1993.

Net Assets - Changes in net assets  resulting  from  operations are comprised of
(i) net realized gain or loss from operations and (ii) changes in net unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of investments.

At  December  31,  1995,  the  Partnership's  net  assets  were  $12.2  million,
reflecting a decrease of $953,000 from $13.1 million at December 31, 1994.  This
decrease  resulted  from the $800,000 net  unrealized  loss and the $153,000 net
realized loss from operations for 1995.

At  December  31,  1994,  the  Partnership's  net  assets  were  $13.1  million,
reflecting a decrease of $286,000 from $13.4 million at December 31, 1993.  This
decrease  resulted  from the  $198,000 net  unrealized  loss and the $88,000 net
realized loss from operations for 1994.

At  December  31,  1993,  the  Partnership's  net  assets  were  $13.4  million,
reflecting a decrease of $1.3  million from $14.8  million at December 31, 1992.
This decrease resulted from the $1.3 million net unrealized loss and the $14,000
net realized loss from operations for 1993.

The net asset value per $500 Unit,  including an  allocation  of net  unrealized
depreciation of investments,  at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $312, $336
and $343,  respectively.  Such per Unit amounts are based on average allocations
to all Limited Partners and do not reflect specific Limited Partner allocations,
which are determined by the original closing date associated with the Units held
by each Limited Partner.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P.:

We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheets of WestMed Venture Partners 2,
L.P. (the "Partnership"),  including the schedules of portfolio investments,  as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related  statements of  operations,  cash
flows,  and  changes in  partners'  capital  for each of the three  years in the
period  ended   December  31,  1995.   These   financial   statements   are  the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 1995 and 1994 by correspondence
with the custodian;  where  confirmation  was not possible,  we performed  other
audit  procedures.  An audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by  management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  such  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects, the financial position of WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P. at December
31,  1995 and 1994,  and the results of its  operations,  its cash flows and the
changes in its partners' capital for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 2, the financial  statements  include  securities valued at
$6,050,203  and  $6,252,798  at  December  31,  1995  and  1994,   respectively,
representing  50% and 48% of net assets,  respectively,  whose  values have been
estimated   by  the  Managing   General   Partner  in  the  absence  of  readily
ascertainable  market  values.  We  have  reviewed  the  procedures  used by the
Managing General Partner in arriving at its estimate of value of such securities
and have  inspected  underlying  documentation,  and, in the  circumstances,  we
believe  the  procedures  are  reasonable  and  the  documentation  appropriate.
However,  because of the inherent  uncertainty  of  valuation,  those  estimated
values may differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material.

WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS 2, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     Organization and Purpose

WestMed Venture Partners 2, L.P. (the  "Partnership")  was formed under Delaware
law in April 1988. The Partnership  operates as a business  development  company
under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended.  The  Partnership  is a
closed-end partnership and accordingly its units of limited partnership interest
("Units") are not  redeemable by the  Partnership.  A total of 38,727 Units were
sold to limited  partners  ("Limited  Partners"  and together  with the Managing
General Partner (as hereinafter defined), the "Partners") at $500 per Unit.

The  general  partners  of  the  Partnership   include  three  individuals  (the
"Independent  General  Partners")  and the  managing  general  partner,  WestMed
Venture  Management  2, L.P.,  a Delaware  limited  partnership  (the  "Managing
General Partner" and collectively  with the Independent  General  Partners,  the
"General  Partners").  The general  partner of the Managing  General  Partner is
Medical  Venture  Holdings,   Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation   affiliated  with
Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.  ("Opco").  The limited partners of the Managing General
Partner are  Oppenheimer  Holdings,  Inc.,  MVP Holdings,  Inc. and BSW, Inc., a
Delaware corporation owned by John A. Balkoski, Philippe L. Sommer and Howard S.
Wachtler.  Messrs. Sommer and Wachtler are principally  responsible for managing
the investments of the Partnership.

Opco, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange,  the National Association of
Securities Dealers,  Inc., and all principal United States securities exchanges,
is a diversified investment banking and securities firm, a registered investment
advisor and Futures  Commission  Merchant providing a broad range of services to
individual,  corporate, and institutional clients. Opco operates in the capacity
of broker and dealer for its  customers,  as well as trader for its own account.
The services provided by Opco and its subsidiaries,  and the activities in which
it is engaged,  include  securities  brokerage,  securities  research,  customer
financing,  securities  trading,  corporate  finance,  mergers and acquisitions,
underwriting and investment advisory services.

The Partnership's  objective is to achieve  long-term capital  appreciation from
its portfolio of venture capital investments, consisting of companies engaged in
the health care industry.  The Partnership is scheduled to terminate on December
31,  1998.  However,  the  General  Partners  can  extend the term for up to two
additional  two-year periods,  if they determine that such extensions are in the
best interest of the Partnership.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Valuation of  Investments - Portfolio  investments  are carried at fair value as
determined  quarterly by the Managing  General  Partner under the supervision of
the Independent  General  Partners.  The fair value of  publicly-held  portfolio
securities is adjusted to the average  closing  public market price for the last
five

<PAGE>


WESTMED VENTURE PARTNERS 2, L.P.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


trading  days  of  each  quarter  discounted  for  sales  restrictions.  Factors
considered in the determination of an appropriate discount include,  underwriter
lock-up or Rule 144 trading  restrictions,  insider status where the Partnership
either has a  representative  serving on the board of directors of the portfolio
company under  consideration  or is greater than a 5% shareholder  thereof,  and
other  liquidity  factors  such as the size of the  Partnership's  position in a
given  company   compared  to  the  trading  history  of  the  public  security.
Privately-held  portfolio  securities  are  carried  at cost  until  significant
developments  affecting  the  portfolio  company  provide a basis for  change in
valuation.  The fair  value of private  securities  is  adjusted  (i) to reflect
meaningful  third-party  transactions  in the private market and (ii) to reflect
significant  progress or slippage in the  development of the company's  business
such that cost is no  longer  reflective  of fair  value.  As a venture  capital
investment fund, the Partnership's  portfolio  investments involve a high degree
of  business  and  financial  risk that can result in  substantial  losses.  The
Managing  General Partner  considers such risks in determining the fair value of
the Partnership's portfolio investments.

Use of Estimates - The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Investment  Transactions - Investment  transactions  are recorded on the accrual
method. For portfolio  investments,  transactions are recorded on the date which
the Partnership obtains an enforceable right to demand the securities or payment
thereof.  Realized  gains  and  losses on  investments  sold are  computed  on a
specific identification basis.

Statements  of  Cash  Flows  - Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  short-term
interest-bearing   investments  in  commercial  paper  and  other  money  market
investments.  The Partnership  considers its interest-bearing cash account to be
cash equivalents.

Income Taxes - No provision  for income taxes has been made since all income and
losses are  allocable  to the partners for  inclusion  in their  respective  tax
returns.  The Partnership's net assets for financial  reporting  purposes differ
from its net  assets  for tax  purposes.  Net  unrealized  depreciation  of $2.9
million at  December  31,  1995,  which was  recorded  for  financial  statement
purposes, was not recognized for tax purposes.  Additionally,  from inception to
December 31, 1995,  other timing  differences  totaling $2.3 million,  primarily
relating  to  original  sales  commissions  paid and other  costs of selling the
Units, have been recorded on the Partnership's financial statements but have not
yet been deducted for tax purposes.

Reclassifications  -  Certain  reclassifications  were made to the 1994 and 1993
financial statements in order to conform with the current period presentation.

3.     Allocations of Partnership Profits and Losses

Pursuant to the Partnership's agreement of limited partnership,  as amended (the
"Partnership  Agreement"),  the  Partnership's net income and net realized gains
from all sources are allocated to all  Partners,  in proportion to their capital
contributions,  until all Partners have been  allocated an amount (the "Priority
Return")  equal  to 6% per  annum,  simple  interest,  on their  total  Adjusted
Invested  Capital;  i.e.,  original  capital  contributions  reduced by previous
distributions.  Thereafter,  net income  and net  realized  gains  from  venture
capital  investments  in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority  Return
are  allocated  20% to the Managing  General  Partner and 80% to all Partners in
proportion  to their  capital  contributions.  Any net income  from  non-venture
capital investments in excess of the amount used to cover the Priority Return is
allocated to all Partners in proportion to their capital contributions. Realized
losses  are   allocated  to  all  Partners  in   proportion   to  their  capital
contributions.  However, if realized gains had been previously  allocated in the
80-20 ratio,  then losses are  allocated in the reverse  order in which  profits
were  allocated.  From its inception to December 31, 1995, the Partnership had a
$2.8 million net loss from its venture capital  investments,  including $248,000
of cumulative interest and other income from portfolio investments.

4.     Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,  the Managing General Partner is entitled
to receive a one-time venture capital fee equal to 5% of the gross proceeds from
the sale of Units. Such fee is incurred as portfolio investments are made in the
proportion of the cost of each portfolio investment to the net proceeds from the
sale of Units. Venture capital fees incurred are recorded as a cost of acquiring
the portfolio  investments.  The  Partnership  incurred  venture capital fees of
$39,000,  $79,000 and $59,000 for the years ended  December 31,  1995,  1994 and
1993,  respectively.  Cumulative venture capital fees incurred from inception to
December 31, 1995 totaled $813,000.

Pursuant to a  management  agreement  between the  Partnership  and the Managing
General Partner,  the Managing General Partner performs,  or arranges for others
to perform,  the  management,  administrative  and certain  investment  advisory
services necessary for the operation of the Partnership.  For such services, the
Managing  General Partner  receives a management fee at the annual rate of 2% of
the lesser of the net assets of the Partnership or the net  contributed  capital
of the Partnership; i.e., gross capital contributions to the Partnership (net of
selling commissions and organizational expenses) reduced by capital distributed.
Such fee is determined and payable quarterly.

For services rendered to the Partnership,  each of the three Independent General
Partners  receives a $5,000 annual fee and  reimbursement  for all out-of-pocket
expenses relating to attendance at meetings of the General Partners.

The Independent  General Partners have full authority over the management of the
Partnership  and provide overall  guidance and  supervision  with respect to the
operations  of the  Partnership  and perform the various  duties  imposed on the

custody  arrangement  with respect to  portfolio  securities,  the  selection of
accountants,  fidelity  bonding  and  the  activities  of the  Managing  General
Partner. As required by the 1940 Act, a majority of the general partners must be
individuals  who are not  "interested  persons" of the Partnership as defined in

exemptive  order  declaring that Messrs.  Elliott,  Taylor and White,  the three
Independent General Partners of the Partnership, are not "interested persons" of
the  Partnership  as  defined  in the 1940 Act  solely by reason of their  being
general  partners of the  Partnership.  Such individuals also comprise the Audit

Partner was allocated  $10,000,  $3,000,  and $13,000 of the  Partnership's  net
