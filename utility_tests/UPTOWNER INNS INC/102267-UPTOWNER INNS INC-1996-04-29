<PAGE>
                                     PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS.  

        (a)  The registrant, Uptowner Inns, Inc., is a corporation that
was incorporated in the State of West Virginia on July 1, 1961.  The
registrant owns and operates a motor hotel with a Holiday Inns
Franchise that consists of dining, banquet, and lounge facilities, and
also operates three apartment buildings, rental properties all located
in the City for Huntington, West Virginia.  

        The main physical property of Uptowner Inn of Parkersburg,
Inc., had a swimming pool, dining and banquet facilities, and two
parcels, owned in fee by such subsidiary, located in downtown
Parkersburg, West Virginia at 415 Seventh Street.  The Hotel was
closed on June 30, 1987.  On August 31, 1994, the property was sold
for $750,000.  

        A wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, Motel and
Restaurant Supply, which was incorporated in the State of West
Virginia on July 16, 1966, has had no activity since 1981.  

        Neither the registrant nor any of its subsidiaries has
experienced bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings; has been
involved in reclassification, merger or consolidation; has acquired or,
except as hereinafter set forth, disposed of any material amount of
assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business; or has
undertaken any material change in the mode of conducting its
business.  


        (b)  The registrant is engaged in substantially one line of
business, to-wit, the operation of motor hotels and related facilities. 



        (c)  The registrant is engaged in substantially one line of
business, to wit, the operation of motor hotels with dining and
banquet facilities, and residential/commercial rentals.  The income of
the registrant from rentals represents less than ten percent of the
consolidated revenue of the registrant and its subsidiaries, which
consolidated revenue did not exceed $50,000,000. during any of the
last three fiscal years.  

        The hotel industry is highly competitive with the registrant
competing against numerous national hotel franchises in Huntington,
West Virginia.  As the Companies' operations are generally one
business segment, its competition locally includes Radisson hotel,
Ramada Inn, Holiday Inn, Comfort Inn, and Red Roof Inn.  

        Seasonality directly affects this business as a result of
people not traveling or vacationing in large numbers in the late fall
and winter because of poor weather at these geographical locations. 

        At June 30, 1995, the registrant and its subsidiaries employ
approximately 57 employees.  


        (d)  The registrant has no foreign operation.

West Virginia, acquired for rental and for future development,
subject to a mortgage in favor of Betty M. Dove, in the original

west side of Huntington approximately 3 miles from the main motor
hotel and at an exit for Interstate 64.  This purchase was finalized
in October 1988 from an option entered into in 1983.  The property is
to be operated as a rental property until it is deemed beneficial to
build and operate a decent motel in that location.  


        (m)  The registrant purchased a parcel of real estate with a
residential building in January 1990.  This property is across an
alley from the main motor hotel and was acquired for future
development and parking.  


        (n)  The registrant purchased a parcel of real estate with a
building housing residential and commercial tenants in July 1991. 
This property is across the street from its main motor hotel and
adjacent to other rental properties and parking facilities.  The
property has been renovated and is now fully utilized as rental
property.  The property is subject to a mortgage in favor of West
Virginia Housing Development Fund in the original amount of $500,000.,
5.5% rate of interest, maturing November 2018, the balance of which

accident by a patron of the lounge.  Legal counsel believes that good
defenses exist in this action, and that the case will ultimately be
resolved in Uptowner Inns, Inc.'s favor.  The insurance company has
denied liability in this case and legal counsel believes the risk of
loss will fall to Uptowner Inns, Inc.

      Improvements in the local economy has resulted in an increase in
Motor Inn Revenue and, in turn, the Food and Beverage revenue increases
as well.  The Rents have increased due to the completion and rental of
the Huntington East apartments and commercial facility in the previous
fiscal year and generating revenues all through the last year.

      Costs and expenses have been maintained at approximately the same
levels due to management efforts to keep costs under control.  An
exception is interest, which is due to the general increase of interest
rates during the past year and the mortgage on the Huntington East
project having a full year of interest payments in 1995.  The large
decrease in repairs and maintenance is due to the greater work done in
1994 and the management decision to postpone some maintenance pending the
inspection by Holiday Inn and their requirements for major changes to
maintain the Holiday Inn franchise.

      There is no tax benefit for the fiscal years 1994 and 1993 due to
the loss and the lack of any taxable income to apply this against.  For
the year ended June 30, 1995, the Company utilized operating loss
carryforwards in the amount of $485,679. to offset taxable income.  The
Company has a carryforward loss for taxable income until the year 2008. 




INCOME (LOSS)

                                     1995           1994           1993

      The sale of the Parkersburg property in August 1994, with the gain
of $306,930., had an obvious impact on income, but the increase in
revenues of $203,611. and the decrease of expenses of $65,105. resulted
in a significant change in Income From Operations from a loss of $81,046.
in 1994 to an increase of $187,670. in 1995.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


                                          1995           1994   

Resources available at 
      June 30, 1995 and 1994

   Cash                            $   298,380.    $   119,199.
   Investments                         576,470.           -



      Because of resources available to the Company and its current
financial condition and structure, it is management's opinion that,
barring a severe decline in the nation's economy, there will be financial
improvement in the future reporting periods.  

      Due to the property sale and significant improvement of income from
operations, the liquidity is the strongest the Company has ever
experienced.  It is anticipated that the next year will provide
opportunity to improve the liquidity further, subject to the final costs
that may be incurred to update the motor hotel property to retain the
Holiday Inn Franchise.  The improvement would be as a result of the
operating activities continuing to generate a good cash flow and the
costs of major improvements not causing declines.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT





Board of Directors  
Uptowner Inns, Inc. and Subsidiaries  
Huntington, West Virginia  



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Uptowner Inns, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for the year then ended.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Uptowner Inns, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June
30, 1995, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1.	Summary of significant accounting policies:  

	A.	Principles of consolidation:  

    	        The consolidated financial statements include the
        accounts of Uptowner Inns, Inc. and all of its Subsidiaries
        after elimination of all material intercompany balances and
        transactions.  


	B.	Dominant Industry:  

    	        The Company and its Subsidiaries operate motor inns in
        West Virginia which constitute the majority of operations of
        the Company.  Information about revenues, profitability, and
        identifiable assets of these domestic operations is presented
        in the basic financial statements.  


	C.	Inventories:  

    	        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on
        the first-in, first-out method.


	D.	Property, plant and equipment:  

    	        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost with
        depreciation being provided on the straight-line method over
        the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:  

      		Buildings and improvements                10 - 40 years 	
 	      Furniture and equipment                    2 - 10 years 

    	        Repairs, maintenance and renewals are charged to
        operations as incurred, and expenditures for significant
        betterments and renewals are capitalized.  

    	        The cost of fixed assets retired or sold, together with
        the related accumulated depreciation, are removed from the
        accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in net
        earnings.

1.	Summary of significant accounting policies (Cont'd):  

    E.  Investments:  

    	        The Company's investments in debt securities, which
        typically mature in one year or less, are held to maturity and
        valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  

   	F. 	Income taxes:  

    	        The income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the
        transactions reported in the financial statements and consist
        of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily
        to different methods of depreciation for book and tax
        purposes and net operating loss carryovers.  The deferred tax
        assets and liabilities represent the future tax return
        consequences of those differences, which will either be
        taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are
        recovered or settled.  


   	G. 	Per share computations:  

    	        Income per share computations are based on the weighted
        average number of common shares outstanding during the year. 
        The average number of shares outstanding was 1,583,563 for
        1995, 1994 and 1993.  


   	H.  Cash and cash equivalents:  

    	        For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash
        equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and
        all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of
        three months or less, of which the Company had none.  



2.	Disposal of subsidiary:  

     		On August 31, 1994, the Company sold all of the assets of
    Uptowner Inns of Parkersburg, its wholly owned subsidiary for
    cash of $750,000.  The transaction resulted in a gain of
    $306,930., which has been included in operations in the year
    ended June 30, 1995.
