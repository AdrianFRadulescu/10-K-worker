                 Report of Independent Public Accountants



To the Stockholders of VSE Corporation:

    We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements included in VSE Corporation's annual 
report to stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and have 
issued our report thereon dated March 1, 1996.  Our audits were made for the 
purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The 
schedule listed in the index is the responsibility of the company's management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial 
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audits of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in
our opinion, fairly states, in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

Report from the Chairman and CEO

The company put on seven-league boots in 1995.  During the year we reported a
landmark contract award, aggressive acquisitions, important additions to our
technology, and most importantly, the excitement we feel as new employees,
managers, and directors join the VSE team.  In this report I want to share with
you some of our accomplishments in 1995 and our vision and strategies for
continued growth in the years ahead.

The BAV Contract

VSE has been an important player in America's defense community since 1959, and
we are determined to build on our reputation and strengths as a dependable and
innovative contractor.  Several years ago we identified a potential Navy program
which could help meet the Navy's need to realize cost savings in the engineer-
ing, overhaul, maintenance, training, and logistic support associated with the
transfer of Navy ships to foreign governments.  Through the privatization of 
this effort, the Navy could complete the drawdown of its active and reserve 
ship inventory from the  six hundred ship  Navy previously required to the 
restated requirements of the post Cold War era.

Putting together a world-class team of subcontractors with the resources, 
skills, and global presence required to execute the contract (see inside cover),
VSE's BAV Division submitted a proposal which was judged by the Navy to be 
technically superior to eight other competing proposals.  Award of a cost plus 
award fee contract was made to BAV in August 1995.  The award was protested by 
two of the other competitors, and in late January 1996 the General Accounting 
Office (GAO) denied the protests, upholding the Navy's selection of BAV.  The 
contract, including option periods which may be exercised by the Navy, provides
for a ten-year effort.  Revenues under the contract will depend on the number 
and size of the  delivery orders  for ships and services which may be ordered by
foreign governments.  The Navy has estimated that up to $1 billion, and possibly
more, may be ordered under the contract during the ten-year period.

The Navy's ship transfer program is good for America.  It means challenging work
for American engineers and naval architects, technicians, suppliers and 
shipyards from Virginia to Oregon and New York to Louisiana, and many other 
states.  The program will be substantially funded by foreign governments, and 
the additional capability gained by our allies as we transfer destroyers, 
frigates, and auxiliary ships to them will reduce the burden on our country in 
meeting mutual defense needs around the globe.

Work under the contract will be managed by BAV from VSE's headquarters facility
in Alexandria, Virginia.  During the initial years of the contract, we expect
that the bulk of the work will be performed in U. S. shipyards by BAV's teaming
partners.  Because it is a  delivery order  contract, we are unable to predict
the amount of work which will be ordered each year.  While there are no
assurances, our initial preparations are targeted towards revenues, principally
subcontract revenues, of between $100 and $200 million a year.  In terms of
earnings, we do not expect the BAV work to be as profitable as some of our other
contract operations.  For example, we anticipate a substantial amount of
nonbillable interest expense associated with financing large subcontracts. 
Notwithstanding the lower margins, the contract is expected to provide a
substantial base for developing other business opportunities.  Significant
revenues under the contract are not expected to be recorded until later in 1996.

Report from the Chairman and CEO

The BAV contract represents the kind of opportunity for growth which VSE will
continue to pursue in the years ahead.  There are a number of other privatiza-
tion programs which may develop in the defense establishment.  We have 
identified some of these programs, and we are excited about our prospects.  The 
BAV contract has increased our profile and reputation, and we hope to build 
rapidly on this success.

Other Business Developments

In previous years we outlined the key components of our strategy following the
completion of the spin-off of our non-engineering subsidiaries in 1992.  As the
government downsizes its budget for new procurements, we streamlined our
operations and targeted high profile defense opportunities such as ensuring
logistics support for Navy aircraft, engineering support for Army wheeled and
tracked vehicles, military readiness programs centered on technology insertion,
product improvement, service life extension, prototype development, and
information technology, and the growth of our non-defense business.

One of our largest program efforts in 1995, with option periods through 1999, is
providing logistics support for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the 
F/A-18 (Hornet), F-14 (Tomcat), A-6 (Intruder), AV-8B (Harrier), V-22 (Osprey), 
and a number of military helicopters, missiles, and cruise missiles.  Our tech-
nical logistics support extends to data management and documentation; cost, 
readiness, and supportability analyses; logistics plans; and systems engineer-
ing and configuration management.  We enjoyed significant growth in this 
program in 1995, and we anticipate further growth in 1996.

For Army clients, we continue to provide a broad range of engineering services. 
One high profile program is the effort of VSE engineers to develop an improved
combat bridging vehicle design to assist in the rapid deployment of bridge
sections like those being used by the Army on the rivers in Bosnia.  Another
important program is providing systems technical support services for a variety
of military vehicles and trailers.  Among the improvements recently developed 
are vehicle fire detection and suppression systems to improve the safety of 
military vehicles for U. S. combat personnel.  Other efforts are directed to 
incorporating advanced technology in such areas as tires, tire inflation, 
lubrication, engine cooling, exhaust systems, anti-lock brakes, LED lights, 
collision avoidance, and other improvements to enhance the safety and extend 
the life-cycle of vehicle systems. 

The use and development of information technology to solve client problems is 
an integral part of VSE's service approach.  Since acquiring CMstat Corporation 
in May 1995, CMstat has doubled its revenues, nearly doubled its staff, and 
recorded important sales to major corporations in a number of key industries in-
cluding aerospace, electronics, defense, and telecommunications.  CMstat is a 
leading developer of cross-platform configuration management and product data 
management (CM/PDM) software.

VSE's growth in non-defense government agencies accelerated rapidly in 1995. 
With the acquisition of Energetics Incorporated in August 1995, VSE allied 
itself with one of the premiere companies supporting technology research, 
development, and demonstration programs, principally for the Department of 
Energy and other clients.  Energy conservation and efficiency, advanced tech-
nology transfer, and feasibility, assessment, and development programs affecting
industrial, transportation, and building concerns of the present and future are 
a few of the

Our engineering support services contract for the U. S. Postal Service continued
in 1995 under a new, five-year competitive contract.  Under effective manage-
ment, and supported by contractor efforts such as those provided by VSE at the
Engineering Center in Merrifield, Virginia, the Postal Service reported a 
surplus in 1995.  We believe that VSE's record during the last twenty years in 
performing engineering and support service tasks for the Postal Service will 
assist us in expanding our business in 1996 with this important client.

Upgrading our technical capabilities is a strategic goal in VSE.  We performed
work in a number of new areas in 1995 which we hope will translate into 
contracts in the years ahead.  Some of the new areas include sensor systems, 
facial recognition and imaging software, fastener classification and testing 
systems, automated data collection, antenna assembly transport systems, and 
battlefield power management products. 

Our goal as always in everything we do is to provide clients with engineering
solutions that work better and cost less.   This is our promise, and this is 
the challenge met everyday by the employees who comprise the VSE Team.

Business Strategy

Based on the success obtained during the past three years, the Board of 
Directors reviewed its strategic guidance to management.  Stated very simply, 
the Board determined that the company was on the right track to achieve growth 
and an increase in shareholder value.  

The principal aim of our business is and remains to provide engineering 
solutions and other support services and products, primarily to the federal 
government, to maintain and modernize equipment and systems.  Where our 
experience and qualifications permit, we also provide these services in 
related industries, such as the health care industry, and to commercial, state 
and local government customers. 

The Board directed us to pursue revenue growth by increasing our existing
business base and by accelerating our search for well-managed acquisition
candidates.  With the award of the BAV contract and the successful acquisitions
of CMstat and Energetics in 1995, we believe this approach has the best 
potential to achieve future growth and income.

The defense industry and the government market continue to experience 
significant downsizing and consolidation.  However, the market remains very 
large with substantial opportunities for growth.  In recent years, government 
agencies have begun to emphasize corporate experience and  best value  in 
determining contract awards in addition to low price criteria.  VSE and its 
subsidiaries and divisions are well positioned to compete in this environment.  

At the same time, making superior acquisitions is a prerequisite for growth
because smaller government budgets and larger, more cost-effective  omnibus 
contracts intensify the competition.  Given the competition, it is not likely
that any one company can present the required depth of corporate experience
necessary to win the large number of contracts necessary to grow at a sustained

<PAGE>

Report from the Chairman and CEO

rate.  Large  teaming agreements  (such as that proposed by VSE in winning the 
BAV contract), joint ventures, and strategic acquisitions will be necessary to
achieve a sustained rate of revenue growth.

Substantial per share earnings and share price appreciation are important 
company and management goals.  To achieve these goals, VSE is committed to (a) 
providing customers with quality services and products, and (b) observing all 
legal, ethical, industry, and regulatory standards in everything we do.  We 
believe there is no other way to increase shareholder value.

In February 1996 VSE divested its wholly owned subsidiary Schmoldt Engineering
Services Company of Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  Schmoldt recorded a pretax loss in
1995, and it did not fit well into our current or prospective business lines and
expectations for growth, income, and increased shareholder value.

The VSE Team

On December 31, 1995, Harold P. Weinberg retired from the Board of Directors,
having devoted more than 34 years of service to VSE.    Also in 1995, Jack Z.
Moore, Vice President, retired after more than 30 years of service, and in early
1996, Edwin Barrineau, Senior Vice President, retired after 13 years of service.
William J. Nelson, Vice President, was advanced to relieve Ed Barrineau as
general manager of our systems engineering center operations.  My thanks to each
of these dedicated managers and to all other VSE service employees who retired
during the year.  

We are very pleased to report that Admiral Robert J. Kelly, USN, (Ret.) joined
VSE's Board of Directors as of January 1, 1996.  Admiral Kelly, formerly
Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, brings a wealth of experience and
judgment to VSE that will materially assist us in sharpening our performance and
expanding our horizons for the future.  We are also delighted to welcome all the
other men and women of talent and experience who joined VSE's service team in
1995, including Major General Thomas L. Prather, Jr., USA (Ret.), formerly 
Deputy Chief of Staff for Research, Development and Engineering, Army Materiel 
Command. 

Continuing the precedent established last year, at the end of the Annual Report
you will find the names of the VSE team members who served our customers at
year-end.  They are the people who make VSE the exciting growth company it has
become, and we are happy to have the opportunity to recognize them.

As always, we welcome the support and interest of VSE's shareholders, and we 
look forward to meeting you at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders or at one of 
our offices.  This is your company.  Your considered questions, comments, and
suggestions are always appreciated.

Description of Business 

    General.  During 1995 VSE Corporation ("VSE" or the "company") and its
subsidiaries and divisions operated in a single industry, the professional and
technical services industry.  

    Introduction.  The company's engineering, technical, and management services
operations are performed by VSE and its subsidiaries and divisions including 
the BAV Division, CMstat Corporation,  Energetics Incorporated, Human Resource
Systems, Inc., Schmoldt Engineering Services Company, Value Systems Services, 
and VSE Services Corporation.  Engineering, technical, and management services
accounted for 100% of VSE's revenues from continuing operations in 1995, 1994,
and 1993.

    Services, Facilities, Personnel, and Contracts.  VSE was established in 
1959.  For the past 37 years, the company has provided diversified engineering,
technical, and management services, principally to agencies of the United States
Government (the "government") and to government prime contractors.  VSE provides
engineering, information technology, technical support, and management services
to assist customers in their efforts to reduce the cost and improve the
reliability and maintainability of various equipment and systems.  

    VSE services include program planning; design and engineering, including
prototype development; electronic warfare support; logistics management; ship
reactivation, maintenance, repair, overhaul planning, and follow on technical
support; office automation systems and support; training; technology research,
development, and demonstration programs involving energy conservation and
efficiency, advanced technology transfers, and feasibility, assessment, and
development programs; and information systems and products, including cross-
platform technical data, product data, and configuration management (CM/PDM)
support.  Typical projects include sustaining engineering support for military
vehicles, combat trailers, bridging systems, and amphibious transport; ocean
engineering and mooring systems; depot repair operations; electronic warfare
software development; machinery condition analysis; specification preparation 
for ship alterations and repairs; training and video aids for air-launched 
missiles; and technical data package preparation.

    VSE's principal offices are located in a five-story building in Alexandria,
Virginia, leased by VSE through the year 2003, cancelable as of 1998.  This
building contains approximately 108,000 square feet of engineering, shop, and
administrative space.  In addition, engineering services customers are also
served from more than 20 branch offices located at or near customer sites to
facilitate communications and enhance project performance.  The branch offices
are generally occupied under short-term leases and include an aggregate of
approximately 160,000 square feet of office, shop, and warehouse space.

    VSE also owns and operates an engineering test center in Ladysmith, 
Virginia, consisting of approximately 44 acres of land and an improved storage 
and vehicle maintenance facility.  This facility has been used by VSE to test 
military and commercial equipment for which VSE provides system technical 
support and other engineering services and to supplement the Alexandria, 
Virginia, shop requirements.

    VSE services are provided by a staff of approximately 1,200 employees
(including about 285 part-time employees).  These employees are professional 
and technical personnel having high levels of education, training, and skills,
including (a) mechanical, electrical, electronic, chemical, industrial, energy
and environmental services, marine, and ocean engineers, (b) computer systems,
applications, and data management specialists, (c) technical editors and 
writers, and (d) graphic designers and technicians.  The expertise required by 
VSE's customers also frequently includes knowledge of government administrative

Description of Business

procedures.  Many VSE employees have had experience as government employees in
the past.  The company considers its relationships with employees to be
excellent.

    VSE seeks to provide its customers with competitive, cost effective 
solutions to specific problems.  These problems generally require a detailed 
technical knowledge of materials, processes, functional characteristics, 
information systems, technology and products, and an in-depth understanding of 
the basic requirements for effective systems and equipment. Billing for 
services is generally accomplished by billing customers for a specified level-
of-effort incurred in performing a project or providing a service or for 
installed products, systems, and maintenance charges.

    During 1995, VSE provided services to the government under approximately 
120 contracts, some of which are of an indefinite quantity/ordering nature.  
These contracts permit the contracting agency to issue delivery orders or task 
orders in an expeditious manner to satisfy relatively short-term requirements 
for engineering and technical services.  The services ordered pursuant to 
indefinite quantity/ordering arrangements are normally performed and completed 
within a one year period.  During 1995 VSE provided services under approximately
525 such task orders.

    The following table shows the revenues of VSE, its subsidiaries and 
divisions by customer or agency:

</TABLE>

    During 1995 VSE's 15 largest contracts accounted for approximately 80% of
total revenues, and one such contract with the U. S. Navy accounted for more 
than 13% of such revenues.  This contract included a base year and option 
periods which expired in June 1995.  See "Results of Operations-Revenues" in 
"Management Discussion and Analysis"  for a discussion of this contract.

    The company's services are typically provided under cost-plus-fee,
time-and-materials, or fixed-price contracts. Under cost-plus-fee contracts, 
the customer reimburses VSE for its allowable costs permitted by regulations 
and pays a fee based on negotiated terms.  Under time-and-materials contracts, 
the customer pays VSE at fixed hourly rates for direct labor costs and the 
related overhead and profit, and reimburses VSE for the cost of materials with-
out profit.  Under fixed-price contracts, the customer pays an agreed price for 
services or products.  Under fixed-price contracts and time-and-materials 
contracts, VSE bears the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce its 
profit or cause it to sustain a loss.  To the extent VSE incurs actual costs 
below anticipated costs on these contracts, VSE realizes greater profit 
margins.

    Marketing, Backlog, Competition and Risks.  VSE marketing activities are
conducted by its professional staff of engineers, analysts, program managers,
contract administrators, and other personnel.  Information concerning new
programs and requirements becomes available in the course of contract perform-

ance, through formal and informal briefings, from participation in professional
organizations, and from literature published by the Government, trade
associations, professional organizations, and commercial entities.

    As of December 31, 1995, VSE had proposals pending for engineering services
contracts covering approximately $224 million in  services for the Department of
Defense or other government agencies or prime contractors.  If these contracts
are awarded to VSE, resulting ordering periods could extend through 2001. 
However, there is no assurance that VSE will be the successful bidder for any 
of these contracts.  Moreover, there can be no assurance that contract awards, 
if any, will result in any revenues to VSE because (a) contract awards are 
often rescinded as a result of the government's bid protest procedures, 
(b) contracts may not be funded at the nominal amounts cited in competitive bid 
announcements, and (c) contracts when funded may be terminated at the 
convenience of the government.

    During 1995 and 1994 VSE was awarded contracts having potential ceiling
values of approximately $1.1 billion and $330 million, respectively.  

    VSE's funded backlog of work as of December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 was
approximately $37.6 million, $36.9 million and $33.8 million, respectively.
"Funded" backlog is defined as orders for services that have not been fully 
rendered and for which funding has been provided either at the time of award or
thereafter. Substantially all of the  funded  backlog is expected to be 
completed within one year.

    The excess of unfulfilled contract estimates over the incremental funding
authorized represents an "unfunded" backlog.  Based on the total estimated 
value of contracts actually awarded, the potential revenues for work remaining 
to be performed under existing engineering services contracts (both funded and 
unfunded backlog) was approximately $1.3 billion, $350 million, and $113 
million, as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  VSE has no 
reasonable basis on which to determine when or if such backlog may be funded.  
However, because of uncertainties associated with changing program require-
ments and the ultimate availability of funds, VSE believes that measurements 
of unfunded backlog are of limited use in evaluating its future workload.

    The services business in which VSE is engaged is very competitive.  There 
area substantial number of other organizations, some of which are large, 
diversified firms with greater financial resources and larger technical staffs, 
which are capable of rendering essentially the same services as those offered 
by VSE.  Such companies may be publicly owned or privately held and may be 
divisions of much larger organizations including large manufacturing 
corporations.  The government's own "in-house" capabilities are also, in effect,
competitors of VSE (including the government's own non-profit federally funded 
research and development centers) because government employees often perform 
many of the services that might otherwise be performed by VSE.

    Government agencies have placed an increased emphasis on awarding contracts
of the types performed by VSE on a competitive basis as opposed to a non-
competitive basis.  All significant contracts currently being performed by VSE 
were either initially awarded on a competitive basis or have been renewed at 
least once on a competitive basis.  In addition, the United States defense 
budget has been restrained by the federal budget deficit in recent years.  As a 
result, there is increased competition for the remaining government work.  

    It is not possible to predict the extent of competition which VSE will
encounter as a result of changing economic or competitive conditions, customer
requirements, or technological developments.  VSE believes the principal com-

<PAGE>


Description of Business

petitive factors for the engineering services business in which VSE is engaged
are technical and financial qualifications, quality of services and products, 
and price.

    VSE's business with the government is subject to the risk that one or more
of its potential contracts or extensions of existing contracts may be awarded 
by the contracting agency to a competitor, including "small and disadvantaged" 
or minority-owned businesses pursuant to "set-aside" programs administered by 
the Small Business Administration or may be "bundled" into omnibus contracts 
for very large businesses.  In addition, VSE's business is subject to funding 
delays, extensions, and moratoriums caused by political and administrative 
disagreements such as occurred during the 1995 U.S. budget negotiations.  To 
date, the effect of such negotiations and disagreements on VSE has not been 
material; however, no assurances can be given about such risks with respect to 
future years. 

    Government contracts are subject to termination at the government's conve-
nience, which means that the government may terminate the contract at any time,
without cause.  However, during VSE's 37-year history the aggregate amount of
such government terminations for convenience has not been material.  If a
government contract is terminated for convenience, generally VSE is reimbursed
for its allowable costs to the date of termination and is paid a proportionate
amount of the stipulated profit or fee for the work actually performed.

    The books and records of the company are subject to audit by the Defense 
Contract Audit Agency, which audits can result in adjustments to contract costs 
and fees.  Audits by such agency have been completed for all years through 1992
without material adjustments.  However, there is no assurance that future 
adjustments will not be required.

    Depending on solicitation requirements and other factors, VSE offers its
professional and technical services and products through various competitive
contract arrangements and business units which are responsive to customer
requirements and which may also provide an opportunity for diversification. 
Such arrangements include prime contracts, subcontracts, cooperative arrange-
ments, joint ventures, dedicated ventures, dedicated cost centers, separate 
profit centers (divisions), and subsidiaries. 

    In 1991 VSE formed the Value Systems Services ("VSS") division to join with
a prime contractor on a bid for a U. S. Marine Corps contract.  Services under
the subcontract commenced in January 1992.  The subcontract generated revenues
to VSS of approximately $4 million in 1994 and $11 million in 1993 equal to 
about 10% of VSE's total business volume over these two years.  In April 1994, 
work on this contract ceased.

    In 1991 VSE also formed VSE Services Corporation ("VSES") as a subsidiary 
to compete for certain contracts, including security systems work and other
commercial opportunities.  VSES has been inactive since 1992.  

    In 1994 VSS was awarded a new contract with a different Navy customer to
provide logistic support services for Naval aircraft, helicopters, and airborne
weapons systems.  This contract has the potential to generate revenues to VSE 
of about $77 million over a five-year period ending in 1999.

    VSE has sought to expand its engineering services customer base to
non-defense clients, such as the U. S. Postal Service.  In 1994, VSE won a
recompete of a contract worth approximately $30 million for five years with the
U. S. Postal Service. 

<PAGE>


Description of Business

    VSE's subsidiary, Human Resource Systems, Inc. ("HRSI") provides health care
staffing personnel such as nurses, pharmacists, and technicians, primarily to 
the U. S. Navy.  HRSI has approximately 70 employees.  HRSI has been awarded
additional contracts from the U. S. Postal Service for real estate and
environmental consulting.  

    In 1995 VSE made two acquisitions to expand and diversify its business base.
In May 1995, VSE acquired CMstat Corporation, an information technology company
located in San Diego, California.  CMstat is a leading supplier of commercial
(off-the-shelf) software products and technology to manage engineering, product,
and configuration management data.  In August 1995, VSE acquired Energetics
Incorporated, an energy management and environmental technology company located
in Columbia, Maryland.  Energetics provides technical and management services 
for advanced technology programs, primarily for the Department of Energy and 
other government and commercial clients.

   In 1995 VSE also established the BAV Division to provide engineering,
technical and support services for U.S. Navy ships to be sold, leased, or
otherwise transferred to foreign governments.  BAV was awarded a Navy contract
in August 1995, which has the potential to generate revenues of up to $1 
billion depending on delivery order requirements and option periods exercised 
over the next ten years.

    Schmoldt Engineering Services Company, which was acquired by VSE in 1990, 
was divested in February 1996.

Management Discussion and Analysis

    The discussion and analysis which follows is intended to assist in under-
standing and evaluating the results of operations, financial condition, and
certain other matters of VSE Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
("VSE" or the "company"), CMstat Corporation ("CMstat"), acquired in May 1995,
Energetics Incorporated ("Energetics"), acquired in August 1995, Human Resource
Systems, Inc. ("HRSI"), Schmoldt Engineering Services Company ("Schmoldt
Engineering"), VSE Corona, Inc. ("VCI"), VSE Services Corporation ("VSES"), and
Value Systems Services ("VSS") and BAV, unincorporated divisions of VSE.  The
company is engaged principally in providing engineering, software development,
testing, and management services to the U. S. Government (the "government").  
VCI and VSES have generally been inactive after 1992.  Intercompany sales are
principally at cost.

    The largest customer for the engineering  services rendered by the company
is the  U. S. Department of Defense ("Defense"), including agencies of the U. S.
Army, Navy, and Air Force.  The Defense budget has been restrained by the 
federal budget deficit in recent years, and as a result of this and increased
competition, VSE's engineering services revenues have decreased from the levels
attained in prior years.  There can be no assurance that future reductions in 
the Defense budget will not have a material adverse impact on the company's 
results of operations or financial position.

    Substantially all of the company's revenues from operations depend on the
award of new contracts, on current contracts not being terminated for the
convenience of the government, and on the exercise of option periods and the
satisfaction of incremental funding requirements on current contracts.  In 
1995, 1994 and 1993, the company did not experience any termination of 
contracts for the convenience of the government nor any non-exercise of option 
periods on current contracts which were material to the company's results of 
operations or financial position. 

    BAV Contract.  In August 1995, VSE's BAV Division was awarded a contract
with the U. S. Navy to provide engineering, technical and logistical support
services associated with the sale, lease, or transfer of Navy ships to foreign

<PAGE>


Management Discussion and Analysis                                
     
governments.  The contract award was protested and in January 1996 the General
Accounting Office ("GAO") ruled in favor of BAV and denied the protest.  BAV
began work on the contract in September 1995 and continued to perform work 
under the contract during the protest period.  This contract has the potential, 
if all options are exercised, to generate revenues in excess of one billion 
dollars over a ten year period from 1995 through 2005.
 
    VSE Contracts.  VSE had a contract with the U. S. Navy which accounted for
approximately 14% of total revenues in 1995, 17% in 1994, and more than 20%  in
1993.  This contract was scheduled to expire in September 1992, but was 
extended through September 1995.  The Navy combined the work performed under 
this contract with other related work, and VSE was not the successful bidder 
for the new contract.  Substantially all work on the contract ended by 
September  1995. 
 
    VSE has another contract with the U. S. Navy which accounted for
approximately 13% of revenues in 1995.  Revenues for this contract have 
increased substantially compared to prior years due to increased requirements 
for materials and subcontract work.  Although work on the contract is expected 
to continue through its completion date of September 1996, future levels of 
materials sales and subcontractor work are not expected to continue at the in-
creased levels experienced during 1995.

    VSS Subcontract.  Beginning in January 1992, VSS provided services to the
U. S. Marine Corps under a subcontract.  The subcontract generated revenues to
VSS of about $15.4 million during 1994 and 1993, equal to about 10.6% of VSE's
consolidated revenues over these two years.  A protest against the award of the
prime contract was sustained by the GAO, and in October 1993, a new prime
contract was awarded to a different contractor.  Substantially all work on the
VSS subcontract terminated effective April 1994.  There was no revenue 
associated with this subcontract during 1995.

    VSS Contract.  In February 1994 VSS was awarded a new contract with a
U. S. Navy customer.  In September 1994 VSS began work on the contract.  The
contract generated revenues to VSS equal to approximately 11% of consolidated
revenues in 1995.

    Costs and expenses of operations, as a percentage of revenues, remained
relatively stable during 1995, 1994, and 1993.  The percentage differences
between 1995 and 1994 and between 1994 and 1993 are primarily due to a
combination of factors, some of which are offsetting, including (a) differences
between costs incurred and whether they may be billed based on contract
provisions, (b) the effects of increases or decreases in facility and equipment
lease renewals, fringe benefit programs, and similar period expenses, (c) costs
associated with contract start-up and termination phases, and (d) effective
project and cost management.

    Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 1995 as compared
to 1994 and in 1994 as compared to 1993, primarily due to a reduction in
nonreimbursable administrative expenses.

    Interest expense increased in 1995 as compared to 1994 due to the depletion
of cash to consummate the acquisitions of CMstat and Energetics in 1995 (see
"Acquisitions and Divestitures" below) and the use of bank borrowings to finance
operations.  Interest expense declined in 1994 as compared to 1993 primarily due
to reduced bank borrowings attributable in part to a lower receivables financing
requirement resulting from a lower sales volume.

</TABLE>


    Pretax income from operations increased by approximately 8% in 1995 as
compared to 1994.  The increase in pretax income is primarily due to profits
associated with the new business provided by the acquisitions of Energetics and
CMstat and to the elimination of losses on certain VSE fixed price contracts.
These increases to pretax income were partially offset by reductions in pretax 
income due to the reduced level of sales activity of Schmoldt Engineering and 
increased interest expense and other costs associated with the acquisitions of 
CMstat and Energetics.

    Pretax income from operations increased by approximately 33% in 1994 as
compared to 1993 due primarily to increases in income associated with VSE cost
reductions, a nonrecurring reduction in income in 1993 due to a resolution of 
a claim against the company, increased profit margins on VSE time and material
contracts, and increased income from invested cash surpluses.  These increases
to pretax income were offset by reductions in pretax income due to losses on
certain VSE fixed price contracts, the termination of work associated with the
VSS subcontract in 1994, and the reduced level of sales activity of Schmoldt
Engineering.


Acquisitions and Divestitures

    On May 31, 1995 the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of CMstat, which develops and supports software for commercial and government
customers.  On August 29, 1995 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock
of Energetics, which supports government and industry technology programs in the
fields of energy use and the environment.  

<PAGE>


Management Discussion and Analysis

    On February 7, 1996, VSE sold its wholly owned subsidiary Schmoldt
Engineering.  Under the terms of the transaction, VSE sold all of the 
outstanding capital stock of Schmoldt Engineering to certain officers of 
Schmoldt Engineering in exchange for cash and a promissory note for which 
principal and interest is payable in installments between March 1, 1996 and 
September 1, 2001.  The transaction resulted in a pretax loss of approximately 
$300 thousand to VSE.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows

    A net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.4 million
during 1995 resulted from approximately $6.6 million used in investing
activities, approximately $4.6 million provided by financing activities, and
approximately $450 thousand used in operations.  Significant investing 
activities included approximately $3.5 million associated with the acquisition
of Energetics, approximately $900 thousand associated with the acquisition of 
CMstat, and $2.1 million associated with the purchase of property and 
equipment, including property and equipment purchases to support the new BAV 
contract.  Significant financing activities included borrowing on the company's
$45 million revolving term loan, including commitments for checks outstanding 
at year end, of approximately $4.9 million.  Cash flows from operations 
declined by approximately $6.5 million as compared to 1994 primarily  due to 
the absence of the decline in receivables experienced in 1994 due to the 
terminated VSS subcontract and the additional accounts receivable associated 
with BAV, CMstat and Energetics in 1995.

    A net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 million
during 1994 resulted from approximately  $6.1 million provided by operations,
approximately $700 thousand used in investing activities, and approximately 
$3.3 million used in financing activities.  Cash flows from operations 
increased by approximately $4.8 million as compared to 1993 primarily due to a 
reduction in the level of accounts receivable attributable to a decrease in the
sales of VSE and the termination of work associated with the VSS subcontract. 
Investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment.  
Significant financing activities included reductions of borrowings on the 
company's revolving term bank loan of approximately $2.7 million.

    A net increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $200 thousand
during 1993 resulted from approximately $1.3 million provided by operations and
approximately $1.1 million used in investing activities.  Investing activities
consisted of the purchase of property and equipment.

    The company's principal requirements for cash are to finance the costs of
operations pending the collection of accounts receivable, to acquire capital
assets for office and computer support, and to pay cash dividends.  Performance
of work under the BAV contract is expected to substantially increase the
company's requirements for cash, however, management believes that the cash 
flows from operations and the bank loan commitment are adequate to meet current
operating cash requirements.

Management Discussion and Analysis

Working Capital

    VSE's requirements for working capital are affected significantly by its
revenues and accounts receivable, which are primarily from billings made by 
the company to the government or other government prime contractors for 
services rendered.  Such accounts receivable generally do not present liquidity 
or collection problems. Working capital is also affected by (a) contract 
retainages, (b) start-up and termination costs associated with new or complete 
contracts, (c) capital equipment requirements, and (d) differences between the 
provisional billing rates authorized by the government compared to the costs 
actually incurred by the company.

    Government contracts generally require VSE to pay for material and
subcontract costs included in VSE's contract  billings prior to receiving pay-
ment for such costs from the government.  However, such contracts generally 
provide for progress payments on a monthly or semimonthly basis, thereby 
reducing requirements for working capital.

Dividends

    Cash dividends were declared at the rate of $.325 per share during 1995,
$.305 per  share during 1994, and $.29 per share during 1993.  Pursuant to its
bank loan agreement (see Note 4 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements"), the payment of cash dividends by VSE is subject to annual rate 
restrictions.  VSE has paid cash dividends each year since 1973.

Income Taxes

    The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes."  SFAS No. 109, which was implemented by VSE in fiscal year
1993, requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and
reporting purposes.  The implementation of SFAS No. 109 added approximately 
$284 thousand to net income in 1993.

Inflation and Pricing

    Most of the contracts performed by VSE provide for estimates of future
labor costs to be escalated for any option periods provided by the contracts,
while the non-labor costs included in such contracts are normally considered
reimbursable at cost.  VSE property and equipment consists principally of
computer systems equipment and furniture and fixtures.  The overall impact of
inflation on replacement costs of such property and equipment is expected to be
insignificant.

Report of Independent Public Accountants
To the Stockholders of VSE Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VSE 
Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 
and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' 
investment and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 
1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial state-
ment presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of VSE Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 
1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include VSE Corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries ("VSE" or the "company"), CMstat Corporation ("CMstat"),
Energetics Incorporated ("Energetics"), Human Resource Systems, Inc. ("HRSI"),
Schmoldt Engineering Services ("Schmoldt Engineering"), VSE Corona, Inc. 
("VCI"), VSE Services Corporation ("VSES"), and Value Systems Services ("VSS") 
and BAV, unincorporated divisions of VSE.  The company is engaged principally 
in providing engineering, software development, testing, and management 
services to the U. S. Government.  Intercompany sales are principally at cost.  
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolida-
tion.  Certain prior year balances have been reclassified for comparative 
purposes.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity 
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  In 1994, the company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115 "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  The adoption was not
material to the company's financial position or results of operations.

The company has classified all debt securities as available-for-sale.  
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains 
and losses, net of tax, reported in a separate component of stockholders' 
investment.  Realized gains and losses are included in other income.  
Available-for-sale securities at December 31, 1995 consisted of commercial 
paper of $200 thousand.  Available-for-sale securities at December 31, 1994 
consisted of tax exempt master notes of $1.6 million, 90 day commercial paper 
of $1.2 million, and overnight repurchase agreements of $883 thousand secured 
by U. S. Government agency securities.  The estimated fair value of these 
securities approximated cost, and the amount of gross unrealized gains and 
losses was not significant.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade accounts
receivable.  The company believes that concentrations of credit risk with 
respect to trade accounts receivable are limited as they are primarily U. S. 
Government receivables.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

Supplemental disclosures of cash flow information for the three years ended
December 31, are presented below (in thousands):

                                                1995        1994        1993  
                                              --------    --------    --------
   Interest payments . . . . . . . . . . . .  $    107    $     44    $     39
   Income tax payments . . . . . . . . . . .       841       1,566         528


Contract Revenues

Substantially all of the company's revenues result from contract services
performed for the U. S. Government or for contractors engaged in work for the
U. S. Government under a variety of contracts.  Revenues on cost-type contracts
are recorded on the basis of recoverable costs incurred and fees earned.  

<PAGE>


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Revenues on fixed price contracts are recorded as services are performed, using
the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, primarily based on contract
costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion. 
Revenues on time and material contracts are recorded on the basis of hours
delivered plus other allowable direct costs as incurred.  

The company provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income
during the period in which losses are first identified.

A substantial portion of the contract and administrative costs is subject to
audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The company's indirect cost rates
have been audited and approved for 1992 and prior years.  In the opinion of
management the audits of 1995, 1994 and 1993 will not result in adjustments, if
any, having a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or 
financial position.

The company's software revenues result from sales of software licenses and post
contract customer support.  Revenue from the sale of licenses is recognized 
upon delivery of the software.  Revenue from the support is recognized ratably 
over the period to which the support agreement relates.

Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the company implemented the provisions of SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and 
liability approach to accounting for income taxes for financial statement 
purposes.  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities represent 
the tax effects of temporary differences between tax and financial accounting 
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using presently enacted tax 
rates.

As a result of implementing the provisions of SFAS No. 109, the company
recognized a cumulative one-time tax benefit of $284 thousand or $.33 per share
as of January 1, 1993.  This cumulative one-time tax benefit is the result of 
(a) a difference in the tax and financial accounting basis associated with 
certain real property, which difference was not previously recorded in the 
company's consolidated financial statements, and (b) an adjustment to the 
consolidated financial statements for previously recorded tax and financial 
accounting differences based on presently enacted tax rates.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment (valued at cost) consisted of the following (in
thousands):

                                                           1995        1994

                                                         --------    --------  
                                                           14,382      12,570
    Less accumulated depreciation  . . . . . . . . . . .   (9,884)     (9,492)
                                                         --------    --------
                                                         $  4,498    $  3,078
                                                         ========    ======== 

Depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was
approximately $1.1 million for 1995, $1.1 million for 1994 and $1.3 million for
1993.  Depreciation of computer systems equipment is provided principally by 
the

double-declining method over periods of four to six years.  Depreciation of
furniture and fixtures is provided principally by the straight-line method over
approximately nine years.  Depreciation of all other property and equipment is
provided principally by the double-declining method over periods of three to
twenty years.  Depreciation of buildings and land improvements is provided
principally by the straight-line method over approximately thirty years.

Nonoperating Net Income

Nonoperating net income included in selling, general and administrative 
expenses, primarily interest income, was approximately $81 thousand, $128 
thousand, and $19 thousand for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994, and 
1993, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plan

The company maintained a deferred compensation plan in 1993 that was 
discontinued as of the end of 1993.  The company established the Deferred 
Supplemental Compensation Plan in 1994.  Deferred compensation plan expense for 
the plans for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was approximately
$188 thousand, $125 thousand and $207 thousand, respectively.

Included in other assets are assets of the plans which include equity 
securities recorded at fair value and classified as available-for-sale.  The 
fair value of these securities was $940,131 and $40,002 as of December 31, 1995 
and 1994, respectively.  Unrealized gains/(losses) were $115,013 and ($9,998) 
for 1995 and 1994, respectively.  Changes in the assets of the plans are offset 
in the company's financial statements by a corresponding change in the 
liability to plan participants.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Adoption of SFAS No. 121

In 1995, the company elected an early adoption of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed 
of".  This adoption had no impact on the company.


(2)  Acquisitions

On May 31, 1995 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of CMstat, a
leading developer and supplier of commercial off-the-shelf configuration and
product data management solutions, for approximately $970 thousand in cash. 
The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.  The 
results of CMstat's operations since May 31, 1995 are included in these 
consolidated financial statements.  The company has recorded approximately $1.2
million of identifiable intangible assets, $800 thousand of deferred taxes 
related to the identifiable intangible assets and $400 thousand of goodwill.  
Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are being amortized by the 
straight-line method generally over a period of ten years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     
On August 29, 1995 the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Energetics for approximately $3.7 million.  Energetics assists government and
industry in conducting effective technology programs, primarily in the fields 
of energy use and the environment.  The acquisition was accounted for by the 
purchase method of accounting.  The results of Energetics' operations for the
period August 29, 1995 through December 31, 1995 are included in these 
consolidated financial statements.  The company has recorded approximately 
$1.5 million of goodwill and $100 thousand of identifiable intangible assets.
Goodwill is being amortized by the straight-line method over fifteen years.  
Identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over one year.

The following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994 assume the Energetics acquisition occurred as of the
beginning of the respective periods after giving effect to certain adjustments,
including amortization of identifiable intangible assets, increased interest 
expense on acquisition debt, and related income tax effects.  The pro forma 
results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport 
to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been made as 
of those dates or of results which may occur in the future.

The "Unbilled: Other" included in accounts receivable are reported net of an
allowance for contract disallowances of approximately $1.3 million as of 
December 31, 1995 and 1994. "Unbilled: Other" also includes certain costs which
are not reimbursable under current contracts, but which the company believes 
will be reimbursable on execution of contract documentation or amendments 
increasing funding.  Amounts not presently reimbursable included in "Unbilled: 
Other" were approximately $328 thousand and $700 thousand as of December 31, 
1995, and 1994, respectively.

Contracts with the U. S. Government, primarily with the U. S. Department of
Defense, accounted for approximately 95% of revenues in 1995, 1994, and 1993. 
These contracts were performed primarily in the engineering services industry. 
One such contract with the U. S. Navy accounted for approximately 14% to 23% of
such revenues in 1993 through 1995.

VSE has a revolving term loan agreement (the "Loan") with a syndicate of three
banks.  Under the Loan, VSE can borrow up to $45 million, subject to a borrowing
formula based on billed receivables.  Interest is charged at a prime-based rate
or at an optional LIBOR-based rate.  A commitment fee is charged on the unused
portion of the loan commitment.  The interest rates and the amount of the
commitment fee increase or decrease as VSE's leverage ratio increases or
decreases.  The Loan contains collateral requirements by which company assets 
are secured and restrictive covenants that include minimum tangible net worth 
and profitability requirements and a limit on annual dividends.  The termination
date of the Current Loan is May 31, 1997.  Commitments above are for checks
outstanding at December 31, 1995 of approximately $800 thousand.  The carrying
value of the debt is not significantly different from fair value.

In 1993, the tax effect of certain differences between tax and book bases not
previously recorded were recorded.  Further, a valuation allowance, which is
provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax
asset will not be realized, was established for the deferred tax asset 
associated with certain real property because of the uncertainty that the 
deferred tax asset will be fully realized.  Based on the company's taxable 
income in prior years, the company expects to realize the net deferred tax asset
currently recorded.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(8)  Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

The principal facilities of the company and its subsidiaries are generally 
rented under operating leases for periods of one to ten years.  The company and
its subsidiaries also lease equipment generally under noncancelable operating 
leases for periods of one to two years.  Rent expense for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
was approximately $2.2 million, $2.0 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, 
which was net of sublease income of approximately $272 thousand, $331 thousand,
and $390 thousand, respectively. The future minimum annual rental required under
leases having remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year, net of
noncancelable sublease income, will approximate $2 million in 1996, $1.8 million
in 1997, $1.2 million in 1998, $840 thousand in 1999, and $955 thousand in 2000
and $1.3 million thereafter.

Note Guarantee

The company is a guarantor of an Industrial Development Revenue Note assumed by
Alexandria Tech Center II/Starr Associates, a Virginia general partnership of
which Starr Management Corporation, a former VSE subsidiary ("Starr"), is a 50%
partner.  As of December 31, 1995, the outstanding principal of the note was 
$2.6 million.  The note evidences loan proceeds that were used to finance the 
construction of an office building owned by the partnership for a period of 
ten years and has a one year lease for an additional 16% of the building.  The
ten year lease period expires in July 1997.

Starr has agreed to indemnify the company for any liabilities resulting from any
guarantee given by VSE on behalf of Starr.

Litigation

During June 1993 a settlement was reached among VSE, a bank used by VSE, and a
third party claimant to resolve a potential claim against VSE with respect to a
letter of credit issued in 1988.  VSE's charge to income before tax in 1993 for
the settlement was approximately $300 thousand.
 
The company and its subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, certain
other claims against them and against other parties.  In the opinion of
management, the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the company's results of operations or financial position.

                           EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


     THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of January 1, 
1996, by and between VSE Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Employer"), and
Donald M.  Ervine  ("Employee");
                                                            
     WHEREAS, Employee currently is employed by Employer as chairman of
Employer's board of directors ("the Board") and Employer's chief executive
officer; 

     WHEREAS, Employee has rendered many years of good and valuable service
to the Employer and has contributed greatly to Employer's growth and success;

     WHEREAS, Employer wishes to induce Employee to remain in Employer's
employ to prevent the significant loss which Employer would incur if Employee
were to leave and to enter the employment of a competitor;

     WHEREAS, in the current business climate of takeovers and acquisitions,
Employee may be concerned about the continuation of his employment and his
status and responsibilities if a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs,
and Employer is concerned that Employee may be approached by others with
employment opportunities;

     WHEREAS, Employer desires to ensure that, if a Change in Control appears
possible, Employee will be in a secure position from which he can objectively
engage in any potential deliberations or negotiations respecting such Change
in Control without fear of any direct or implied threat to his employment,
status and responsibilities; and

     WHEREAS, Employee desires to have the foregoing assurances.
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which
is hereby acknowledged,  Employer and Employee, each intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

     1.   Term

          The term of Employee's  employment hereunder shall commence on the
date hereof and shall continue until January 1,  1999,  except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.  If the term of Employee's employment hereunder shall
have continued until January 1,  1999,  thereafter, such term of Employee's
employment hereunder shall be deemed to be renewed automatically, on the same
terms and conditions contained herein, for successive periods of one year
each, unless and until either Employer or Employee, at least 90 days prior to
the expiration of the original term or any such extended term, shall give
written notice to the other of his or its intention not to renew the term of
Employee's employment hereunder.  All references herein to the  Term  refer to
the original term of Employee's employment hereunder and all extensions
thereof.

          (a)  Offices

               During the Term, Employee shall serve as a director of
Employer, chairman of the Board and Employer's chief executive officer, and
the Board shall renominate Employee as a director of Employer, reelect
Employee  as chairman of the board and reappoint Employee as Employer's chief
executive officer, and Employee shall perform the duties of those positions,
as assigned to him by the Board.  Employer agrees that Employee will be
assigned only duties of the type, nature and dignity normally assigned to the
chief executive officer of a corporation of the size, stature and nature of
Employer.  During the Term, Employee shall have, at a minimum, the same
perquisites of office as he had on the date hereof, and he shall report
directly to the Board.

          (b)  Full-Time Basis

               During the Term, Employee shall devote, on a full-time
basis, his services, skills and abilities to his employment hereunder,

hereunder or present a conflict of interest with the interests of Employer or
of any subsidiary thereof ("Subsidiary").

     3.   Compensation

          (a)  Salary 
               
               During the Term, as compensation for services rendered by

of not less than $225,000 per annum, payable in installments in accordance
with Employer's policy governing salary payments to senior officers generally

provided that, the Base Salary shall not be less than the rate of $225,000 per
annum.

          (b)  Performance Bonus

purchase or similar stock plans or arrangements.

          (d)  Tax Withholdings

               Employer shall withhold from Employee's  compensation

required by the federal, state and local governments with jurisdiction over

     4.   Benefits

          During the Term, Employee shall be entitled to such comparable

required with respect to (1) business interests that neither compete with
Employer or any Subsidiaries nor interfere with Employee's  duties and
obligations hereunder and (2) Employee's  charitable, eleemosynary,
philanthropic or professional association activities.

               (ii) During the Term, Employee shall not, without the
Board's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, either as an officer,
director, employee, agent, advisor, consultant, principal, stockholder,
partner, owner or in any other capacity, on his own behalf or otherwise, in
any way engage in, represent, be connected with or have a financial interest
in, any business which is, or to his knowledge, is about to become, engaged in
the business of providing  engineering, management, energy or environmental
services to  the United States Government or any department, agency, or
instrumentality thereof or any state or local governmental agency or to any
person, corporation or other entity (collectively a "Person") with which
Employer or any Subsidiary is currently or has previously done business or any
subsequent line of business developed by Employee or any Subsidiary during the
Term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall be permitted to own
passive investments in publicly held companies provided that such investments
do not exceed five percent of any such company's outstanding equity.

          (b)  Confidential Information

               During the Term and for the first 24 consecutive months
after the termination of the Term, Employee shall not disclose or use,
directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information (as defined below).  For
the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean all
information disclosed to Employee, or known by him as a consequence of or
through his employment with Employer or any Subsidiary, where such information
is not generally known in the trade or industry or was regarded or treated as
confidential by Employer or any Subsidiary, and where such information refers
or relates in any manner whatsoever to the business activities, processes,
services or products of Employer or its Subsidiaries.  Confidential
Information shall include business and development plans (whether
contemplated, initiated or completed), information with respect to the
development of technical and management services, business contacts, methods
of operation, results of analysis, business forecasts, financial data, costs,
revenues, and similar information.  Upon  

<PAGE>

termination  of Term, Employee shall immediately return to Employer all of
property of Employer or any Subsidiary and Confidential Information which is
in tangible form, and all copies thereof.

          (c)  Business Opportunities

               ( i )     During the Term, Employee shall promptly disclose to
Employer each business opportunity of a type which, based upon its prospects
and relationship to the existing businesses of Employer or any Subsidiary,
Employer or any Subsidiary might reasonably consider pursuing.  Upon
termination of the Term, regardless of the circumstances thereof, Employer
shall have the exclusive right to participate in or undertake any such
opportunity on its own behalf without any involvement of Employee. 

               (ii) During the Term, Employee shall refrain from engaging
in any
activity, practice or act which conflicts with, or has the potential to
conflict with, the interests of Employer or its Subsidiaries, and he shall
avoid any acts or omissions which are disloyal to, or competitive with
Employer or its Subsidiaries.           

          (d)  Non-Solicitation of Executives

               During the Term and for the first 24 consecutive months
after termination of the  Term, Employee shall not, except in the course of 
his duties hereunder, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce or
otherwise counsel, advise, ask or encourage any person to leave the employ of
Employer or any Subsidiary, or solicit or offer employment to any person who
was employed by Employer or any Subsidiary at any time during the twelve-month
period preceding the solicitation or offer.

          (e)  Covenant Not To Compete

               (i)  If Employee voluntarily terminates the Term, or if
Employer terminates the Term for Cause (as defined below), Employee shall not,
during the first 24 consecutive months following such termination, engage in
competition with Employer or any Subsidiary, or solicit, from any person or
entity who purchased any then existing product or service from Employer or any
Subsidiary during his employment hereunder, the purchase of any then existing
product or service in competition with then existing products or services of
Employer or any Subsidiary.

               (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, Employee shall be
deemed to engage in competition with Employer if he shall directly or
indirectly, either individually or as a stockholder, director, officer,
partner, consultant, owner, employee, agent, or in any other capacity, consult
with or otherwise assist any person or entity engaged in providing technical
and management services to any person or entity  which Employer or any
Subsidiary, during  

the  Term, has developed or is working to develop.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if Employer is in material breach of this Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 6 shall not apply.

          (f)  Employee Acknowledgment

               Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that the
restrictions imposed upon him by the provisions of this Section 6 are fair and
reasonable considering the nature of Employer's business, and are reasonably
required for Employer's protection.

          (g)  Invalidity

               If a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator shall
declare any provision or restriction contained in this Section 6 as
unenforceable or void, the provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full
force and effect to the extent not so declared to be unenforceable or void,
and the court may modify the invalid provision to make it enforceable to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

          (h)  Specific Performance

               Employee agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of
this Section 6, the remedies available at law to Employer would be inadequate
and in lieu thereof, or in addition thereto, Employer shall be entitled to
appropriate equitable remedies, including specific performance and injunctive
relief.  Employee agrees not to enter into any agreement, either written or
oral, which may conflict with this Agreement, and Employee authorizes Employer
to make known the terms of Sections 6 and 7 hereof to any Person, including
future employers of Employee.

      7.  Termination

          (a)  By Employer

               (i)  Termination for Cause

                    Employer may for Cause (as defined below) terminate
the Term at any time by written notice to Employee.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Cause" shall mean any one or more of the following: (1)
conduct by Employee which is materially illegal or fraudulent; (2) the breach
or violation by Employee of any of the material provisions of this Agreement,
provided that Employee must first be given notice by the Board of the alleged
breach or violation and 30 days to cure said alleged breach or violation; (3)
Employee's  use of illegal drugs or abuse of alcohol or authorized drugs which
impairs Employee's  ability to perform his duties hereunder, provided that
Employee must be given notice by the Board of such impairment and 60 days to
cure the impairment; (4) Employee's  knowing and willful neglect of duties or
negligence in the performance of his duties which materially affects
Employer's or any Subsidiary's business, provided that Employee must first be
given notice by the Board of such alleged neglect or negligence and 30 days to
cure said alleged neglect or negligence.  If a termination occurs pursuant to
clause (1) above, the date on which the Term is terminated (the "Termination
Date") shall be the date Employee receives notice of termination and, if a
termination occurs pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or (4) above, the Termination
Date shall be the date on which the specified cure period expires.  In any
event, as of the Termination Date (in the absence of satisfying the alleged
breach or violation within the applicable cure period), Employee shall be
relieved of all of his duties hereunder and Employee shall not be entitled to
the accrual or provision of any compensation or benefit, after the Termination
Date but Employee shall be entitled to the provision of all compensation and
other benefits that shall have accrued as of the Termination Date, including
Base Salary, Performance Bonuses, paid leave benefits,  Deferred  Compensation
Units, Deferred Supplemental Compensation, and reimbursement of incurred
business expenses.

               (ii) Termination Without Cause

                    Employer may, in its sole discretion, without Cause,
terminate the Term at any time by providing Employee with (a) 60 days' prior
notice thereof and (b) on or prior to the Termination Date, a lump sum
severance compensation payment equal to  two (2) times the  total amount of
Employee's  Base Salary payable hereunder, based upon the amount in effect as
of the effective Termination  Date. In  such event, Employee shall not be
entitled to the accrual or provision of any other compensation or benefit
after the Termination Date other than (a) the medical and hospitalization
benefits for the first 18 months after the Termination Date; (b) the provision
of all compensation and other benefits that shall have accrued as of the
Termination Date, including Base Salary, Performance Bonus, paid leave
benefits, Deferred Compensation Units, Deferred Supplemental Compensation and
reimbursements of incurred expenses; and (c) all stock options or similar
rights to acquire capital stock granted by Employer to Employee shall
automatically become vested and exercisable in whole or in part.

          (b)  Death or Disability

               The Term shall be terminated immediately and automatically
upon Employee's  death or "Disability."  The term "Disability" shall mean
Employee's  inability to  perform all of the essential functions of his
position hereunder for a period of 26 consecutive weeks or for an aggregate of
150 work days during any 12-month period by reason  of  illness, accident or any
other physical or mental incapacity, as may be permitted by applicable law.
Employee's  capability to continue performance of Employee's  duties hereunder
shall be determined by a panel composed of two independent medical doctors
appointed by the Board and one appointed by the Employee or his designated
representative.  If the panel is unable to reach a decision the matter will be
referred to arbitration in accordance with Section 8.  In the event  of 
Employee's  death or Disability for any period of six consecutive months, 
Employee (or his designated beneficiary) will be paid his Base Salary
then in effect for one full year following the date of death or  disability. 

          (c)  By Employee

               (i)  Employee may, in his sole discretion, without cause,
terminate the Term at any time upon 90 days' written notice to Employer.  
If Employee exercises such termination right, Employer may, at its option, 
at any time after receiving such notice from Employee, relieve him of his 
duties and terminate the Term at any time prior to the expiration of said 
notice period.  If the Term is terminated by Employee or Employer pursuant 
to this Section 7(c)( i ), Employee shall not be entitled to any further Base 
Salary or the accrual or provision of any compensation or benefits after the 
Termination Date, including, without limitation, any of the medical and 
hospitalization benefits described in Section 7(a)(ii)(1).  

               (ii) If, during the Term, a "Change of Control" (as defined
below) occurs and, without his consent, Employee is assigned duties materially
inconsistent with his position and status with Employer as of the date hereof,
Employee may, in his sole discretion, terminate the Term upon 30 days' notice
of Employer.  If Employee exercises such termination right, Employer may, at
its option, at any time after receiving such notice from Employee, relieve him
of his duties hereunder and terminate the Term at any time prior to the
expiration of said notice period.  If this Agreement is terminated by Employee
or Employer pursuant to this Section 7(c)(ii), Employee shall be entitled (a)
to continue on or prior to the Termination Date a lump sum severance
compensation payment equal to  three (3) times the  total amount of Employee's
Base Salary payable hereunder, based on the amount in effect as of the
Termination  Date;  (b) the medical and hospitalization benefits and all
compensation and other benefits that shall have accrued as of  the Termination
Date, as described in Section 7(a)(ii)(1); and (c) to the automatic vesting
and  exercisability  in whole or in part of all stock options or similar rights
to acquire capital stock granted by Employer to Employee; provided that
Employee shall not be entitled, after the Termination Date to the accrual or
provision of any other compensation or benefits payable hereunder, including
the Performance Bonus.

          (d)  Change of Control

               For purposes of this Section 7, a  Change of Control  shall
be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:
( i ) any "person," including a "group," as such terms as defined in Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules promulgated thereunder (collectively the "Exchange Act"), other than a
trustee or other fiduciary holding voting securities of Employer ("Voting
Securities") under any  Employer-sponsored  benefit plan, becomes the beneficial
owner, as defined under the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, whether by
purchase or acquisition or agreement to act in concert or otherwise, of 30% or
more of the outstanding Voting Securities; (ii) a cash tender or exchange
offer is completed for such amount of Voting Securities which, together with
the Voting Securities then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the
offeror (and affiliates thereof) constitutes 40% or more of the outstanding
Voting Securities; (iii)  except in the case of a merger or consolidation in
which (a) Employer is the surviving corporation and (b) the holders of Voting
Securities immediately prior to such merger or consolidation beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Securities
immediately after such merger or consolidation (there being excluded from the
number of Voting Securities held by such holders, but not from the outstanding
Voting Securities, any Voting Securities received by affiliates of the other
constituent corporation(s) in the merger or consolidation in exchange for
stock of such other corporation), Employer's shareholders approve an agreement
to merge, consolidate, liquidate, or sell all or substantially all of
Employer's assets; or (iv) two or more directors are elected to the Board
without having previously been nominated and approved by the members of the
Board incumbent on the day immediately preceding such  election.  For purposes
of this Section 7, "affiliate" of a person or another entity shall mean a
person or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with the person or other entity specified. 

          (e)  No Duty to Mitigate

               If Employee is entitled to the compensation and other
benefits provided under Sections 7(a)(ii) or (c)(ii), Employee shall have no
obligation to seek employment to mitigate his damages hereunder.

     8.   Arbitration

          Whenever a dispute arises between the parties concerning this
Agreement or any of the obligations hereunder, or Employee's  employment
generally, Employer and Employee shall use their best efforts to resolve the
dispute by mutual agreement.  If any dispute cannot be resolved by Employer
and Employee, it shall be submitted to arbitration to the exclusion of all
other avenues of relief and adjudicated pursuant to the American Arbitration
Association's Rules for Employment Dispute Resolution then in effect.  The
decision of the arbitrator must be in writing and shall be final and binding
on the parties, and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any
court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator's authority in granting
relief to Employee shall be limited to an award of compensation, benefits and
 unreimbursed  expenses as described in Sections 3, 4, and 5 above, and to the
release of Employee from the provisions of Section 6 and the arbitrator shall
have no authority to award other types of damages or relief to Employee,
including consequential or punitive damages.  The arbitrator shall also have
no authority to award consequential or punitive damages to Employer for
violations of this Agreement by Employee.  The expenses of the arbitration
shall be borne by the losing party to the arbitration and the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover from the losing party all of its or his own costs
and attorneys  fees with respect to the arbitration.  Nothing in this Section
8 shall be construed to derogate Employer's rights to seek legal and equitable
relief in a court of competent jurisdiction as contemplated by Section 6(h).

     9.   Non-Waiver

          It is understood and agreed that one party's failure at any time
to require the performance by the other party of any of the terms, provisions,
covenants or conditions hereof shall in no way affect the first party's right
thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either party of the
breach of any term, provision, covenant or condition hereof be taken or held
to be a waiver of any succeeding breach.

     10.  Severability

          If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under
which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or any
arbitrator, such provision shall be deleted from this Agreement and the
Agreement shall be construed to give full effect to the remaining provision
thereof.

     11.  Survivability

          Unless otherwise provided herein, upon termination of the Term,
the provisions of Sections 6(b), (d) and (e) shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect.

     12.  Governing Law

          This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed
according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to the
conflict of law provisions thereof.

     13.  Construction

          The paragraph headings and captions contained in this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define, limit or affect
the scope or meaning of the provisions hereof.  All references herein to
Sections shall be deemed to refer to Sections of this Agreement.

     14.  Entire Agreement

          This Agreement contains and represents the entire agreement of
Employer and Employee and supersedes all prior agreements, representations or
understandings, oral or written, express or implied with respect to the
subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended in any
way unless in a writing signed by each of Employer and Employee.  No
representation, promise or inducement has been made by either Employer or  
Employee  that is not embodied in this Agreement, and neither Employer nor
Employee shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise
or inducement not specifically set forth herein.

     15.  Assignability

          Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations of Employer
or Employee hereunder may be assigned by Employer or Employee without the
other party's prior written consent.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employer and Employee and
their heirs, successors and assigns.

      16.      Notices

          All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed properly given if delivered personally or sent by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or
sent by telegram,  telelex ,  telecopy  or similar form of telecommunication,

                           EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


     THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of January 1, 
1996, by and between VSE Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Employer"), and
Richard B. McFarland  ("Employee");
                                                            
     WHEREAS, Employee currently is employed by Employer as  a member of
Employer's board of directors ("the Board") and Employer's president and chief
operating officer;  

     WHEREAS, Employee has rendered many years of good and valuable service
to the Employer and has contributed greatly to Employer's growth and success;

     WHEREAS, Employer wishes to induce Employee to remain in Employer s
employ to prevent the significant loss which Employer would incur if Employee
were to leave and to enter the employment of a competitor;

     WHEREAS, in the current business climate of takeovers and acquisitions,
Employee may be concerned about the continuation of his employment and his
status and responsibilities if a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs,
and Employer is concerned that Employee may be approached by others with
employment opportunities;

     WHEREAS, Employer desires to ensure that, if a Change in Control appears
possible, Employee will be in a secure position from which he can objectively
engage in any potential deliberations or negotiations respecting such Change
in Control without fear of any direct or implied threat to his employment,
status and responsibilities; and

     WHEREAS, Employee desires to have the foregoing assurances.
  
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which
is hereby acknowledged,  Employer and Employee, each intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

     1.   Term

          The term of Employee's employment hereunder shall commence on the
date hereof and shall continue until January 1,  1999,  except as otherwise
provided in Section 7.  If the term of Employee's  employment hereunder shall
have continued until January 1,  1999,  thereafter, such term of Employee's
employment hereunder shall be deemed to be renewed automatically, on the same
terms and conditions contained herein, for successive periods of one year
each, unless and until either Employer or Employee, at least 90 days prior to
the expiration of the original term or any such extended term, shall give
written notice to the other of his or its intention not to renew the term of
Employee's  employment hereunder.  All references herein to the "Term" refer to
the original term of Employee's  employment hereunder and all extensions
thereof.

 Employer   and as Employer's president and chief operating officer, and the
Board shall renominate Employee as a director of Employer and reelect Employee
as Employer's president and chief operating officer,  and Employee shall
perform the duties of those positions, as assigned to him by the Board. 
Employer agrees that Employee will be assigned only duties of the type, nature
and dignity normally assigned to the chief  operating officer of  a corporation
of the size, stature and nature of Employer.  During the Term, Employee shall
have, at a minimum, the same perquisites of office as he had on the date
hereof, and he shall report directly to the  Employer's chief executive
officer. 

          (b)  Full-Time Basis

hereunder or present a conflict of interest with the interests of Employer or
of any subsidiary thereof ("Subsidiary").

     3.   Compensation

          (a)       Salary

     4.   Benefits

          During the Term, Employee shall be entitled to such comparable

           (a)  Exclusive Services

           (i)  During the Term, Employee shall at all times devote his full-
time attention, energies, efforts and skills to Employer's business and shall 
not, directly or indirectly, engage in any other business activity, whether or 
not for profit, gain or other pecuniary advantages, without the Board's written
consent, provided that such prior consent shall not be required with respect 
to (1) business interests that neither compete with Employer or any 
Subsidiaries nor interfere with Employee's duties and obligations hereunder 
and (2) Employee's  charitable, eleemosynary, philanthropic or professional 
association activities.

               (ii) During the Term, Employee shall not, without the

the business of providing  engineering, management, energy or environmental
services to  the United States Government or any department, agency, or

person, corporation or other entity (collectively a "Person") with which
Employer or any Subsidiary is currently or has previously done business or any
subsequent line of business developed by Employee or any Subsidiary during the
Term.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee shall be permitted to own
passive investments in publicly held companies provided that such investments
do not exceed five percent of any such company's outstanding equity.

          (b)  Confidential Information

               During the Term and for the first 24 consecutive months
after the termination of the Term, Employee shall not disclose or use,
directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information (as defined below).  For
the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean all
information disclosed to Employee, or known by him as a consequence of or
through his employment with Employer or any Subsidiary, where such information
is not generally known in the trade or industry or was regarded or treated as
confidential by Employer or any Subsidiary, and where such information refers
or relates in any manner whatsoever to the business activities, processes,
services or products of Employer or its Subsidiaries.  Confidential
Information shall include business and development plans (whether
contemplated, initiated or completed), information with respect to the
development of technical and management services, business contacts, methods
of operation, results of analysis, business forecasts, financial data, costs,
revenues, and similar information.  Upon termination  of Term, Employee shall 
immediately return to Employer all of property of Employer or any Subsidiary 
and Confidential Information which is in tangible form, and all copies thereof.

          (c)  Business Opportunities

               ( i )     During the Term, Employee shall promptly disclose to
Employer each business opportunity of a type which, based upon its prospects
and relationship to the existing businesses of Employer or any Subsidiary,
Employer or any Subsidiary might reasonably consider pursuing.  Upon
termination of the Term, regardless of the circumstances thereof, Employer
shall have the exclusive right to participate in or undertake any such
opportunity on its own behalf without any involvement of Employee. 

               (ii) During the Term, Employee shall refrain from engaging
in any activity, practice or act which conflicts with, or has the potential to
conflict with, the interests of Employer or its Subsidiaries, and he shall
avoid any acts or omissions which are disloyal to, or competitive with
Employer or its Subsidiaries.           

          (d)  Non-Solicitation of Executives

               During the Term and for the first 24 consecutive months
after termination of the Term , Employee shall not, except in the course of
his duties hereunder, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce or
otherwise counsel, advise, ask or encourage any person to leave the employ of
Employer or any Subsidiary, or solicit or offer employment to any person who
was employed by Employer or any Subsidiary at any time during the twelve-month
period preceding the solicitation or offer.

          (e)  Covenant Not To Compete

               (i)  If Employee voluntarily terminates the Term, or if
Employer terminates the Term for Cause (as defined below), Employee shall not,
during the first 24 consecutive months following such termination, engage in
competition with Employer or any Subsidiary, or solicit, from any person or
entity who purchased any then existing product or service from Employer or any
Subsidiary during his employment hereunder, the purchase of any then existing
product or service in competition with then existing products or services of
Employer or any Subsidiary.

               (ii) For purposes of this Agreement, Employee shall be
deemed to engage in competition with Employer if he shall directly or
indirectly, either individually or as a stockholder, director, officer,
partner, consultant, owner, employee, agent, or in any other capacity, consult
with or otherwise assist any person or entity engaged in providing technical
and management services to any person or entity  which Employer or any
Subsidiary, during the Term, has developed or is working to develop. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Employer is in material
breach of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 6 shall not apply.
  
          (f)  Employee Acknowledgment

               Employee hereby agrees and acknowledges that the
restrictions imposed upon him by the provisions of this Section 6 are fair and
reasonable considering the nature of Employer's business, and are reasonably
required for Employer's protection.

          (g)  Invalidity

               If a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator shall
declare any provision or restriction contained in this Section 6 as
unenforceable or void, the provisions of this Section 6 shall remain in full
force and effect to the extent not so declared to be unenforceable or void,
and the court may modify the invalid provision to make it enforceable to the
maximum extent permitted by law.

          (h)  Specific Performance

               Employee agrees that if he breaches any of the provisions of
this Section 6, the remedies available at law to Employer would be inadequate
and in lieu thereof, or in addition thereto, Employer shall be entitled to
appropriate equitable remedies, including specific performance and injunctive
relief.  Employee agrees not to enter into any agreement, either written or
oral, which may conflict with this Agreement, and Employee authorizes Employer
to make known the terms of Sections 6 and 7 hereof to any Person, including
future employers of Employee.

      7.  Termination

          (a)  By Employer

               (i)  Termination for Cause

                    Employer may for Cause (as defined below) terminate
the Term at any time by written notice to Employee.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Cause" shall mean any one or more of the following: (1)
conduct by Employee which is materially illegal or fraudulent; (2) the breach
or violation by Employee of any of the material provisions of this Agreement,
provided that Employee must first be given notice by the Board of the alleged
breach or violation and 30 days to cure said alleged breach or violation; (3)
Employee's  use of illegal drugs or abuse of alcohol or authorized drugs which
impairs Employee's  ability to perform his duties hereunder, provided that
Employee must be given notice by the Board of such impairment and 60 days to
cure the impairment; (4) Employee's  knowing and willful neglect of duties or
negligence in the performance of his duties which materially affects
Employer's or any Subsidiary's business, provided that Employee must first be
given notice by the Board of such alleged neglect or negligence and 30 days to
cure said alleged neglect or negligence.  If a termination occurs pursuant to
clause (1) above, the date on which the Term is terminated (the "Termination
Date") shall be the date Employee receives notice of termination and, if a
termination occurs pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or (4) above, the Termination
Date shall be the date on which the specified cure period expires.  In any
event, as of the Termination Date (in the absence of satisfying the alleged
breach or violation within the applicable cure period), Employee shall be
relieved of all of his duties hereunder and Employee shall not be entitled to
the accrual or provision of any compensation or benefit, after the Termination
Date but Employee shall be entitled to the provision of all compensation and
other benefits that shall have accrued as of the Termination Date, including
Base Salary, Performance Bonuses, paid leave benefits,  Deferred  Compensation
Units, Deferred Supplemental Compensation, and reimbursement of incurred
business expenses.

               (ii) Termination Without Cause

                    Employer may, in its sole discretion, without Cause,
terminate the Term at any time by providing Employee with (a) 60 days' prior
notice thereof and (b) on or prior to the Termination Date, a lump sum
severance compensation payment equal to  the total amount  of Employee's  Base
Salary payable  for one (1) year hereunder,  based upon the amount in effect as
of the effective Termination  Date. In  such event, Employee shall not be
entitled to the accrual or provision of any other compensation or benefit
after the Termination Date other than (a) the medical and hospitalization
benefits for the first 18 months after the Termination Date; (b) the provision
of all compensation and other benefits that shall have accrued as of the
Termination Date, including Base Salary, Performance Bonus, paid leave
benefits, Deferred Compensation Units, Deferred Supplemental Compensation and
reimbursements of incurred expenses; and (c) all stock options or similar
rights to acquire capital stock granted by Employer to Employee shall
automatically become vested and exercisable in whole or in part.

          (b)  Death or Disability

               The Term shall be terminated immediately and automatically
upon Employee's  death or "Disability."  The term "Disability" shall mean
Employee's inability to  perform all of the essential functions of his
position hereunder for a period of 26 consecutive weeks or for an aggregate of
150 work days during any 12-month period by reason  of  illness, accident or any
other physical or mental incapacity, as may be permitted by applicable law.
Employee's  capability to continue performance of Employee's  duties hereunder
shall be determined by a panel composed of two independent medical doctors
appointed by the Board and one appointed by the Employee or his designated
representative.  If the panel is unable to reach a decision the matter will be
referred to arbitration in accordance with Section 8.  In the event  of 
Employee's  death or Disability for any period of six consecutive months, 
Employee (or his designated beneficiary) will be paid his Base Salary then in 
effect for one full year following the date of death or  disability. 
 
          (c)  By Employee

               (i)  Employee may, in his sole discretion, without cause,
terminate the Term at any time upon 90 days' written notice to Employer.  If 
Employee exercises such termination right, Employer may, at its option, at any 
time after receiving such notice from Employee, relieve him of his duties and
terminate the Term at any time prior to the expiration of said notice period. 
If the Term is terminated by Employee or Employer pursuant to this Section
7(c)( i ), Employee shall not be entitled to any further Base Salary or the
accrual or provision of any compensation or benefits after the Termination
Date, including, without limitation, any of the medical and hospitalization
benefits described in Section 7(a)(ii)(1).  

               (ii) If, during the Term, a Change of Control (as defined
below) occurs and, without his consent, Employee is assigned duties materially
inconsistent with his position and status with Employer as of the date hereof,
Employee may, in his sole discretion, terminate the Term upon 30 days' notice
of Employer.  If Employee exercises such termination right, Employer may, at
its option, at any time after receiving such notice from Employee, relieve him
of his duties hereunder and terminate the Term at any time prior to the
expiration of said notice period.  If this Agreement is terminated by Employee
or Employer pursuant to this Section 7(c)(ii), Employee shall be entitled  (a)
to receive on or prior to the Termination Date a lump sum severance
compensation payment equal to two (2) times the total amount of Employee s
Base Salary payable hereunder, based on the amount in effect as of the
Termination Date; (b)  the medical and hospitalization benefits and all
compensation and other benefits that shall have accrued as of  the Termination
Date, as described in Section 7(a)(ii)(1); and (c) to the automatic vesting
and  exercisability  in whole or in part of all stock options or similar rights
to acquire capital stock granted by Employer to Employee; provided that
Employee shall not be entitled, after the Termination Date to the accrual or
provision of any other compensation or benefits payable hereunder, including
the Performance Bonus.

          (d)  Change of Control

               For purposes of this Section 7, a "Change of Control" shall
be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:
( i ) any "person", including a "group," as such terms as defined in Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules promulgated thereunder (collectively the "Exchange Act"), other than a
trustee or other fiduciary holding voting securities of Employer ("Voting
Securities") under any  Employer-sponsored  benefit plan, becomes the beneficial
owner, as defined under the Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, whether by
purchase or acquisition or agreement to act in concert or otherwise, of 30% or
more of the outstanding Voting Securities; (ii) a cash tender or exchange
offer is completed for such amount of Voting Securities which, together with
the Voting Securities then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the
offeror (and affiliates thereof) constitutes 40% or more of the outstanding
Voting Securities; (iii)  except in the case of a merger or consolidation in
which (a) Employer is the surviving corporation and (b) the holders of Voting
Securities immediately prior to such merger or consolidation beneficially own,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Voting Securities
immediately after such merger or consolidation (there being excluded from the
number of Voting Securities held by such holders, but not from the outstanding
Voting Securities, any Voting Securities received by affiliates of the other
constituent corporation(s) in the merger or consolidation in exchange for
stock of such other corporation), Employer's  shareholders approve an agreement
to merge, consolidate, liquidate, or sell all or substantially all of
Employer's assets; or (iv) two or more directors are elected to the Board
without having previously been nominated and approved by the members of the
Board incumbent on the day immediately preceding such  election.  For purposes
of this Section 7, "affiliate" of a person or another entity shall mean a
person or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by,
or is under common control with the person or other entity specified. 

          (e)  No Duty to Mitigate

               If Employee is entitled to the compensation and other
benefits provided under Sections 7(a)(ii) or (c)(ii), Employee shall have no
obligation to seek employment to mitigate his damages hereunder.

          8.   Arbitration

          Whenever a dispute arises between the parties concerning this
Agreement or any of the obligations hereunder, or Employee's  employment
generally, Employer and Employee shall use their best efforts to resolve the
dispute by mutual agreement.  If any dispute cannot be resolved by Employer
and Employee, it shall be submitted to arbitration to the exclusion of all
other avenues of relief and adjudicated pursuant to the American Arbitration
Association's Rules for Employment Dispute Resolution then in effect.  The
decision of the arbitrator must be in writing and shall be final and binding
on the parties, and judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any
court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator's authority in granting
relief to Employee shall be limited to an award of compensation, benefits and
 unreimbursed  expenses as described in Sections 3, 4, and 5 above, and to the
release of Employee from the provisions of Section 6 and the arbitrator shall
have no authority to award other types of damages or relief to Employee,
including consequential or punitive damages.  The arbitrator shall also have
no authority to award consequential or punitive damages to Employer for
violations of this Agreement by Employee.  The expenses of the arbitration
shall be borne by the losing party to the arbitration and the prevailing party
shall be entitled to recover from the losing party all of its or his own costs
and attorneys  fees with respect to the arbitration.  Nothing in this Section
8 shall be construed to derogate Employer's rights to seek legal and equitable
relief in a court of competent jurisdiction as contemplated by Section 6(h).

     9.   Non-Waiver

          It is understood and agreed that one party's failure at any time
to require the performance by the other party of any of the terms, provisions,
covenants or conditions hereof shall in no way affect the first party's right
thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either party of the
breach of any term, provision, covenant or condition hereof be taken or held
to be a waiver of any succeeding breach.

     10.  Severability

          If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the law under
which this Agreement is to be construed, or if any such provision is held
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or any
arbitrator, such provision shall be deleted from this Agreement and the
Agreement shall be construed to give full effect to the remaining provision
thereof.

     11.  Survivability

          Unless otherwise provided herein, upon termination of the Term,
the provisions of Sections 6(b), (d) and (e) shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect.

     12.  Governing Law

          This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed
according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to the
conflict of law provisions thereof.

     13.  Construction

          The paragraph headings and captions contained in this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not be construed to define, limit or affect
the scope or meaning of the provisions hereof.  All references herein to
Sections shall be deemed to refer to Sections of this Agreement.

     14.  Entire Agreement

          This Agreement contains and represents the entire agreement of
Employer and Employee and supersedes all prior agreements, representations or
understandings, oral or written, express or implied with respect to the
subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended in any
way unless in a writing signed by each of Employer and Employee.  No
representation, promise or inducement has been made by either Employer or  


Employee  that is not embodied in this Agreement, and neither Employer nor
Employee shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise
or inducement not specifically set forth herein.

     15.  Assignability

          Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations of Employer
or Employee hereunder may be assigned by Employer or Employee without the
other party's prior written consent.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Employer and Employee and
their heirs, successors and assigns.

     16.  Notices

          All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed properly given if delivered personally or sent by
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or
sent by telegram,  telelex ,  telecopy  or similar form of telecommunication,
