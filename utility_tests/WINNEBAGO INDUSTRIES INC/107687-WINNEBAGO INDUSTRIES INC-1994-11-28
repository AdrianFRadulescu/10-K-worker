                Report for the Fiscal Year Ended August 27, 1994


                                     PART I


ITEM 1.   Business

GENERAL

Winnebago  Industries,  Inc.  is a leading  U.S.  manufacturer  of motor  homes,
self-contained  recreation vehicles used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor
recreation  activities.  Motor  home and van  conversion  sales  by the  Company
represented more than 80 percent of its revenues in each of the past five fiscal
years. The Company's motor homes are sold through dealer organizations primarily
under the Winnebago, Itasca, Vectra, Rialta and Luxor brand names.

During fiscal 1994,  1993 and 1992,  other products  manufactured by the Company
consisted  principally of extruded aluminum and a variety of component  products
for other  manufacturers.  Service  revenues  during fiscal 1994,  1993 and 1992
consisted  principally of revenues from satellite  courier and tape  duplication
services.  Service revenues, in fiscal 1994 and 1993 also includes revenues from
floor  plan  financing  of  dealer   inventories  of  the  Company's   products.
Additionally in fiscal years prior to 1994,  service revenues  included revenues
from contract assembly of a variety of electronic products.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Iowa on February 12,
1958, and adopted its present name on February 28, 1961. The Company's executive
offices are located at 605 West Crystal Lake Road in Forest City,  Iowa.  Unless
the  context  indicates  otherwise,  the  term  "Company"  refers  to  Winnebago
Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.


PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS

The Company  determined it was  appropriate to define its operations  into three
business segments for fiscal 1994, (See Note 19, "Business Segment  Information"
in the  Company's  Annual Report to  Shareholders  for the year ended August 27,
1994).  However,  during each of the last five fiscal years, at least 88% of the
revenues of the Company were derived from recreational vehicle products.

The following table sets forth the respective  contribution to the Company's net
revenues  by product  class for each of the last five fiscal  years  (dollars in
thousands):

(2)  Subsequent to August 27, 1994, the Company discontinued its van conversion
     operations.

The primary use of recreation vehicles for leisure travel and outdoor recreation
has historically led to a peak retail selling season  concentrated in the spring
and summer  months.  The Company's  sales of  recreation  vehicles are generally
influenced  by this  pattern in retail  sales,  but can also be  affected by the
level of dealer  inventory.  The Company has generally  manufactured  recreation
vehicles during the entire year,  both for immediate  delivery and for inventory
to satisfy the peak selling season.  During fiscal years when interest rates are
high and/or market conditions are uncertain,  the Company attempts to maintain a
lower level of inventory of recreation  vehicles.  Order backlog  information is
not deemed significant to understand the Company's business.

Presently,   the  Company  meets  its  working  capital  and  capital  equipment
requirements  and  cash   requirements  of  subsidiaries  with  funds  generated
internally and funds from  agreements with financial  institutions.  Since March
26,  1992,  the  Company  has  had  a  financing  and  security  agreement  with
NationsCredit  Corporation,  formerly  Chrysler  First  Commercial  Corporation.
Additionally,  on February 24, 1994,  the Company and  Cycle-Sat  entered into a
$3,000,000  line of credit with  Firstar Bank Cedar  Rapids.  (See Note 8, Notes
Payable,  in the  Company's  Annual  Report to  Shareholders  for the year ended
August 27, 1994.)

RECREATION VEHICLES

MOTOR HOMES - A motor home is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as
a temporary dwelling during vacation and camping trips.

Among the Recreation  Vehicle Industry  Association  (RVIA)  classifications  of
motor homes, Winnebago currently manufactures and sells three types:

     Class A  models  are  conventional  motor  homes  constructed  directly  on
     medium-duty  truck chassis  which include the engine and drive  components.
     The living area and driver's  compartment  are designed and produced by the
     recreation vehicle manufacturer.

     Class B models are a panel-type truck to which sleeping, kitchen and toilet
     facilities are added.  These models also have a top extension added to them
     for more head room.

     Class C models are mini motor homes built on  van-type  chassis  onto which
     the  manufacturer  constructs  a living  area with  access to the  driver's
     compartment. Certain models of the Company's Class C units include van-type
     driver's compartments built by the Company.

The Company  currently  manufactures  and sells motor homes  primarily under the
Winnebago, Itasca, Vectra, Rialta and Luxor brand names. The Class A and Class C
motor homes generally  provide living  accommodations  for four to seven persons
and include  kitchen,  dining,  sleeping and bath areas,  and in some models,  a
lounge.   Optional  equipment  accessories  include,   among  other  items,  air
conditioning,  electric  power  plant,  stereo  system and a wide  selection  of
interior equipment.

A subsidiary,  Winnebago Industries Europe GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary,  was
formed in fiscal 1992 to expand the Company's presence in Europe.  (See Note 19,
Business Segment Information, in the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for
the year ended August 27, 1994.)

Except for the Company's new Rialtas,  the Company's motor homes are sold with a
basic  warranty  against  defects in workmanship or materials for a period of 12
months or 15,000 miles,  whichever  occurs first.  The Company's new Rialtas are
sold with a basic  warranty  package for a period of 24 months or 24,000  miles,
whichever  occurs first.  At the  expiration of the basic warranty  period,  the
first  owner  receives  a  36-month  or  36,000-mile,  whichever  occurs  first,
structure  warranty against  delamination on the sidewalls and back walls.  This
36-month or 36,000-mile  extension  does not apply to the Winnebago  Warrior and
Itasca Passage models.

The  Company's  motor  homes are sold by dealers in the retail  market at prices
ranging from approximately $32,000 to more than $170,000,  depending on size and
model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.

The Company  currently  manufactures  Class A and Class C motor homes ranging in
length from 23 to 37 feet and 21 to 29 feet, respectively. The Company's Class B
motor homes are 17 feet in length.

COMPONENT  PARTS  AND  ACCESSORIES  -  The  Company  manufactures  or  purchases
component  parts and accessory  items primarily for its and, to a lesser extent,
other recreation vehicle  manufacturers'  units. These parts and accessories are
sold to distributors, manufacturers and dealers.

NON-RECREATION VEHICLE ACTIVITIES

OEM - Original equipment  manufacturer sales of component parts such as aluminum
extrusions,  metal  stamping,  rotational  moldings,  vacuum formed plastics and
fiberglass to outside manufacturers.

CYCLE-SAT, INC. - Through the use of the latest innovations in satellite,  fiber
optic  and  digital  technologies,  Cycle-Sat  has  grown to  become  a  leading
high-speed  distributor  of  television  and  radio  commercials.  To this  end,
Cycle-Sat employs a satellite-assisted  duplication center in Memphis, Tennessee
and a  patented  satellite  network  in place at  approximately  545  television
stations in the U.S. and Canada.  The Company's patented  Cyclecypher  equipment
allows the direct and  automatic  distribution  of  television  commercials  and
traffic  instructions  to  specific  television  and radio  stations.  Ancillary
services  include audio and video post production  services and the operation of
two satellite  news  gathering  vehicles,  which are leased to provide spot news
coverage of sports events and for corporate videoconferences.

WINNEBAGO  ACCEPTANCE  CORPORATION  - Prior to the sale of its dealer floor plan
receivables  in February  1990,  WAC provided  financing for selected  Winnebago
dealers for floor plan and rental units. Subsequent to the February 1990 sale of
its dealer floor plan receivables,  WAC has only engaged in floor plan financing
for a limited number of dealers during fiscal years 1993 and 1994.

DISCONTINUED ACTIVITIES - The Company discontinued its van conversion operations
subsequent to August 27, 1994.

The Company  sold a majority of the assets of North Iowa  Electronics,  Inc.,  a
contract assembler of a variety of electronic  products,  on August 8, 1993. See
Note 3 in the Company's  Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended August
27, 1994.

On September 20, 1991, the Company  discontinued its Commercial Vehicle Division
operations  (manufacturing  of route delivery vans). See Note 2 in the Company's
Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended August 27, 1994.

PRODUCTION

The Company's  Forest City facilities  have been designed to provide  vertically
integrated production line manufacturing. The Company also operates a fiberglass
manufacturing  facility in Hampton,  Iowa,  and a sewing  operation  in Lorimor,
Iowa. The Company  manufactures  the majority of the components  utilized in its
motor homes, with the exception of the chassis,  engines,  auxiliary power units
and appliances.

Most of the raw materials and components  utilized by the Company are obtainable
from numerous  sources.  The Company believes that substitutes for raw materials
and  components,  with the  exception of chassis,  would be  obtainable  with no
material impact on the Company's operations. The Company purchases Class A and C
chassis and engines from General  Motors  Corporation  - Chevrolet  Division and
Ford Motor  Company;  Class C chassis and engines  from  Volkswagen  of America,
Inc.; and Class A chassis and engines from Oshkosh Truck Corporation and Spartan
Motors,  Inc.  Only two  vendors  accounted  for as much as five  percent of the
Company's  purchases in fiscal 1994,  General Motors  Corporation and Ford Motor
Company (approximately 17 percent, in the aggregate).

Class B chassis and engines from Volkswagen of America, Inc. are utilized in the
Company's EuroVan Camper.

Motor home bodies are made principally of Thermo-Panel materials: the lamination
of aluminum  and/or  fiberglass,  extruded  polystyrene  foam and  plywood  into
lightweight rigid structural panels by a process developed by the Company. These
panels  are cut to form the floor,  roof and  sidewalls.  Additional  structural
strength  is   provided  by   Thermo-Steel(R)   construction,   which   combines
Thermo-Panel  materials  and a framework of heavy gauge steel  reinforcement  at
structural  stress points.  The body is designed to meet rigid Winnebago  safety
standards,  with most models  subjected  to computer  stress  analysis.  Certain
models of motor  homes  are made in part of other  materials  such as  aluminum,
fiberglass and plastic.

The Company  manufactures  tip-out  windows,  lavatories,  and all of the doors,
cabinets,  shower pans, waste holding tanks,  wheel wells and sun visors used in
its recreation  vehicles.  In addition,  the Company produces most of the doors,
bucket  seats,   upholstery  items,  lounge  and  dinette  seats,  seat  covers,
mattresses, decorator pillows, curtains and drapes.

The Company produces  substantially all of the raw, anodized and  powder-painted
aluminum  extrusions  used for  interior  and  exterior  trim in its  recreation
vehicles. The Company also sells aluminum extrusions to over 130 customers.

DISTRIBUTION AND FINANCING

The Company  markets its recreation  vehicles on a wholesale  basis to a broadly
diversified dealer  organization  located throughout the United States and, to a
limited extent, in Canada and other foreign countries.  Foreign sales, including
Canada,  were less than ten percent of net revenues in fiscal 1994. As of August
27, 1994, the motor home dealer organization included approximately 325 dealers,
compared to approximately 310 dealers at August 28, 1993. During fiscal 1994, 13
dealers  accounted for  approximately  25 percent of motor home unit sales,  and
only one dealer  accounted for more than four percent  (4.3%) of motor home unit
sales.

The Company has sales  agreements with dealers which are renewed on an annual or
bi-annual  basis.  Many of the  dealers  are  also  engaged  in  other  areas of
business,  including the sale of automobiles, and many dealers carry one or more
competitive  lines.  The  Company  continues  to  place  high  emphasis  on  the
capability  of its  dealers  to  provide  complete  service  for its  recreation
vehicles.  Dealers  are  obligated  to provide  full  service  for owners of the
Company's  recreation  vehicles,  or in lieu thereof,  to secure such service at
their own expense from other authorized firms.

At August 27, 1994,  the Company had a staff of 34 people engaged in field sales
and service to the motor home dealer organization.

The Company  advertises and promotes its products  through national RV magazines
and cable TV networks  and on a local basis  through  trade  shows,  television,
radio and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers.

Substantially  all sales of  recreation  vehicles  to  dealers  are made on cash
terms.  Most  dealers are financed on a "floor plan" basis under which a bank or
finance  company  lends the dealer all, or  substantially  all, of the  purchase
price,  collateralized  by a lien upon, or title to, the merchandise  purchased.
Upon  request of a lending  institution  financing a dealer's  purchases  of the
Company's products, and after completion of a credit investigation of the dealer
involved,  the Company  will execute a repurchase  agreement.  These  agreements
provide that, in the event of default by the dealer on the dealer's agreement to
pay  the  lending   institution,   the  Company  will  repurchase  the  financed
merchandise. The agreements provide that the Company's liability will not exceed
100 percent of the invoice price and provide for periodic  liability  reductions
based on the  time  since  the date of the  invoice.  The  Company's  contingent
liability  on all  repurchase  agreements  was  approximately  $118,954,000  and
$101,445,000 at August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993,  respectively.  Included in
these  contingent  liabilities are  approximately  $36,231,000 and  $27,758,000,
respectively, of certain dealer receivables subject to recourse, (See Note 11 in
the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended August 27, 1994).
The  Company's   contingent   liability  under  repurchase   agreements   varies
significantly from time to time, depending upon seasonal shipments, competition,
dealer organization, gasoline supply and availability of bank financing.

Since fiscal 1984, the Company has made  available to retail  customers a retail
financing  program which  provides loans with up to 15-year terms for motor home
financing at favorable rates through participation with a financial institution.
The Company,  from time to time, offers retail financing  incentives in the form
of lower interest rates to attract customers to purchase motor homes.

COMPETITION

The  recreation  vehicle  market  is  highly  competitive,  both as to price and
quality of the product.  The Company believes its principal marketing advantages
are the quality of its  products,  its dealer  organization,  its  warranty  and
service capability and its marketing techniques.  The Company also believes that
its prices are competitive with those of units of comparable size and quality.

The Company is a leading  manufacturer  of motor homes.  For the 12 months ended
August 31, 1994, RVIA reported  factory  shipments of 36,300 Class A motor homes
and 16,900 Class C motor homes.  Unit sales of such  products by the Company for
the last five fiscal years are shown  elsewhere  in this report.  The Company is
not a  significant  factor  in the  markets  for its  other  recreation  vehicle
products and its  non-recreation  vehicle products and services,  except for the
markets serviced by Cycle-Sat,  which is a major factor in the satellite courier
and tape duplication business.

REGULATION, TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

The plumbing,  heating and electrical systems  manufactured and installed in all
of the  Company's  motor homes are  manufactured  and installed to meet National
Fire Protection  Association 501C (American National Standards  Institute 119.2)
as well as Federal Motor Vehicle Safety  Standards  applicable to motor homes. A
variety  of  other  federal  and  state  regulations  pertaining  to  safety  in
recreation  vehicles  have been adopted or are proposed  from time to time.  The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all such existing regulations and
while it is not able to predict  what  effect the  adoption  of any such  future
regulations  will have on its business,  it is confident of its ability to equal
or exceed any reasonable safety standards.

The Company has several  registered  trademarks,  including  Winnebago,  Itasca,
Chieftain,   Minnie  Winnie,  Brave,  Passage,  Sunrise,   Adventurer,   Spirit,
Suncruiser,  Sundancer,  Sunflyer,  Warrior,  Elante', Vectra,  Thermo-Panel and
Thermo-Steel, .

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

During fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company spent  approximately  $1,704,000,
$1,077,000 and $1,820,000, respectively, on research and development activities.
These  activities  involved the equivalent of 30, 17 and 34 full-time  employees
during fiscal 1994,  1993 and 1992,  respectively.  Figures for fiscal 1992 have
been  restated  to exclude  expenses  for the  discontinued  Commercial  Vehicle
Division.

HUMAN RESOURCES

As of  September  1, 1994,  1993 and 1992,  the Company  employed  approximately
3,150, 2,770 and 2,530 persons,  respectively.  Of these,  approximately  2,300,
2,090 and  1,820  persons,  respectively,  were  engaged  in  manufacturing  and
shipping  functions.  None  of the  Company's  employees  are  covered  under  a
collective bargaining agreement.


ITEM 2.  Properties

The Company's manufacturing, maintenance and service operations are conducted in
multi-building  complexes,  containing an aggregate of  approximately  1,417,000
square feet in Forest City,  Iowa.  The Company also owns 698,000 square feet of
warehouse  facilities  located in Forest City. The Company leases  approximately
235,000 square feet of its unoccupied manufacturing facilities in Forest City to
others.  In fiscal 1989,  the Company  purchased a 308,000  square foot shopping
mall on 30 acres in Temple,  Texas.  At August  27,  1994,  a  customer  service
facility operation occupied approximately 75,000 square feet of the mall and the
Company had leased a majority  of the  remainder  of the mall to various  retail
stores. The Company also leases a manufacturing  facility and a storage facility
in Hampton, Iowa (74,000 square feet and 10,000 square feet) and a manufacturing
facility in Lorimor,  Iowa (17,200 square feet).  Leases on the above facilities
expire at various dates,  the earliest of which is March,  1996. In fiscal 1993,
Winnebago  Industries  Europe GmbH purchased a distribution and service facility
in Kirkel,  Germany.  The facility has  approximately  16,700 square feet and is
located  on  approximately  six acres of land.  The  Company  also owns a 14,400
square foot facility in Forest City which is leased to Cycle-Sat.  The Company's
facilities in Forest City are located on  approximately  784 acres of land,  all
owned by the Company.

Most of the Company's buildings are of steel or steel and concrete  construction
and are fire  resistant with  high-pressure  sprinkler  systems,  dust collector
systems,  automatic fire doors and alarm systems.  The Company believes that its
facilities and equipment are well maintained,  in excellent condition,  suitable
for the purposes for which they are intended and adequate to meet the  Company's
needs for the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

On April 23, 1991,  the Federal Trade  Commission  ("FTC") issued to the Company
Civil  Investigative  Demands  to  produce  documents  and  answers  to  written
interrogatories  in  connection  with an  investigation  of whether  the Company
engaged in deceptive  practices in selling  approximately  7,800 diesel  powered
LeSharo and Phasar motor homes and Centauri and utility vans which were produced
between 1983 and 1986.  After  narrowing the FTC's Civil  Investigative  Demands
through a motion to quash and subsequent  stipulated order, the Company produced
responsive  documents at its  corporate  offices in December,  1991 and January,
1992.  The  Company had no further  contact  with the FTC for  approximately  26
months when the  Company's  FTC Counsel in  Washington,  D.C.  received a letter
dated March 22, 1994 from the FTC staff in which it was  suggested  that the FTC
staff had  concluded  that the Company had engaged in violations of Section 5 of
the FTC Act in  connection  with the marketing and sale of certain of the diesel
and gasoline  LeSharo and Phasar motor homes and Centauri and utility vans.  The
FTC staff letter also  suggested a willingness  to pursue  consent  negotiations
with  the  Company  or  otherwise  that  the FTC  staff  would  be  preparing  a
recommendation  to the commission that it issue a complaint  against the Company
seeking consumer redress and other equitable relief. Any recommendation  made by
the FTC staff  would have to be approved by the  Commission  itself.  If the FTC
should  decide to issue such a  complaint,  the  Company  believes it would have
meritorious  defenses to the same and further  believes  that the FTC would have
several  significant  hurdles to overcome  including the statute of  limitations
issues. Contemporaneously,  the Company has contacted Regie Nationale Des Unises
Renault,   the   manufacturer  of  a  majority  of  the  component  parts  under
investigation by the FTC,  relative to the most recent action taken by the FTC's
staff.

In  addition  to the  foregoing,  the  Company  is  involved  in  various  legal
proceedings which are ordinary routine litigation incident to its business, many
of which are covered in whole or in part by  insurance.  Counsel for the Company
based  on  his  present   knowledge  of  pending  legal  proceedings  and  after
consultation with trial counsel, has advised the Company that, while the outcome
of such  litigation is uncertain,  he is of the opinion that it is unlikely that
these  proceedings will result in any recovery which will materially  exceed the
Company's reserve for estimated losses. On the basis of such advice,  Management
is of the opinion that the pending legal  proceedings will not have any material
adverse  effect on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

                                  UNDERTAKING

For the purposes of complying  with the  amendments to the rules  governing Form
S-8 (effective  July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned
registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated
by reference into registrant's  Registration Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 2-40316
(which  became  effective  on or about June 10,  1971),  2-73221  (which  became
effective on or about August 5, 1981),  2-82109  (which  became  effective on or
about March 15,  1983),  33-21757  (which  became  effective on or about May 31,
1988), and 33-59930 (which became effective on or about March 24, 1993):

Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of  1933  and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the  event  that a  claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant of expenses  incurred or paid by a director,  officer or  controlling
person of the  registrant  in the  successful  defense  of any  action,  suit or
proceeding)  is  asserted by such  director,  officer or  controlling  person in
connection with the securities being registered,  the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit  to a  court  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  the  question  whether  such
indemnifi-cation by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


                                   SIGNATURES



Pursuant to the  requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934,  the  Registrant  has duly  caused  this report to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Board of Directors and Shareholders
Winnebago Industries, Inc.
Forest City, Iowa


We have audited the consolidated  financial statements of Winnebago  Industries,
Inc. and  subsidiaries  (the  Company) as of August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993
and for each of the three  years in the period  ended  August 27,  1994 and have

Purchases.

NationsCredit,  or (iii)  used  Product  acquired  by a Dealer  as trades on the
purchase of new Product  which are to be held in Dealer's  inventory  for future
resale and not for rental or lease.

        (e) "Finance  Transactions"  shall mean the  obligations  of Dealers to
repay NationsCredit (i) for advances of money made by NationsCredit to Client on
behalf of Dealers for the  financing of sales of Eligible  Products by Client to

shall include Rental Transactions.

         (f) "Loan  Agreement" means the Financing and Security  Agreement dated
March 26. 1992. between Client and NationsCredit.

         (g) "Loss" or "Losses" shall mean any unpaid principal amounts owing to

Transactions  are in  default  in their  repayment  schedule  or are  "sold  and
unpaid".

         (h) "Prime Rate" shall be the Prime Rate as announced by NationsBank of
North  Carolina  N.A.  on the  last day of an  Accounting  Month  effective  for
outstanding  balances in the successive  Accounting  Month. When a change in the

successive  Accounting  Month.  The new Prime Rate will apply to new advances as
well as to existing balances from the first day of the Accounting Month in which
the new Prime Rate is effective.

         (i) "Rental  Transactions" shall mean those Finance  Transactions where
the Dealer's  obligation  to repay  NationsCredit  is for new Eligible  Products
intended to be rented to retail customers.

2.   COMPENSATION OF NATIONSCREDIT

         (a) Finance  charges to Client and Dealers,  terms of payment by Client
and Dealers and all other terms with respect to all Finance  Transactions  shall
be as agreed upon from time to time by NationsCredit and Client.
Beginning rates, terms and fees shall be as follows:

             (i)    NationsCredit  will receive Prime Rate minus 2.00% per annum
                    computed  on the  average  daily  outstanding  balances  due
                    NationsCredit  on  Finance  Transactions  for  new  Eligible
                    Product that are not Rental Transactions.

             (ii)   A monthly  service fee, in an amount equal to 3.5% per annum
                    (calculated  on a 30-day  period)  computed upon the average
                    daily  outstanding  balances in any month due  NationsCredit
                    from Dealers  under the Finance  Program.  The average daily
                    outstanding  balances  shall be arrived at by computing  the
                    daily outstanding balances adding each day's balance for any
                    given accounting month and dividing the sum by the number of
                    days in that accounting month.

             (iii)  All  charges  shall be billed  monthly to the Client  and/or
                    Dealers and payable  upon  receipt on the basis of a 360 day
                    year for the actual number of days elapsed.  Monthly charges
                    shall be calculated by multiplying the  corresponding  daily
                    rate  by  the  number  of  days  in  the  Accounting  Month,
                    multiplying  the  resulting  product  by the  average  daily
                    balance  of all  Finance  Transactions.  The  average  daily
                    balance  shall be computed by adding the ending  balance for
                    each day in the Accounting Month and dividing the sum by the
                    number of days in that Accounting Month.

             (iv)   Notwithstanding   changes   in  the  Prime  Rate  which  may
                    fluctuate  from time to time,  the minimum  Prime Rate to be
                    used in calculating charges shall be 6.5% per annum.

         (c)  Client  will  pay to  NationsCredit  a fee of  Forty-five  Dollars
($45.00)  for each  Dealer  visited by a  NationsCredit  representative  for the
purpose of obtaining signed documents  pursuant to 3(b) of this Agreement.  This
fee may be increased from time to time at the sole discretion of NationsCredit.

by Dealers .

         (b)  NationsCredit  will  supply  to  Client a  security  agreement  in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A and all other forms required
to be signed by  Dealers  prior to  NationsCredit's  entering  into any  Finance
Transactions.  If used  Eligible  Product is to be financed for the Dealer,  the
security  agreement  will be in  substantially  the form of  Exhibit B  attached
hereto. Upon the agreement of the parties,  NationsCredit will attempt to obtain
from  Dealers a signed  security  agreement  and all other forms  required to be
signed by  Dealers  in  consideration  of the  payment  of the fees set forth in
paragraph 2(c).

         (c)  NationsCredit  agrees to review the  recommendation  of Client for
approval of any dealer  proposed by Client for  financing  by  NationsCredit  of
Eligible  Products.  NationsCredit  shall have the ultimate  right to approve or
disapprove any such recommendations, to determine and establish credit lines and
limits  for any  proposed  dealer  and to  terminate  or reduce  any  previously
approved credit line for any Dealer without in any way diminishing the liability
of Client for Losses or to repurchase Eligible Products.

         (d)  NationsCredit  will  promptly  advance  funds by wire  transfer to
Client on behalf of any Dealer in an amount  equal to the net  invoice  price of
each unit of new Eligible  Product(s)  shown on copies of invoices  submitted to
it; provided,  however, that NationsCredit may deduct from the proceeds of those
advances any amounts owing to it by Client pursuant to this Agreement,  the Loan
Agreement  between  NationsCredit and Client, or any other agreement between the
parties.

              NationsCredit  will  advance  funds to Dealers  and/or to any lien
holders on the Dealers  behalf for the  purchase of used  Eligible  Product upon
receipt  from the  Dealer of a  request  for an  advance  in  writing  with such
information and representations as shall be required by NationsCredit.

         (e) NationsCredit will provide the following administrative, accounting
and information services for Client in connection with all Finance Transactions.

             (i)    Accounting

                    Establish  accounting  records for each Dealer to record all
                    sales made by Client to that Dealer  pursuant to the Finance
                    Program,  payments made by Dealer on its purchases under the
                    Finance Program,  and other appropriate  debits and credits;
                    and,  generally,  keeping  those data  records  necessary to
                    service the Finance Program.

             (ii)   Billing

                    Mail or deliver to each Dealer a statement reflecting debits
                    and credits on the Dealer's account  promptly  following the
                    first business day of each Accounting  Month, and such other
                    statements  as  required  from time to time to  reflect  any
                    payment then due or to become due on that account.

             (iii)  Reports

                    Produce  reports  for each  Dealer  as it  generates  in the
                    normal  course of  conducting  its business for service only
                    clients   and  which  are  being   produced   currently   by
                    NationsCredit's  data  processing  system  ("NationsCredit's
                    System").

             (iv)   Provide  access to its host computer so that Client can have
                    access  to all  of  the  information  regarding  all  Dealer
                    accounts at the same time such  information  is available to
                    NationsCredit provided Client bears all out-of-pocket costs.

         (f) NationsCredit  will use reasonable  efforts to collect  outstanding
Finance Transactions.  Those efforts shall consist of sending notices and making
demands  for  payment  upon  Dealers  as  NationsCredit  shall  determine  to be
necessary  in its  discretion.  NationsCredit  shall not be  required,  prior to
making demand upon Client for payment of Losses,  nor as a condition to Client's
liability, to commence litigation for the collection of any Finance Transactions
outstanding  with any Dealer in default or to enforce or attempt to enforce  any
rights it may have as a secured creditor holding a security interest in Eligible
Products, its proceeds or any other collateral.

         (g)  NationsCredit  shall not be  required to  repossess  or attempt to
repossess  any  Eligible  Products,  proceeds or other  collateral  constituting
security for Finance  Transactions,  but  NationsCredit  will, at the request of
Client,  proceed  with the  Client to  repossess  or  attempt  to  repossess  by
providing personnel or other facilities whenever it is in a position to do so.

         (h)  NationsCredit  will  commence  in its name  proceedings  to obtain
possession  of Eligible  Products by  replevin  or similar  litigation  upon the
request of Client whenever a repossession  of Eligible  Products is not possible
to be made peaceably.

         (i) NationsCredit will take all steps necessary in order to perfect its
security  interest in new Eligible  Products,  including  searching to ascertain
whether any Dealer had  previously  granted a security  interest in the Eligible
Products to third persons,  notifying the holders of any such security interests
of  NationsCredit's  intention  to take a purchase  money  security  interest in
Eligible Products, filing of financing statements covering the Eligible Products
where  required  and  notifying  the Client  that it may then ship new  Eligible
Product to its Dealer.  In the State of Louisiana,  NationsCredit  will take all
steps  necessary  to obtain a  security  interest  in or lien upon new  Eligible
Products provided, however,  NationsCredit will not obtain a first purchase more
security   interest   requiring   notification   to  prior   filed   parties  or
subordinations by prior filed collateral  chattel mortgagees unless it may agree
to do so, in  writing,  separate  and apart from this  Agreement.  NationsCredit
makes no warranties or  representations  that it will prevail in the enforcement
of a security  interest in Eligible Products which are the subject of the Rental
Transactions  or  used  Eligible  Product  which  is the  subject  of a  Finance
Transaction.  For  the  purposes  of this  subsection,  NationsCredit  shall  be
entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of all information  concerning
any Dealer submitted by Client to NationsCredit.

Prior  to  advancing  on  used  Eligible  Product,   NationsCredit  will  obtain
termination or  subordination  of any prior filed  financing  statements  with a
collateral description which would include used Eligible Product.  NationsCredit
will attempt to obtain the  certificate  of title for each unit of used Eligible
Product which may show as owner either the Dealer's customers from whom the unit
was purchased as a trade, or the Dealer, with all liens released.  NationsCredit
will not be required to determine whether the Dealer has complied with any state
certificate of title laws necessary to have a valid title issued.

         (j) NationsCredit  will make or cause to be made a physical  inspection
of Eligible  Products  constituting  inventory of each Dealer with whom it shall
have  outstanding  Finance  Transactions  including but not limited to, Eligible
Product  which is the subject of a Rental  Transaction  and which is on Dealer's
premises. Inspections shall be once each thirty (30) days plus a grace period of
fifteen  (15)  days,  but in any event  not less  than ten (10)  times per year.
NationsCredit's  duties shall consist of verifying the physical  presence at the
location of Dealer of all items of Eligible Products included in any outstanding
Finance  Transactions,  and if any items are not present,  demanding payment for
them from the Dealer.  NationsCredit may, but shall not be required,  to inspect
the Dealer's business records or to otherwise  determine or verify the status of
any  item  of  Eligible  Product  if it is  present  on the  Dealer's  premises.
NationsCredit  will not perform the  inventory  inspection  services for Dealers
located in Alaska and Hawaii; however, NationsCredit will arrange for inspection
by a  third  party  contractor  with  all  costs  of  such  inspection  services
reimbursed by Client.  Client  agrees to waive any claim  against  NationsCredit
arising out of the inspection services performed by the third party contractor.

In the case of new Eligible  Product  that was  acquired by Client's  Dealer for
rental or was converted into a Rental Transaction,  and such item is not present
on the Dealer's premises at the time of an inventory  inspection,  NationsCredit
may, but shall not be required to, obtain a copy of the rental agreement entered
into between the Dealer and its customer for that Product.  NationsCredit  shall
have no obligation  whatsoever to determine the  genuineness  or validity of any
rental agreement.

         (k)  NationsCredit  will monitor the insurance  coverage to assure that
personal  property  insurance is being  maintained  on the  Eligible  Product by
Dealers and that no lapses occur; if lapses occur,  NationsCredit may, but shall
not be required, to obtain insurance coverage for such premiums to the Dealer as
may be  required.  In the event that these  premiums are not paid by the Dealer,
NationsCredit will notify Client of the Dealer's default. Client agrees that any
accrued and unpaid  premiums shall be the  responsibility  of Client pursuant to
Section 5.

          (I)  NationsCredit agrees to finance Rental Transactions as follows:

               (i)  The invoices  submitted for new Eligible Product intended to
                    be rented to a retail customer must be noted as "rental" and
                    the Rental  Transaction  is to be  repayable  in twelve (12)
                    substantially equal and consecutive monthly  installments of
                    principal  plus  interest,  after which period any remaining
                    principal  balance and accrued and unpaid  charges  shall be
                    immediately due and payable in full.

               (ii) A Rental Transaction will mature and any remaining principal
                    balance,  accrued interest,  and charges will be immediately
                    due and  payable  in full upon (1) the sale of the  Eligible
                    Product which is the subject of the Rental  Transaction;  or
                    (2)  upon  NationsCredit's  physical  verification  that the
                    mileage of the Eligible Product has reached 25,000 miles, or

               (iii)At the election of the Dealer and with the prior approval of
                    NationsCredit,   a  Finance  Transaction  for  new  Eligible
                    Product may be converted into a Rental  Transaction upon (1)
                    written  notification by Dealer to NationsCredit of Dealer's
                    intent  to  convert  new   Eligible   Product  to  a  Rental
                    Transaction;  and (2) delivery of the  Certificate  of Title
                    showing   NationsCredit  as  the  first  lienholder  on  the
                    Eligible Product;  and (3) delivery of evidence of liability
                    insurance with respect to rental of the Eligible  Product to
                    a customer.  NationsCredit will not be required to determine
                    whether the Dealer has complied  with any state  certificate
                    of title  laws  necessary  to have a valid  title  issued or
                    state  insurance laws  necessary to have required  insurance
                    coverage.  Upon rental the Dealer  shall pay for the same in
                    accordance with the terms of Rental  Transactions  which are
                    contained herein. Once converted, the Rental Transaction may
                    not  revert to a Finance  Transaction  which is not a Rental
                    Transaction.   To  evidence  the  conversion  of  a  Finance
                    Transaction  to  a  Rental  Transaction,  NationsCredit  and
                    Client shall require the Dealer  promptly to send any rental
                    agreements  entered  into  by  them  with  customers  to the
                    NationsCredit    service    location   as    designated   by
                    NationsCredit.  In the event any Dealer  fails to do so, and
                    it is  discovered by  NationsCredit  at the time of its next
                    physical inspection of that Dealer's inventory that any unit
                    of  Eligible  Product is missing  and has not been paid for,
                    and for which  NationsCredit has not theretofore  received a
                    rental agreement  covering the same,  payment therefor shall
                    be due in full.  The only  form of  rental  agreement  which
                    shall be  considered  acceptable  by  NationsCredit  for the
                    purpose of this paragraph shall be agreed upon in writing by
                    Client  and  NationsCredit  and  shall be the  only  form so
                    considered acceptable.

4.   OBLIGATIONS OF CLIENT

     (a) Client  shall submit its  recommendation  to  NationsCredit  for credit
lines to be approved or disapproved by  NationsCredit  for proposed Dealers whom
Client wishes NationsCredit to finance. As part of those recommendations, Client
will submit credit information and history,  financial statements, and any other
information NationsCredit shall require for its review.

     (b) With  respect to any  shipment of new  Eligible  Products to any Dealer
that Client wishes to become the subject of a Finance Transaction,  Client shall
send a copy of the invoice(s)  representing  such shipment(s) to  NationsCredit,
which invoice(s) shall contain the model, serial number and total purchase price
to the  Dealer  for each  unit of new  Eligible  Products.  In  addition  to the
foregoing  information,  if new Eligible Products are to become the subject of a
Rental  Transaction,  the  invoice  copy  sent to  NationsCredit  shall be noted
"Rental"  and shall  include a statement of the terms of payment due by Dealers.
If used Eligible Product is to be the subject of a Finance  Transaction,  Client
agrees that the terms of the  financing  including  the  advance  amount and the
rates of charges, shall be determined by NationsCredit in its sole discretion.

     (c) Client  shall submit to  NationsCredit  a Security  Agreement  properly
signed by the Dealer in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit "A" or "B" and such
other  documents as  NationsCredit  may require unless  NationsCredit  agrees to
obtain such pursuant to paragraph 3(b).

     (d) It shall be Client's  obligation  to repossess  any  Eligible  Products
found in the possession of a defaulting Dealer and be responsible for its resale
or disposition,  until its repurchase from  NationsCredit as provided in Section
5.  Client  agrees  that it acts as  NationsCredit's  agent or as its  bailee in
arranging for repossession, storage, repair, shipment, or acting in any way with
respect to the Eligible Product.

     (e) As to any items of Eligible Product which NationsCredit  repossesses or
otherwise for any reason acts to protect a security interest in Eligible Product
against  third  parties,  Client  will pay to  NationsCredit  any  out-of-pocket
expenses   NationsCredit  incurs  in  repossessing  or  protecting  such  claim,
including but not limited to handling,  moving and storage expenses,  reasonable
attorney's fees and court costs.

     (f) Client agrees to pay all  NationsCredit's  filing and  recording  fees,
attorney's  fees and costs which relate to the  perfection  of a first  purchase
money  security  interest in  Louisiana  on Eligible  Product;  and all taxes or
stamps for recording purposes wherever required.

     (g) Client will  communicate  to Dealers all rates and terms that have been
agreed  upon from time to time  between  NationsCredit  and  Client and shall be
responsible to obtain from Dealers their agreement to pay the same.

     (h)  Client  agrees  that as long as  there  are any  Finance  Transactions
outstanding, it will furnish NationsCredit:

          (i) Annual  Report.  Within one  hundred  twenty  (120) days after the
     close of each  fiscal  year end of the  Client,  a copy of an annual  audit
     report of the Client,  prepared on a  consolidated  basis and in conformity
     with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied on a  consistent
     basis, and duly certified by independent  certified  public  accountants of
     recognized standing.

          (ii) Interim Reports.  Within forty-five (45) days after each quarter,
     except the last  quarter of each fiscal  year of the  Client,  a copy of an
     unaudited financial statement of the Client, prepared in the same manner as
     the audit  report  referred to above and  consisting  of at least a balance
     sheet as of the close of that quarter and  statements of earnings and their
     source and the  application  of funds for that  quarter  and for the period
     from the beginning of that fiscal year to the close of that quarter.

     (i)  Client  agrees  to  change  the  name  of  its  subsidiary  "Winnebago
Acceptance   Corporation"  so  that  the  name  becomes  available  for  use  by
NationsCredit  where required.  Client authorizes  NationsCredit to use the name
"Winnebago" for purposes of executing its obligations under this Agreement,  and
authorizes  its  continued  use by  NationsCredit  until  all  transactions  and
obligations under the Agreement are satisfied by Client.

5.   LIABILITY OF CLIENT

     (a)  Following  the  default  of any Dealer in the  payment of any  Finance
Transaction,  Client will repurchase from  NationsCredit  any Eligible  Products
found in the  possession  of the  defaulting  Dealer for an amount  equal to the
unpaid  principal  balance,  plus all accrued and unpaid  charges and  insurance
premiums owing on the related Finance  Transactions.  There shall be no limit to
this repurchase obligation.

     (b) All Finance  Transactions  entered into by NationsCredit  shall be with
full  recourse to Client so that  following the default of any Dealer in payment
of any  amounts  required  to be paid by the Dealer,  and  following  reasonable
efforts by NationsCredit to collect same without having to resort to litigation,
Client shall pay to NationsCredit on demand all Losses of NationsCredit.

     (c) In the event that NationsCredit files an action against a Dealer or any
other party (other than the Client) which may be directly or contingently liable
for payment of the Finance  Transaction,  Client will pay all of NationsCredit's
out-of-pocket  expenses,  fees and costs incurred.  If  NationsCredit  is made a
party to any action  brought by a third party  against  the Client,  Client will
defend  NationsCredit  and hold it harmless from any judgment,  claim or expense
which it might suffer as a result of the action (unless such judgment,  claim or
expense is determined to be due to NationsCredit's failure to perform its duties
and  responsibilities  under  this  Agreement).  Client  also  agrees to pay any
attorney's fees and court costs incurred by NationsCredit in enforcing  Client's
obligations under this Agreement.

6.   NATURE AND SCOPE OF CLIENT'S LIABILITY FOR LOSSES

    (a)  This  Section 6 and Section 5 shall  establish,  determine  and control
         Client's  liability for Losses in respect to all Finance  Transactions.
         Client's liability for Losses and its obligation to repurchase Eligible
         Products  shall not be avoided or limited  for any  reason,  including,
         without limitation,  usury, or any other defenses to payment claimed or
         alleged by any defaulting Dealer.

    (b)  Client waives presentment for payment,  acceptance,  protest and notice
         of protest and all other  notices to which it might be entitled by law,
         except as provided in this Agreement.  NationsCredit  may compromise or
         adjust  the  amounts  due upon any  Finance  Transactions  and upon the
         Eligible  Products to which they relate only with the written  approval
         of Client if Client is not then in breach of its obligations  hereunder
         or under the Loan  Agreement.  In the event  Client is in breach of its
         obligations hereunder or under the Loan Agreement, NationsCredit may so
         compromise or adjust without affecting Client's liability for Losses or
         to  repurchase   Eligible  Products  which  shall  continue  unaffected
         thereby.

   7.    RESERVE ACCOUNT

         An  account  shall  be  established  by  NationsCredit   (the  "Reserve
Account")  and  credits  and  charges  shall  be made  in  accordance  with  the
following:

     (a) NationsCredit will credit the Reserve Account in an amount equal to all
charges  collected from Dealers in excess of the charges due  NationsCredit  set
forth in Section 2.

     (b)  Any  amounts  required  to  be  paid  by  Client  may  be  charged  by
NationsCredit  against any balance in the Reserve Account.  However, the Reserve
Account  shall in no manner  affect  the  liability  of Client to pay  Losses of
NationsCredit,  nor shall  NationsCredit  debit the account for Losses as may be
owing  by  Client  so long as  Client  is not in  default  with  respect  to its
obligation to pay  NationsCredit's  Losses or to perform its  obligations  under
this Finance Agreement or is not in default under the Loan Agreement.

     (c) NationsCredit shall provide Client with a monthly report of any credits
or charges to the Reserve Account.

8.   SUBROGATION

     In the event Client is required to pay  NationsCredit  any amount by reason
of any  default by a Dealer in meeting  obligations  to  NationsCredit  and upon
Client's payment in full of all of such obligations,  Client shall be subrogated
to all rights which NationsCredit may have against such Dealer under any Finance
Transaction  covering such obligations and  NationsCredit  shall execute without
recourse,  any  assignment or other  documents as may be reasonably  required by
Client.

9.   ASSIGNMENT

     This  Agreement  shall not be  assigned  by either  party  without  written
consent of the other  provided,  however,  that  NationsCredit  may assign  this
Agreement in whole or in part to the corporation  created pursuant to 3(j) or to
any affiliated  company or wholly owned subsidiary of NationsCredit  without the
written consent of the Client.

10.  TERM AND TERMINATION

     The term of this Agreement  shall be three (3) years from March 26, 1992 to
March 25,  1995,  and shall  thereafter  continue  from year to year,  provided,
however,  that either party may terminate  this  agreement at any time after the
initial  three (3) year term by giving the other party one hundred  eighty (180)
days written notice of such termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not
affect obligations existing between the parties at the time of termination.

11.  AUTOMATIC TERMINATION AND BUYOUT

         This Agreement will terminate  immediately  and without notice upon the
occurrence of any of the following:

     (a) Client  defaults in the prompt  payment of any  amounts  when due under
this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties;

     (b) Client defaults or there occurs an event which with the passage of time
will  constitute a default under the Loan Agreement  between  NationsCredit  and
Client.

     (c) Client sustains a substantial adverse change in its financial condition
as  determined  by  NationsCredit  in its sole  discretion,  or  sells,  leases,
transfers  or  otherwise  disposes  of  substantially  all  of  its  assets,  or
consolidates  with or merges with any other entity,  or permits any other entity
to consolidate or merge into Client;

     (d)  Client  or  NationsCredit  commences  a case or an order of  relief is
entered  under the federal  bankruptcy  laws,  as now  constituted  or hereafter
amended,  or any other applicable  federal or state bankruptcy,  insolvency,  or
other  similar  law; or the consent by either of them to the  appointment  of or
taking  possession  by a receiver,  liquidator,  assignee,  trustee,  custodian,
sequestrator  (or other similar  official) of Client or  NationsCredit or of any
substantial  part of their  property,  or the  making  by  either of them of any
assignment  for  the  benefit  of  creditors,   or  the  failure  of  Client  or
NationsCredit  generally  to pay their  debts as such debts  become  due, or the
taking of corporate  action by Client or  NationsCredit in furtherance of any of
the foregoing.

         Upon  termination  due to the  occurrence  of events  set forth  above,
Client  shall  purchase  from  NationsCredit  all Finance  Transactions  for the
present  balance  outstanding  plus accrued  charges and insurance  fees, all as
reflected on the  Statements of Account of  NationsCredit.  NationsCredit  shall
execute such bills of sale and assignment as shall be necessary to complete such
sale.

12.  REMEDIES AND WAIVERS

     Both  NationsCredit and Client shall have the right to enforce any remedies
available to it under this Agreement partially, successively or concurrently and
any such action shall not prevent NationsCredit from pursuing any further remedy
it  may  have  hereunder  or by  law.  No  delay  or  failure  on  the  part  of
NationsCredit  to  exercise  any right or remedy  hereunder  upon any default or
breach  by  Client  of  any  provision  hereof  shall  be  considered  to  be an
abandonment  thereof so long as Client's default or breach continues,  nor shall
any waiver of a single  default  or breach be deemed a waiver of any  subsequent
default or breach.

13.  NOTICES

     Any notice of demand  required  to be given or made in writing  pursuant to
this Agreement shall be given by certified mail,  postage prepaid,  addressed to
the parties at their respective addresses shown on page 1 of this Agreement.

14.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT

     This  Agreement is being  entered into by the parties at the same time as a
Loan  Agreement is being  entered into by the parties  which will relate to some
terms and  conditions  of the  relationship  between  Client and  NationsCredit.
However,  this Agreement and all Addendums attached hereto constitute the entire
agreement  between the parties with respect to the financing of Client's Dealers
and supersedes all prior agreements whether written or oral with respect thereto
and shall not be  modified  orally.  This  Agreement  shall in all  respects  be
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

15.  JURISDICTION

     The  parties  agree that the courts of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania,
including the U. S.  District  Court for the Eastern  District of  Pennsylvania,
shall have  jurisdiction  to hear and  determine  any  claim,  dispute or demand
pertaining  to this  Agreement  and they  expressly  submit and  consent to such
jurisdiction.

16.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIALS

     Trial by jury in any suit, action or proceeding  arising on, out of, under,
or by reason of or  relating  in any way to this  Agreement  or any  transaction
under it, or concerning  the validity,  interpretation,  or  enforcement of this
Agreement between the parties, is hereby waived by each of them.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have signed this Agreement as of the
day and year at the beginning and this  Agreement  shall be effective as of that
date.

                           WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES, INC.
                               1994 ANNUAL REPORT

CORPORATE PROFILE
Winnebago Industries, Inc., headquartered in Forest City, Iowa, is a leading
United States manufacturer of motor homes, self-contained recreation vehicles
used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreation activities. Motor home
and van conversion sales represent more than 80 percent of the Company revenues.
These vehicles are sold through dealer organizations primarily under the
Winnebago(R), Itasca(R), Elante'(R), Vectra(R), Rialta(TM) and Luxor(TM) brand
names. The Company markets its recreation vehicles on a wholesale basis to a
broadly diversified organization of approximately 325 dealers located throughout
the United States, and to a limited extent, in Canada and other foreign
countries.

Winnebago Industries also owns an 80 percent interest in Cycle-Sat, Inc., a
telecommunications service firm that is a leading distributor of television and
radio commercials using satellite, fiber optic and digital technologies. In
addition to Cycle-Sat, service revenue includes floor plan financing of dealer
inventories of the Company's products provided by the Company's subsidiary,
Winnebago Acceptance Corporation. In fiscal years prior to 1994, service
revenues also included revenues from the Company's subsidiary, North Iowa
Electronics, Inc., which was sold during fiscal 1993.

MOTOR HOME PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION
The principal kinds of recreation vehicles manufactured by the Company in fiscal
1994 include:

CLASS A MOTOR HOMES
These are conventional motor homes constructed directly on medium-duty truck
chassis which include the engine and drivetrain components. The living area and
driver's compartment are designed and produced by Winnebago Industries, Inc.

Warrior(R), Chieftain(R) and Adventurer(R); Itasca Sunrise(R), Suncruiser(R) and
Passage(R); Elante'(R); Vectra(R); and Luxor(TM).

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Fiscal 1994 was a record year for revenues and the third year of improved
operating performance for Winnebago Industries. This achievement reflects our
continuing, relentless commitments to quality, value and broadening the
Winnebago Industries line of motor homes. We have also built a solid foundation
for growth at Cycle-Sat, our telecommunications subsidiary. This rapidly growing
business was profitable in 1994, and we feel it is poised for significant
growth.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the year ended August 27, 1994, revenues increased 18 percent to a record
$452.1 million, while income before the cumulative effect of a required
accounting change increased 88 percent to $17.4 million, or 69 cents per share.
This compares to net income of $9.3 million, or 37 cents per share, for fiscal
1993.

In the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the Company adopted the remaining portions
of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) No. 106, which relates to health
care and to other benefits provided to retirees. (Certain provisions of FASB No.
106 were adopted in fiscal 1992.) The cumulative effect of this required change
was a one-time, non-cash earnings reduction of $20.4 million, or 81 cents per
share. In the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a tax credit of $1.3
million, or 5 cents per share, as a result of the Company's improved operating
results which increases the likelihood of the Company realizing its tax assets.
After the recognition of tax credit and the accounting principle change, the
fiscal 1994 net loss was $3.0 million, or 12 cents per share.

OPERATING REVIEW
Sales of manufactured products, primarily motor homes, increased 19 percent to
$432.4 million. This strong gain was achieved despite a fourth-quarter shortage
of Class C chassis and parts for our new Rialta motor home. According to
Statistical Surveys, Inc., Winnebago Industries achieved a 16.8 percent share of
the motor home market for calendar 1994 through August 31, 1994, giving us a
strong number two market share, more than twice the level of our next closest
competitor. In addition, we are pleased to report that Winnebago motor homes are
the top selling brand in the world.

Winnebago Industries' strong motor home performance reflects a fundamental
commitment to quality and value, and to building strong dealer and consumer
relationships. We involve our employees in continuously seeking ways to reduce
cost without sacrificing quality. In addition, our emphasis on quality helped
significantly reduce warranty expense, as a percent of recreation vehicle
revenues, in each of the last five fiscal years.

In the second half of the year, we introduced three motor home models that
should add incremental volume in 1995. They are the EuroVan Camper, sold through
VW distributors, the upscale Luxor and the all-new fuel efficient
front-wheel-drive Rialta.

We also took important steps to expand our presence in Europe, a larger market
than the United States. In March, we held a grand opening of a new sales,
service and technical facility near Saarbrucken, Germany.

Cycle-Sat achieved a 27 percent increase in sales to $18.9 million, and a $3.0
million improvement in operating profit to $1.1 million. The subsidiary was
profitable in each quarter of fiscal 1994 and particularly benefitted from
strong movie promotion on television during the summer of 1994. Cycle-Sat
completed performance testing of its new Flat Antenna, for which it has
exclusive North American marketing and worldwide manufacturing rights. We have
received our first order for this product for home and business applications.

GROWTH STRATEGIES 

Our fundamental growth strategies are clear and straightforward. We will work
to:

*    Increase our motor home market share by maintaining an emphasis on quality
     and value, and by building strong dealer and consumer relationships.

*    Involve our employees in identifying and implementing programs that keep
     Winnebago Industries a low-cost motor home producer without sacrificing
     quality.

*    Develop motor homes that suit a range of lifestyles across a broad spectrum
     of price points.

*    Increase our presence in promising overseas markets, such as Europe and 
     Japan.

*    Expand the scope of Cycle-Sat's business to 
     increase its sales and profitability.

The objective of these strategies is to increase shareholder value
significantly. This is a fundamental goal of Winnebago Industries' management.

MANAGEMENT
We continued to strengthen our management team. The Company's board of directors
named Fred Dohrmann chief executive officer. Fred is a long-time Winnebago
employee who understands the importance of providing consumers with "best-buy"
products. Francis Zrostlik, president/director of Stellar Industries and a
member of the board from 1979 to 1986, was re-elected a director, bringing the
board to eight members.

OUTLOOK
We enter 1995 with a strong lineup of motor home models that have received
excellent dealer and consumer acceptance. In addition to new models, we have
incorporated significant new design, interior and engineering features on many
current models. While it is too early to predict what 1995 will bring, we are
encouraged by long-term motor home trends. Buyers age 50 and older are
increasing, and we are seeing more younger buyers, 35 to 49, purchasing motor
homes for weekend and vacation travel. We also look forward to a good year at
Cycle-Sat. Thank you for your support and interest in Winnebago. Sincerely,

John K. Hanson                Fred G. Dohrmann
Chairman of the Board         President and
                              Chief Executive Officer

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Over the past three years, a strengthening economy and changing demographics of
motor home buyers have fueled growth in the recreation vehicle (RV) industry.
Sales of Class A and conventional Class C (excluding micro-mini) Winnebago
Industries motor homes rose during fiscal 1994. This increase was led by the
conventional Class C segment during fiscal 1994 which recorded a gain of 26.5
percent in retail sales volume and 28.5 percent in wholesale sales volume
compared to the same period a year ago.

Extensive consumer research revealed that demographics for motor home buyers are
changing. Traditionally, buyers are aged 50 and older, with time and money to
enjoy leisure travel and outdoor recreation. Today, more "baby boomers," aged 35
to 49, are purchasing vehicles for weekend and vacation travel. Our new 1995
motor homes were developed to delight all customers, including younger and
first-time buyers. Models were updated with more modern conveniences and
comforts, while price-points were broadened within product lines. The new models
have been enthusiastically received, with initial dealer orders in fiscal 1995
significantly ahead of last year.

[CAPTION: A leader in innovation, Winnebago Industries has a patent pending on
the Itasca Suncruiser's unique new hydraulic room extension design. The
slide-out on this Suncruiser 34RQ model provides an open and spacious living
area for full-time active enjoyment.]

We have purposefully worked to differentiate models within our 1995 Class A
line, beginning with redesigns of our Winnebago and Itasca models. The Winnebago
Adventurer was remodeled as a wide-body unit (approximately 102 inches wide),
lending itself to increased design flexibility. Available in five models,
including a rear engine diesel pusher, the Adventurer ranges from 30 to 34 feet
in length.

The 1995 Itasca Suncruiser is the first motor home in the RV industry to offer a
new hydraulic room extension system from HWH Corporation, expanding the width of
the motor home by nearly three feet. Available on three of the six Suncruiser
models, the slider portion is approximately 13 feet long and provides for an
open and spacious living area.

Another Class A motor home, the mid-priced, bus-styled Vectra, now has five
popular models, ranging from 31 to 37 feet in length.

The Winnebago Brave and the Itasca Sunrise motor homes, our most popular models,
were expanded to include new 1995 diesel pusher models, offering the long-term
economic advantages of increased fuel mileage and engine longevity, as well as
floor plan flexibility and added space for the driver and copilot.

The Winnebago Warrior and Itasca Passage are economical introductions to the RV
lifestyle. With three floor plans from 23 to 25 feet in length, the Warrior and
Passage contain all the necessities for a comfortable vacation in a compact,
efficient layout.

The Luxor, a new premium motor home, was introduced late in fiscal 1994. The
opulent vehicle is our top-of-the-line entry into the wide-body, bus-styled
market. Strong initial orders indicate the success of this model.

Several changes were made in our 1995 conventional Class C lineup as well. The
new fuel-efficient, front-wheel-drive Rialta motor home was introduced in
limited quantities late in fiscal 1994. The Rialta utilizes a cab and drivetrain
components from Volkswagen AG in Germany, provided under an exclusive contract
with Volkswagen United States, Inc. This compact, multi-purpose vehicle has
distinctive European styling and uni-body construction.

Other Class C products include Winnebago Minnie 300 and Itasca Spirit lines
which feature four models in different configurations ranging from 21 feet to
nearly 29 feet in length. The upgraded Winnebago Minnie Winnie and Itasca
Sundancer lines are available in three models, including two wide-body designs
for 1995. Our Class C market share should benefit as production of the Rialta,
classified as a low-profile Class C, continues to expand.

In developing the Rialta project, part of our agreement with Volkswagen involved
production of a EuroVan Camper conversion package for Volks-wagen AG.
Approximately 120 Volkswagen dealers have signed agreements to sell and service
the new pop-top EuroVan Camper for the U.S. market.

CUSTOMER DRIVEN
A "Customer Driven" attitude at Winnebago Industries fosters a strong, lasting
relationship with dealers and retail customers. We are committed to developing
products that satisfy customers needs and achieve high quality standards.

[CAPTION: The Rialta, a revolutionary new front-wheel-drive motor home was
introduced by Winnebago Industries offering fuel efficiency, aerodynamic styling
and full motor home features. The Rialta is a multi-purpose, compact vehicle
just under 21 feet in length.]

Employees have been empowered to take pride in the products they are
manufacturing though involvement in action teams, quality circles and
cost-saving suggestion programs. This has made a significant impact on the
quality of our products. Over the past five years, warranty expenses have been
dramatically reduced as a percentage of revenues and Winnebago Industries has
won more "Best Buy" awards from Consumers Digest magazine than any other motor
home manufacturer.

Our dealers also are encouraged to suggest quality and product improvement
ideas. A dealer council was created for Winnebago and Itasca, representing the
dealers currently selling and servicing Winnebago Industries products. In fiscal
1994, every dealer was presented with a free membership in the Winnebago-Itasca
Travelers (WIT) Club to encourage them to actively participate in WIT
activities.

Owners of new or used Winnebago Industries vehicles are eligible for membership
in the many chapters of the WIT Club. Members may participate in numerous
national, state, local and special motor home rallies, caravans and other events
throughout the year. In addition, they are entitled to special discounts and
services such as mail forwarding, trip routing and emergency road service. With
approximately 12,000 members internationally, the club has proven to be a
valuable sales tool, fostering fellowship between its members and the Company.
We celebrated the 25th anniversary of the WIT Club during the Grand National
Rally in Forest City, Iowa, this past summer.

A separate owner's club also was created especially for race fans. Stock car
racing is the largest spectator sport in the United States, attracting thousands
of RV travellers each year. Winnebago Industries and the National Association
for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) signed a three-year agreement making
Winnebago "The Official Motor Home of NASCAR" and giving us the rights to use
NASCAR official status in advertising and promotions. Members of our "Winnebago
Motorsports Team" are eligible to park in "Winnebago Pit Road," preferred
camping locations at racing events which feature special activities such as
celebrity autograph sessions and seminars.

ever produced. From the fine leather upholstery to the solid brass fixtures, the

EXPANDING INTERNATIONALLY
The improving international economy helped Winnebago Industries' overseas
growth. Each of the Company's major international representatives has moved
their operations to better facilitate access to our customers and provide room
for further growth.

To strengthen its presence in continental Europe, Winnebago Industries Europe
GmbH moved into a 6.5 acre complex near Saarbrucken, Germany. In addition to
office and warehousing space, the facility has garages for modification of motor
homes to meet the technical requirements of each European country.

Mitsubishi Corporation, our Japanese distributor, moved their RV offices to a
prime sales location in Tokyo. In addition, Dudley's American Motorhomes Ltd.,
our distributor in the United Kingdom and Ireland, purchased a new, much larger
facility on 6.5 acres of land near Ducklington.

ADDITIONAL WINNEBAGO PRODUCTS
Law enforcement agencies find that mobile command units are useful in
maintaining visibility in neighborhoods. Many service providers ranging from
medical clinics to hair salons are going to their customers rather than having
their customers come to them. As a result, we expanded production of commercial
vehicles, especially customized motor home shells, for a wide variety of
applications.

The name "Winnebago" has become a household word and, as such, has a high
intrinsic value. To capitalize on the franchise value of the name, we license
its use on products such as tents, camping equipment, shoes, clothing and toys.
We even developed a collector card series, offering a glimpse into memorable
events and products from Winnebago Industries' history.

OTHER MANUFACTURING
Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) sales of component parts, such as aluminum
extrusions, metal stampings, rotational moldings, vacuum-formed plastics and
fiberglass, to outside manufacturers continued to increase. Growth of 24 percent
was realized in fiscal 1994, with sales of $24.0 million versus $19.4 million
for the prior year, providing $2.8 million of operating income for fiscal 1994.
Over the past four years, OEM sales have more than doubled.

CYCLE-SAT, INC.
By using the latest innovations in satellite, fiber optic and digital
technologies, Cycle-Sat has grown to become a leading high-speed distributor of
television and radio commercials. Today, Cycle-Sat serves more than 625
advertising agencies and corporate clients by distributing commercials and
airing instructions to approximately 545 television stations in the United
States and Canada.

Advertising agencies that need additional time to edit a commercial and
corporations that distribute commercials to one or more television stations
within several hours of airing particularly appreciate Cycle-Sat's service and
speed. On the receiving end, traffic coordinators at television stations
appreciate Cycle-Sat's technology. Instead of handling tape boxes or matching
spot commercials with broadcast instructions, the coordinators just pull the
commercials and traffic instructions from the satellite feed.

Fiscal 1994 was a year of strong growth and profitability for Cycle-Sat. Sales
grew 27 percent to $18.9 million. This growth, along with the fixed nature of
many of Cycle-Sat's costs, raised its operating profit to $1.1 million, an
improvement of $3.0 million. 

Fourth quarter sales were particularly strong, benefitting from television
commercials previewing a record number of upcoming movies. During the year, 19
television stations joined the Cycle-Sat network.

Since its inception, Cycle-Sat has embraced technologies and business practices
to better serve its expanding customer base. The company's patented Cyclecypher
equipment allows the direct and automatic distribution of television commercials
and traffic instructions to specific television and radio stations. This unique
satellite shuttle service operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week and
offers point-to-point video information delivery in two hours or less.

FLAT ANTENNA
This year, independent performance testing was successfully completed on
Cycle-Sat's new Flat Antenna. This revolutionary engineering approach allows
businesses and individuals to receive satellite signals with performance
comparable to the one-meter parabolic industry standard. Cycle-Sat has received
its first order for the Flat Antenna, for which it has exclusive North American
marketing and worldwide manufacturing rights and is providing units for
evaluation to prospective customers. 

The Flat Antenna mounts flush along the side or top of a structure, thus
reducing the chance of wind damage and eliminating the need for building
permits. The antenna can be painted with non-metallic paint to blend into the
background. The antenna need not directly face the satellite as with parabolic
dishes. And due to its narrow band frequency and frequency selective focusing
characteristics, the Flat Antenna is less susceptible to ground-based
interference.

[PHOTO]
[CAPTION: The Cycle-Sat Flat Antenna is truly a revolutionary antenna design.
Completely flat and extremely thin, it does not need to directly face the
transmitting satellite to provide signal reception. Only the Low Noise Block
Downconverter and support arms protrude from the roof line or wall surface. This
reduces wind effect on the antenna while providing superior aesthetic benefits,
particularly where local building codes restrict antenna installations.]

[PHOTO]
[CAPTION: Made of high-quality, exterior-grade molded plastic, the Flat Antenna
is very lightweight and its low structural profile often reduces the need for a
heavy mounting frame. The antenna can often be configured for simultaneous
multi-satellite receptions.]

[PHOTO]
[CAPTION: Cycle-Sat has two technical operations centers, one in Memphis, Tenn.,
and a second in Forest City, Iowa. In addition to operating a continuous
satellite shuttle service, the centers offer closed captioning, as well as
post-production services, including editing and tagging television and radio
commercials.]

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL
The primary use of recreation vehicles for leisure travel and outdoor recreation
has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring
and summer months. The Company's sales of recreation vehicles are generally
influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but can also be affected by the
level of dealer inventory. The Company has generally manufactured recreation
vehicles during the entire year, both for immediate delivery and for inventory
to satisfy the peak selling season. During fiscal years when interest rates are
high and/or market conditions are uncertain, the Company attempts to maintain a
lower level of inventory of recreation vehicles.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FISCAL 1994 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1993
Net revenues for manufactured products for fiscal 1994 increased $67,546,000, or
18.5 percent, from fiscal 1993. Motor home shipments (Class A, B and C)
increased by 965 units, or 11.9 percent, during fiscal 1994 when compared to
fiscal 1993. The relatively higher growth in dollar sales is due to an increase
in volume of higher-priced Class A models. The Company anticipates demand for
its RV products will continue to grow in fiscal 1995 due to continued acceptance
of the new models in the Company's RV products lineup.

Service revenues for fiscal 1994 increased $487,000, or 2.5 percent, from fiscal
1993. Cycle-Sat, Inc. (Cycle-Sat) recorded revenues of $18,900,000, an increase
of $4,042,000, or 27.2 percent, due to increased revenues from established
customers as well as revenues generated with new customers. Negatively impacting
fiscal 1994 service revenues, was the absence of revenues of NIE (an electronic
component assembly business), which was sold during August 1993.

Cost of manufactured products, as a percent of manufactured product revenues,
was 86.0 percent for fiscal 1994 compared to 86.7 percent during fiscal 1993.
This decrease primarily reflects a shift in shipments to a more favorable
product mix and to an increase in motor home production volume.

Cost of services, as a percent of service revenues, decreased during fiscal 1994
to 58.2 percent from 76.1 percent during fiscal l993. This percentage decrease
can be attributed to the increase in Cycle-Sat revenues and to a reduction in
lease expense at Cycle-Sat due to a renegotiation of its satellite lease
agreement.

Selling and delivery expenses increased $5,007,000 to $26,882,000 and, as a
percentage of net revenues, to 5.9 percent from 5.7 percent when comparing
fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993. The increases can be attributed primarily to
increased promotional and advertising expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased by $1,148,000 to $24,536,000 when
comparing fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1993, but decreased as a percentage of net
revenues to 5.4 percent from 6.1 percent. The increase in dollars primarily
reflects an increase in the Company's product liability settlements and
increased spending by Cycle-Sat.

Other expense was $262,000 in fiscal 1994 compared to $188,000 in fiscal 1993.
The primary reasons for the change when comparing the two periods were an
expiration of leases which generated lease income for Winnebago Acceptance
Corporation (WAC) during fiscal 1993 offset partially by reduced costs incurred
by the Company under its repurchase agreements with lending institutions who
have provided wholesale floor plan financing to the Company's dealers.

For fiscal 1994, the Company had a net financial expense of $661,000 compared to
$96,000 during fiscal 1993. During fiscal 1994, the Company recorded an interest
payment to the Internal Revenue Service of $419,000 relating to the resolution
of pending income tax return issues and $395,000 of realized and unrealized
losses in its marketable securities portfolio. During fiscal 1993, the Company
recorded a consolidated foreign exchange loss of $245,000, principally due to
Winnebago Industries, Europe (WIE) operations and interest expense of $598,000.
Partially offsetting this was income from interest and dividends of $442,000 and
realized gains of $355,000 in the Company's marketable securities portfolio.

For fiscal 1994, the Company reported income before the cumulative effect of an
accounting change of $17,445,000 which consisted primarily of income from RV
operations of $13,800,000 and from Cycle-Sat operations of $695,000. Credit for
income taxes of $1,312,000 is the result of the increased likelihood of the
Company realizing a portion of the deferred tax assets in the future because of
improved earnings. In fiscal 1994, the Company was required to adopt the
remaining portion of FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" related to health care and other
benefits. This change in accounting principle resulted in a cumulative non-cash
charge at the beginning of fiscal 1994 of $20,420,000, or $.81 per share.

For fiscal 1993, the Company reported net income of $9,278,000 which consisted
primarily of income from RV operations of $11,922,000 and a loss from Cycle-Sat
operations of $2,021,000. Credit for income taxes of $1,087,000 was the result
of an IRS settlement. During fiscal year 1993, taxable income was offset by net
operating loss carryforwards.

For fiscal 1994, the Company had a net loss of $2,975,000, or $.12 per share,
compared to fiscal 1993's net income of $9,278,000, or $.37 per share.

FISCAL 1993 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1992
Net revenue for manufactured products for fiscal 1993 increased $83,736,000, or
29.8 percent, from fiscal 1992. Motor home shipments (Class A and C) increased
by 1,507 units, or 22.9 percent, during fiscal 1993 when compared to fiscal
1992. This growth in sales is due to an increase in the market share of
Winnebago products and an increase in the overall market for Class A and C motor
homes. Additionally, the Company's expansion of product lines led to the most
complete motor home lineup in the Company's history and resulted in a more
favorable sales mix including a greater proportion of larger units.

Service revenues for fiscal 1993 increased $5,353,000, or 38.6 percent, from
fiscal 1992. This increase can be attributed primarily to Cycle-Sat, due to
increased revenues from established customers as well as revenues generated with
new customers.

Cost of manufactured products, as a percent of manufactured product revenues,
was 86.7 percent for fiscal 1993 compared to 88.8 percent during fiscal 1992.
This decrease primarily reflects an increase in motor home volume.

Cost of services, as a percent of service revenue, decreased during the 1993
fiscal year to 76.1 percent from 94.9 percent during the 1992 fiscal year. This
percentage decrease reflects an increase in revenue at Cycle-Sat in relation to
Cycle-Sat's fixed costs.

Selling and delivery expenses increased $3,184,000 to $21,875,000, but decreased
as a percentage of net revenues to 5.7 percent from 6.3 percent. The increase in
dollars primarily reflects increased promotional and advertising expenses. The
decrease in percentage primarily reflects an increase in fiscal 1993 revenues.

General and administrative expenses increased by $6,535,000 to $23,388,000 and,
as a percentage of net revenues, to 6.1 percent from 5.7 percent when comparing
fiscal 1993 to fiscal 1992. The increases primarily reflect the Company
reinstating its matching contribution to its 401(k) program, bad debt provisions
recorded by WAC and increased spending by Cycle-Sat.

Other expense (income) resulted in an expense of $188,000 in fiscal 1993
compared to income of $952,000 in fiscal 1992. The primary reasons for the
change from income to expense when comparing the two periods were a reduction in
lease income in fiscal 1993 and increased costs incurred by the Company under
its repurchase agreements with lending institutions who have provided wholesale
floor plan financing to the Company's dealers.

For fiscal 1993, the Company had a net financial expense of $96,000 compared to
$585,000 during fiscal 1992. During fiscal 1993, the Company recorded a
consolidated foreign exchange loss of $245,000, principally due to WIE
operations and interest expense of $598,000. Partially offsetting this was
income from interest and dividends of $442,000 and realized gains of $355,000 in
the Company's marketable securities portfolio. During fiscal 1992, the Company
recorded realized losses of $592,000 in its marketable securities portfolio and
interest expense of $403,000, offset by income from interest and dividends of
$384,000.

For fiscal 1993, the Company reported net income of $9,278,000 which consisted
primarily of income from RV operations of $11,922,000 and a loss from Cycle-Sat
operations of $2,021,000. Credit for income taxes of $1,087,000 was the result
of an IRS settlement. During fiscal year 1993, taxable income was offset by net
operating loss carryforwards.

For fiscal 1992, the Company reported a net loss of $1,769,000 from continuing
operations, which consisted primarily of income from RVoperations of $1,742,000
and a loss from Cycle-Sat operations of $4,169,000. Also in fiscal 1992, the
Company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $1,026,000. In fiscal
1992, the Company was required to adopt FASB Statement No. 106, "Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," with respect to
individual deferred compensation contracts. This change in accounting principle
resulted in a cumulative non-cash charge as of the beginning of fiscal 1992 of
$7,774,000, or $.31 per share, and increasing the fiscal 1992 loss from
continuing operations and net loss by $1,360,000, or $.05 per share.

For fiscal 1993, the Company had net income of $9,278,000, or $.37 per share,
compared to a fiscal 1992 net loss of $10,569,000, or $.42 per share.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESOURCES
FISCAL 1994 CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION
The Company meets its working capital and capital equipment requirements and
cash requirements of subsidiaries with funds generated internally and funds from
agreements with financial institutions.

At August 27, 1994, working capital was $58,523,000, an increase of $13,854,000
from the amount at August 28, 1993. Cash provided by operations during fiscal
1994 was $3,409,000. During fiscal 1994, cash flows used by investing activities
was $15,756,000 including investments in dealer receivables, long-term notes
receivables and capital expenditures. In fiscal 1994, capital expenditures were
$9,532,000 compared to $7,671,000 in fiscal 1993.

The Company's sources of liquidity at August 27, 1994 consisted principally of
cash and marketable securities in the amount of $4,148,000. The Company has
available a $12,000,000 (or 75 percent of eligible inventory, whichever is less)
line of credit through a financing and security agreement with NationsCredit
Corporation. Additionally, Cycle-Sat has a $3,000,000 (or the sum of the base of
75 percent of Cycle-Sat eligible accounts receivable and 50 percent of its
inventory, whichever is less) line of credit with Firstar Bank Cedar Rapids, NA.

Principal expected demands at August 27, 1994 on the Company's liquid assets for
fiscal 1995 include approximately $10,350,000 of capital expenditures (primarily
equipment replacements), payments on maturities of long-term debt and the
payment of cash dividends.

Based on expected cash generated from operations in fiscal 1995 and the above
cash and financing resources available, management believes that the Company has
adequate sources of financing to finance its 1995 cash requirements.

IMPACT OF INFLATION
Historically, the impact of inflation on the Company's operations has not been
significantly detrimental, as the Company has usually been able to adjust its
prices to reflect the inflationary impact on the cost of manufacturing its
products.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS:
In fiscal 1994, the Company operated predominantly in three industry segments;
the manufacture and sale of recreation vehicles and other manufactured products,
the satellite courier and tape duplication business, and floor plan and rental
unit financing for selected Winnebago, Itasca, Elante', Vectra, Rialta and Luxor
dealers.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the
parent company and subsidiary companies. All material intercompany balances and
transactions with subsidiaries have been eliminated.

In the Consolidated Statements of Operations, service revenues are generated by
the satellite courier and tape duplication business, electronic component
assembly business (which was sold August 1993), and dealer floor plan financing.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. For purposes of these statements, cash equivalents
include all liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less. For cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

FISCAL PERIOD. The Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal year period. The
financial statements are all based on a 52 week basis.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES. Marketable debt and equity securities are carried at the
aggregate of lower of cost or market. Net realized gains and losses on security
transactions are determined on the specific identification cost basis. The net
change in the investment valuation allowances used in the determination of net
earnings is the result of changes in the difference between aggregate cost and
market values of items still held as marketable securities at year-end of the
respective periods:

                          August 27, 1994  August 28, 1993
(in thousands)               Cost  Market     Cost  Market
Marketable
     securities            $4,106  $3,301   $2,461  $2,309

Marketable securities fair values are based on quoted market prices.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. Sales are recorded by the Company when products are shipped
to independent dealers. Interest income from dealer floor plan and rental
program notes receivable are recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with
the terms of the loan agreements. Satellite courier and tape duplication revenue
is recognized upon satellite transmission or shipment of information.

INVENTORIES. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost
being determined by using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and market
defined as net realizable value.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using
the straight-line method on the cost of the assets, less allowance for salvage
value where appropriate, at rates based upon their estimated service lives.
Accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes wherever permitted.

PROVISION FOR WARRANTY CLAIMS. Estimated warranty costs are provided at the time
of sale of the warranted products.

INCOME TAXES. The Company adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective the beginning
of fiscal 1993. This Statement requires recognition of deferred assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse. Prior to fiscal 1993, the Company accounted for income taxes under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 (APB No. 11). The
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in no cumulative effect on operations, and the
prior years' consolidated financial statements were not restated. (See note 12).

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. Allowance for doubtful accounts are based on
previous loss experience. Additional amounts are provided through charges to
income as management feels necessary after evaluation of receivables and current
economic conditions. Amounts which are considered to be uncollectible are
charged off and recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the
allowance upon recovery.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES. During fiscal 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" with
respect to individual deferred compensation contracts. This change in accounting
principle resulted in a cumulative non-cash charge as of September 1, 1991 of
$7,774,000, or $.31 per share. In addition, as a result of the adoption of this
new standard, the loss from continuing operations and net loss for fiscal 1992
were increased by approximately $1,360,000, or $.05 per share.

In fiscal 1994, the Company was required to adopt SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" related to health
care and other benefits. SFAS No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the
estimated cost of retiree benefit payments during the years the employee
provides services. SFAS No. 106 allows recognition of the cumulative effect of
the liability in the year of adoption or the amortization of the obligation over
a period of up to 20 years. The Company elected to recognize the cumulative
effect of this obligation. The cumulative effect as of the beginning of fiscal
1994 for adopting SFAS No. 106 was an accrual of postretirement health care
costs of $20,420,000 and a decrease in net earnings of $20,420,000 ($.81 per
share), which has been included in the Company's consolidated statements of
operations for fiscal year ended August 27, 1994.

The effect of adopting SFAS No. 106 on income from operations for the fiscal
year ended August 27, 1994 was a decrease of $2,943,000 ($.12 per share). See
note 10 for further information regarding the Company's postretirement health
care costs.

In addition, there are several new accounting pronouncements which have been
issued that the Company must adopt within the next two fiscal years; however,
the Company does not believe the new accounting pronouncements will
significantly affect the Company's financial condition or operating results.

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

NOTE 2:  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONs
In September 1991, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the
Commercial Vehicle Division which manufactured delivery vans and shuttle buses.
As part of such plan, the Company discontinued production during fiscal 1992.
The Company's plan to sell the operation during fiscal 1992 was not successful,
therefore, the Company decided to liquidate the assets of the Commercial Vehicle
Division and recorded a $1,026,000 charge to liquidate such assets. The net
assets were liquidated in fiscal 1994. As of August 28, 1993, other assets
included $481,000 of net assets, which primarily consisted of inventory and
equipment, associated with discontinued operations.

NOTE 3:  SALE OF NORTH IOWA ELECTRONICS, INC.
In August 1993, the Company sold certain assets and liabilities of its
electronic component assembly business, North Iowa Electronics, Inc. (NIE).
Under the terms of the agreement, the net assets of NIE were sold for $100,000
in cash and a $1.6 million promissory note. The note receivable is
collateralized by receivables, inventory and fixed assets. The note has an
interest rate of 8 percent and requires monthly principal and interest payments
through March 1997 at which time the entire unpaid principal balance and
interest are due. At August 27, 1994, the promissory note receivable balance was
$1,576,000.The gain on the sale of $277,000 has been deferred until the Company
is certain the buyer can generate sufficient cash flows from operating
activities to retire the note. NIE's operations were not material in relation to
the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

NOTE 4:  DEALER FINANCING RECEIVABLES
Dealer floor plan receivables are collateralized by recreation vehicles and are
due upon the dealers' sale of the vehicle with the entire balance generally due
at the end of one year. At August 27, 1994, the Company had certain
concentration of credit risks whereby $7,349,000 of dealer financing receivables
were from one dealer located on the West Coast.

Rental program receivables are collateralized by recreation vehicles and provide
for a 10 percent down payment and a 2 percent monthly reduction of the
outstanding balance with the balance due in full at the end of one year.

NOTE 5:  INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of the following:
                                August 27,       August 28,
(dollars in thousands)                1994             1993

Finished goods                     $21,675          $16,578
Work in process                     13,807           11,051
Raw materials  33,800               26,614

                                    69,282           54,243
LIFO reserve                        13,832           13,633

                                   $55,450          $40,610

The above value of inventories, before reduction for the LIFO reserve,
approximates replacement cost at the respective dates.

NOTE 6:  GUARANTEED OPERATING LEASES
During fiscal years 1988 through 1992, Cycle-Sat entered into various
non-cancellable operating leases, of which certain leases have been guaranteed
by Winnebago Industries. These leases expire between 1994 and 1999. Rent expense
of $2,070,000, $2,218,000 and $2,939,000 was recorded under these leases during
the years ended August 27, 1994, August 28, 1993 and August 29, 1992,
respectively. Future minimum lease payments under such leases are as follows
(dollars in thousands): 1995 - $2,353; 1996 - $2,302; 1997 - $1,081; 1998 -
$214; 1999 - $26. Total future minimum lease payments are $5,976,000 of which
$1,221,000 is guaranteed by Winnebago Industries.

NOTE 7:  LONG-TERM NOTES RECEIVABLE
Long-term notes receivable of $4,884,000 and $4,203,000 at August 27, 1994 and
August 28, 1993, respectively, are primarily collateralized by dealer
inventories and real estate. The notes had weighted average interest rates of
7.47 percent and 7.91 percent at August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993,
respectively, and have various maturity dates ranging through March 1999.

The Company and Cycle-Sat entered into a $3,000,000 line of credit with Firstar
Bank Cedar Rapids dated February 24, 1994. Terms of the agreement limit the
amount advanced to the lesser of $3,000,000 or the sum of the base of 75 percent
of Cycle-Sat's eligible accounts receivable and 50 percent of its inventory. The
agreement provides for a declining interest rate based on future increases in
the tangible net worth of Cycle-Sat and contains a restrictive covenant related
to the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the agreement.
Cycle-Sat was in compliance with this covenant as of August 27, 1994. Borrowings
under the line of credit are secured by Cycle-Sat's accounts receivables and
inventories and have been guaranteed by the Company. The line of credit expires
January 31, 1995. The outstanding balance under the line of credit at August 27,
1994 was $2,300,000 with an interest rate of 9.0 percent per annum. As of August
27, 1994, Cycle-Sat had $573,000 of unused borrowings available.

Since March 1992, the Company has had a $12,000,000 financing and security
agreement with NationsCredit Corporation (NationsCredit) formerly Chrysler First
Commercial Corporation. Terms of the agreement limit borrowings to the lesser of
$12,000,000 or 75 percent of eligible inventory (fully manufactured recreation
vehicles ready for delivery to a dealer). Borrowings are secured by the
Company's receivables and inventory. The agreement requires a graduated interest
rate based upon the bank's reference rate as defined in the agreement. The line
of credit is available for a term of one year and continues during successive
one-year periods unless either party provides at least 90-days notice prior to
the end of the one-year period to the other party that they wish to terminate
the line of credit. The agreement prohibits any advances, loans or additional
guarantees of any obligation to any subsidiary or affiliate in excess of
$5,000,000 or $7,500,000 in the aggregate for all subsidiaries and affiliates
from the date of the agreement. The agreement also includes certain restrictive
covenants in the agreement including maintenance of minimum net worth, working
capital and debt to equity ratio. As of August 27, 1994, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants. There were no outstanding borrowings under the
line of credit at August 27, 1994 or August 28, 1993.

During fiscal 1994, the Company and Winnebago RV, Inc. entered into a $2,001,000
financing agreement with 1st Source Bank for the purchase of a 1990 King Air 350
airplane. Terms of the agreement call for 35 monthly installment payments
beginning August 28, 1994, and a 36th payment to pay off the remaining principal
and interest balance of the agreement. The agreement is secured by the airplane.
The outstanding balance under this agreement at August 27, 1994 was $2,001,000
with an interest rate of 7.95 percent per annum.

During fiscal year 1993, the Company and Winnebago Industries Europe GmbH (WIE),
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a $1.8 million financing
arrangement with Volksbank Saarbrucken-St. Ingebert eG to finance the
acquisition and renovation of a new facility in Kirkel, Saarland, Federal
Republic of Germany. The financing arrangement includes four loans with interest
rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8.75 percent. All four of the loans have been
advanced to WIE in the aggregate amount of $2,039,000 which require various
repayment terms through 2008. The loans are secured by real estate and
improvements of the new facility. Management believes that carrying value of the
long-term debt approximates fair value of these obligations.

During fiscal 1991 and 1990, the Company and Cycle-Sat entered into a
sale/leaseback agreements for most of Cycle-Sat's equipment which provided cash
of approximately $5,600,000 and a gain of $766,000 which is being deferred and
amortized over the terms of the respective leases. These leases have terms of 60
to 72 months, have been recorded as capital leases, and are guaranteed by the
Company. Also, during fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, Cycle-Sat entered into
additional capital lease arrangements for property approximating $444,000,
$842,000 and $466,000, respectively.

Assets and accumulated amortization related to capital leases were approximately
$7,606,000 and $4,978,000 at August 27, 1994 and $7,243,000 and $3,706,000 at
August 28, 1993, respectively.

Maturities of the long-term debt for the next five years are as follows (dollars
in thousands): 1995 - $2,504; 1996 - $792; 1997 - $1,869; 1998 - $176; 1999 -
$181.

NOTE 10: EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a qualified profit sharing and contributory 401(k) plan and a
stock bonus retirement plan for eligible employees. The plans provide for
contributions by the Company in such amounts as the Board of Directors may
determine. Contributions to the plans in cash and common stock valued at market
for fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $1,444,000, $2,084,000 and $226,000,
respectively.

The Company has an Executive Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan. Investments in
the plan consist of life insurance policies, with the cash surrender values
recorded in the accompanying balance sheets. Upon the termination or death of a
participating executive, the Company receives its cash investment in the policy,
with any excess investment remitted directly to the policy beneficiary.

The Company also has a nonqualified deferred compensation program which permits
key employees and directors to annually elect (via individual contracts) to
defer a portion of their compensation until their retirement. The retirement
benefit to be provided is fixed based upon the amount of compensation deferred
and the age of the individual at the time of the contracted deferral. An
individual generally vests at the age of 55, with five years of service since
the first deferral was made. For deferrals prior to December 1992, vesting also
occurs after 20 years of service. Deferred compensation expense was $2,056,000,
$2,619,000 and $2,762,000 (excluding $7,774,000 of expense for cumulative effect
of accounting change) in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Total
deferred compensation liabilities were $20,322,000 and $18,766,000 at August 27,
1994 and August 28, 1993, respectively.

Also, to assist in funding the retirement benefits of the program, the Company
has invested in corporate-owned life insurance policies. The cash surrender
value of these policies are presented as assets (net of borrowings of
$3,683,000, $3,796,000 and $3,833,000 in fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively) of the Company in the accompanying balance sheets.

The Company provides certain health care and other benefits for certain retired
employees who have fulfilled eligibility requirements at age 55 with 15 years of
continuous service. Retirees are required to pay a monthly premium for medical
coverage based on years of service at retirement and current age. In fiscal 1993
and 1992, the Company recognized on a "pay-as-you-go" basis expense of $501,000
and $364,000, respectively, for postretirement health care benefits, which is
not comparable with current year's expenses. As discussed in note 1, the Company
implemented SFAS No. 106 as of August 29, 1993 on the immediate recognition
basis. The Company's postretirement health care plan currently is not funded.
The status of the plans is as follows:

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at August 27, 1994:

Retirees                                          $ 2,336,000
Fully eligible active plan participants             2,777,000
Other active plan participants                      9,651,000

                                                    14,764,000

Unrecognized net gain                               8,305,000

Accrued postretirement benefit liability
     recognized in financial statements           $23,069,000

Net postretirement benefit expense for the fiscal year ended August 27, 1994
consisted of the following components: 

Service cost-benefits earned
     during the year                              $ 1,624,000

Interest cost on accumulated
     postretirement obligation                      1,319,000

                                                   $2,943,000

The assumed pre-65 and post-65 health care cost trend rates used in measuring
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of August 27, 1994 was 11.1
percent and 10.4 percent, respectively for 1994, decreasing each successive year
until it reaches 5.5 percent in 2014 after which it remains constant. A
one-percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
August 27, 1994 by approximately $3,383,000. The effect of this change on the
net postretirement health care cost for fiscal 1995 would be to increase it by
approximately $581,000.

The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation upon the initial adoption of this new accounting standard at
the beginning of fiscal 1994 was 6.5 percent which was increased to 8.0 percent
at August 27, 1994 due to increasing interest rates. The approximately
$8,300,000 of unrecognized net gain at August 27, 1994 is a result of the
increase in the discount rate (approximately $5,800,000) and various other
factors such as increases in the health care premiums the Company charges
retirees (approximately $2,500,000). The unrecognized net gain will be amortized
over the average remaining service of active participants (18 years).

NOTE 11:  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS
It is customary practice for companies in the recreation vehicle industry to
enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions which have provided
wholesale floor plan financing to dealers. Most dealers are financing on a
"floor plan" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all,
or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a lien upon, or
title to, the merchandise purchased. Upon request of a lending institution
financing a dealer's purchases of the Company's products, and after completion
of a credit investigation of the dealer involved, the Company will execute a
repurchase agreement. These agreements provide that, in the event of default by
the dealer on his agreement to pay the lending institution, the Company will
repurchase the financed merchandise. The agreements provide that the Company's
liability will not exceed 100 percent of the dealer invoice and provide for
periodic liability reduction based on the time since the date of the original
invoice. The Company's contingent liability on all repurchase agreements was
approximately $118,954,000 and $101,445,000 at August 27, 1994 and August 28,
1993, respectively. Included in these contingent liabilities are approximately
$36,231,000 and $27,758,000, respectively of certain dealer receivables subject
to recourse agreements with ITT, NationsCredit, and John Deere Credit, Inc. On
March 26, 1992, the Company entered into a three year Inventory Floor-Plan
Finance Agreement with NationsCredit, whereby NationsCredit provides financing
to certain dealers subject to NationsCredit approval and full recourse to the
Company. In accordance with the agreement during fiscal 1993, the Company was
required to maintain deposits with NationsCredit of $4,000,000. The compensating
balance earned interest at the reference rate as defined in the agreement. The
$4,000,000 compensating balance has been included in cash and cash equivalents
at August 28, 1993. As of August 27, 1994, the deposits were no longer required.
In addition, ITT and John Deere Credit, Inc. provide financing to the Company's
dealers on a partial and full recourse basis. The Company had reserves of
$1,204,000 and $993,000 at August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993, respectively,
for losses on repurchases and dealers subject to recourse provisions.
Historically, the Company's repurchases under these agreements have been
immaterial with losses of approximately $101,000, $295,000 and $160,000 recorded
during fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company purchases Class A and Class C chassis and engines from General
Motors Corporation-Chevrolet Division and Ford Motor Company; Class C chassis
and engines from Volkswagen of America, Inc.; and Class A chassis and engines
from Oshkosh Truck Corporation and Spartan Motors, Inc.

The Company self-insures for product liability claims. Self-insurance retention
liability varies annually based on market conditions and ranges from $3,000,000
to $5,000,000 per occurrence and $9,000,000 to $12,000,000 in aggregate per
year. Liabilities in excess of these amounts are the responsibility of the
co-insurer.

During fiscal 1993, the Company recalled 1989 Spectrum motor homes (86 units).
As of August 27, 1994, the Company has recorded a $2,255,000 reserve for the
motor home recall.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been conducting an investigation of the
Company's LeSharo and Phasar motor homes, Centauri vans and utility vans
produced between 1983 and 1986. If the FTC should decide to issue a complaint
and seek consumer redress and other equitable relief, the Company believes it
would have meritorious defenses to the same.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings which
are in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are covered in whole
or in part by insurance. Counsel for the Company, based on his present knowledge
of pending legal proceedings and after consultation with trial counsel, has
advised the Company that, while the outcome of litigation is uncertain, he is of
the opinion that it is unlikely that these proceedings will result in any
recovery which will materially exceed the Company's reserve for estimated
losses. On the basis of such advice, management is of the opinion that the
pending legal proceedings will not have any material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE 12:  INCOME TAXES
The components of the provision (credit) for income taxes for continuing
operations are as follows:

</TABLE>

As discussed in note 1, in fiscal 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109 which
permits the recognition of future tax benefits only to the extent that
realization of such benefits are more likely than not. The likelihood of
realizing the Company's gross deferred tax asset (and reduction of the valuation
allowance) was reviewed at the beginning of fiscal 1993 and is reviewed and
updated periodically with any required adjustments recorded in the period in
which the developments on which they are based become known.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 109 at the beginning of fiscal 1993, the Company
recorded $16.9 million of deferred tax assets which represented future tax
benefits resulting from differences in the tax basis of assets and liabilities
versus their financial accounting basis. At the same time, the full amount of
the $16.9 million deferred tax asset was offset by recognizing a deferred tax
asset valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing these future tax
benefits as a result of the Company's losses in the preceding four years.
Accordingly, there was no cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle in fiscal 1993.

In fiscal 1994, the Company recorded a $1.3 million tax benefit due to the level
of earnings achieved in fiscal 1994 which increased the likelihood of the
Company realizing a portion of its gross deferred tax assets in the future.

During the second quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company received notice that the
Joint Committee on Taxation approved the IRS audits of the Company's tax returns
for fiscal 1986 through 1988. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax
benefit of $1,087,000 from the reversal of income tax reserves previously
recorded for the pending IRS audits. However, no additional tax benefits were
recorded in fiscal 1993 due to the continuing uncertainty of the Company's
ability to realize its deferred tax assets.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES, INC.
FOREST CITY, IOWA

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Winnebago Industries, Inc.,
and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993 and the
related statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity
for each of the three years in the period ended August 27, 1994. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Winnebago Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries at August 27, 1994 and August 28, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August 27, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting due to required new accounting standards for individual
deferred compensation contracts during the year ended August 29, 1992, changed
