                                    PART I

ITEM 1.     Business

      Xerox Credit Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with its
subsidiaries herein called "the Company" unless the context otherwise
requires), was organized on June 23, 1980.  All of the Company's outstanding
capital stock is owned by Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI), a holding
company, which is wholly-owned by Xerox Corporation (Xerox Corporation
together with its subsidiaries are herein called "Xerox" unless the context
otherwise requires).

      The Company is engaged in financing long-term accounts receivable
arising out of equipment sales by Xerox to its Document Processing customers
throughout the United States.  Contract terms on these accounts receivable
range primarily from two to five years.

      The Company discontinued its real-estate development and related real-
estate financing businesses in the first quarter of 1990.  In the fourth
quarter of 1990, the Company discontinued its third-party financing and
leasing businesses.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.

      Xerox is a global company serving the worldwide Document Processing
markets.  Xerox' Document Processing activities encompass developing,
manufacturing, marketing, servicing and financing a complete range
of document processing products and services designed to make offices
around the world more productive.  These products and systems are
marketed in over 130 countries by a direct sales force and a network of
agents, dealers and distributors.  The financing of Xerox equipment is
generally carried out by the Company in the United States and internationally
by several foreign financing subsidiaries.

      In December 1993, Xerox announced a worldwide restructuring program
aimed at improving its productivity and significantly lowering its cost base.
The ongoing operations of the Company are unaffected by this decision.

ITEM 2.     Properties

      The Company does not directly own any facilities in order to carry on
its principal business.  Its principal executive offices in Stamford,
Connecticut comprise approximately 25,000 square feet of office space.
In addition, the Company leases approximately 1,200 square feet of office
space at various domestic and international locations, the majority of
which are used by the Company's discontinued operations.  These facilities
are deemed adequate by management.

ITEM 3.     Legal Proceedings

      None.


ITEM 4.     Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

            Results of Operations

Results of Operations
                         Continuing Operations

      Contracts receivable income represents income earned under an agreement
with Xerox by which the Company purchases long-term accounts receivable
associated with Xerox' sold equipment.  These receivables arose from Xerox
equipment being sold under installment sales and sales-type leases.  In 1993,
the Company purchased receivables from Xerox totaling $1,848 million compared
to $1,964 million in 1992.  Earned income from contracts receivable decreased
in 1993 to $376 million from $389 million in 1992.  The decreases in earned
income is the result of lower purchases of contracts receivable in 1993
compared to 1992 due to weak United States sales early in 1993 because of
reorganization of the Xerox United States Customer Operations sales force, as
well as lower interest income earned on Xerox contracts receivable resulting
from declining interest rates.  Earned income from contracts receivable
increased in 1992 to $389 million from $380 million in 1991.  The increase
reflected the growth of Xerox equipment sales financed through the Company
in 1992 compared to 1991.  In connection with the contracts receivable
purchased from Xerox, the Company retains an allowance for losses at the time
of purchase, which is intended to protect against future losses.  Should
any additional allowances be required, Xerox is required to provide such
funding.  The resultant effect is to relieve the Company of any exposure with
regard to write-offs associated with the contracts receivable purchased from
Xerox.

      Interest expense was $209 million in 1993 compared to $212 million in
1992, a decrease of $3 million.  The 1993 decrease resulted from lower
interest rates partially offset with increased borrowings required to fund the
Companys additional investment in contracts receivable.  The $212 million of
interest expense in 1992 was an increase of $12 million from the 1991 interest
expense of $200 million.  The 1992 increase in interest expense reflected
increased borrowings required to fund the additional investment in contracts
receivable.  The Company intends to continue to match its contracts receivable
and indebtedness to maintain the relationship between interest income and
interest expense.

      Operating and administrative expenses were $13 million for 1993, a
decrease of $6 million from 1992.  The decrease was due primarily to
operating efficiencies associated with the administration of contracts
receivable purchased from Xerox.  Operating and administrative expenses
increased to $19 million in 1992 compared to $16 million in 1991.  This
increase was due primarily to additional administrative costs associated with
the increase in the volume of Xerox contracts receivable financed in 1992
compared to 1991.

      The effective income tax rate for 1993 was 40.9 percent as compared
with 39.9 percent and 40.2 percent for 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The
increase in the effective tax rates in 1993 compared to 1992 and 1991 is due
primarily to the 1993 increase in the corporate federal income tax rates from
34 percent to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993.

                         Discontinued Operations

      Since their discontinuance in 1990, the Company has made substantial
progress in disengaging from the real-estate and third-party financing 
businesses.  During the three years ended  December 31, 1993, the Company
received net cash proceeds of $2,089 million from the sale of discontinued
business units and assets, from several asset securitizations and from run-off
collection activities.  The amounts received were consistent with the
Company's estimates in the disposal plan and were primarily used to reduce the
Company's short-term indebtedness.  At December 31, 1993, the Company remains
contingently liable for approximately $126 million under recourse provisions
associated with the securitization transactions.

      Since a portion of the remaining assets ($120 million) represents
passive lease receivables, many with long-duration contractual maturities and
unique tax attributes, the Company expects that the wind-down of the portfolio
will be significantly slower in 1994 and future years, compared with 1993 and
prior years.  The Company believes that the liquidation of
the remaining assets will not result in a net loss.

      Additional information regarding discontinued operations is included in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

      The Company's principal sources of funds are cash from the collection
of Xerox contracts receivable and borrowings.

      At December 31, 1993 the Company and Xerox have joint access to three
revolving credit agreements totaling $3 billion with various banks, which
expire from 1994 to 1998.  The interest on amounts borrowed under these
facilities is at rates based, at the borrower's option, on spreads above
certain reference rates such as LIBOR and Federal funds rates.

      Net cash used in operating activities was $48 million in 1993
compared with $23 million of cash used in 1992.  The 1993 increase in cash
used by operating activities is mainly attributable to the reduction in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments.  Net cash
used in operating activities was $23 million in 1992 compared with $161
million of cash provided by operating activities in 1991.  The 1992 decrease
in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to the
reduction in deferred income taxes payable which declined as a result of the
Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109- "Accounting for Income Taxes" and sales of certain discontinued
operation's assets.

      Net cash provided by investing activities was $21 million in 1993
compared to $58 million of cash used in investing activities in 1992.  The
increase in cash provided by investing activities was the result of higher net
collections from the Company's investment in contracts receivable in 1993,
which was partially offset by lower net collections from discontinued 
operations.  Net cash provided by investing activities during 1992
decreased $815 million from $757 million of cash provided by investing
activities during 1991.  The decrease resulted from lower net collections
from the sale and run off activity of discontinued assets.

     Net cash provided by financing activities was $26 million in 1993
compared to $79 million in 1992.  The decrease in cash provided was
the result of increased principal payments on the Company's long-
term debt.  Net cash provided by financing activities was $79 million during
1992, compared with $926 million of cash used in financing activities during
1991.  The proceeds from the 1991 sales and asset securitizations of the 
third-party financing and leasing assets enabled the Company to reduce the
short-term indebtedness of the Company more in 1991 than in 1992, and pay
higher dividends in 1991 than in 1992.

<PAGE>

      The Company believes that cash provided by continuing operations, cash
available under its commercial paper program supported by its credit
facilities, and its readily available access to the capital markets are more
than sufficient for its funding needs.  During 1994, new borrowing associated
with the financing of customer purchases of Xerox equipment will continue.
The timing, principal amount and form of new short- and long-term financing
will be determined based upon the Company's need for financing and prevailing
debt market conditions.

      The Company intends to continue to match its contracts receivable
and indebtedness to maintain the relationship between investment income and
interest expense.  To assist in managing its interest rate exposure, the
Company has entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements.  In
general, the Company's objective is to hedge its variable-rate debt by paying
fixed rates under the swap agreements while receiving variable-rate based
payments in return.  The Company has also entered into swap agreements
that convert both fixed-and non-commercial paper based variable-rate interest
payments into payments that are indexed to commercial paper rates.

      During 1993, the Company entered into third-party interest rate swap
agreements, which effectively converted $750 million of variable-rate
debt into fixed-rate debt.  These agreements mature at various dates
through 1997 and resulted in a weighted average fixed-rate of 4.52 percent
at December 31,1993.  The Company also entered into third-party interest rate 
swap agreements, during 1993 which effectively converted $425 million of
variable-rate debt into variable-rate debt that is indexed to the commercial
paper rates.  These agreements mature at various dates through 1997.

      As of December 31, 1993 the Company's overall debt-to-equity ratio
was 6.5 to 1.  The Company declared aggregate dividends of $59 million, $85
million and $230 million during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The 
Company intends to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 6.5 to 1
over time.

      Pursuant to a Support Agreement between the Company and Xerox,
Xerox has also agreed to retain ownership of 100 percent of the voting capital
stock of the Company and to make periodic payments to the extent necessary
to ensure that the Company's annual pre-tax earnings available for
fixed charges equal at least 1.25 times the Company's fixed charges.

                        Report of Independent Auditors



The Board of Directors
Xerox Credit Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Xerox Credit
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index.  In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying
index.  These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Xerox
Credit Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1992.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      Basis of Presentation

      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xerox
Credit Corporation (the Company) and its subsidiaries.  The Company is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI), which is in
turn wholly-owned by Xerox Corporation (Xerox).  All significant transactions
between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated.

      Recognition of Earned Income

      The Company utilizes the finance method for the recognition of earned
income associated with contracts receivable.  Under this method, the
difference between the amount of gross contract receivable and the cost of
the contract is recorded as unearned income.  The unearned income is
amortized to income over the term of the transaction under an effective yield
method.

      Cash and Cash Equivalents

      All highly liquid investments of the Company, with a maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase, are considered to be cash equivalents.

      Allowance for Losses

      In connection with the contracts receivable purchased from Xerox, the
Company retains an allowance for losses at the time of purchase which is
intended to protect against future losses.  Should any additional allowances
be required, Xerox is required to provide such funding.  The resultant effect
is to relieve the Company of any exposure with regard to write-offs
associated with the contracts receivable purchased from Xerox.

                         XEROX CREDIT CORPORATION
                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      Charge Off of Delinquent Receivables

      The Company's policy with respect to the charge-off of delinquent
receivables to the reserve is that such receivables are to be charged off as
soon as it becomes apparent that the collection of the receivables through
normal means is unlikely.  The policy contemplates that delinquent receivables
will be charged off before the aging of such delinquent receivables
reaches 180 days.

      New Accounting Pronouncements

      Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109- "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 has no impact on income and shareholder's
equity for continuing operations in 1992.  A tax benefit of $87 million was
recorded to discontinued operations and represents the cumulative tax benefits
associated with the discontinued real-estate operations that were not
previously recorded.

      Also, effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106-
"Employees' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions," which
changes the method of recording other postretirement benefit costs from a cash
basis to the accrual basis.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 106 on
the Company was immaterial.

      In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
No. 112- "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  SFAS No. 112
requires accrual accounting for employee benefits that are paid after the
termination of active employment but prior to retirement.  The Company is
required to adopt SFAS No. 112 beginning in 1994.  the adoption of SFAS No.
112 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company since the
applicable benefits are either routinely accrued or are types of benefits
not currently offered by the Company.

(2)   Discontinued Operations

      The Company has made substantial progress in disengaging from the
real-estate and third-party financing businesses that were discontinued in
1990.  During the three years ended December 31, 1993, the Company
received aggregate net cash proceeds of $2,089 million ($232 million in 1993,
$480 million in 1992 and $1,377 million in 1991) from the sale of individual
assets or of business units, from several asset securitizations and from
run-off collection activities.  The amounts received were consistent with
the Company's estimates in the disposal plan and were used primarily to repay
short-term indebtedness. At December 31, 1993, the Company remains
contingently liable for $126 million under recourse provisions associated with
the securitization transactions.

      In addition, the Company has issued certain guarantees with respect to
obligations and debt of one operation sold, Highline Financial Services, Inc.
As a result of the guarantees, liabilities in the amount of $17 million are
included in the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 1993, under the
caption "Liabilities of business transferred."  Because the Company has full
recourse to the underlying assets associated with the guarantees, $17 million
of assets remain on the Company's December 31, 1993 balance sheet, under the
caption "Net assets of discontinued operations."  These liabilities and
assets will decrease proportionately with the collection  of the underlying
receivables, which have a remaining life of approximately 12 months.

      During 1991 and 1992, incremental tax benefits of $22 million and $122
million, respectively, were realized by the Company related to the writeoff of
its real estate businesses in 1990.  Rather than recording these tax
benefits in net income, the Company increased before-tax reserves related
to the discontinued businesses.  Management believed this prudent in
view of weak market conditions and continuing uncertainties in the domestic
real-estate and credit markets.

      Approximately $120 million (34 percent) of the remaining assets
represent passive lease receivables, many with long-duration contractual
maturities and unique tax attributes.  Accordingly, the Company expects that
the wind-down of the portfolio will be slower during 1994 and in future years,
compared with prior years.  The Company believes that the liquidation of the
remaining assets will not result in a net loss.

      Short-and long-term debt represents debt included in the Company's
consolidated balance sheets that has been assigned to the discontinued
businesses in accordance with historical methodologies.  Proceeds from
disposition of these businesses, along with their results of operations
during the phase-out period, are expected to be used to repay such
consolidated indebtedness.

1998; $13; 1999 and thereafter-$67.

(3)   Investments

      Contracts receivable represent purchases of long-term trade accounts
receivable from Xerox.  These receivables arose from Xerox equipment being
sold under installment sales and sales-type leases.  Contract terms on
these receivables range primarily from two to five years and are generally
collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.  The Company
purchased receivables from Xerox totaling $1,848 million in 1993, $1,964
million in 1992, and $1,784 million in 1991.  The Company was charged $11
million in 1993, $10 million in 1992, and $9 million in 1991 by Xerox for
administrative costs associated with the contracts receivable purchased from
Xerox.

      Under SFAS No. 107- "Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial
Instruments," the Company is not required to determine the fair value of
these receivables.  Management believes that any revaluation of the
contracts receivable would result in a fair value significantly in excess
of the carrying value of these receivables.

      During 1990, the Company sold, with limited recourse, $750 million
of Xerox contracts receivable in two asset securitizations.  At
December 31, 1993, $40 million of these receivables remain outstanding.
For the securitization transactions, the Company or one of its subsidiaries
acts as collection agent for the accounts and remits the principal collected
plus a floating rate of interest to the purchasers on a monthly basis.

      The scheduled maturities of contracts receivable at December 31,
1993 are as follows (in millions):  1994-$1,663; 1995-$1,205; 1996-$781;
1997-$365; 1998-$127; 1999 and thereafter- $7. Experience has shown that a
portion of these contracts receivable will be prepaid prior to maturity.
Accordingly, the preceding schedule of contractual maturities should not
be considered a forecast of future cash collections.

      Included in notes receivable from Xerox and affiliates are receivables
from related parties payable on demand at various interest rates.  For
additional information relating to these amounts, see Schedule II- Amounts
Receivable from Related Parties and Underwriters, Promoters and Employees
Other than Related Parties.

      In September 1993, the Company acquired 873,550 shares of common stock
of Xerox Financial Services Life Insurance Company ("XFSLIC"), a subsidiary of
XFSI, representing approximately 26 percent of total common stock outstanding,
from a Xerox affiliate.  In connection with the purchase of the XFSLIC common
stock, the Company issued a $75 million adjustable rate promissory note due
1998, with an initial interest rate of 6 percent.  The XFSLIC investment is
accounted for on the equity method and is recorded at Xerox' historical cost
because all parties involved are part of the Xerox group.  Xerox intends to
dispose of its investment in XFSLIC and the Company is expected to receive
book value upon ultimate disposition of this investment.

(4)   Lines of Credit, Interest Rate Swaps and Notes Payable-
      Xerox Corporation

      At December 31, 1993 the Company and Xerox had joint access to three
revolving credit agreements totaling $3.0 billion with groups of banks, which
expire from 1994 to 1998.  These agreements are unused and are available to 
back the issuance of commercial paper.  At December 31, 1993, Xerox' domestic
operations had borrowed approximately $2.4 billion of commercial paper backed
by these agreements of which approximately $1.7 billion is related to the
Company.

      The Company routinely enters into interest rate swap agreements
in the management of interest rate exposure.  An interest rate swap is
an agreement to exchange interest rate payment streams based on a
notional principal amount.  In general, the Company's objective is
to hedge its variable-rate debt by paying fixed rates under the swap
agreements and receiving variable-rate payments in return.  These swap
agreements effectively convert an amount (equal to the notional amount)
of underlying variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt.  The net interest
rate differentials that will be paid or received are recorded currently
as adjustments to interest expense.  The counterparties to these swap
agreements are typically major commercial banks.

      At December 31, 1993 and 1992, there were outstanding swap agreements
which effectively converted $2,200 million and $1,850 million, respectively,
of short- and long-term variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt.  These swap
agreements mature at various dates through 1999 and result in weighted-
average fixed rates of 5.39 percent and 6.17 percent at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.  During 1993, the Company also entered into interest rate
swap agreements which effectively converted $425 million of short- and long-
term variable-rate debt into variable-rate debt that is indexed to the
commercial paper rates.  These agreements mature at various dates through
1997.  In addition, at December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company had an
agreement which effectively converted $100 million of fixed-rate debt,
with a weighted average fixed-rate of 8.97 percent, into variable-rate debt
that is indexed to the commercial paper rates.

      At December 31, 1993, the Company's swap agreements had an aggregate
net fair value of $35 million, based on quotes from banks, which represents
the estimated net amount the Company would be required to pay to terminate all
the agreements as of December 31, 1993. The Company has no present plans to
terminate any of these agreements prior to their scheduled maturities.
Because the $35 million represents a theoretical liability of the Company,
there was no significant credit risk in the event of a counterparty default.

      Notes payable- Xerox Corporation is an intercompany payable with Xerox
relating to the purchase of long-term trade accounts receivables.  These 
amounts are settled periodically throughout the year.

(a)   The notes carry interest rates which are based primarily on spreads
      above certain reference rates such as U.S. Treasury Bill, LIBOR and
      Federal funds rates.

(b)   The notes are redeemable on or after March 1, 1994, at the option of
      the Company, in whole or in part, at a premium plus accrued interest.

(c)   The notes are redeemable on or after April 15, 1996, at the option of
      the Company, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued
      interest.

(d)   The notes mature August 15, 2048 and are repayable at the option of
      the noteholders beginning August 15, 1991 and annually thereafter.
      On August 15, 1993 and 1991, $1 million and $2 million of these notes 
      were repaid, respectively. The outstanding notes are classified as notes
      payable after one year, since the Company has the ability to refinance
      them on a long-term basis, if required.  The interest rate is indexed to
      rates on commercial paper placed for issuers whose commercial paper
      rating is "AA" or the equivalent as reported in Federal Reserve
      Statistical Release H.15 (519), which at year-end was 3.34 percent.

      Principal payments on notes payable for the next five years are:
$554 million in 1994; $400 million in 1995; $415 million in 1996;
$54 million in 1997; $0 million in 1998; and $211 million thereafter.

      Certain of the Company's debt agreements allow it to redeem outstanding
debt, usually at par, prior to scheduled maturity.  Outstanding debt issues
with these call features are classified on the balance sheet and in the
preceding five-year maturity table in accordance with management's current
expectations.  The actual decision as to early redemption will be made at
the time the early redemption option becomes exercisable and will be based
on economic and business conditions then in existence.

      Interest payments on notes payable for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
$148 million, $166 million, and $237 million, respectively.  Interest payments
on commercial paper for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were $48 million, $40 million
and $55 million, respectively.  The weighted-average commercial paper interest
rates for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were 3.3 percent, 3.9 percent and 6.1 percent,
respectively.

      At December 31, 1993, $1,634 million of notes payable remains out-
standing, substantially all of which are subject to the requirements of SFAS
No. 107- "Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments."  The fair
value of the Company's notes payable at December 31, 1993 was $1,698 million,
which was estimated based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues
or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities.  The difference between the fair value and the carrying value
represents the theoretical net premium the Company would have to pay to
retire all notes payable at December 31, 1993.  The Company has no plans to
retire its notes payable after one year prior to their call or final 
maturity dates.

      The original issue discount and other expenses associated with the debt
offerings are amortized over the term of the related issue.

(6)   Income Taxes

      "SFAS No. 109 requires a change from the deferred method of accounting
for income taxes of APB Opinion 11 (APB No. 11) to the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes.  Under the asset and liability method
of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Under SFAS
No. 109 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

      Effective January 1, 1992, the Company prospectively adopted SFAS No.
109.  The cumulative effect of that change was immaterial and had no impact
on income from continuing operations.  A tax benefit of $87 million was
recorded in 1992 to discontinued operations, which represented the cumulative
tax benefits associated with the discontinued real-estate operations that were
not previously recorded.

      Pursuant to the deferred method under APB No. 11, which was applied in
1991 and prior years, deferred income taxes were recognized for income and
expense items that were reported in different years for financial reporting
purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate applicable to the year of
the calculation.  Under APB No. 11, deferred taxes were not adjusted 
for subsequent changes in tax rates.

      Income taxes are provided at statutory rates based on income before
income taxes exclusive of the amortization of investment tax credits and
earnings not subject to Federal taxation.  Substantially all of the Company's
operations are included in Xerox' consolidated income tax returns.  In
connection with these consolidated returns, the Company paid Xerox $136
million, $15 million, and $41 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The Company paid $1 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, to taxing authorities
for Company operations not included in Xerox' consolidated tax returns.

        Total provision for income taxes          $   63    $   63    $   66


      Deferred income taxes for 1993, 1992, and 1991 result from differences
between financial and tax reporting in the timing of the recognition of income
on securitized assets.  In addition, deferred income taxes for 1991 included
differences due to the timing of interest expense recognized on the Company's
$250 million Zero Coupon Notes which were redeemed during 1992.

      A reconciliation of the effective tax rate from the U.S. Federal
statutory tax rate follows:
                                                  1993       1992       1991

      The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of deferred taxes at December 31, 1993 follows:

                                                   1993          1992

       Total deferred taxes, net                 $  (38)        $(174)


      Total net deferred tax liabilities included in the Company's balance
sheets at December 31, 1991 was $323 million.  The 1993 reduction in deferred
income taxes payable is the result of sales of certain discontinued
operations assets.  The Company believes that it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of
operations based on scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and income from
operating activities.

(7)   Xerox Corporation Support Agreement

      The terms of a Support Agreement with Xerox provide that the Company
will receive income maintenance payments, to the extent necessary, so that
the Company's earnings shall not be less than 1.25 times its fixed charges.
For purposes of this calculation, both earnings and fixed charges are
as defined in Section 1404 (formerly Section 81(2)) of the New York Insurance
Law.  In addition, the agreement requires that Xerox retain 100 percent
ownership of the Company's voting capital stock.

               COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

                                            Year Ended December 31,
                                1993      1992      1991     1990     1989

  fixed charges (1)             1.74      1.75      1.82     1.88     1.69

(1)  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the
     Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available
     for fixed charges by total fixed charges.  Interest expense has been
     allocated to discontinued operations principally on the basis of
     the relative amount of gross assets of the discontinued operations.
     Management believes that this allocation method is reasonable in
     light of the amount of debt specifically assigned to discontinued
     operations.  The discontinued operations consist of the Company's
     real-estate development and related financing operations and its
     third-party financing and leasing businesses.

(1)  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on
     Xerox' continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for
     fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest, by total fixed charges.
     Fixed charges consist of interest, including capitalized interest, and
     one-third of rent expense as representative of the interest portion of
     rentals. Interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations
     principally on the basis of the relative amount of gross assets of the
     discontinued operations. Xerox management believes that this allocation
     method is reasonable in light of the debt specifically assigned to
     discontinued operations.  The discontinued operations consist of Xerox'
     real-estate development and related financing operations, third-
     party financing and leasing businesses, and other financial services 
     businesses.

(2)  Xerox' ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the Xerox' finance subsidiaries which primarily finance Xerox equipment.
     Financing businesses, due to their nature, traditionally operate at lower
     earnings to fixed charges ratio levels than do non-financial companies.

(*)  In 1993, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $1,373 million before-tax ($813 million after-tax) charge incurred
     in connection with the restructuring provision and litigation
     settlements.  Excluding this charge, the ratio was 2.13.  1993 Earnings
     were inadequate to cover fixed charges.  The coverage deficiency was $283
     million.

(**) In 1992, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $936 million before-tax ($778 million after-tax) charges incurred in
     connection with the decision to disengage from the Company's IOFS 
     businesses.  Excluding this charge, the ratio was 1.96.

(***)In 1991, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $175 million before-tax charge incurred in connection with the
     Document Processing work-force reduction announced in December 1991.
     Excluding this charge, the ratio was 2.03.
