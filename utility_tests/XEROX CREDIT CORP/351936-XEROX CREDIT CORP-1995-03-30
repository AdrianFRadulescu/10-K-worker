                                    PART I

ITEM 1.     Business

      Xerox Credit Corporation, a Delaware corporation (together with its
subsidiaries herein called "the Company" unless the context otherwise
requires), was organized on June 23, 1980.  All of the Company's outstanding
capital stock is owned by Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI), a holding
company, which is wholly-owned by Xerox Corporation (Xerox Corporation
together with its subsidiaries are herein called "Xerox" unless the context
otherwise requires).

      The Company is engaged in financing long-term accounts receivable
arising out of equipment sales by Xerox to its Document Processing customers
throughout the United States.  Contract terms on these accounts receivable
range primarily from two to five years.

      The Company discontinued its real-estate development and related real-
estate financing businesses in the first quarter of 1990.  In the fourth
quarter of 1990, the Company discontinued its third-party financing and
leasing businesses.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.

      Xerox is a global company serving the worldwide Document Processing
markets.  Xerox' Document Processing activities encompass developing,
manufacturing, marketing, servicing and financing a complete range
of document processing products and services designed to make offices
around the world more productive.  These products and systems are
marketed in over 130 countries by a direct sales force and a network of
agents, dealers, distributors and value-added resellers, as well as through 
U.S. retail marketing channels.  The financing of Xerox equipment is
generally carried out by the Company in the United States and internationally
by several foreign financing subsidiaries.

ITEM 2.     Properties

      The Company does not directly own any facilities in order to carry on
its principal business.  Its principal executive offices in Stamford,
Connecticut comprise approximately 25,000 square feet of office space.
In addition, the Company leases approximately 1,200 square feet of office
space at various domestic and international locations, the majority of
which are used by the Company's discontinued operations.  These facilities
are deemed adequate by management.

ITEM 3.     Legal Proceedings

      None.

            Results of Operations

Results of Operations
                         Continuing Operations

      Contracts receivable income represents income earned under an agreement
with Xerox pursuant to which the Company purchases long-term accounts 
receivable associated with Xerox' sold equipment.  These receivables arise 
from Xerox equipment being sold under installment sales and sales-type leases.
In 1994, the Company purchased receivables from Xerox totaling $1,916 million 
compared to $1,848 million in 1993.  Earned income from contracts receivable 
decreased in 1994 to $362 million from $376 million in 1993.  The 1994 
decrease is due to lower interest earned on Xerox' contracts receivable which 
reflects the fact that a significant number of those contracts were activated 
in 1993 and 1992 when market interest rates were at a ten year low.  Earned 
income from contracts receivable decreased in 1993 to $376 million from $389 
million in 1992.  The decrease in earned income was the result of lower 
purchases of contracts receivable in 1993 compared to 1992, due to weak United 
States sales early in 1993 because of the reorganization of the Xerox United 
States Customer Operations sales force, as well as lower interest income 
earned on Xerox contracts receivable resulting from declining interest rates.

      Interest expense was $202 million in 1994 compared to $209 million in
1993, a decrease of $7 million.  The 1994 decrease resulted from lower 
overall interest rates partially offset by increased borrowings required 
to fund the Company's additional investment in contracts receivable.  The $209 
million of interest expense in 1993 was a decrease of $3 million from the 1992 
interest expense of $212 million.  The 1993 decrease reflected lower interest 
rates partially offset by increased borrowings required to fund the 
Company's additional investment in contracts receivable.  The Company intends 
to continue to match its contracts receivable and indebtedness to maintain the
relationship between interest income and interest expense.

      Operating and administrative expenses were $13 million for 1994, the
same amount as in 1993.  Operating and administrative expenses
decreased to $13 million in 1993 compared to $19 million in 1992.  This
decrease was due primarily to operating efficiencies associated with the
administration of contracts receivable purchased from Xerox.

      The effective income tax rate for 1994 was 40.8 percent as compared
with 40.9 percent for 1993 and 39.9 percent for 1992, respectively.  The
increase in the effective tax rates in 1993 compared to 1992 was due primarily
to the 1993 increase in the corporate federal income tax rates from 34 percent
to 35 percent retroactive to January 1, 1993.

                         Discontinued Operations

      Since their discontinuance in 1990, the Company has made substantial
progress in disengaging from the real-estate and third-party financing 
businesses.  During the three years ended  December 31, 1994, the Company
received net cash proceeds of $841 million from the sale of discontinued
business units and assets, from several asset securitizations and from run-off
collection activities.  The amounts received were consistent with the
Company's estimates in the disposal plan and were primarily used to reduce the
Company's short-term indebtedness.  At December 31, 1994, the Company remains
contingently liable for approximately $50 million under recourse provisions
associated with the securitization transactions.

      Since a portion of the remaining assets ($62 million) represents
passive lease receivables, many with long-duration contractual maturities and
unique tax attributes, the Company expects that the wind-down of the portfolio
will be significantly slower in 1995 and future years, compared with 
prior years.  The Company believes that the liquidation of
the remaining assets will not result in a net loss.

      In January 1995, Xerox signed a definitive agreement for the sale of 
Xerox Financial Services Life Insurance Company(XFSLIC), a subsidiary of the 
Company's parent, Xerox Financial Service, Inc.  The Company's $74 million 
investment in XFSLIC, representing a 26% interest, is reported as a component 
of net assets of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet.  
Closing of the sale is expected in the first half of 1995.  The Company 
anticipates that the ultimate disposition of this investment will not result 
in a net loss.


      Additional information regarding discontinued operations is included in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

      The Company's principal sources of funds are cash from the collection
of Xerox contracts receivable and borrowings.

      At December 31, 1994, the Company and Xerox have joint access to three
revolving credit agreements totaling $5 billion with various banks, which
expire from 1995 to 1999.  The interest on amounts borrowed under these
facilities is at rates based, at the borrower's option, on spreads above
certain reference rates such as LIBOR and Federal funds rates.

      Net cash provided by operating activities was $20 million in 1994
compared with $48 million of cash used in 1993.  The 1994 decrease in cash
used by operating activities is mainly attributable to the comparatively 
smaller reduction in the deferred income taxes payable balance offset by 
greater reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of 
payments.  Net cash used in operating activities was $48 million in 1993 
compared with $23 million in 1992.  The 1993 increase in cash used by 
operating activities was mainly attributable to the reduction in accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments.

      Net cash provided by investing activities was $47 million in 1994
compared to $21 million provided in 1993.  The increase in cash provided by 
investing activities was the result of higher net collections from the 
Company's investment in contracts receivable in 1994,which was partially 
offset by lower net collections from discontinued operations.  Net cash 
provided by investing activities was $21 million in 1993 compared to $58
million of cash used in investing activities in 1992.  The increase in cash 
provided by investing activities was the result of higher net
collections from the Company's investment in contracts receivable in 1993,
which was partially offset by lower net collections from discontinued 
operations.

      Net cash used in financing activities was $68 million in 1994
compared to $26 million provided in 1993.  The increase in cash used was
the result of less net borrowing and payment of higher dividends in 1994.  Net 
cash provided by financing activities was $26 million in 1993 compared to $79 
million in 1992.  The decrease in cash provided was the result of increased 
principal payments on the Company's long-term debt.

<PAGE>

      The Company believes that cash provided by continuing operations, cash
available under its commercial paper program supported by its credit
facilities, and its readily available access to the capital markets are more
than sufficient for its funding needs.  During 1995, new borrowing associated
with the financing of customer purchases of Xerox equipment will continue.
The timing, principal amount and form of new short- and long-term financing
will be determined based upon the Company's need for financing and prevailing
debt market conditions.

      The Company intends to continue to match fund interest income from its 
contracts receivable with interest obligations on its indebtedness.   To  
lock-in interest spreads on new business and reduce interest cost, the
Company has entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements.  In
general, the Company's objective is to hedge its variable-rate debt by paying
fixed rates under the swap agreements while receiving variable-rate based
payments in return.  The Company has also entered into swap agreements
that convert both fixed-and non-commercial paper based variable-rate interest
payments into payments that are indexed to commercial paper rates.

      During 1994, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements, which effectively converted $430 million of variable-rate
debt into fixed-rate debt.  These agreements mature at various dates
through 1997 and resulted in a weighted average fixed-rate of 6.71 percent
at December 31,1994.  The Company also entered into interest rate 
swap agreements during 1994 which effectively converted $275 million of
variable-rate debt into variable-rate debt that is indexed to the commercial
paper rates.  These agreements mature at various dates through 1997.

      As of December 31, 1994, the Company's overall debt-to-equity ratio
was 6.5 to 1.  The Company declared aggregate dividends of $88 million, $59
million and $60 million during 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 
Company currently intends to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 
6.5 to 1.

      Pursuant to a Support Agreement between the Company and Xerox,
Xerox has  agreed to retain ownership of 100 percent of the voting capital
stock of the Company and to make periodic payments to the extent necessary
to ensure that the Company's annual pre-tax earnings available for
fixed charges equal at least 1.25 times the Company's fixed charges.

                        Report of Independent Auditors



The Board of Directors
Xerox Credit Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Xerox Credit
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index.  In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index.  These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Xerox
Credit Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1992.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      Basis of Presentation

      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xerox
Credit Corporation (the Company) and its subsidiaries.  The Company is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI), which is in
turn wholly-owned by Xerox Corporation (Xerox).  All significant transactions
between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated.

      Recognition of Earned Income

      The Company utilizes the interest method for the recognition of 
earned income associated with contracts receivable.  Under this method, the
difference between the amount of gross contract receivable and the cost of
the contract is recorded as unearned income.  The unearned income is
amortized to income over the term of the transaction under an effective yield
method.

      Cash and Cash Equivalents

      All highly liquid investments of the Company, with a maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase, are considered to be cash equivalents.

      Allowance for Losses

      In connection with the contracts receivable purchased from Xerox, the
Company retains an allowance for losses at the time of purchase which is
intended to protect against future losses.  Should any additional allowances
be required, Xerox is required to provide such funding.  The resultant effect
is to relieve the Company of any exposure with regard to write-offs
associated with the contracts receivable purchased from Xerox.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

      Charge Off of Delinquent Receivables

      The Company's policy with respect to the charge-off of delinquent
receivables is that  receivables are charged off as soon as it becomes 
apparent that the collection of the receivables through normal means is 
unlikely.  The policy contemplates that delinquent receivables
will be charged off before the aging of such delinquent receivables
reaches 180 days.

      New Accounting Pronouncements

      Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109- "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The
effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 had no impact on shareholder's
equity and income from continuing operations in 1992.  A tax benefit of $87 
million was recorded to discontinued operations and represented the 
cumulative tax benefits associated with the discontinued real-estate 
operations that were not previously recorded.

      Also, effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106-
"Employees' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions," which
changes the method of recording other postretirement benefit costs from a cash
basis to the accrual basis.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 106 on
the Company was immaterial.

      Commencing in 1994,  SFAS No. 112- "Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits"  requires accrual accounting for employee benefits 
that are paid after the termination of active employment but prior to 
retirement.  SFAS No.112 did not have an impact on operating results of the 
Company as the applicable benefits are either routinely accrued or are types 
of benefits not currently offered by the Company.

      Effective December 31, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 119-
"Disclosure about Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments". The typical transactions with off-balance sheet risk which the
Company enters into are interest rate swap agreements.  See Note 4 on Page 21 
for disclosure relating to these derivative financial instruments.

(2)   Discontinued Operations

      The Company has made substantial progress in disengaging from the
real-estate and third-party financing businesses that were discontinued in
1990.  During the three years ended December 31, 1994, the Company
received aggregate net cash proceeds of $841 million ($129 million in 1994,
$232 million in 1993 and $480 million in 1992) from the sale of individual
assets, from several asset securitizations and from run-off collection 
activities.  The amounts received were consistent with the Company's estimates 
in the disposal plan and were used primarily to repay short-term indebtedness. 
At December 31, 1994, the Company remains contingently liable for $50 million 
under recourse provisions associated with the securitization transactions.

      During 1992, incremental tax benefits of $122 million were realized by 
the Company related to the write-off of its real estate businesses in 1990.  
Rather than recording these tax benefits in net income, the Company increased 
before-tax reserves related to the discontinued businesses.  Management 
believed this prudent in view of weak market conditions and continuing 
uncertainties in the domestic real-estate and credit markets.

      Approximately $62 million (21 percent) of the remaining assets
represent passive lease receivables, many with long-duration contractual
maturities and unique tax attributes.  Accordingly, the Company expects that
the wind-down of the portfolio will be slower during 1995 and in future years,
compared with prior years.  The Company believes that the liquidation of the
remaining assets will not result in a net loss.

      Short-and long-term debt represents debt included in the Company's
consolidated balance sheets that has been assigned to the discontinued
businesses in accordance with historical methodologies.  Interest expense 
assigned to discontinued businesses for 1994 and 1993 was $10 million and $14 
million, respectively. Proceeds from disposition of these businesses, along 
with their results of operations during the phase-out period, are expected to 
be used to repay such consolidated indebtedness.

1999; $1; 2000 and thereafter-$61.

          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(3)   Investments

      Contracts receivable represent purchases of long-term trade accounts
receivable from Xerox.  These receivables arise from Xerox equipment being
sold under installment sales and sales-type leases.  Contract terms on
these receivables range primarily from two to five years and are generally
collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.  The Company
purchased receivables from Xerox totaling $1,916 million in 1994, $1,848
million in 1993, and $1,964 million in 1992.  The Company was charged $11
million in 1994 and 1993, and $10 million in 1992 by Xerox for administrative 
costs associated with the contracts receivable purchased from Xerox.

      Under SFAS No. 107- "Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial
Instruments," the Company is not required to determine the fair value of
these receivables.  Management believes that any revaluation of the
contracts receivable would result in a fair value in excess
of the carrying value of these receivables.

      The scheduled maturities of contracts receivable at December 31,
1994 are as follows (in millions):  1995-$1,702; 1996-$1,206; 1997-$785;
1998-$368; 1999-$133; 2000 and thereafter- $9. Experience has shown that a
portion of these contracts receivable will be prepaid prior to maturity.
Accordingly, the preceding schedule of contractual maturities should not
be considered a forecast of future cash collections.

      Included in the $59 million notes receivable balance from Xerox and 
affiliates are receivables from related parties payable on demand at various 
interest rates.  $50 million of these amounts is a floating rate note from
XFSI.

(4)   Lines of Credit and Interest Rate Swaps

      At December 31, 1994, the Company and Xerox had joint access to three
revolving credit agreements totaling $5.0 billion with various banks, which
expire from 1995 to 1999.  These agreements are unused and are available to 
back the issuance of commercial paper.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had 
a total of $1.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding. The average interest 
rate paid on commercial paper issued in 1994 was 4.4 percent.

      The Company routinely enters into interest rate swap agreements
in the management of interest rate exposure.  An interest rate swap is an 
agreement to exchange interest rate payment streams based on a notional 
principal amount.  In general, the Company's objective is to hedge its 
variable-rate debt by paying fixed rates under the swap agreements and 
receiving commercial paper-rate payments in return.  These swap agreements 
effectively convert an amount (equal to the notional amount) of underlying 
variable-rate commercial paper into fixed-rate debt.  The net interest rate 
differentials that will be paid or received are recorded currently as 
adjustments to interest expense.  The counterparties to these swap agreements 
are typically major commercial banks.

The Company does not enter into swap transactions for trading 
or other speculative purposes.  The Company's policies on the use of such
derivative instruments prescribe an investment grade counterparty credit floor 
and at least quarterly monitoring of market risk on a counterparty-by-
counterparty basis.  Based upon its ongoing evaluation of the replacement cost 
of its derivatives transactions and counterparty creditworthiness, the Company 
considers the risk of credit default significantly affecting its financial 
position or results of operations to be remote.  The Company's interest rate 
hedging activities are largely unaffected by changes in market 
conditions as swaps are typically held to maturity in order to lock in 
interest spreads on underlying transactions.

The aggregate amounts of interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 1994
 and 1993 are as follows:
                                               (Dollars in millions)
                                                1994           1993

Pay fixed/receive variable                    $1,555          $2,050
Pay variable/receive variable                    425             375
Pay variable/receive fixed                         0               0

                                              $1,980          $2,425

Average interest payment rates                  5.54%           5.39%

      At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company's swap agreements had an 
aggregate net fair value of $45 million and $(35) million, respectively, based 
on quotes from banks.  These values represents the estimated net amounts the 
Company would have received and paid had the agreements been terminated as of 
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company has no present plans to 
terminate any of these agreements prior to their scheduled maturities.

(d)   The notes mature August 15, 2048 and are repayable at the option of
      the noteholders beginning August 15, 1993 and annually thereafter.
      The outstanding notes are classified as notes payable after one
      year, since the Company has the ability to refinance them on
      a long-term basis, if required.  The interest rate is indexed to
      rates on commercial paper placed for issuers whose commercial paper
      rating is "AA" or the equivalent as reported in Federal Reserve
      Statistical Release H.15 (519), which at year-end was 6.03 percent.

(e)   The 1996 and 1997 medium term notes carry average interest rates of 
      5.24% and 5.99%, respectively.

      Principal payments on notes payable for the next five years are:
$403 million in 1995; $684 million in 1996; $351 million in 1997;
$0 million in 1998;  $150 million in 1999; and $61 million thereafter.

      Certain of the Company's debt agreements allow it to redeem outstanding
debt, usually at par, prior to scheduled maturity.  Outstanding debt issues
with these call features are classified on the balance sheet and in the
preceding five-year maturity table in accordance with management's current
expectations.  The actual decision as to early redemption will be made at
the time the early redemption option becomes exercisable and will be based
on economic and business conditions then in existence.

      Interest payments on notes payable for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
$137 million, $148 million, and $166 million, respectively.  Interest payments
on commercial paper for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were $66 million, $48 million
and $40 million, respectively.  The weighted-average commercial paper interest
rates for 1994, 1993 and 1992 were 4.4 percent, 3.3 percent and 3.9 percent,
respectively.

      At December 31, 1994 and 1993, carrying values of notes payable  were 
$1,649 million and $1,634 million, respectively, substantially all of 
which are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 107- "Disclosures about
Fair Values of Financial Instruments."  The fair values of the Company's
notes payable at December 31, 1994 and 1993 were $1,640 million and $1,698 
million,respectively, based on quoted market prices for the notes or 
other issues with similar features and maturity dates.  The difference between
the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net amounts 
the Company would have received or paid if it had retired all notes payable at
December 31, 1994 or 1993, respectively.  The Company has no plans to retire 
its notes payable prior to their call or final maturity dates.

      The original issue discount and other expenses associated with the debt
offerings are amortized over the term of the related issue.

(6)   Income Taxes

      

      Income taxes are provided at statutory rates based on income before
income taxes exclusive of the amortization of investment tax credits and
earnings not subject to Federal taxation.  Substantially all of the Company's
operations are included in Xerox' consolidated income tax returns.  In
connection with these consolidated returns, the Company paid Xerox $86
million, $136 million, and $15 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
The Company paid $10 million in 1994, and $1 million in both 1993 and 1992, to 
taxing authorities for Company operations not included in Xerox' consolidated 
tax returns.

      Deferred income taxes for 1993 and 1992 result from differences
between financial and tax reporting in the timing of the recognition of income
on securitized assets.

      The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of deferred taxes at December 31, 1994 follows:

                                                     (In millions)

        The 1994 reduction in deferred income taxes payable is the result of 
sales of certain discontinued operations assets.  The Company believes that it 
is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the 
ordinary course of operations based on scheduling of deferred tax liabilities 
and income from operating activities.

(7)   Xerox Corporation Support Agreement

      The terms of a Support Agreement with Xerox provide that the Company
will receive income maintenance payments, to the extent necessary, so that
the Company's earnings shall not be less than 1.25 times its fixed charges.
For purposes of this calculation, both earnings and fixed charges are
as defined in Section 1404 (formerly Section 81(2)) of the New York Insurance
Law.  In addition, the agreement requires that Xerox retain 100 percent
ownership of the Company's voting capital stock.

                          XEROX CREDIT CORPORATION
               COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
                                (In Millions)

                                            Year Ended December 31,
                                1994      1993      1992     1991     1990

Income before income taxes     $ 147     $ 154     $ 158    $ 164    $ 182

Fixed charges:
  Interest expense
    Xerox debt                     5         4         2        -        2
    Other debt                   197       205       210      200      205
      Total fixed charges        202       209       212      200      207
Earnings available for
  fixed charges                $ 349     $ 363     $ 370    $ 364    $ 389

Ratio of earnings to
  fixed charges (1)             1.73      1.74      1.75     1.82     1.88

(1)  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the
     Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available
     for fixed charges by total fixed charges.  Interest expense has been
     assigned to discontinued operations principally on the basis of
     the relative amount of gross assets of the discontinued operations.
     Management believes that this allocation method is reasonable in
     light of the amount of debt specifically assigned to discontinued
     operations.  The discontinued operations consist of the Company's
     real-estate development and related financing operations and its
     third-party financing and leasing businesses.

  fixed charges (1)(2)            2.67        0.71     1.09    1.86     1.99


(1)  The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on
     Xerox' continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for
     fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest, by total fixed charges.
     Fixed charges consist of interest, including capitalized interest, and
     one-third of rent expense as representative of the interest portion of
     rentals. Interest expense has been  assigned to discontinued operations
     principally on the basis of the relative amount of gross assets of the
     discontinued operations. Xerox management believes that this allocation
     method is reasonable in light of the debt specifically assigned to
     discontinued operations.  The discontinued operations consist of Xerox'
     real-estate development and related financing operations, third-
     party financing and leasing businesses, and other financial services 
     businesses.

                                                                   (Cont'd)


(2)  Xerox' ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the Xerox' finance subsidiaries which primarily finance Xerox equipment.
     Financing businesses, due to their nature, traditionally operate at lower
     earnings to fixed charges ratio levels than do non-financial companies.

(*)  In 1993, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $1,373 million before-tax ($813 million after-tax) charge incurred
     in connection with the restructuring provision and litigation
     settlements.  Excluding this charge, the ratio was 2.13.  1993 Earnings
     were inadequate to cover fixed charges.  The coverage deficiency was $283
     million.

(**) In 1992, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $936 million before-tax ($778 million after-tax) charges incurred in
     connection with the decision to disengage from the Company's IOFS 
     businesses.  Excluding this charge, the ratio was 1.96.

(***)In 1991, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
     the $175 million before-tax charge incurred in connection with the
     Document Processing work-force reduction announced in December 1991.
     Excluding this charge, the ratio was 2.03.
