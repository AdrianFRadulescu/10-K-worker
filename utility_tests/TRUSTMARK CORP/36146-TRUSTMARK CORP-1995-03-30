                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Trustmark Corporation (Corporation) is a one-bank holding company which
was incorporated under the Mississippi Business Corporation Act on August 5,
1968 and commenced doing business in November 1968. At December 31, 1994, the
Corporation had total consolidated assets of $4.8 billion and total
consolidated equity of $421 million. The Corporation's primary business
activities are generated through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trustmark
National Bank (Trustmark).  The Corporation became the sole owner of Trustmark
on October 7, 1994 when it exchanged 137,514 shares of the Corporation's common
stock for the minority shareholders' interest.  Trustmark accounts for
substantially all of the total assets and total revenues of the Corporation.
Trustmark, which was chartered by the State of Mississippi in 1889, is
headquartered in Jackson and is the largest bank in the state having total
assets at December 31, 1994, of approximately $4.8 billion and deposits of $3.4
billion.

     Trustmark's primary means of asset growth has been through mergers and
acquisitions of financial institutions.   The most recent acquisition involved
the merger of Trustmark Corporation and First National Financial Corporation
(FNFC) of Vicksburg, Mississippi.  This merger was consummated after the close
of business on October 7, 1994, and has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests.  The stockholders of FNFC received 3,600,262 shares of Trustmark
Corporation stock and approximately $1,105,000 in cash in connection with this
merger.

     Trustmark's retail banking system offers a variety of deposit, investment
and credit products to its customers through a branch network with facilities
in 156 locations.  Trustmark is well established as a provider of depository,
credit and cash management services to middle-market and larger businesses.
These services range from payroll checking, business checking accounts,
corporate savings, secured and unsecured lines of credit and loans to direct
deposit payroll, sweep accounts and letters of credit.  Trustmark also offers
MasterCard, VISA and VISA Gold credit card services to consumers and merchants
throughout Mississippi.  In addition, Trustmark successfully introduced the
Trustmark Express Check debit card in 1994 which allows customers to access
their checking or savings account through any merchant that accepts MasterCard
and at any Trustmark Express, Gulfnet or Cirrus automated teller machine.
Trustmark's Trust Services business unit provides services in three areas:
custody, investment management and ancillary services such as a third party
fiscal agent. Trustmark's Investment Services unit provides both institutional
and retail customers with quality investment opportunities through its Dealer
Bank Department and Trustmark Financial Services, Inc. (TFSI), its wholly-
owned
<PAGE>   4
subsidiary.  Full-service brokerage was added as a service in 1994, and plans
are being made for expansion of offices in Trustmark branch locations.

     In addition, the Corporation directly owns all of the stock of F. S.
Corporation and First Building Corporation, both nonbank Mississippi
corporations.  F. S. Corporation previously developed automobile financing,
including all incidental and related matters.  First Building Corporation
previously managed and operated its own real estate investments.  Today, F. S.
Corporation and First Building   Corporation are dormant corporations and are
not significant subsidiaries.

    As of January 31, 1995, the Corporation and its subsidiaries employed 2,206
full-time equivalent employees.

COMPETITION

     Trustmark competes with national and state banks in its service areas for
all types of depository, credit, investment and trust services.  In addition,
Trustmark competes in its respective service areas with other financial
institutions including savings and loan associations, personal loan companies,
consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, brokerage
firms, investment companies, credit unions and financial service operations of
major retailers.  Trustmark competes with these financial institutions in the
areas of interest rates, the availability and quality of services and products,
and the pricing of these services and products.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

     The Corporation is a registered bank holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  As such, the Corporation is required
to file an annual report and such additional information as the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System may require.  The Act requires every
bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Board of Governors
before it may acquire substantially all the assets of  any bank, or ownership
or control of any voting shares of any bank, if, after the acquisition, it
would own or control, directly or  indirectly,  more  than  five  percent  of
the voting shares of the bank. In addition, a bank holding company is generally
prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of voting
shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities.  One of the principal
exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Board of
Governors, by order or regulation, to be closely related to banking or managing
or controlling banks "as to be a proper incident thereto." The Board has by
regulation determined that a number of activities are closely related to
banking within the meaning of the Act. In addition, the Corporation is subject
to regulation by the State of Mississippi under its laws of incorporation.

     Trustmark is subject to various requirements and restrictions by federal
and state banking authorities including the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC) and the Mississippi
<PAGE>   5
Department of Banking.  Areas subject to regulation include loans, reserves,
investments, issuance of securities, establishment of branches, loans to
directors, executive officers and their related interests, relationships with
correspondent banks, consumer protection and other aspects of operations.  In
addition, national banks are subject to legal limitations on the amount of
earnings they may pay as dividends. Trustmark also is insured by, and therefore
subject to the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

     In December 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991 (FDICIA) was enacted.  FDICIA substantially revised the depository
institution regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act and made revisions to several other federal banking statutes.  Among other
things, FDICIA requires banking regulators to take prompt corrective action
whenever financial institutions do not meet minimum capital requirements.  In
addition, FDICIA has created restrictions on capital distributions that would
leave a depository institution undercapitalized.

     In May of 1993, the FDIC adopted the final rule implementing Section 112
of FDICIA.  This regulation includes requirements, procedures and interpretive
guidelines that mandate new audit and reporting requirements for financial
institutions.  As a result of these new requirements, certain formal
attestations, assertions and documentation must be imposed on existing control
structures.  This regulation became effective for fiscal years ending after
December 31, 1992.

     Nonaccruing loans have been included in the average loan balances and
interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has
been included in interest income.  Interest income and average yield on
tax-exempt assets have been calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis using a
tax rate of 35% for 1994 and 1993 and 34% for 1992.  Certain reclassifications
have been made to the 1993 and 1992 statements to conform to the 1994 method of
presentation.

     The change in interest due to both volume and yield/rate has been
allocated to change due to volume and change due to yield/rate in proportion to
the absolute value of the change in each.  Tax-exempt income has been adjusted
to a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35% for 1994 and 1993 and 34% for
1992.  The balances of nonaccrual loans and related income recognized have been
included for purposes of these computations.

     Included in the above maturity schedule are mortgage related securities
totaling $977,518,000 which have contractual maturities as follow:  Within One
Year - $924,000; After One, But Within Five Years - $17,437,000; After Five,
But Within Ten Years - $144,920,000; After Ten Years - $814,237,000.  Due to
the nature of mortgage related securities, the actual maturities of these
investments can be substantially shorter than their contractual maturity.
Management believes the actual weighted average maturity of the entire mortgage
related portfolio to be approximately 4.18 years.

     Interest which would have been accrued on nonaccrual and restructured
loans if they had been in compliance with their original terms is immaterial.

     At December 31, 1994 the Corporation had no loan concentrations greater
than ten percent of total loans except as shown in Table 5.

     At December 31, 1994 there were no interest-earning assets that would be
required to be disclosed if such assets were loans.

     It is the Corporation's policy that interest will not be accrued on any
loan for which payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, on any
loan which is seriously delinquent unless the obligation is both well secured
and in the process of collection, or on any loan that is maintained on a cash
basis due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.
Management considers a debt to be "well secured" if it is secured by collateral
in the form of liens on or pledges of real or personal property that have a
realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full or by the guaranty of
a financially responsible party.  A debt is considered to be "in process of
collection" if, based on a probable specific event, it is expected that the
loan will be repaid or brought current.  At December 31, 1994, the Corporation
has no loans about which Management has serious doubts as to their
collectibility other than those disclosed above.

</TABLE>




     The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan
losses charged to expenses.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan
losses when Management believes that the collection of the principal is
unlikely.

     The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which Management
and the Board of Directors believe is adequate to absorb estimated losses
inherent in the loan portfolio.  The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed on a
quarterly basis by using the criteria specified in revised Comptroller of the
Currency Banking Circular 201, as well as additional guidance provided by
regulatory authorities.  Each review includes analyses of historical loss
experience, trends in portfolio volume and composition and consideration of
current economic conditions.  Once this information is analyzed, it is used as
the basis for allocations for significant credits that are individually
analyzed and for pools of other problem credits, homogeneous uncriticized
loans, credits by industry or concentration, and other off-balance sheet
commitments to lend.  During 1994, the provision for loan losses equalled net
charge-offs.  Management considered it prudent to maintain the allowance for
loan losses at $65.014 million at December 31, 1994 in light of recent
improvements in net charge-offs and nonperforming assets.

The following table is a summary by allocation category of the Corporation's
allowance for loan losses at December 31, 1994.  These allocations were
determined by internal formulas based upon Management's analyses of the various
types of risk associated with the Corporation's loan portfolio.  A discussion

</TABLE>



     The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses which is considered
sufficient to absorb potential losses.  The methodology employed in order to
determine an amount which is considered adequate utilizes the criteria
specified in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's revised Banking
Circular 201 as well as guidance provided in the Interagency Policy Statement.
Loss percentages were uniformly applied to pools of risk-rated loans within the
commercial portfolio.  The percentages utilized were determined based on
migration analysis, previously established floors for each category and
economic factors.  In addition, relationships of $500,000 or more which were
risk-rated Other Loans Especially Mentioned (OLEM) or Substandard and all which
were risk-rated Doubtful were reviewed by the Corporation's Internal Asset
Review staff to determine if the standard percentages appeared to be sufficient
to cover potential loss on each line.  In the event that the percentages on any
particular lines were determined to be insufficient, additional allocations
were made based upon recommendations of lending and asset review personnel.

     Industry allocations were made based on concentrations of credit within
the portfolio as well as arbitrary designation of certain other industries by
Management.

     The general allocation is included in the allowance to cover potential
loan losses within portions of the loan portfolio not addressed in the
preceeding allocations.  The types of loans included in the general allocation
were residential mortgage loans, direct and indirect installment loans, credit
card loans and overdrafts.  The actual allocation amount was based upon the
more conservative estimate of loss experience within these categories during
1994, the historical 5-year moving average for each category, or previously
established floors.

     The amount included in the allocation for lines of credit and letters of
credit consists of a percentage of the unused portion of those lines and the
amount outstanding in letters of credit.   Arbitrary percentages, which were
the same as those applied to the funded portions of the commercial and retail
loan portfolios, were applied to cover any potential losses in these
off-balance sheet categories.

     The remaining $27,440,000 is discretionary and serves as added protection
in the event that any of the above specific components are determined to be
inadequate or for issues that cannot or have not been measured on a
quantitative basis over a prolonged period of time.  Because of the imprecision
inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses, Management will continue
to take a prudent, yet conservative approach in the evaluation of the allowance
for loan losses.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Corporation does not directly own or lease any physical properties.
All properties are owned or leased by Trustmark whose main office is located in
Jackson, Mississippi and is housed in a 14-floor combination office and bank
building owned in fee.  Approximately 132,000 square feet (50%) of the rentable
space in the building is allocated to bank use with the remainder occupied by
tenants on a lease basis. Trustmark operates 98 full-service and 27
limited-service branches. In addition, the Bank's ATM Network includes 68 ATMs
at on-premise locations with 42 located at off-premise sites. Trustmark leases
35 of the 156 total locations with the remainder being owned.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     In January 1995, a judgment was rendered in a Mississippi circuit court
against the Corporation's subsidiary, Trustmark National Bank, in a case
related to the placement of collateral protection insurance ("CPI") by
Trustmark on a particular loan.  The judgment awarded $500 thousand in actual
damages and $38 million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs.  Several other
suits relating to CPI have been filed against Trustmark and are pending at
various stages.  Management of the Corporation is vigorously pursuing the appeal
of the judgment mentioned above and the defense of the other pending suits.
While the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, Management believes,
based on the advice of legal counsel, that the judgment referred to above will
be reversed or substantially reduced and that the impact of this matter, the
other CPI related suits or any additional claims related to CPI will not be
material to the results of operations or financial position of the Corporation.

     Trustmark is involved in various other legal matters and claims which are
being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  None of these
other matters is expected, in the opinion of Management, to have a material
adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the
Corporation.  

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to the Corporation's shareholders during
the fourth quarter of 1994.

                      DIRECTORS DEFERRED INCOME AGREEMENT

         This Agreement is entered into by and between FIRST NATIONAL BANK,
VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI (the "Bank"), and (the "Director").

                             W I T N E S S E T H :

         WHEREAS, the Bank recognizes that the competent and faithful efforts
of the Director on behalf of the Bank have contributed significantly to the
success and growth of the Bank;

         WHEREAS, the Bank values the efforts, abilities and accomplishments of
the Director and recognizes the Director's services will substantially 
contribute to its continued growth and profits in the future;

         WHEREAS, the Bank desires to compensate the Director and retain the
services of the Director if re-elected to serve on the Board of Directors;

         WHEREAS, the Director, in consideration of the foregoing, agrees to
 continue to serve as a Director, if re-elected;

         WHEREAS, the Director has agreed to defer receipt of fees to be earned
in the future.



                                       1
<PAGE>   2
         NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:

ARTICLE 1. DEFINITIONS

         For the purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context so indicates,
the capitalized terms shall have the following meanings:

  Beneficiary:            The person or persons designated by the Director who
                          may become entitled to receive the compensation
                          payable Under Article 3 and Article 4 of this 
                          Agreement (see Article 8).

  Deferral Period:        The Sixty (60) month period which commenced on the
                          date shown on the Addendum to this Agreement. An
                          Election to Participate Form signed by the Director is
                          included and made a part of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2. DEFERRAL OF FEES

         The Director has elected to defer receipt of Director's fees to be
earned during the Deferral Period. Once the Director has executed the Election
to Participate Form, a subsequent increase in the Director's fees payable due
to an increase in the fee structure shall also be deferred under the provisions
of this Agreement, unless the Director directs the Secretary in writing within
10 days after notification of the increase and prior to the right to receive
the additional fees that such additional fees are not to be deferred. If
Director fees are increased or decreased during the Deferral Period, the
compensation payable under Article 3 and Article 4 shall be actuarially
determined and evidenced by an Addendum to this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3. COMPENSATION

         The Bank agrees to pay Director, if living, and if not, then to the
designated Beneficiary, the annualized amount as shown in the Addendum to this
Agreement, payable in monthly



                                       2
<PAGE>   3
installments, for a total of One Hundred Twenty (120) consecutive monthly
installments, commencing on the first business day of the month following the
end of the Deferral Period, or upon Director's death if such shall occur before
the payments have commenced. The payments may be accelerated or paid in a lump
sum at the request of the Director and subject to the Board's discretion.
Accelerated payments are to be actuarially determined to be of substantially the
same value as payments made under the terms of this Article using the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation interest rate for and valuing deferred and
immediate annuities. However, in any event, post-retirement amounts payable
under this Article 3 and the Addendum to this Agreement shall be adjusted as
provided by the provisions of Article 5 as required therein.

ARTICLE 4. DEATH OF DIRECTOR AFTER BEGINNING OF PAYMENTS

         If the Director dies after the beginning of monthly payments, but 
prior to receiving the full One Hundred Twenty (120) monthly installments, the
Bank shall continue to pay such monthly installments to the Director's 
Beneficiary until the total number of payments made to the Director and his or 
her Beneficiary equal One Hundred Twenty (120).

ARTICLE 5. BENEFIT REDUCTION CLAUSE

         (a) Termination. If the Director shall terminate service on the Board
during the Deferral Period, the post-retirement benefits provided under this
Agreement will be reduced prorata by the amount of time remaining in the
Deferral Period.

         (b) Absenteeism. Post-retirement benefits payable under this Agreement
shall be reduced for meetings missed during the Deferral Period. The amount of 
reduction shall be determined by treating each year separately. The reduction 
shall be actuarially calculated and shall depend upon the fees attributed to 
the meeting missed and the year in which missed.



                                       3
<PAGE>   4
ARTICLE 6. STATUS OF AGREEMENT

         This Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment between the
parties, nor shall any provision of this Agreement restrict the right of the
Bank's shareholders to replace the Director or the right of the Director to
terminate service on the Board.

ARTICLE 7. BINDING EFFECT

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and upon the successors and assigns of the Bank, and upon the
heirs and legal representatives of the Director.

ARTICLE 8. BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION

         For purposes of this Agreement, the Director may from time to time
designate, in writing, any person or persons, contingently or successively to
whom the Bank shall pay the Director's benefits on event of the Director's
death. The Bank shall prescribe the form for the written designation or
Beneficiary and, upon the Director's filing the form with the Bank, it
effectively shall revoke all designations filed prior to that date by the
Director. If the Director fails to designate a Beneficiary or if the
Beneficiary designated by the Director predeceases him or dies before complete
distribution of the Director's benefits, then the Bank shall pay the Director's
benefits to the legal representative of the estate of the last to die of the
Director and his or her Beneficiary.

ARTICLE. 9. INCOMPETENCY

         If the Bank shall find that any person to whom any payment is payable
under this Agreement is unable to care for his or her affairs because of
illness or accident, or is a minor, any payment due (unless a prior claim
therefore shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian, committee or other
legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, a brother
or sister, or a custodian



                                       4
<PAGE>   5
determined pursuant to the Uniform Gift to Minors Act, or to any person deemed
by the Bank to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to
payment, in such manner and proportions as the Bank may determine. Any such
payment shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the Bank under this
Agreement.

ARTICLE 10. ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS

         None of the rights to compensation under this Agreement are assignable
by the Director or any Beneficiary or designee of the Director, and any attempt
to anticipate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, or change the
Director's right to receive compensation shall be void.

ARTICLE 11. NAMED FIDUCIARY

         (a) The Bank is hereby designated as the named fiduciary under this
Agreement. The named fiduciary shall have authority to control and manage the
operation and administration of this Agreement, and it shall be responsible 
for establishing and carrying out a funding policy and method consistent with
the objectives of this Agreement.

         (b) The Bank shall make all determinations as to rights to benefits
under this Agreement.  Any decision by the Bank denying a claim made by the
Director or by a Beneficiary for benefits under this Agreement shall be stated
in writing and delivered or mailed to the Director or such Beneficiary.  Such
statement shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial, written to the
best of the Bank's ability in a manner that may be understood without legal or
actuarial counsel.  In addition, the Bank shall afford a reasonable opportunity
to the Director or such Beneficiary for a full and fair review of the decision
denying such claim.

         (c) Subject to the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall
have full power and authority to interpret, construe and administer this
Agreement. No member of the Board of Directors of the Bank shall, in any event,
be liable



                                       5
<PAGE>   6
to any person for any action taken or omitted in connection with the
interpretation, construction or administration of this Agreement, so long as
such action or omission to act be made in good faith.  In no event, however,
shall the provisions of Article 12 or any other provisions in this Agreement
prevent the Director from seeking legal recourse for any claim he may have
under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12. FUNDING

         The Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be an unfunded and
unsecured promise to pay. The Bank shall not be obligated under any
circumstances to fund or otherwise secure its obligations under this Agreement.
Under no circumstances will the Bank, without the consent of the Director,
cause this Agreement to be directly funded in whole or part through escrow,
trust, or otherwise such as to create a pre-retirement or post-retirement
taxable event to the Director or the Director's Beneficiary.

ARTICLE 13. DIRECTOR RIGHTS

         The rights of the Director, any designated Beneficiary of the 
Director, or any other person claiming through the Director under this 
Agreement, shall be solely those of an unsecured general creditor of the Bank. 
The Director, a designated Beneficiary of the Director, or any other person 
claiming through the Director shall only have the right to receive from the 
Bank those payments as specified under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 14. ASSETS

         The Director, the Director's designated Beneficiary, or any other
person claiming through the Director shall have no rights or interests
whatsoever in any asset of the Bank in connection with the liabilities the Bank
has assumed under this Agreement, or otherwise.  Any asset used or acquired by
the Bank in connection with the liabilities it has assumed



                                       6
<PAGE>   7
under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be held in trust for the benefit of
the Director or the Director's designated Beneficiary, nor shall it be
considered security for the performance of the obligations of the Bank, and it
shall be, and remain, a general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the Bank.

ARTICLE 15. AMENDMENT

         During the lifetime of the Director and prior to retirement, this
Agreement may be amended or revoked at any time, in whole or part, by the 
mutual written agreement of the Bank and the Director.

ARTICLE 16. LAW GOVERNING

         This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of 
Mississippi.

ARTICLE 17. SEVERABILITY

         In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or portion
thereof, are held to be inoperative or invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then: (1) insofar as is reasonable, effect will be given to the
intent manifested in the provision held invalid or inoperative, and (2) the
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected
thereby.

ARTICLE 18. SUICIDE

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
benefits otherwise provided herein shall not be payable if the Director's death
results from suicide, whether sane or insane, within two years after the
execution of this Agreement.  If the Director dies during this two year period
due to suicide, the fees deferred will be paid to the Director's designated
Beneficiary in a single payment.  Payment is to be made within thirty days
after the Director's death is declared a suicide by competent legal authority.



                                       7
<PAGE>   8
Credit shall be given to the Bank for payments made prior to determination of
suicide.

ARTICLE 19. PERIOD OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

         If, in any year, payments made under this Agreement would, in the sole
judgment of the Board of Directors, create economic hardship for the Bank's
depositors, the Board of Directors has full authority to postpone such
payments.  However, upon such postponement, the Bank will increase the total
sum payable to the Director or the Director's Beneficiaries under this
Agreement by an actuarially determined amount.

ARTICLE 20. PRIOR AGREEMENTS

         This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and any previous
agreements or understandings between the parties hereto regarding the subject
matter hereof are merged into and superseded by this Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement, in
triplicate, the day and year written here below.

                    EXECUTIVE SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME AGREEMENT

                                (Pre-Retirement)



         THIS AGREEMENT is entered into this _____day of ______________1993, by
and between First National Bank (hereinafter called the "BANK"), party of the
first part, and _________________ (hereinafter called "EMPLOYEE"), party of the
second part.



                                  WITNESSETH:



         WHEREAS, Employee has been employed by the Bank in an executive
capacity and has discharged all duties in a capable and efficient manner
resulting in substantial profits to the Bank; and



         WHEREAS, the Bank desires to retain the services of Employee and
realizes that if the Employee were to enter into competition with the Bank it
may suffer financial loss; and



         WHEREAS, Employee is willing to remain in the employment of the Bank
if the Bank will agree to pay the Employee's spouse or designated
beneficiaries, certain annual amounts, all in accordance with the provisions
and conditions set forth hereinafter;



         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants
and agreements herein set forth, and for good and valuable consideration,
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and agree
as follows:
<PAGE>   4



                                                                          Page 2


         1.  The Bank agrees that, provided Employee shall die prior to
attaining age sixty-five (65), and provided further that such death occurs
while Employee is still in the active employment of the Bank, that commencing
with the first day of the month following the month in which Employee shall
die, it will pay Employee's spouse, if then living, the sum of Thirty-Nine
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($39,000.00) per annum for one (1) year, payable in
equal installments of Three Thousand Two Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars
($3,250.00) each for twelve (12) months immediately following the death of
Employee; and at the conclusion of the first twelve-month period following
Employee's death, the Bank will pay the sum of Twenty-Nine Thousand Two Hundred
Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($29,250.00) per annum for four (4) years payable in
equal installments of Two Thousand Four Hundred Thirty-Seven and 50/100 Dollars
($2,437.50) per month for forty eight (48) months; and at the conclusion of
this four-year period following Employee's death, the Bank will pay the sum of
Nineteen Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($19,500) per annum for ten
(10) years, payable in equal installments of One Thousand Six Hundred
Twenty-Five and 00/100 Dollars ($1,625.00) per month for one hundred twenty
(120) months subject to the conditions and limitations set out elsewhere in
this Agreement; payable upon the first business day of each month.  If said
spouse shall have predeceased Employee or should die during the one hundred
eighty (180) months following Employee's death, the balance of such payments
shall be made on the same monthly basis to the designated beneficiaries of
Employee living at Employee's death or the death of Employee's spouse,
whichever is later, share and share alike, until the Bank shall have made said
one hundred eighty (180) monthly payments.  If, at the date of death of the
Employee, no spouse or duly designated Beneficiary exists, or if the spouse or
designated beneficiary shall have died prior to the death of the Employee, or
if the Employee has revoked a prior designation by a writing filed with the
Bank without having filed a new designation, then any death benefits which
would have been payable to the Beneficiary shall be payable to the Employee's
surviving children, equally; of if none survive, then to the Employee's estate.

         2.  The Bank agrees that if Employee's spouse and designated
beneficiaries shall die before receiving the said one hundred eighty (180)
monthly payments, the balance of each payment shall be made to the Employee's
Estate until the Bank shall have made one hundred eighty (180) monthly
payments.

         3.  It is agreed that neither Employee nor spouse or designated
beneficiaries shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, or
otherwise convey the right to receive any payments hereunder which payments and
the right thereto are expressly declared to be nonassignable and
nontransferable, and any attempted assignment shall be void.

         4.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their
heirs, executors, administrators or the successors of any of the
aforementioned.

         5.  If Employee shall voluntarily terminate employment during
Employee's lifetime, or if employment shall be terminated by the Board of
Directors of the Bank during Employee's lifetime, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate and the Bank shall have no further obligation
hereunder.

         6.  During the lifetime of Employee, this Agreement may be amended or
revoked at any time in whole or in part by the Bank.

         7.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
benefit otherwise provided herein shall not be payable if the Employee's death
results from suicide, whether sane or insane within two years after the
execution of this Agreement.

         8.  The Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be an unfunded
and unsecured promise to pay.  The Bank shall not be obligated under any
circumstances to fund its obligations under this Agreement.  The Bank
may,however, at its sole and exclusive option, elect to informally fund this
Agreement in whole or in part.

         9.  This Agreement shall not be deemed to create a contract of
employment between the Bank and the Employee and shall create no right in the
Employee to continue in the Bank's employ for any specific period of time, or
to create any other rights in the Employee or obligations on the part of the
Bank, except as are set forth in this Agreement.  Nor shall this Agreement
restrict the right of the Bank to terminate the Employee or restrict the right
of the Employee to terminate his employment.

         10.  The rights of the Employee, any designated recipient of the
Employee, or any other person claiming through the Employee under this
Agreement, shall be solely those of an unsecured general creditor of the Bank.
The employee, the designated recipient of the Employee, or any other person
claiming through the Employee, shall only have the right to receive from the
Bank those payments as specified under this Agreement.

         11.  The Employee agrees that he, his designated recipient, or any
other person claiming through him shall have no rights or interests whatsoever
in any asset of the Bank.  Any asset used or acquired by the Bank in connection
with the liabilities it has assumed under this Agreement, except as expressly
provided, shall not be deemed to be held under any trust for the benefit of the

Employee or his recipients.  Nor shall it be considered security for the
performance of the obligations of the Bank.  It shall be, and remain, a
general, unpledged, and unrestricted asset of the Bank.

         12.  The Bank reserves the right to accelerate the payment of any
benefits payable under this Agreement without the consent of the Employee, the
Employee's spouse, estate, designated recipients, or any other person claiming
through the Employee.  In the event the Bank determines to accelerate these
payments, the present value of any future payments shall be paid to the
recipient.  The current federal reserve discount rate which is charged on loans
to the Bank shall be used in discounting any payments as determined by the
employer.

         13.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State or
Commonwealth wherein the Bank has its main office.

         14.  In the event that any of the provisions, or portion thereof, of
this Agreement are held to be inoperative or invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then (1) insofar as is reasonable, effect will be given to the
intent manifested in the provision held invalid or inoperative and (2) the
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected
thereby.

         15.  For purposes of this Agreement the Employee shall designate a
Beneficiary on forms furnished by the Bank.  (a copy of which is attached
hereto and labeled Exhibit A.)  Such Employee may then from time to time change
the designated Beneficiary by written notice to the Bank and upon such
change,the rights of all previously designated Beneficiaries to receive any
benefits under this Agreement shall cease.

         16.  If the Bank shall find that any person to whom any payment is
payable under this Agreement is unable to care for their affairs because of
illness or accident, or is a minor, any payment due (unless a prior claim
therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian, committee or other
legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, a brother
or sister or a custodian determined pursuant to the Uniform Gift to Minors Act,
or to any person deemed by the Bank to have incurred expense for such person
otherwise entitled to payment, in such manner and proportions as the Bank may
determine.  Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities
of the Bank under this Agreement.

which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all three
copies shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

                    Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Trustmark Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trustmark
Corporation (a Mississippi corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Trustmark Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1994, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for
securities.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The accounting and reporting policies of Trustmark Corporation and
subsidiaries (the Corporation) follow generally accepted accounting principles
and policies within the financial services industry.  The following is a
summary of the more significant accounting policies:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Trustmark
Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Building Corporation, F. S.
Corporation, Trustmark National Bank (the Bank) and the Bank's wholly-owned
subsidiary, Trustmark Financial Services, Inc.  In 1994, the Corporation
exchanged 137,514 shares of the Corporation's common stock for the minority
shareholders' interest in the Bank.  As discussed in Note 2, the financial data
of the Corporation as previously reported has been restated for a business
combination in 1994 using the pooling of interests method of accounting.  All
intercompany profits, balances and transactions have been eliminated.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," requires disclosure of financial
instruments' fair values, as well as the methodology and significant
assumptions used in estimating fair values.  These requirements have been
incorporated throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
estimates using present value techniques.  Those techniques are significantly
affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of
future cash flows.  In that regard, the derived fair value estimates for those
assets or liabilities cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of
the instrument.  All nonfinancial instruments, by definition, have been
excluded from these disclosure requirements.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair
value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the
Corporation and may not be indicative of amounts that might ultimately be
realized upon disposition or settlement of those assets and liabilities.

CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

     The carrying amounts for cash and due from banks and short-term
investments (federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse
repurchase agreements) approximate fair values because of the short maturities
of those financial instruments.

SECURITIES

     In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."
The Corporation adopted the provisions of the new standard for investments held
as of or acquired after January 1, 1994.  In adopting SFAS No. 115, securities
have been
<PAGE>   7
classified as either trading, available for sale or held to maturity.  In
accordance with the statement, prior period financial statements have not been
restated to reflect the change in accounting principle. Management determines
the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.

     Trading account securities are held for resale in anticipation of
short-term market movements.  Trading account securities, consisting primarily
of debt securities, are carried at fair value.  Gains and losses, both realized
and unrealized, are reported in other income.

     Securities available for sale are carried at fair value.  The unrealized
difference between amortized cost and fair value on securities available for
sale is excluded from earnings and is reported net of deferred taxes as a
component of stockholders' equity.  This caption includes debt and equity
securities that Management intends to use as part of its asset/liability
management strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest
rates, changes in prepayment needs, or for other purposes.  Prior to January 1,
1994, securities available for sale were stated at the lower of amortized cost
or fair value with any resulting adjustments reflected in the statement of
income.

     Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.  This caption
includes debt securities for which Management has the positive intent and the
Corporation has the ability to hold until maturity.

     Amortization of premium and accretion of discount are computed under the
interest method.  The adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used to
compute the realized gain or loss on the sale of securities.

     Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices where
available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

LOANS

     Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, reduced by unearned
income and an allowance for loan losses. Unearned income on instalment loans is
recognized as income over the terms of the loans by a method which approximates
the interest method.  Interest on other loans is calculated by using the simple
interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding. The
allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses
charged to expense. Loans  are charged against the allowance for loan losses
when Management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely.
The allowance, which is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans and
prior loan loss experience, is an amount that Management believes will be
adequate to absorb probable losses on loans existing at the reporting date. The
evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and
volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific
problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower's
ability to pay.

     Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when Management believes,
after considering economic and business conditions and
<PAGE>   8
collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that
collection of principal or interest is doubtful.

      The fair values of loans, as disclosed in Note 5, are estimated for
portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.  For variable-rate
loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk,
fair values are based on carrying values.  The fair values of certain mortgage
loans, such as one-to-four family residential properties, are based on quoted
market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization
transactions, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics.  The fair
values of other types of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

     In June 1993, FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan," which becomes effective for the Corporation beginning in
1995.  This statement defines the measurement requirements for loans that are
impaired or deemed to be troubled debt restructures.  Based upon the existing
loan portfolio, the effect of the implementation of this statement is not
expected to be material.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

     Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation
and amortization.  Depreciation is charged to expense over the estimated useful
lives of the assets.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of
the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements,
whichever is shorter.  Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed by
the straight-line and accelerated methods.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     Intangible assets, which consist of core deposits and purchased mortgage
servicing rights, are being amortized by the straight-line method over 10
years and 9 years, respectively.

OTHER REAL ESTATE

      Other real estate owned is reported in other assets and is recorded at
the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated cost of
disposition.  Any valuation adjustments required upon foreclosure are charged
to the allowance for loan losses.  Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the
periodic revaluation of the property are charged to current period earnings as
other real estate expenses.  Costs of operating and maintaining the properties,
net of related income and gains (losses) on their disposition, are charged to
other real estate expenses as incurred.

INCOME TAXES

     The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
effective January 1, 1993.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109 changed the
Corporation's method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to
the liability method.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 on the
Corporation's financial
<PAGE>   9
statements in 1993 was to increase net income $1,575,000 or 5 cents per share.

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Refer to Note 10 for
the detail of temporary differences which give rise to deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

DEPOSITS

     The fair values of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, NOW accounts, MMDA products and savings
accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand.  This
amount is commonly referred to as the carrying value.  Fair values for
certificates of deposit are based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows.  The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities. See Note 8 for a detail of carrying
values and fair values for all deposit liabilities.

SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES

     The carrying amounts for federal funds purchased, securities sold under
repurchase agreements and other liabilities approximate their fair values.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Corporation has a noncontributory pension plan covering substantially
all of its employees.  The funding policy for the plan is to make contributions
within the limits required by applicable regulations.  Employees of the
Corporation participate in a profit-sharing plan covering substantially all
employees with more than one year's service. Executive and qualified senior
officers participate in a supplemental executive incentive program.
Contributions to these plans are made at the discretion of the Corporation's
Board of Directors and are funded accordingly.  The Corporation has a trusteed,
contributory, self-insured medical benefit plan covering substantially all
employees who work at least 30 hours per week and have completed the required
waiting period.  Contributions to the plan are made as prescribed by the
trustees.  The Corporation has a deferred compensation plan for its directors
and certain executive and senior officers.

     In 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 106, "Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  The effect of implementing this
statement was immaterial.

PER SHARE DATA

     Per share data is based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during each period.  Per share data for all periods presented has
been restated for the effect of a business combination accounted for as a
pooling of interests in 1994.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

     For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash on hand and amounts due from banks.
<PAGE>   10
     The Corporation paid income taxes approximating $32,725,000 in 1994,
$32,124,000 in 1993, and $21,606,000 in 1992.  Interest paid on deposit
liabilities and other borrowings approximated $124,581,000 in 1994,
$119,355,000 in 1993, and $144,749,000 in 1992.

     For the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993, and 1992, noncash transfers
from loans to foreclosed properties were $1,490,000, $2,989,000,  and
$6,456,000, respectively.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1993 and 1992 financial
statements to conform to the 1994 method of presentation.

NOTE 2 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     On October 7, 1994, First National Financial Corporation (FNFC) and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Vicksburg, were merged with the
Corporation.  The stockholders of FNFC received 3,600,262 shares of the
Corporation's common stock in connection with the merger.  In addition, cash
payments of approximately $1,105,000 were made in connection with the merger.
All financial data of the Corporation has been restated to reflect the business
combination using the pooling of interests method of accounting.  There were no
material adjustments to the net assets of FNFC as a result of adopting the same
accounting practices as the Corporation.  The effect of the pooling of
interests on previously reported operations follows ($ in thousands):

     On January 1, 1994, in adopting SFAS No. 115, the Corporation transferred
securities with an amortized cost of approximately $629,000,000 from held to
maturity to available for sale.  There were no other transfers made between
classifications during 1994.

     Gross gains of $4,197,000 and gross losses of $5,594,000 were realized in
1994 as a result of calls and dispositions of securities classified as
available for sale.  During 1993 and 1992 gross gains and gross losses on
dispositions of securities carried at lower of aggregate cost or fair value
were not material.  At December 31, 1994, the net adjustment to unrealized
holding losses on available for sale securities included as a separate
component of stockholders' equity was $7,971,000.

     During 1994, there were no sales of securities held to maturity.  Gross
gains of $23,000 were realized on securities called prior to maturity.  Gross
gains of $623,000 and gross losses of $148,000 were realized in 1993 as the
result of calls and the disposition of securities held to maturity.  All sales
of securities held to maturity during 1993 were related to business
combinations.  Gross securities gains of $3,126,000 and gross securities losses
of $26,000 were realized during 1992.

     The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for
sale and held to maturity at December 31, 1994, by contractual maturity, are
shown below ($ in thousands).  Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations
with or without call or prepayment penalties.

    In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation makes loans to its
directors and to companies in which these directors are principal owners.  In
the opinion of Management, such loans are made on substantially the same terms,
including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with other parties.  An analysis of changes in these

     The Corporation has evaluated the need for a valuation allowance and,
based on the weight of the available evidence, has determined that it is more
likely than not that all deferred tax assets will eventually be realized.

     During 1994, the Corporation reached a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service regarding the deduction for amortization of core deposit
intangibles.  The effects of this settlement, which are not material, are
included in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 11 - LEASE COMMITMENTS

     The Corporation currently has lease commitments for banking premises and
general offices and equipment which expire from 1995 to 2008.  The majority of
these commitments contain renewal options which extend the base lease from 5 to
20 years.  Rental expense approximated $2,221,000 in 1994, $1,855,000 in 1993,
and $1,960,000 in 1992.

     Minimum rental commitments at December 31, 1994, under material,

NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

    The Corporation makes commitments to extend credit and issues standby and
commercial letters of credit in the normal course of business in order to
fulfill the financing needs of its customers.  The Corporation also engages in
forward contracts in order to manage its own exposure to the risks of interest
rate fluctuations.

     Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to customers
pursuant to certain specified conditions.  Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses.  Since many of these commitments
are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Corporation applies
the same credit policies and standards as it does in the lending process when
making these commitments.  The collateral obtained is based upon the assessed
creditworthiness of the borrower.

     Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments
issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party.  Essentially, the same policies regarding credit risk and collateral
which are followed in the lending process are used when issuing letters of
credit.

     Forward contracts are agreements to purchase or sell securities or other
money market instruments at a future specified date at a specified price or
yield.  Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values and interest
rates.  At December 31, 1994, obligations under forward contracts consist of
commitments to sell mortgages originated or purchased by the Corporation into
the secondary market at a future date.  These obligations are entered into by
the Corporation in order to fix the interest rate at which it can offer
mortgage loans to its customers or purchase mortgages from other financial
institutions.  Gains or losses on the sale of mortgages into the secondary
market (which
<PAGE>   20
have not been material) are recorded upon the sale of the mortgages.  Any
decline in market value of mortgages held by the Corporation at the end of a
financial reporting period pending sale into the secondary market is recognized
at that time.  As of December 31, 1994, the Corporation's exposure under
commitments to sell mortgages in the future is immaterial.

     The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party for loan commitments and letters of credit is
represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments.  However,
for forward contracts, the contractual or notional amounts do not represent the
Corporation's actual exposure to credit loss at December 31, 1994, as
represented below ($ in thousands):

        represent credit risk:

          Standby and commercial letters
            of credit written                                  35,304
     Financial instruments whose contractual or notional
        amounts exceed the amount of credit risk:
          Forward contracts                                    34,250
</TABLE>

     The fair values of loan commitments, letters of credit and forward
contracts approximate the fees currently charged for similar agreements or the
estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle similar obligations.  The fees
associated with these financial instruments or the estimated cost to terminate,
as applicable, are immaterial.

     In January 1995, a judgment was rendered in a Mississippi circuit court
against the Corporation's subsidiary, Trustmark National Bank, in a case
related to the placement of collateral protection insurance ("CPI") by the Bank
on a particular loan.  The judgment awarded $500 thousand in actual damages and
$38 million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs.  Several other suits
relating to CPI have been filed against the Bank and are pending at various
stages.  Management of the Corporation is vigorously pursuing the appeal of the
judgment mentioned above and the defense of the other pending suits.  While the
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, Management believes, based on
the advice of legal counsel, that the judgment referred to above will be
reversed or substantially reduced and that the impact of this matter, the other
CPI related suits or any additional claims related to CPI will not be material
to the results of operations or financial position of the Corporation.

     The Bank is involved in various other legal matters and claims which are 
being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business.  None of these 
other matters is expected, in the opinion of Management, to have a material 
adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the 
Corporation.

NOTE 13 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     As mentioned in Note 1, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," on January 1, 1994.  In
accordance with the statement, prior period financial statements have not been
restated to reflect the change in accounting principle.  As of January 1, 1994,
stockholders' equity was increased by $14,326,000 (net of $8,874,000 in
deferred income taxes) to reflect the net unrealized holding gains on
securities classified as available for sale.

     Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without
prior approval of the Bank's regulatory agency.  At December 31, 1994,
approximately $123,924,000 of undistributed earnings of the Bank included in
consolidated surplus and retained earnings was available for future
distribution to the Corporation as dividends, subject to approval by the Board
of Directors.  Banking regulations also require maintaining certain minimum
levels of capital for which the Bank is in compliance.

BUSINESS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

     Trustmark Corporation is a one-bank holding company which was incorporated
under the Mississippi Business Corporation Act on August 5, 1968.  On October
7, 1994, the Corporation became the sole owner of its major subsidiary,
Trustmark National Bank, when it exchanged 137,514 shares of the Corporation's
common stock for the minority shareholders' interest. Trustmark National Bank
now has 156 locations serving 44 Mississippi communities and offering a wide
range of financial services through 98 full-service branches and 27
limited-service branches.  In addition, the Bank's ATM network includes 68
automated teller machines at on-premise locations with 42 located at
off-premise sites.  Trustmark National Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary,
Trustmark Financial Services, Inc., provides a wide range of brokerage products
through a full-service investment center. The Corporation also directly owns
all of the stock of F.  S. Corporation and First Building Corporation, both
nonbank Mississippi corporations.  F. S. Corporation previously developed
automobile financing, including all incidental and related matters.  First
Building Corporation previously managed and operated its own real estate
investments.  Today, F. S. Corporation and First Building Corporation are
primarily dormant and are not considered significant subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this report.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

     On October 7, 1994, the Corporation was able to achieve its goal of
acquiring one financial institution annually by completing a merger with First
National Financial Corporation (FNFC) of Vicksburg, Mississippi and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Vicksburg (FNBV). At the date
of consummation, FNBV had achieved the largest deposit market share in the
Vicksburg area through its 10 locations.  The business combination was
accounted for as a pooling of interests; therefore, all financial data of the
Corporation as previously reported has been restated. At September 30, 1994,
FNFC reported total assets of $278 million, total deposits of $243 million,
total equity of $29 million and net income of $2.1 million.

     On July 31, 1993, UniSouth Banking Corporation (UniSouth), of Columbus,
Mississippi, was merged with Trustmark National Bank.  On August 7, 1992, the
Corporation purchased a substantial portion of the assets and substantially all
of the liabilities of the former Foxworth Bank from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Both of these business combinations have been accounted
for by the purchase method of accounting.  Accordingly, the financial
statements include the effect of these business combinations only since their
consummation. Please see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

EARNINGS SUMMARY

     Trustmark Corporation reported net income for the year ended December 31,
1994 of $55.0 million or $1.58 per share compared to $52.3 million or $1.55 per
share for 1993 and $40.8 million or $1.23 per share for 1992.  The Corporation
was able to achieve record earnings as a result of a substantially lower
provision for loan losses combined with modest growth in noninterest income and
continuing efforts to improve its operating efficiency.  It should also be
noted that net income for 1993 was positively impacted by the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," as of January 1, 1993.  The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle was to increase net income by $1.6 million or $.05 per
share.

     Two key measures of profitability in the banking industry are return on
average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE).  ROA rose to 1.15% in
1994 from 1.14% in 1993 and .97% in 1992.  ROE was 13.42% in 1994 versus 14.71%
in 1993 and 13.21% in 1992. ROE declined in 1994 because the pace of growth for
equity, which included for the entire year the effect of common stock issued in
the July 31, 1993 UniSouth merger, has exceeded the growth of earnings.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND LIQUIDITY

     A key objective of asset/liability management is to manage the
<PAGE>   27
Corporation's assets and liabilities to optimize and maintain the spread
between interest earned and interest paid while ensuring an adequate liquidity
position.  The Asset/Liability Committee monitors and adjusts the Corporation's
exposure to interest rates, within specific policy guidelines, based on its
view of current and expected market conditions. The primary tool utilized by
this committee is an asset/liability modeling system which is used to evaluate
exposure to interest rate risk and to project earnings and balance sheet
growth.  The Asset/Liability Committees of both senior bank officials and the
Board of Directors meet monthly to review Trustmark's interest rate risk
position.  Interest rate risk tolerances are defined by policy and, if
exceeded, are addressed and appropriate action taken to reduce any excess to an
acceptable level.  The Corporation's latest net interest income forecasts for
the six month, twelve month and second twelve month periods were within policy
guidelines.

     Another tool used to monitor the Corporation's overall interest rate
sensitivity is a gap analysis.  The table below represents the Corporation's 90
day and one year gap position as of December 31, 1994 ($ in thousands):


<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                       Interest Sensitive Within

Total rate sensitive liabilities        1,484,118      2,219,168 
                                       -----------    -----------
     Net gap                           $ (429,680)    $ (575,571)
                                       ===========    ===========
</TABLE>

     The analysis indicates that the Corporation is in a negative gap position
over the next three month and twelve month time horizons.  Management believes
that it has adequate flexibility to alter the overall rate sensitivity
structure as necessary to minimize exposure to changes in interest rates.
During the course of 1994, the Corporation's negative gap position has
decreased in response to rising interest rates and uncertain market conditions.

     The Corporation's goal is to maintain an adequate liquidity position to
compensate for expected and unexpected balance sheet fluctuations and to
provide funds for growth.  This is achieved by maintaining a stable base of
core deposits, accessibility to local, regional and national funding sources,
readily marketable assets and diversity in customers, products and market
areas. The ability to maintain liquidity is also enhanced by consistent
earnings power and adequate capital.  The Asset/Liability Committee establishes
guidelines which monitor the current liquidity position and ensure adequate
funding capacity.

EARNING ASSETS

     During 1994, the banking industry rode the wave of success for the third
straight year.  However, certain events of this past year left many wondering
exactly what 1995 will bring. Rising interest rates during 1994 began to dampen
the desire for mortgage loans which had enjoyed unprecedented demand during the
past three years and also pushed down prices on bonds which has decreased the
fair
<PAGE>   28
value of some banks' portfolios.  On the other hand, the Federal Reserve's
effort to corral inflation by pushing up interest rates has had a minimal
impact in slowing the economy outside of the housing market.  Some predictions
show that business spending will help boost the economy for some time even as
higher interest rates begin to take their toll on consumer spending. The
general consensus of the banking industry is that given the varied predictions
for the economy and the interest rate environment, 1995 will be a difficult
year.

     The Mississippi economy continued to show signs of growth and recovery
during 1994.  The November 7, 1994 issue of U. S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT rated
Mississippi as having the eighth best overall economic health since the
recovery began in 1991.  This comes after 1993's ranking as number one in the
nation in economic growth.  Six variables were used in the 1994 ranking to
determine overall economic growth:  employment growth (ranked 8th in the United
States), income growth (4th), new business growth (8th), building permit growth
(4th), home price growth (6th) and retail sales growth (41st). Among
Mississippi's neighboring states, Georgia's overall economic health ranked
12th, Tennessee - 16th, North Carolina - 18th, Louisiana - 19th, Arkansas -
20th and Alabama - 21st. The success of the Mississippi economy is predicted to
continue as the latest index of leading economic indicators rose for the second
consecutive month and the fourth time in the last six months.

     The Corporation has been able to take advantage of the improved economic
atmosphere in Mississippi by improving its mix of earning assets.  At December
31, 1994, earning assets were $4.317 billion compared to $4.309 billion at
December 31, 1993.  The combined increase from loans, federal funds sold and
securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements more than offset the
decline in securities experienced during 1994.

     Total loans increased by $116.5 million or 5.22% during 1994.
Mississippi's switch from an agricultural-based economy to a more
manufacturing-based economy has provided an increased demand for business
lending.  This conversion plus an increased marketing effort by the Corporation
are the primary factors for the $63.8 million increase in commercial and
industrial loans during 1994.  The Corporation's commercial loan portfolio is
very diverse, without a significant concentration of credit in any one
particular industry segment, thus allowing for risk diversification in the
portfolio.

     Consumer loans have grown by $76.5 million during 1994 primarily in the
area of automobile loans. Trustmark remains one of the market leaders in the
indirect lending business with plans to continue to grow through the expansion
of its coverage and consistent service in current market areas.

     The most substantial decrease in the loan portfolio during 1994 was seen
in real estate loans, which declined by $28.9 million.  This decline can be
traced to two major factors.  First, rapidly rising interest rates on real
estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties slowed the
volume of both new and refinanced mortgages.  Second, the Corporation continued
to be committed to the growth of its mortgage servicing portfolio. The
<PAGE>   29
Corporation intends to package and sell substantially all qualified one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans that the Corporation has originated or
purchased while retaining the right to service these mortgages.  At December
31, 1994, the Corporation's volume of residential mortgage loan servicing was
approximately $2.09 billion compared to $1.68 billion at the end of 1993.  This
24.5% increase can be attributed to the strong growth of loans purchased in the
correspondent market and the utilization of loans originated within the
Corporation.

     The decline in residential mortgage loans was somewhat offset by growth
from residential construction and development loans.  The Corporation will
continue to strengthen its lending relationships with builders and developers
as an enhancement to the growth in residential mortgage loans. Please see Note
5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the
Corporation's loan portfolio.

     The Corporation's emphasis on credit quality has produced a healthy loan
portfolio and a conservative approach to providing for potential loan losses.
This emphasis on credit quality can be seen in the Corporation's commitment to
the continued refinement of credit administration systems designed to monitor
overall policy compliance and the adequacy of supporting financial and
collateral documentation.  As a result of this commitment, it is anticipated
that the Corporation's ability to identify and address actual and potential
credit problems will be further strengthened.

     The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which Management
and the Board of Directors believe is adequate to absorb estimated losses
inherent in the loan portfolio, plus estimated losses associated with
off-balance sheet credit instruments such as letters of credit. The adequacy of
the allowance is reviewed on a quarterly basis by using the criteria specified
in revised Comptroller of the Currency Banking Circular 201 as well as
additional guidance provided by regulatory authorities.  Specifically, the
analysis is based on a consideration of the following factors: estimated future
loss in significant and criticized loans, known deterioration in concentrations
of credit, classes of loans or pledged collateral, historical loss experience
based on volume and types of loans, results of independent review  of the loan
portfolio, trends in portfolio volume, maturity and composition, off- balance
sheet risk, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, consideration
of current economic conditions and downturns in specific local industries,
lending policies and procedures and experience, ability and depth of lending
management and staff.  This analysis is presented to the Credit Policy
Committee with subsequent review and approval by the Board of Directors.

     The current level of the allowance for loan losses approximates 2.77% of
total loans outstanding and provides the Corporation with an adequate reserve
coverage of nonperforming loans.  Because of the imprecision and subjectivity
inherent in most estimates of expected credit losses, Management will continue
to take a prudent, yet conservative approach in the evaluation of the allowance
for loan losses.  Please see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for an analysis of the changes in
<PAGE>   30
the allowance for loan losses.

     Net charge-offs totaled $2.79 million in 1994, which resulted in an
annualized net charge-off ratio of .12%. This compares to $5.78 million in net
charge-offs, or a net charge-off ratio of .27%, realized in 1993.  The current
level of net charge-offs for the Corporation remains below that of its peer
group.

     A measure of asset quality in the financial institutions industry is the
level of nonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming
loans, consisting of nonaccrual and restructured loans, and other real estate.

     Asset quality of the Corporation is considered to be very good.  The
overall volume of classified assets, which is comprised of classified loans and
other real estate owned, remains at approximately the same level reported at
December 31, 1993 and is favorable.  As the table above illustrates, overall
nonperforming assets and past due loans remain well-controlled and continue to
compare favorably to peer levels.  As of December 31, 1994, the Corporation
knows of no additional loans, other than those identified above, that
Management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to repay
principal and interest.

     The securities portfolio is utilized to provide a quality investment
alternative for available funds and to provide a stable source of interest
income.  At the end of 1994, total securities were $1.86 billion, a decline of
$118.2 million or 6.0% from the end of 1993.  This decline is partially
attributable to the Corporation's decision to utilize this liquidity to reduce
its overnight borrowing position and to provide funds for loan growth.
Securities backed by the U. S. Government and its agencies comprise over 85% of
the total portfolio.  For more information on the composition of the securities
portfolio, please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     On January 1, 1994, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." Under this accounting
standard, debt securities that the Corporation has the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at
amortized cost.  Debt and equity securities which are not classified as held to
maturity or as trading securities are classified as available for sale and
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity, net of income taxes.  At the date of
adoption, the Corporation transferred
<PAGE>   31
securities of approximately $629 million from held to maturity to available for
sale.  There were no other transfers made between classifications during 1994.

     Within the securities portfolio, the available for sale portfolio has been
reduced since the end of the first quarter of 1994 due to instability in the
bond market resulting from the current rising interest rate environment.
Reinvestment activity was primarily in securities held to maturity having
higher yields, with the balance going to reduce the Corporation's overnight
borrowing position. The latest comparisons of the tax equivalent yield of the
securities portfolio show the Corporation remaining in the upper quartile when
compared to its peer group.  This has been accomplished while maintaining the
quality of the portfolio.

     At December 31, 1994, the amortized cost and fair value of securities
classified as available for sale were $452.6 million and $439.7 million,
respectively.  This resulted in an unrecognized loss, net of tax, of
approximately $7.97 million as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

     During 1994, the Corporation decreased the size of its short-term
portfolio as it sought funds for loan growth and the reduction of its overnight
borrowing needs.  Products included in the short-term portfolio are primarily
U. S. Government agency securities classified as available for sale and reverse
repurchase agreements.  As necessary, this portfolio is utilized as an
alternative to the overnight funds market and has contributed an additional
$721 thousand in interest income when compared to investments in the overnight
funds market. The short-term portfolio will continue to play a vital role in
maintaining the Corporation's liquidity and profitability.

     In 1994, realized gains were $4.197 million on securities available for
sale while realized losses totaled $5.594 million, resulting in net securities
losses of $1.397 million. Gross unrealized gains approximated $3.9 million
while gross unrealized losses approximated $16.8 million on these securities.

     During 1994, there were no sales of securities held to maturity.  Gross
gains of $23 thousand were realized on securities called prior to their
maturity. Gross unrealized gains approximated $5.3 million and gross unrealized
losses approximated $82.3 million on securities classified as held to maturity
at December 31, 1994.

     Federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase
agreements increased by $10.5 million when compared to the end of 1993. Market
conditions and liquidity needs are the driving forces behind the utilization of
federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements
as short-term investment products.  Trading account securities continue to
represent an immaterial portion of the balance sheet.

DEPOSITS AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES

     Deposits are the primary source of funding for the Corporation's earning
assets.  Trustmark offers a variety of products designed to attract and retain
customers with the primary focus on core deposits.

     Total deposits at December 31, 1994 increased by $20.4 million when
compared to December 31, 1993. Interest-bearing deposits
<PAGE>   32
decreased by $3.4 million while noninterest-bearing deposits increased $23.8
million during that time period.  Although interest-bearing deposits decreased
only slightly during 1994, the mix changed significantly.  With rates rising
throughout the year, customers began to shift from shorter-term savings
instruments, primarily money market deposit accounts, to longer-term
certificates of deposit.  As the rates on other money market products began to
rise, the Corporation successfully offered a certificate of deposit product
with a step-up feature that allowed it to retain its core deposit customers. In
1995, Management's strategy will be to increase core deposits and to reduce the
Corporation's dependence on short-term borrowings, principally federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.  The composition of
total deposits is presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Federal funds purchased increased $80.8 million when compared to December
31, 1993.  This can be traced to an increase in funds purchased from
correspondent banks. With current market conditions uncertain, the Corporation
plans to reduce its position in federal funds purchased with excess funds from
maturing securities.

     Securities sold under repurchase agreements fell by $72.5 million during
1994.  With interest rates on the rise, some customers who had purchased
securities sold under repurchase agreements have sought alternative products
that would provide additional yield.  However, this remains a very popular
alternative to traditional deposit products.  More information on securities
sold under repurchase agreements is presented in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     The Corporation has always placed a great emphasis on maintaining a strong
capital base. The Corporation's Management and Board of Directors continually
review factors which could have an unfavorable impact on the level of
stockholders' equity. It is the Corporation's goal to maintain its position as
a "well capitalized" financial institution by expanding its capital base
through continued profitability, business combinations and possibly the sale of
stock. Based on the capital levels defined by banking regulators, a "well
capitalized" institution is one that has at least a 10% total risk-based
capital ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 5% Tier 1 leverage
ratio. The Corporation's solid capital base is reflected in its regulatory
capital ratios.  The table below illustrates these ratios at December 31, 1994
($ in thousands):

</TABLE>

     As shown in the table above, the Corporation's capital ratios surpass the
minimum requirements of 4% for the Tier 1 capital ratio and 8% for the total
risk-based capital ratio.  The Tier 1 leverage ratio generally must exceed 3%
and is driven by evaluation and discretion of the regulators.

     At December 31, 1994, the Corporation had stockholders' equity of $421.0
million which contained a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale,
net of taxes, of $7.97 million. This compares to total stockholders' equity of
$387.6 million at the end of 1993 and $323.2 million at the end of 1992.
During 1994, 3,737,776 shares of common stock were issued in connection with
business combinations.  These additional shares bring the total outstanding at
December 31, 1994 to 34,910,683.  In addition, the Corporation's adoption of
SFAS No. 115 on January 1, 1994 resulted in an increase to stockholders' equity
of $14.326 million to reflect the unrealized holding gains on securities
classified as available for sale, net of deferred taxes.

     Based on its dividend payout ratio of 26.0%, the Corporation retained
74.0% of its earnings for 1994, generating an internal capital growth rate of
9.9%. Dividends for the fourth quarter of 1994 were raised to $.1075 per share
resulting in an annual dividend rate of $.43 per share. Book value for the
Corporation's common stock was $12.06 at December 31, 1994 compared to the
closing market price of $17.50.

NET INTEREST INCOME

     Net interest income is an effective measurement of how well Management has
managed the Corporation's interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
During 1994, the Corporation's level of net interest income dropped by 1.38% or
$2.7 million when compared to 1993 essentially due to its cost of funding
increasing at a somewhat faster pace than its yield on earning assets.

     When compared to 1993, average earning assets rose 4.1% during 1994.
During the same time period, the yield on average earning assets declined by 20
basis points.  This combination resulted in interest income generated by
earning assets increasing $4.8 million or 1.6% during 1994. The primary
contributor to this gain came from interest and fees on loans, which increased
7.1% during 1994 as a result of multiple increases in the prime rate combined
with growth in average loans.  This more than offset declines in interest
earned on securities, which experienced reduced yields resulting from a lower
interest rate environment for reinvestment activity.       

     Average interest-bearing liabilities rose 2.1% in 1994, with
<PAGE>   34
the rate paid increasing by 14 basis points when compared to 1993.  As a
result, interest expense generated by interest-bearing liabilities increased by
$7.5 million or 6.44% when compared to 1993.  An increase in both the average
balance and rate paid on federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements more than offset a decline in the average balances of
interest-bearing deposits combined with an increased rate paid.

     The table below illustrates the changes in net interest margin as a
percentage of average earning assets for the year ended:

</TABLE>


The fully taxable equivalent (FTE) yield on tax exempt income has been computed
based on a 35% federal marginal tax rate for both 1994 and 1993. While the
Corporation did experience a decline in the net interest margin during 1994, it
was able to maintain a stable level of net interest income in the face of an
uncertain interest rate environment and unstable market conditions.   The
Corporation will continue to take the necessary precautions in order to
minimize exposure to changes in interest rates.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

     Earnings for 1994 were positively impacted by the substantial reduction in
the Corporation's provision for loan losses when compared to 1993 and 1992.
The provision for loan losses was $2.8 million in 1994 compared to $18.6
million in 1993 and $26.7 million in 1992 and covered net charge-offs on a
dollar for dollar basis thus bringing the allowance for loan losses at December
31, 1994 back to its December 31, 1993 level. Management will continue to take
a prudent, yet conservative approach in the evaluation of the allowance for
loan losses.

NONINTEREST INCOME

     The Corporation stresses the importance of growth in noninterest income as
one of its key long-term strategies.  Noninterest income for 1994, excluding
securities losses, increased $2.6 million or 5.6% when compared to 1993 and
$7.6 million or 17.8% when compared to 1992.

     Trust service income increased by 6.6% in 1994 as Trustmark continued to
be one of the largest bank providers of asset management services in
Mississippi, with over $4.1 billion in assets under administration.

     During 1994, other account charges, fees and commissions became the
largest component of noninterest income.  The two major contributors to the
20.1% increase in this category were fees generated from residential mortgage
servicing and ATM usage.
<PAGE>   35
Management's commitment to the continued growth of the mortgage servicing
portfolio was evidenced by the $2.2 million or 35.6% increase in fees collected
from servicing mortgages during 1994. The Corporation's commitment to customer
service is reflected in the growth of ATMs experienced during 1994. The
Trustmark Express ATM System added an average of two automated teller machines
per month during the year, bringing the total in service to 110.  As a result,
fees resulting from ATM usage grew significantly during 1994.

     Year-to-date service charges have remained at essentially the same level
as 1993 as the Corporation continued to experience marginal deposit growth.
The primary reason for the 39.7% decline in other income during 1994 was a
reduction in gains on mortgage loans sold.  Rising interest rates combined with
a reduction in refinancing volume contributed to this decline.

     The Corporation recorded securities losses during 1994 as securities
acquired from the FNFC merger were sold in order to maintain the Corporation's
current investment management policies and practices.  In addition, in response
to rising interest rates and uncertain market conditions, the Corporation sold
a portion of its securities available for sale in order to reposition itself
for the future.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

     Another long-term strategy of the Corporation is to continue to provide
quality service to its customers within the context of economic discipline.
The utilization of the newest technological advances in the financial services
industry has allowed the Corporation to provide enhanced customer service while
improving its efficiency. The Corporation's commitment to lowering its cost
position is demonstrated by its efficiency ratios which remain substantially
below that of its peer group.  Noninterest expense for 1994 increased $2.0
million or 1.3% when compared to 1993.  This nominal increase is especially
noteworthy considering that expenses from both the Columbus and Tupelo
branches, which were acquired during the UniSouth acquisition, have been
included for the entire year of 1994 while expenses for 1993 were included only
from the acquisition date of July 31, 1993.

     Salaries and employee benefits continue to comprise the largest portion of
other expenses and have increased 4.7% during 1994.  This increase can be
primarily attributed to the additional salary expense incurred during 1994 from
the UniSouth acquisition and annual salary increases.  The number of full-time
equivalent employees totaled 2,214 at December 31, 1994 compared to 2,230 at
December 31, 1993.  This decrease points out the Corporation's commitment to
improving its operational efficiencies through the continued evaluation of its
staff levels. Personnel expense for the Corporation remains well below that of
its peer group.

     Renovations to facilities purchased and leased in business combinations as
well as the general maintenance of existing facilities have contributed to the
5.2% increase in net occupancy expenses during 1994. Equipment expenses have
increased by 7.7% as the Corporation strengthens its retail delivery and
support systems through the purchase and implementation of the latest
technology.
<PAGE>   36
These investments will reduce back-office costs and enhance customer service
and sales effectiveness.

     Market write-downs on other real estate decreased by 65.7% in 1994 due to
substantial improvement in asset quality.  The Corporation's volume of other
real estate compares very favorably to that of its peer group.  FDIC insurance
expense remained at essentially the same level as that of the prior year.

     The amortization of intangible assets decreased 16.4% during 1994.
Increased prepayments of mortgages serviced resulted in the accelerated
amortization of mortgage servicing rights during 1993 which has more than
offset the amortization of intangible assets associated with the UniSouth
acquisition that began during the third quarter of 1993.  In addition, the
amortization of intangible assets associated with a business combination in
1983 was completed during the fourth quarter of 1993.

     Services and fees expense increased by 10.5% during 1994 due to increased
expenses for communications and advertising. Other expenses decreased 3.2%
during 1994 primarily due to declines in operational losses and the 1993
accrual of interest on the projected settlement of the core deposit case with
the Internal Revenue Service.

INCOME TAXES

     In 1994, the Corporation's effective tax rate was 34.7% compared to 29.9%
in 1993 and 30.0% in 1992.  The effective tax rate for 1994 was higher than
1993 and 1992 as the result of three factors.  First, tax exempt income as a
percentage of total income declined during 1994.  Second, the Corporation had
several nonrecurring favorable permanent differences in 1993.  And finally,
differences arising from the nondeductible core deposit amortization related to
a business combination consummated in July of 1993 and the reduction in
deductible amortization related to the 1994 settlement of the core deposit
amortization issue with the Internal Revenue Service caused the effective tax
rate to rise in 1994.

     The Corporation adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," as of
January 1, 1993.  SFAS No. 109 required an asset and liability approach to
accounting for the effect of income taxes that result from a company's
activities during the current and preceding years.  The cumulative effect of
this change in accounting principle was to increase net income by $1.6 million
or $.05 per share.

OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended by SFAS No. 118,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and
Disclosures."  The statement addresses how creditors should establish
allowances for credit losses on individual loans determined to be impaired.
This standard offers a definition of impairment and how the amount of
impairment is measured. SFAS No. 114 applies to financial statements for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1994.  Management expects the implementation
of this statement to be immaterial.
<PAGE>   37
     During 1994, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 119, "Disclosure about
Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments."
This statement requires new disclosures about why a company uses derivative
financial instruments (such as futures, forwards, swaps and options) and what
strategies underlie their use.  At December 31, 1994, obligations under forward
contracts consist of commitments to sell mortgages originated or purchased by
the Corporation into the secondary market at a future date.  These obligations
are entered into by the Corporation in order to fix the interest rate at which
it can offer mortgage loans to its customers or purchase mortgages from other
financial institutions.  As of December 31, 1994, the Corporation's exposure
under commitments to sell mortgages in the future is immaterial.

     Prior to its merger with the Corporation, First National Financial
Corporation's subsidiary, First National Bank of Vicksburg (FNBV) entered into
an agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the United
States Department of Justice settling allegations that FNBV had discriminated
against certain minority borrowers.  This agreement required FNBV to establish
a $750,000 fund to compensate certain borrowers and to reimburse $50,000 in
costs incurred by regulators during its investigation that was completed in
1993.  At December 31, 1994, the Corporation believes it has complied with all
provisions of the agreement. As successor to FNBV, the Corporation will ensure
that future conformity with the agreement is honored.
