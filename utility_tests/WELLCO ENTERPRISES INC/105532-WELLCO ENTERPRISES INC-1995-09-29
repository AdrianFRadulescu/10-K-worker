                                     PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Company operates in one industry  segment.  Substantially  all the Company's
revenues  are derived  from the sale of  military  footwear  and related  items,
whether sold by the Company or its  licensees.  The majority of revenues (66% in
1995,  74% in 1994)  were  from  sales to the U. S.  government,  primarily  the
Defense Logistics Agency.

For more  than the last  five  years,  the  Company  has  manufactured  and sold
military  combat boots under firm fixed price  contracts  with the United States
government.  Boot  products  are the general  issue  all-leather  boot,  the hot
weather  boot  and the  desert  boot,  all  manufactured  using  the  government
specified  Direct Molded Sole process.  The  government  awards fixed price boot
contracts on the basis of bids from several qualified manufacturers.

The Company also  provides,  primarily  under  long-term  licensing  agreements,
technology,  assistance  and related  services  for  manufacturing  military and
commercial  footwear to customers in the United  States and abroad.  Under these
agreements  licensees  receive  technology,  services  and  assistance,  and the
Company earns fees based primarily on the licensees'  sales volume.  In addition
to providing technical assistance, the Company also helps supply certain foreign
military footwear manufacturers with some of their machinery and material needs.
The Company builds specialized footwear  manufacturing  equipment for use in its
own and its customers' manufacturing  operations.  This equipment is either sold
or leased.

During the 1995 fiscal year, pairs of combat boots sold were  approximately  20%
less than the 1994 fiscal year. Except for Operation Desert Storm,  which caused
pairs of  combat  boots  sold to the U. S.  government  in  fiscal  year 1991 to
increase significantly,  the government has for the last few years been reducing
its  inventory of combat  boots by  purchasing  fewer pairs than were  consumed.
During 1995, the government accomplished this by extending the delivery schedule
for the second year of a multi-year contract from twelve to sixteen months.

On August 6, 1993, Wellco was awarded an indefinite quantity multi-year contract
from the U. S.  government for between 277,000 and 416,000 pairs of combat boots
to be shipped  during a one year period  starting  October,  1993.  Against this
first year  quantity,  the  government  placed  orders for its minimum  required
quantity of 277,000  pairs.  This contract  contains two options under which the
government  can exercise its right to buy between  277,000 and 416,000 pairs for
each option.

The government had initially  planned to require  delivery on each option over a
one year period,  as was the case with the base year 277,000  pairs.  In August,
1994 the  government  exercised its first option for the 277,000  minimum pairs.
However,  actual  consumption  of combat  boots  during  the first  year of this
contract has been less than anticipated,  resulting in the government  extending
deliveries of this  option's  277,000  pairs over sixteen  months,  or one-third
longer than the first year's delivery.

On August 2, 1995,  the  government  exercised  its second and last option under
this contract,  again for the minimum  277,000 pairs. On September 26, 1995, the
Company agreed to a government request for a contract modification which reduced
the minimum  second option pairs to 30,000.  The Company  understands  that this
request was caused by the government's  over-obligation  of funds for its fiscal
year ending  September 30, 1995, and they were correcting this by reducing their
obligation  on items for which  delivery  orders  had not yet been  placed.  The
Company agreed to this modification  because the government could have otherwise
exercised its right to  unilaterally  cancel the contract for the convenience of
the government.  This contract  modification  allows the Company to make a claim
against  the  government  for the lost  contribution  to  overhead,  general and
administrative  costs and profit caused by any reduction in the original 277,000
pairs and/or any delay in production.

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

The  government  has  indicated  that  their  intent is to  purchase  all of the
original  277,000  pairs,  but they will have to wait for their fiscal year 1996
funding appropriation before increasing the 30,000 pair committment. The Company
presently believes that this will result in a reduced production  schedule of no
more than a few weeks,  but if there is a  significant  delay in ordering  boots
and/or if the government orders  significantly  less than their original 277,000
pair  commitment,  the  operating  results  of the  Company  could be  adversely
affected. The Company intends to file a claim for any lost overhead, general and
administrative  costs and  profit,  but any such claim would be subject to final
verification and audit by the government.  The Company believes that any adverse
effect would only be significant  starting it its third fiscal quarter beginning
December 31, 1995.

Somewhat  offsetting  the effect of reduced combat boot shipments in 1995 was an
increase in machinery  and  material  sales to  licensees,  including a military
combat boot factory in El Salvador, one new licensee and one long-term licensee.
These  sales  can vary  significantly  from year to year with the needs of these
customers.
                                     
During  1994,  the  Company  was  awarded  an  option  under an  existing  U. S.
government research and development  contract for further work on improvement to
the hot weather  combat boot.  This work was completed in 1995 and  improvements
developed  under this contract have now been  incorporated  into the hot weather
combat  boot.  In August,  1995,  the  Company  was  awarded a U. S.  Government
research and  development  "cost plus fixed fee" contract with a total estimated
value of $1,184,000. The objective of this contract is to develop changes to the
combat  boot  that will  result in fewer  lower  extremity  disorders.  Work has
started on this contract and could extend over three years.

This type of research and  development  work is vital to assuring that the U. S.
armed forces have the most serviceable combat boots available.  Development work
of this type, done by the Company in a very short period of time in 1991, led to
the desert boot which was first used in Operation Desert Storm.

In 1995,  Wellco,  along  with two other  manufacturers  of  military  clothing,
jointly bid on a trial contract to procure,  warehouse and distribute all of the
standard  clothing  items to Air Force  recruits at  Lackland  Air Force Base in
Texas for one year,  with two options for one year each. The government has been
evaluating bids for many months, with the projected contract award date being no
later than October 24, 1995.

Bidding on contracts is open to any qualified U. S. manufacturer. In addition to
meeting very stringent manufacturing and quality specifications, contractors are
required to comply with precise delivery schedules and a significant  investment
in specialized equipment is required.

The  August,  1993 combat  boot  contract  was the first one awarded the Company
under the U. S.  government's  "best  value"  system,  under  which  contractors
offering the best value to the  government  receive the largest  awards.  Wellco
anticipates  that  during  the  latter  half of the 1996  fiscal  year the U. S.
Government will start the solicitation  process on its next multi-year contract.
Until then,  Wellco is continuing  to improve its quality and on-time  delivery,
two very important factors in the best value system.

The Company  usually  competes on U. S.  government  contracts  with three other
companies,  no one of which  dominates  the  industry.  Many factors  affect the
government's  demand for combat boots and the quantity  purchased  can vary from
year to year. Wellco  anticipates that the government will continue buying fewer
pairs of combat  boots  than  consumption  for the next few  years.  Contractors
cannot  influence  the  government's  combat  boot  needs.  Price,  quality  and
manufacturing efficiency are the areas emphasized by the Company that strengthen
its competitive position.

Government  contracts are subject to partial or complete  termination  under the
following circumstances:

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

         (1)      Convenience of the Government.  The  government's  contracting
                  officer has the authority to partially or completely terminate
                  a contract for the  convenience of the government only when it
                  is in the government's interest to terminate.  The contracting
                  officer is responsible  for  negotiating a settlement with the
                  contractor.

         (2)      Default  of  the  Contractor.   The  government's  contracting
                  officer has the authority to partially or completely terminate
                  a contract because of the  contractor's  actual or anticipated
                  failure to perform his contractual obligations.

Under certain circumstances occasioned by the egregious conduct of a contractor,
contracts may be  terminated  and a contractor  may be prohibited  for a certain
period of time from receiving government contracts.  The Company has never had a
contract either partially or completely terminated.

Because domestic  commercial  footwear  manufacturers are adversely  affected by
imports  from low labor cost  countries,  the Company  targets its  marketing of
technology  and assistance  primarily to military  footwear  manufacturers.  The
Company  competes against several other footwear  construction  methods commonly
used for  heavy-duty  footwear with leather  uppers.  These methods  include the
Goodyear  Welt  construction,  as well as boots  bottomed by injection  molding.
These  methods  are  used  in  work  shoes,   safety  shoes,  and  hiking  boots
manufactured  both in the U.  S.  and  abroad  for the  commercial  market.  The
Goodyear Welt method is also used for certain types of military boots,  although
not for the  models  manufactured  by the  Company  which  are made  only in the
government  specified  Direct  Molded Sole  construction.  Quality,  service and
reasonable  manufacturing  costs are the most important  features used to market
the Company's technology, assistance and services.

The  Company  has a strong  research  and  development  program.  While  not all
research and  development  results in  successful  new  products or  significant
revenues,  the continuing development of new products and processes has been and
will continue to be a significant factor in growth and development.  The Company
developed the desert combat boot, first used in Operation Desert Storm. In 1993,
the Company  completed  initial  development  of  improvements  to the black hot
weather boot  incorporating  many of the  features it  developed  for the desert
boot.  In  1994 it was  awarded  an  option  under  that  contract  for  further
development.  In August,  1995 it was awarded a contract  to develop  changes to
combat boots that will result in fewer lower extremity disorders.

 Although not precisely  quantified,  the Company spends a significant amount of
time and  effort on both  Company  and  customer-sponsored  research  activities
related to the  development of new products and processes and to the improvement
of existing ones. A significant  amount of this cost is for the personnel  costs
of  mold  engineers,   rubber  technicians,   chemists,  pattern  engineers  and
management,  all of whom have many  responsibilities in addition to research and
development. The Company estimates that the cost of research and development can
vary from  $50,000 to  $300,000  per year,  depending  on the number of research
projects and the specific needs of its customers.

See Note 14 to the consolidated  financial  statements in Item 8 for revenues by
class and information  about export revenues.  The Company does not have foreign
operations.

The Company's backlog of all sales, not including  license fees and rentals,  as
of September,  1995 was approximately  $18,100,000  compared to $17,200,000 last
year.  Of the current year backlog,  the Company  estimates  that  approximately
$10,400,000 will be shipped in the 1996 fiscal year.

Most of the raw materials  used by the Company can be obtained from at least two
sources and are readily  available.  Because all  materials in combat boots must
meet rigid government  specifications and because quality is the first priority,
the Company  purchases  most of its raw  materials  from vendors who provide the
best  materials at a reasonable  cost. The loss of some vendors would cause some
difficulty  for  the  entire  industry,  but the  Company  believes  a  suitable
replacement  could be found in a  reasonably  short  period  of time.  Major raw
materials include leathers, fabrics and rubber, and by government regulation all
are from manufacturers in the United States.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Compliance with various existing governmental  provisions relating to protection
of the  environment  has not had a  material  effect  on the  Company's  capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.


The Company employed an average of 267 persons during the 1995 year.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company has manufacturing, warehousing and office facilities in Waynesville,
North  Carolina  and  Aguadilla,  Puerto  Rico.  The  building and land in North
Carolina is owned by the Company. The Puerto Rico building and land are leased.
                                  
Management believes all its plants, warehouses and offices are in good condition
and are  reasonably  suited for the purposes for which they are presently  used.
The volume of  operations  in 1995 caused  both the  Waynesville  and  Aguadilla
facilities to be used at less than normal capacity.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

There are no material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine
litigation  incidental to the Company's business, to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is subject.

Management does not know of any director, officer, affiliate of the Company, nor
any  stockholder of record or beneficial  owner of more than 5% of the Company's
common stock, or any associate thereof who is a party to a legal proceeding that
is adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were not any  submissions of matters to a vote of security  holders during
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995.

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

As it has been for a number of years,  your company's  most  important  activity
continues  to be the  development,  manufacture  and sale of military  footwear.
Although heavily influenced by the size of our country's military  establishment
and by  Government  purchasing  patterns,  we feel this  business  continues  to
represent a very promising  long-term future for a small number of dedicated and
specialized   producers,   such  as  Wellco,  and  we  intend  to  maintain  our
concentration on this business,  while continuing also to seek  opportunities in
related and compatible  fields for military and  commercial  consumption at home
and abroad.

The decline in net income in Fiscal Year 1995  resulted  primarily  from reduced
shipments  of  military  boots to the  U.S.  Government,  as well as a  $420,000
reduction in net investment and dividend and interest income.

Several  developments  that have  taken  place in  recent  months  could  have a
significant  favorable  impact on the  company's  earnings,  beginning  with the
second half of its 1996 Fiscal Year:

1.   Wellco's  sales to the U.S.  Government for the past two years have largely
     been against a contract  awarded in August 1993, which called for a minimum
     basic quantity of 277,000 pr of military combat boots, with two options for
     additional like quantities to be exercised at one-year intervals. The basic
     award called for shipments  over a one-year  period.  When the first option
     was  exercised in August 1994,  the  Government  specified a sixteen  month
     delivery  schedule  for the  purpose  of  reducing  its  inventories.  This
     stretched-out  delivery  schedule is the cause of reduced  current sales to
     the Government. The sixteen month delivery cycle will end in December 1995.

     On August 2, 1995, the  government  exercised its second  and  last  option
     under this contract,  again for the minimum 277,000 pairs. On September 26,
     1995, the Company   agreed  to  a   government   request   for  a  contract
     modification which  reduced  the  minimum  second  option  pairs to 30,000.
     The Company understands   that   this    request    was   caused   by   the
     government's over-obligation of funds for its fiscal year ending  September
     30, 1995, and they were correcting  this by reducing  their  obligation  on
     items for which delivery  orders  had not yet  been  placed.   The  Company
     agreed  to this  modification  because the government could have  otherwise
     exercised  its  right  to  unilaterally   cancel   the   contract  for  the
     convenience  of the government.   This contract   modification  allows  the
     Company to make a claim against  the  government for the lost  contribution
     to overhead,  general  and  administrative  costs and profit  caused by any
     reduction  in the original 277,000 pairs and/or any delay in production.

     The government has indicated that their  intent is to  purchase  all of the
     original  277,000  pairs,  but they will have to wait for their fiscal year
     1996 funding  appropriation  before  increasing the 30,000 pair commitment.
     The  Company  presently  believes  that  this  will  result  in  a  reduced
     production  schedule  of no  more  than  a few  weeks,  but if  there  is a
     significant  delay  in  ordering  boots  and/or  if the  government  orders
     significantly  less  than  their  original  277,000  pair  commitment,  the
     operating results of the Company could be adversely  affected.  The Company
     intends to file a claim for any lost overhead,  general and  administrative
     costs and profit, but any such claim would be subject to final verification
     and audit by the government.  The Company  believes that any adverse effect
     would only be significant  starting in its third fiscal  quarter  beginning
     December 31, 1995.

2.   On August 31,  1995  Wellco's  subsidiary,  Ro-Search  Inc.,  was awarded a
     $1,184,000  Development Contract by U.S. Army Natick Research,  Development
     and  Engineering  Center,  with the object of  developing  improvements  in
     military combat footwear for the purpose of reducing the incidence of lower
     extremity  disorders.  Work on this contract could extend over a three year
     period and, if successful,  could  contribute  significantly to maintaining
     and enhancing  the Company's  leadership  position in the  development  and
     production of military boots.

                                      -2-

3.   In recent months the Company has received several orders for the production
     of military footwear for Latin American and Middle East countries.  We feel
     that foreign  countries are beginning to recognize the superior  quality of
     U.S.-made  boots, in comparison  with  lower-cost  products made in the Far
     East and elsewhere.

4.   The blast  protective  boots and overboots  developed by  Ro-Search,  Inc.,
     designed  to  eliminate  or reduce  foot and leg  injuries  among  military
     personnel  operating in  mine-infested  areas and engaged in mine clearance
     operations, are attracting widening attention for use in parts of the world
     where guerilla warfare and other conflicts have taken place. Such boots are
     presently being produced for use in Turkey and in Peru.

5.   The Company's largest commercial licensee,  Georgia Boot Inc., is presently
     relying on Wellco to bottom several  hundred pairs daily of work and safety
     shoes,  using  Ro-Search's  proprietary  Process 82. Similar  production of
     commercial footwear for other clients is under consideration.
                                      
6.   Wellco,  together  with two other  manufacturers  of military  apparel,  is
     participating  in a  joint  venture  which  has bid to  manufacture  and/or
     procure and to distribute  all standard  items of clothing to all U. S. Air
     Force  recruits.  This is a test contract whose purpose we understand to be
     an evaluation of the use of contractors to replace some of the Government's
     purchasing and distribution  system. The Government is presently evaluating
     bids and has  projected a contract  award  during this Fall.  If awarded to
     Wellco and its partners,  such a contract could have a favorable  effect on
     future revenues and earnings.

The dedication,  experience and talents of our co-workers in Waynesville,  North
Carolina and  Aguadilla,  Puerto Rico have always been and will continue to be a
key component of whatever we may accomplish.
Our heartfelt gratitude is extended to all of them.

Respectfully,



Horace Auberry                      Rolf Kaufman
Chairman                            President

WELLCO'S INVOLVEMENT IN BOOT DEVELOPMENT

Wellco was founded  fifty-five  years ago. One of the  activities of the Company
and its  employees  that  has  brought  us  this  far is our  work  in  footwear
development,  especially in the  development of combat boots that meet the needs
of the U. S.  armed  forces.  The  individual  soldier is our  customer  and the
purpose  of our  development  efforts  is to  provide  them with the best,  most
serviceable boots available.

Our financial releases frequently mention various development work. This year we
are  providing  you  with  a  history  of  Wellco's   involvement   in  footwear
development,  which,  in light of the  importance  of  combat  boots to  current
operations, is primarily about combat boot development.

The first development work goes back to the early 1930's, even prior to Wellco's
founding in 1941.  At that time,  the  Company's  founders,  then  operating  in
Germany,  developed  and  patented  the initial  technology  for  simultaneously
forming,  vulcanizing  and attaching a one-piece  rubber sole and heel to a shoe
upper.

Wellco's founders,  the Rollman and Kaufman families,  had to flee Nazi Germany.
Although  they brought few physical  possessions,  they were able to bring their
knowledge  and desire to develop and improve  footwear.  Upon coming to the U.S.
and founding  Wellco in  Waynesville,  North  Carolina,  they first applied this
knowhow to the production of a broad line of slippers and casual footwear, while
continuing  to  perfect  the  process  for use in heavy  duty  rugged  footwear,
including  military  boots.  This  continuing  development  activity  led to the
patenting in 1957 of "Process  82(R)," a version of the technology that has been
widely  licensed and used and  continuously  improved for the production of work
and safety  footwear  and other  products  worldwide.  In 1963,  the Company was
successful in  demonstrating  to the U.S.  Military the  superiority  of another
version of the original  technology for use in military  footwear,  which became
known as the DMS (Direct Molded Sole) construction.

The first military  application of the DMS construction was in the production of
the Tropical Combat Boot, initially known as the "Vietnam Boot." The U. S. armed
forces did not have a combat  boot that  protected  their  feet in the hot,  wet
climate of Viet Nam. They also needed protection  against certain unique hazards
which  they  encountered.  This  boot has been in  continuous  use for more than
thirty  years,  with a  succession  of  improvements  developed  by Ro-Search in
conjunction with U.S. Army Natick Research,  Development and Engineering  Center
(Natick), leading to the adoption of the most recent improvements in 1994.

In 1968 the U.S.  military's general purpose all-leather combat boot was changed
to the DMS  construction.  This boot  replaced one made with the  Goodyear  Welt
construction  and  gave  the U. S.  armed  forces a much  more  comfortable  and
serviceable  boot. The current  version of this boot was designed and adopted in
1985,  although it too has been variously  refined since that time,  always as a
result of cooperative efforts between Wellco/Ro-Search and Natick.

In  1991 a  Wellco/Ro-Search  developed  prototype  was  selected  as  the  U.S.
Military's desert boot, presently known as Hot Weather Boot - Type II. This boot
was designed under emergency  conditions for Operations Desert Shield and Desert
Storm, in response to the requirements personally set forth by General Norman H.
Schwarzkopf.  U. S. armed  forces  needed a boot that  provided  protection  and
performance  in a hot,  dry and sandy  climate.  In  record  time,  the  Company
developed a boot meeting the soldiers' needs,  wrote the boot  specification and
started  contract  production  of this  boot.  This boot  today has  become  the
standard for use by military forces operating in arid climates.

On August 31, 1995,  Ro-Search was awarded a $1,184,000  development contract by
Natick.  While military  combat boots used by our country's armed forces are the
finest in the world,  there is always room for  improvement.  The contract  just
awarded  seeks to improve the  wearer's  foot  health and comfort by  increasing
flexibility  and  enhancing  impact  characteristics  of  such  footwear,  while
retaining the excellent support, wearability and resistance to the elements that
are characteristic of the present product. To carry

                                       -4-

out this  assignment and consider all options,  the Company has enlisted the aid
of several  sub-contractors  specialized in various footwear constructions other
than the DMS (Direct  Molded Sole)  construction  of the present  combat  boots,
and/or  specialized  in testing and  evaluation  of factors that  influence  the
incidence  of foot and leg  disorders  and injury.  The  contract  just  awarded
includes three phases that could extend over a three-year period and is expected
to result  in the  adoption  of a new or  improved  design  for  soldier  use by
approximately  1998. The importance of this contract to the Company rests not as
much in the revenue and net income which may be associated with it as it does in
the opportunity to develop military  footwear.  We again have the opportunity to
be of service to our  primary  customer,  the U. S.  armed  forces,  and we look
forward to again  improving the combat boots he relies upon in protecting all of
us.

There  is  one  more  area  where  our  boot  development  makes  a  significant
contribution to soldiers. For several years, Ro-Search has been perfecting boots
which reduce  injuries  among troops  operating in mine-  infested  areas and/or
engaged in mine clearance  operations.  To this end, a blast protective boot has
been  developed,  incorporating  a metal honeycomb in the sole deigned to absorb
and deflect  the blast  produced by land  mines.  A blast  protective  overboot,
incorporating  the  same  honeycomb  in  its  sole,  supplemented  by  Kevlar(R)
impact-resistant  material,  has been developed for use in combination  with the
blast protective boot in areas of greatest danger.  These boots have been tested
by the U.S.  Military  at Natick and at Aberdeen  Proving  Grounds and have been
worn under  guerilla  warfare  conditions in El Salvador and by Canadian  forces
engaged in mine  clearance in U.N.  operations in Kuwait and Bosnia.  Such boots
are  presently  being  produced for use in Peru and Turkey and are  attracting a
high level of interest from the military forces of a number of other  countries,
besides the U.S.A.

   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
                                    CONDITION


                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparing The Year Ended July 1, 1995 and July 2, 1994:

Income  before  income  taxes in the  current  year was  $1,212,000  compared to
$2,034,000 in the prior one. Several factors resulted in the $822,000  decrease,
the more significant ones being:

     1.   Pairs of combat boots sold decreased almost 20%. Most of this decrease
          was in shipments to the U. S. government.  In November,  1994,  Wellco
          made its first  shipments  against an option awarded under its current
          military boot contract. This option has a delivery schedule of sixteen
          months,  compared  to a twelve  month  schedule  for boots  shipped in
          fiscal year 1994.

     2.   1994 includes $255,000 in favorable  adjustments to previous estimates
          of  contracting  actions which were  finalized in the fourth  quarter.
          From time to time contract  changes will occur whose financial  effect
          on the Company are included in the  financial  statements at estimated
          amounts  until final  amounts  are  negotiated  and  settled  with the
          government.  Most of this  $255,000  adjustment  relates to  estimates
          recorded in the years 1991-1993.

     3.   Somewhat  offsetting  the effect of lower  combat  boots  sales was an
          increase in machinery and materials  sales. A significant  shipment of
          machinery and boot  materials was made to a combat boot  manufacturing
          factory  in El  Salvador,  which  did not  occur  in 1994.  1995  also
          includes  substantial  machinery  sales to one new boot  manufacturing
          customer  and  to  one  long-time  customer.   These  sales  can  vary
          significantly from year to year with the needs of these customers.

     4.   Revenues from  technical  assistance  fees and equipment  rentals from
          licensees,  which vary with their  shipments,  decreased  because  the
          Company's U. S. combat boot manufacturing licensees were also affected
          by the government's longer delivery schedule .

     5.   While revenues  decreased  $252,000,  certain  manufacturing  expenses
          increased, and this reduced margins. Group health insurance costs, for
          which the Company is self funded, increased $131,000. This cost varies
          from period to period with the actual amount of health costs  incurred
          by employees. Workers' compensation insurance premiums also increased,
          but this was more than offset by  decreases  in the cost of  utilities
          and maintenance.

     6.   General and administrative  expense decreased $6,000 in 1995. Employee
          bonus compensation decreased $69,000 with the lower net income.

     7.   Dividend and interest  income  decreased  $52,000.  Investment  income
          decreased  $368,000 in the current year,  primarily because two equity
          securities were sold for prices less than their carrying value.

The  percentage of income tax provision to pretax income  decreased in 1995. The
untaxed  portion of dividend  income from  corporate  equity  securities did not
decrease in proportion to the decrease in pretax income.

In 1995,  Wellco adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115,
 
                                      -6-

<PAGE>



"Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt  and  Equity  Securities".  This
resulted  in the  carrying  value  of  Marketable  Securities,  as  shown in the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets,  being  increased by the $730,000  excess of fair
value over their adjusted cost, and a corresponding  increase, net of the effect
of income taxes, in Stockholders' Equity of $482,000.

On December 30, 1994,  Wellco  purchased  400,000  shares of the common stock of
Alba Waldensian,  Inc. (21.5% of total shares  outstanding).  This investment is
being accounted for on the equity method.  Included in the 1995 pretax income is
$69,000  representing  Wellco's  share of  Alba's  net  income  from the date of
purchase  through July 1, 1995, and the  amortization  of the excess of Wellco's
proportionate share of Alba's net assets over Wellco's basis in the stock.

Forward Looking Information:

In August,  1993 Wellco was awarded a U. S. government  combat boot contract for
277,000  pairs to be shipped  over a twelve  month  period.  The  contract  also
contains  two  options  for the same  quantity.  During  the first year and each
option period,  the  government  can increase its total  purchases by up to 50%,
with the specific  additional quantity awarded to each contractor being based on
an evaluation of the  contractors'  performance  during the prior year. To date,
the government has not increased its purchases, and the Company understands that
it will not during the remaining option periods of this contract.

In August, 1994 the government exercised the first option for a total of 277,000
pairs. The delivery period for shipments under this option is sixteen months, or
a one-third longer period than the first year's award.  This delivery  extension
was caused by a  government  program to reduce its combat  boot  inventories  by
buying  fewer  boots than are  consumed.  Deliveries  under this  option will be
substantially completed by December, 1995.

On August 2, 1995,  the  government  exercised  its second and last option under
this contract,  again for the minimum  277,000 pairs. On September 26, 1995, the
Company agreed to a government request for a contract modification which reduced
the minimum  second option pairs to 30,000.  The Company  understands  that this
request was caused by the government's  over-obligation  of funds for its fiscal
year ending  September 30, 1995, and they were correcting this by reducing their
obligation  on items for which  delivery  orders  had not yet been  placed.  The
Company agreed to this modification  because the government could have otherwise
exercised its right to  unilaterally  cancel the contract for the convenience of
the government.  This contract  modification  allows the Company to make a claim
agains  the  government  for the lost  contribution  to  overhead,  general  and
administrative  costs and profit caused by any reduction in the original 277,000
pairs and/or any delay in production.

The  government  has  indicated  that  their  intent is to  purchase  all of the
original  277,000  pairs,  but they will have to wait for their fiscal year 1996
funding appropriation before increasing the 30,000 pair commitment.  The Company
presently believes that this will result in a reduced production  schedule of no
more than a few weeks,  but if there is a  significant  delay in ordering  boots
and/or if the government orders  significantly  less than their original 277,000
pair  commitment,  the  operating  results  of the  Company  could be  adversely
affected. The Company intends to file a claim for any lost overhead, general and
administrative  costs and  profit,  but any such claim would be subject to final
verification and audit by the government.  The Company believes that any adverse
effect would only be significant  starting in its third fiscal quarter beginning
December 31, 1995.

The Company also  understands  that the  government's  combat boot  inventory is
significantly  greater than what they want it to be. They are  presently  buying
fewer pairs than  consumption  and will probably  continue to do so for the next
few years.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

In late  August,  1995,  the Company was awarded a $1,184,000  development  boot
contract from the U. S. government. The objective of this contract is to develop
changes to the combat boot that will result in fewer lower extremity  disorders.
Work has started on this contract and could extend over three years.

Wellco,  along with two other  manufacturers of military clothing,  have jointly
bid on a trial contract to procure, warehouse and distribute all of the standard
clothing items to Air Force recruits at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas for one
year,  with two options for one year each. The  government  has been  evaluating
bids for many months, with the projected contract award date being no later than
October 24, 1995.

Subsequent  to July  1,  1995,  Wellco  received  several  orders  from  foreign
customers for its anti-personnel  mine protective boot. Interest in this product
has increased significantly,  but at this point it is too early to project if it
will become a significant contributor to future operations.


Comparing The Year Ended July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993:

Income  before  income  taxes in the  current  year was  $2,034,000  compared to
$2,423,000 in the prior one.
                                     
Several factors  resulted in the $389,000  decrease,  the more  significant ones
being:

     1.   Operations  in the prior year  included  significant  equipment  sales
          under contract to a military boot factory in Colombia,  South America.
          This contract represented a complete retooling of an existing factory,
          and a contract  of this type and  significance  did not exist in 1994.
          Somewhat  offsetting  this were $255,000 in favorable  adjustments  to
          previous estimates of contracting  actions which were finalized in the
          fourth  quarter of the 1994 year.  From time to time contract  changes
          will occur whose  financial  effect on the Company are included in the
          financial  statements  at estimated  amounts  until final  amounts are
          negotiated  and settled  with the  government.  Most of this  $255,000
          adjustment  relates to estimates  recorded in the years 1991-1993.  If
          prior year estimates were adjusted for the actual settlement  amounts,
          pretax  income  for  1993,   1992  and  1991  would  be  increased  by
          approximately $101,000, $93,000 and $41,000.

     2.   Revenues from  technical  assistance  fees and equipment  rentals from
          licensees  decreased  because the prior  period  included  certain fee
          surcharges  which  did  not  occur  in the  current  period.  Somewhat
          offsetting  this was the effect of  certain  licensees  having  higher
          sales, on which these variable fees are earned.

     3.   Despite the decrease in total revenues, certain manufacturing expenses
          increased, and this reduced margins. Group health insurance costs, for
          which the  Company  is self  funded,  increased  $82,000.  The cost of
          workers' compensation insurance also increased.

     4.   General and administrative expense decreased in 1994 because the prior
          year  includes  $137,000  incurred by a special  committee of Wellco's
          Board of Directors in the  investigation  of a potential  acquisition.
          Also, employee bonus compensation decreased with the lower net income.

     5.   Dividend  and  interest  income  decreased  because  the  payment of a
          special cash dividend in September,  1993 totaling  $5,300,000 reduced
          invested funds.

The  percentage of income tax provision to pretax income  decreased in 1994. The
primary reason for this was a reduction in the previously  accrued liability for
Puerto Rico taxes on  undistributed  earnings of the Company's  subsidiary which
operates in Puerto  Rico.  The  subsidiary  was able,  under a new law of Puerto
Rico, to prepay, at a 20% lower rate,  certain of these taxes normally paid when
that subsidiary pays a dividend to the Company.

                                      -8-

In  fiscal  year  1993,  Wellco  elected  to adopt  early  Financial  Accounting
Standards Board Opinion No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes".  The cumulative

                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Wellco uses cash from  operations to supply most of its liquidity  needs. A bank
line of credit is maintained for supplying any unforeseen cash needs.
                                      
The following table  summarizes at the end of each year the availability of cash
from the Company's most liquid assets and from its existing borrowing sources:

The decrease at the end of 1995 was primarily  caused by the  investment in Alba
Waldensian,  Inc. The decrease at the end of 1994 was caused by the payment of a
special cash dividend totaling $5,300,000 in September,  1993. This dividend was
paid out of monies  determined  by the Board of  Directors  to not be  otherwise
needed in the foreseeable future.

The following  table  summarizes  the major sources  (uses) of cash for the last
three years:

In 1995, cash from the sale of marketable securities was used to pay for part of
the purchase of Alba Waldensian,  Inc. (the affiliate)  common stock.  Cash from
1995 operations was also used to purchase Alba's stock,  purchase  equipment and
pay the cash dividend.  Cash from 1994 operations was used to increase inventory
and to provide  monies for the  increase in accounts  receivable.  Cash from the
sale of marketable securities and some of the cash from July 3, 1993 was used to
pay 1994 cash dividends, including the $5,300,000 special dividend.

Cash resources are adequate to meet presently  known  operating  activity needs.
The Company has no material commitments for capital equipment.  The Company does
not know of any demands, commitments,  uncertainties, or trends that will result
in or that are  reasonably  likely  to  result in its  liquidity  increasing  or
decreasing in any material way.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Fiscal Years Ended July 1, 1995, July 2, 1994 and July 3, 1993


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

         Principles of Consolidation

                  The accompanying financial statements include the consolidated
                  accounts  of the Company  and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.
                  Appropriate   eliminations  have  been  made  of  intercompany
                  transactions and balances.

         Inventories

                  Raw  materials  and  supplies  are  valued  at  the  lower  of
                  first-in, first-out cost or market. Finished goods and work in
                  process are valued at the lower of actual cost,  determined on
                  a specific basis, or market.

         Income Taxes

                  The  provision  for income  taxes is based on taxes  currently
                  payable  adjusted for the net change in the deferred tax asset
                  or liability  during the current year. A deferred tax asset or
                  liability  arises  from  temporary   differences  between  the
                  carrying  value  of  assets  and   liabilities  for  financial
                  reporting and income tax purposes.

         Marketable Securities

                  Marketable  securities  consist of  corporate  equity and debt
                  securities and the notes of various U. S. government agencies.
                  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115 (SFAS
                  115),  "Accounting for Certain  Investments in Debt and Equity
                  Securities",  was  effective  as of the  beginning of the 1995
                  fiscal  year.  Under  SFAS  115,  corporate  equity  and  debt
                  securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued
                  in  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  at  their  fair  value
                  (usually market value).  The difference between fair value and
                  the  securities'  adjusted  cost,  net of the effect of income
                  taxes, is reflected in Stockholders' Equity.

                  U. S.  government  agency  notes,  purchased  at a discount to
                  their  face value and held for a very  short  period  prior to
                  their  maturity,  are  classified as  held-to-maturity.  These
                  securities  are valued in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheets at
                  their cost,  which is not  significantly  less than  amortized
                  cost, and the difference  between cost and the amount realized
                  at  maturity  is  included   with   Interest   Income  in  the
                  Consolidated Statements of Operations.

                  Retroactive application of SFAS 115 is not permitted. Prior to
                  the 1995 fiscal year,  the Company's  method of accounting for
                  marketable  securities  was to  reflect  their  value at cost.
                  Under  both  SFAS  115 and the  prior  accounting  method,  an
                  unrealized loss is recognized for any decline in an individual
                  investment's  fair value below cost that is judged to be other
                  than  temporary.  Realized  gains  and  losses on the sales of
                  investments  are  determined  on the  specific  identification
                  basis.

         Depreciation
               
                                      -17-

<PAGE>



                  The  Company  uses  the   straight-line   method  to  compute 
                  depreciation  on  machinery  leased to licensees and property,
                  plant and equipment.


         Investment in Affiliate

                  Investment  in  affiliate,  defined as owned more than 20% but
                  not more than 50%,  is  accounted  for on the  equity  method.
                  Because this  affiliate  was purchased  from a more-than-  50%
                  owner of Wellco, the investment was initially recorded at that
                  entity's basis at the date of Wellco's acquisition. The excess
                  of that basis over Wellco's cost of acquisition ($650,000, net
                  of the effect of income  taxes) was recorded as an increase in
                  Additional Paid-In Capital.

         Machinery Leased to Licensees

                  Certain  shoe-making  machinery is leased to  licensees  under
                  cancelable operating leases. Such activity is accounted for by
                  the operating method whereby leased assets are capitalized and
                  depreciated  over their estimated useful lives (5 to 10 years)
                  and rentals,  based  primarily on the volume of shoes produced
                  or  shipped by the  lessees,  are  recorded  during the period
                  earned.

         Intangible Asset

                  The  excess of the fair value (as  determined  by the Board of
                  Directors)  of Wellco  Enterprises,  Inc.  common stock issued
                  over the net assets of Ro-Search,  Incorporated at acquisition
                  is not being amortized. This asset arose prior to 1970 and, in
                  the opinion of  management,  there has not been any diminution
                  in its value.

         Pensions

                  The Company has two non-contributory,  defined benefit pension
                  plans  covering  substantially  all  employees  at  its  North
                  Carolina  plant.  The Company's  policy is to fund the minimum
                  amount  required by the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security
                  Act.

         Revenue Recognition

                  All  government  combat boot  production  contracts  are fixed
                  price  and  usually  have a  delivery  schedule  of  twelve to
                  sixteen  months.  Revenue is recognized for each boot shipment
                  after it has been  inspected and accepted by the  government's
                  Quality Assurance Representative.

                  Government research and development contracts are typically no
                  more  than one year in  duration.  Revenue  is  recognized  as
                  services are performed and invoiced.  Revenues from  licensees
                  are recognized in the period services are rendered or products
                  are shipped.

         Statements of Cash Flows

                  For  the  purpose  of  these  statements,  current  marketable
                  securities  are not  considered to be cash  equivalents  since
                  they are  purchased  for  yield  and  represent  a part of the
                  Company's investing activities.

         Fiscal Year

                  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June
                  30.  Because of this, the 1993 fiscal  contains 53 weeks,  and
                  all other years presented contain 52 weeks.

                  Statement  of   Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  112,
                  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postemployment   Benefits",   is
                  effective for the Company's 1995 fiscal year. As it applies to
                  the Company, SFAS No. 112 requires the recording of an expense
                  and liability for the cost of insurance  benefits to employees
                  who are not  actively  at work due to illness  or layoff.  The
                  amount of this liability at July 1, 1995 was not significant.

2. RECEIVABLES:

     The majority of receivables at July 1, 1995 are from the U. S. government. 
     The Company's  policy is to require either a  confirmed  irrevocable  bank 
     letter  of  credit  or  advance payment on significant  order from foreign 
     customers.   Allowances  for  doubtful  accounts in  1995 and 1994 are not

4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES:

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),  "Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities",  was effective as of
    the beginning of the 1995 fiscal year. Under SFAS 115,  corporate equity and
    debt securities are classified as  available-for-sale  and are valued in the
    Consolidated  Balance Sheets at their fair value (usually market value). The
    difference  between fair value and the securities  adjusted cost, net of the
    effect  of  income  taxes,  is  reflected  in  Stockholders'  Equity.  U. S.
    government agency notes are classified as held-to-maturity and are valued at
    their cost which  approximates  amortized  cost.  Restatement  of previously
    issued  financial  statements is not permitted under SFAS 115. The Company's
    previous  method of accounting for investments was to reflect their value at
    cost and only adjust cost by any declines in fair value below cost that were
    judged to be other  than  temporary.  Under  both SFAS 115 and the  previous
    method of accounting, any decline in fair value below cost that is judged to
    be other than temporary is recognized as an unrealized loss.

    Applying  FAS 115 to the  July 1,  1995  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
    resulted in corporate  equity and debt securities being stated at their fair
    value (an  increase  of  $730,000  over  adjusted  cost) with an increase in
    Stockholders'  Equity,  after the effect of income taxes, of $482,000.  Fair
    value is usually current market value at the financial statement date.

    Adjusted cost,  gross  unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of all
    Marketable Securities at July 1, 1995 is :

     Proceeds from the sale of Marketable Securities classified under FAS 115 as
     available-for-sale  in the fiscal year ended July 1, 1995 were  $4,098,000,
     resulting in gross realized gains of $354,000 and gross realized  losses of
     $142,000.  An unrealized  loss  ($194,000)  was recognized on one corporate
     equity  security  whose fair  value's  decline  below cost was judged to be
     other  than  temporary.  Realized  gains and  losses  are  determined  on a
     specific  identification basis. The U. S. Government agency note matured in
     July, 1995.

5.   INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE:

     On December 30, 1994 Wellco  purchased from Coronet  Insurance  Company for
     cash 400,000  shares of the common stock of Alba  Waldensian,  Inc.  (Alba)
     $4,250,000 was paid to Coronet and $225,000 was paid for investment bankers
     fees, legal fees and other  investigation  costs.  This represents 21.5% of
     total Alba common shares. At December 30, Coronet owned 58.79% of the total
     outstanding common stock of Wellco.  Because Coronet owned more than 50% of
     Wellco,  the  investment was recorded at the basis of Coronet in these Alba
     shares  ($5,461,000),  and the  excess of that  basis  over  Wellco's  cost
     increased  Additional  Paid-In  Capital by  $650,000,  net of the effect of
     income taxes. The total market value of these shares,  based on the closing
     price of Alba common stock on the American  Stock  Exchange on June 29,1995
     was  $3,650,000.  Management  has  evaluated the reasons for the decline in
     Alba's  market  price  since its  acquisition  and has  concluded  that the
     decline is temporary.

     Wellco has an option to purchase up to 538,000  additional Alba shares from
     Coronet.  If all of this option was  exercised,  Wellco  would own 50.4% of
     total Alba common shares.

     The investment in Alba is accounted for using the equity method. The excess
     of Wellco's equity in the underlying net assets of Alba ($747,000) over its
     basis is being amortized to income over a remaining period of approximately
     7 years.  Amortization  included in Equity in Earnings of  Affiliate in the
     Consolidated  Statements of Operations is $50,000 in the year ended July 1,
     1995.

     Alba is a manufacturer of both men's and women's  apparel  products as well
     as medical  specialty  products.  Other than this investment,  there are no
     business relationships or transactions between Wellco and Alba.

     Summarized financial information (unaudited) for Alba is as follows:

Total Pension Liability ............................      $ 2,174       $ 1,767
</TABLE>


     The pension  liability not yet charged against  operations is a part of the
     long-term pension obligation  liability.  This liability at July 1, 1995 is
     offset by an  intangible  pension  asset of $642,000  ($575,000  at July 2,
     1994) and an equity reduction,  net of income taxes, of $525,000  ($306,000
     at July 2, 1994).

     Plan assets are invested in the General Investment Account of the Company's
     actuary.  This  account  invests  primarily in  high-quality,  fixed income
     mortgage obligations and corporate bonds. The assumed average discount rate
     and the expected  long-term  rate of return on plan assets is 7.5% ( 8% for
     1994). To the extent  projected  benefits are based on final average annual
     earnings,  the assumed rate of annual  increase in future  salary levels is
     5.5% (6.5% for 1994).

11. RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS:

     The Company  provides  health  insurance  benefits  for  qualified  retired
     employees of its North Carolina  plant.  Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement  Benefits Other
     Than  Pensions"  (FAS 106) was  effective  for the 1994 fiscal  year.  This
     Statement  requires the recognition of the cost of postretirement  benefits
     over the service lives of employees and the recognition, either immediately
     upon adoption of the  Statement or over average  remaining  future  service
     lives,  of the liability at the date of adoption  (July 4, 1993).  The 1995
     and 1994 Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the Statement's adoption
     and the Company  elected to recognize the liability over  remaining  future
     service lives. Restatement of previously issued financial statements is not
     permitted.  The Company's  previous  accounting  method for  postretirement
     health benefits was to expense costs in the period paid.

     Employees of the North Carolina plant who meet certain  criteria and retire
     early (age 62-64) or disabled  receive  for  themselves,  but not for their
     dependents,   the  same  health  insurance   benefits  received  by  active
     employees.  All benefits  terminate when the employee  becomes  eligible to
     receive Medicare  (usually age 65 or 30 months after disability date). This
     benefit is provided  at no cost to the  employee  and the Company  does not
     fund the cost of this benefit prior to costs actually being incurred.

</TABLE>


     The  assumed  health care cost trend rate used to project  expected  future
     cost was 13.2% in 1995 (14% in 1994),  gradually  decreasing  to 6% by 2004
     and remaining at 6% thereafter. The assumed discount rate used to determine
     the  accumulated  liability was 8% at July 1, 1995 ( 7.5% at July 2, 1994).
     The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed  health care cost trend rate for
     each  future  year would not have a  significant  effect on the service and
     interest cost  components of the current period cost or on the  accumulated
     liability.

12. INCOME TAXES:

     In fiscal year 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes".  The Standard  requires
     that an asset and liability approach be used in accounting for income taxes
     and provides  revised  criteria for the recognition of deferred tax assets.
     As permitted by the Standard, prior year financial statements have not been
     restated.  The  cumulative  prior year effect of adopting  SFAS No. 109 was
     recorded in 1993 and increased net income by $260,000.

     This primarily represents the benefit of being able to reduce future years'
     taxable  income by certain  expenses  previously  recognized  for financial
     statement purposes.

     Income  earned in Puerto Rico by the Company's  Puerto Rican  subsidiary is
     not  subject to United  States  federal  income tax and is 90% exempt  from
     Puerto Rican income tax through 2000.

     The accumulated undistributed earnings ($4,335,000 at July 1, 1995) of this
     subsidiary are subject to a Puerto Rican tollgate tax (5%) when remitted to
     the parent  company.  Accrued tax  liabilities  have been  provided for the
     tollgate tax reasonably  expected to be paid in the future. In 1994 under a
     new Puerto  Rican law,  the Company  elected to prepay at a 8% rate certain
     tollgate  taxes  previously  accrued at 10%. This is the primary reason for
     the decrease in the 1994 effective tax rate.

15. GOVERNMENT BOOT CONTRACT REVENUES:

     In 1994 two contract  actions were settled with the U. S.  government,  and
     this  resulted in an increase in income  before  income  taxes of $255,000.
     This amount is the excess of the actual settlement  amounts over previously
     recorded  estimates.  At July 1, 1995, all  significant  contract items had
     been settled.

16. COMMITMENT:

     Under a  Resolution  of its  Board of  Directors,  Wellco is  committed  to
     purchase its Common Stock,  which, as of September 6, 1990, was owned by or

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




Board of Directors and Stockholders
Wellco Enterprises, Inc.
Waynesville, North Carolina

We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Wellco
Enterprises,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 1, 1995 and July 2, 1994, and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash
flows  for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  July 1,  1995.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit  also  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence
supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Wellco  Enterprises,  Inc.  and
subsidiaries  as of July 1,  1995 and July 2,  1994,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 1, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 4 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting  for marketable  securities  during fiscal year
1995 to conform with  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115. As
discussed  in Note 12 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company
changed its method of  accounting  for income taxes  during  fiscal year 1993 to
conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors and Stockholders
Wellco Enterprises, Inc.
Waynesville, North Carolina

We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Wellco
Enterprises,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 1, 1995 and July 2, 1994, and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period  ended July 1, 1995.  Our audits
also  included  the  financial  statement  schedule  filed under Part IV of Item
14(a)2.  These  financial  statements and financial  statement  schedule are the
responsiblility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial  statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of Wellco  Enterprises,  Inc.  and
subsidiaries  as of July 1,  1995 and July 2,  1994,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

         (a) The holders of the preferred  stock shall be entitled to cumulative

         annum and no more, payable out of any and all surplus or net profits of
         the corporation, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly, as and when declared
         by the Board of Directors,  before any dividends  shall be declared set
         apart  for or paid upon the  common  shares  of the  corporation.  Said
         dividends on the preferred  stock shall be cumulative  from the date of
         issue  so that if the  corporation  shall  fail in any year to pay such
         dividends on all of the issued and outstanding  preferred  stock,  such
         deficiency in the dividends shall be fully paid, but without  interest,
         before any  dividends  shall be paid or set apart on the common  stock.
         Subject to the foregoing provisions,  said preferred stock shall not be
         entitled  to  participate  in any other or  additional  surplus  or net

         thereof, to wit, One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars per share and the amount
         of all unpaid accrued dividends  thereon,  before any sum shall be paid
         or any assets  distributed among the holders of the common shares;  and
         after the  payment  to the  holders of the  preferred  stock of its par
         value and the unpaid accrued  dividends  thereon,  the remaining assets
         and funds of the  corporation  shall be  divided  among and paid to the
         holders  of all the  common  stock in  proportion  to their  respective
         holdings of such shares.

         (c) The Board of Directors,  in their  discretion,  may declare and pay
         dividends  on the common  shares  concurrently  with  dividends  on the
         preferred  stock,  for any dividend period of any fiscal year when such
         dividends  are  applicable  to the common  shares;  provided,  that all
         accumulated  dividends on the preferred  stock for all previous  fiscal
         year and all dividends on the preferred stock for the previous dividend
         periods for the fiscal  year shall have been paid in full.  The holders
         of the  common  stock  shall be  entitled  to  share  in any  dividends
         declared upon the common stock of the corporation.

         (e) No holder of either the preferred or common stock shall be entitled
         as of right to purchase or subscribe for any part of any unissued stock
         of either  class,  or any  additional  preferred  or common stock to be
         issued by reason of any increase of the authorized capital stock of the
         corporation of either common or preferred stock, or bonds, certificates
         of indebtedness,  debentures or other securities convertible into stock
         of the  corporation,  but any such  unissued  stock or such  additional
         authorized issue of new stock or of other  securities  convertible into
         stock may be issued and disposed of pursuant to resolution of the Board
         of Directors to such persons,  firms,  corporations or associations and
         upon such terms as may be deemed advisable by the Board of Directors in
         the exercise of their discretion.

         (f) Said common stock without nominal or par value may be issued by the
         corporation  from time to time for such  cash,  property,  services  or
         expenses  as may be  determined  from  time  to time  by the  Board  of
         Directors thereof.

         or any assets  distributed among the holders of the Common shares;  and
         after the  payment  to the  holders of the  Preferred  Stock of its par
         value and the unpaid accrued  dividends  thereon,  the remaining assets

         holdings of such shares, irrespective of the class to which such shares
         belong.

         (c) The Board of Directors,  in their  discretion,  may declare and pay
         dividends  on the Common  shares  concurrently  with  dividends  on the

         of either class, or any

                                       OF

                             WELLCO SHOE CORPORATION


         The undersigned  corporation,  for the purpose of amending its Articles
of  Incorporation  and pursuant to the  provisions  of Chapter 55 of the General
Statutes  of  North  Carolina,  known  as  the  Business  Corporation  Act,  and
particularly  pursuant to Section 55-103 thereof,  hereby executes the following
Articles of Amendment.

         1.  The  name of the  corporation  at the  date of  execution  of these
Articles  of  Amendment  is  Wellco  Shoe  Corporation,  but one of the  changes
effected by these Articles of Amendment is to change the name of the corporation
to Wellco Ro-Search Industries, Inc.

         2. The  amendment  adopted by action of the Board of Directors  and the
Shareholders  is that the  Charter  of Wellco  Shoe  Corporation  be  amended by
striking out all of the Articles  thereof  numbered  First,  Second,  Fourth and
Fifth,  as set forth in the Charter of Wellco Shoe  Corporation  as the same has
been heretofore amended and filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the
State of North Carolina,  and be inserting in lieu thereof the Articles numbered
First, Second, Fourth and Fifth set forth in Exhibit "A" attached hereto.

         3.  The date of the adoption of this amendment by the Shareholders  was
October 31, 1961.

         4. The number of shares of the  corporation  outstanding at the time of
the  adoption of said  amendment  was 1,544  shares of 5%  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock,  12,507  shares of Class A Common  Stock,  and  23,277  shares of Class B
Common  Stock,  all of which  shares were  entitled to vote  thereon.  The 1,544
shares of 5%  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock were  entitled  to vote  thereon as a
class. The 35,734 shares of Common Stock, consisting of 12,507 shares of Class A
Common Stock and 23,277  shares of Class B Common  Stock,  were entitled to vote
thereon as a class.

         5. The number of shares voted for such amendment was 1,412 shares of 5%
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock and 35,669 shares of Common Stock (both Class A and
Class B Common  Stock  voting  together  as a class and being in this  paragraph
referred to as "Common  Stock"),  and the number of shares  voted  against  such
amendment  was 8 shares of 5%  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  Voting within each
class entitled to vote as a class was as follows:

         Class                                            Number of Shares Voted

                                                        For              Against

5% Cumulative Preferred Stock                           1,412             8
Common Stock                                           35,669            None

         6. Any exchange, reclassification or cancellation of issued shares will

on a share-for-share basis into one share of 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock authorized by the amendment  effected hereby, and the Class B Common Stock

<PAGE>



         7.  Such amendment does not effect a change in  the  amount  of  stated
capital of the corporation.

         8. The  amendment  hereby  effected  does not give rise to  dissenter's
rights under G. S. 55- 101(b) for the reason that the amendment  does not change
the corporation into a non-profit corporation or cooperative  organization,  nor
does the amendment  effect any changes as described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3),
(4) and (5) of  Subsection  (a) of G. S. 55-101 in the 5%  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock heretofore authorized,  issued and outstanding, nor would the amendment to
the  prejudice  of any holder of such shares  create or increase  any  priority,
dividend preference,  cumulative dividend right, redemption price or liquidation
preference of any other then issued  shares;  nor would the amendment  authorize
the  corporation  to issue  shares of any new  class  having  preferences  as to
dividends or liquidation prior to such shares.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  said  corporation  has caused  these  Articles of
Amendment to be executed in its  corporate  name by its  President and Secretary
and its corporate  seal to be hereunto  affixed,  this the 12th day of December,
1961.

respective  holders  thereof into ten (10) shares of Class B Common  Stock,  and
after the  conversion of all of the  outstanding  shares of Class A Common Stock
into Class B Common Stock,  the authorized Class A Common Stock shall thereby be
eliminated,  and all authorized Class B Common Stock of the par value of ONE AND
NO/100  DOLLARS   ($1.00)  per  share   (including  all  amounts   thereof  then
outstanding)  shall  thereafter  be  designated  as  the  Common  Stock  of  the
Corporation.

         ARTICLE FIFTH: The designations,  preferences, privileges, limitations,
voting  powers and relative  rights of the shares of each class of stock and the
restrictions or limitations thereof shall be as follows:

         (a) The 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled, in
preference to the Common  Stock,  when and as declared by the Board of Directors
from funds legally available therefor, to dividends at the rate of five per cent
(5%) of the par value thereof per annum,  payable  quarterly on January 1, April
1, July 1, and October 1, of each year,  or  otherwise as the Board of Directors
may determine (the periods between such dates,  commencing on such dates,  being
herein referred to as "dividend  periods").  Such dividends of the 5% Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock  shall be  cumulative  from  the date of  issuance
thereof.  If,  at the  time  of the  issuance  of any  shares  of 5%  Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  dividends  upon  the  shares  of  5%  Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock at the time  outstanding  shall not then have been
paid or  declared  and set apart  for  payment,  at the full rate to which  said
shares are entitled,  to the beginning of the then current dividend  period,  no
dividends  shall  be  declared  or  paid  on the  shares  of  the 5%  Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock  issued at such time until all such  dividends  in
arrears shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment as aforesaid,
and none of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to prevent the declaration and
payment of such dividends in arrears without a declaration


<PAGE>



or payment of dividends on additional  shares so issued.  No dividends  shall be
paid or set apart for  payment on the Common  Stock at any time unless the total
amount of  dividends  theretofore  paid or declared and set apart for payment on
then  outstanding 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock shall be equal to
Five Dollars ($5.00) per annum for each share of such 5% Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred  Stock  from  the date  when it  became  cumulative  to the end of the
current dividend period.

         Whenever full cumulative dividends,  as aforesaid,  on all shares of 5%
Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock then  outstanding for all past dividend
periods and for the current dividend period shall have been paid or declared and
set apart  for  payment,  dividends  may be  declared  and paid or set apart for
payment on the Common Stock,  when and to the extent that the Board of Directors
shall  determine,  and no holder  of any  shares  of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred Stock as such shall be entitled to share therein.

         (b) In the event of any  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any proceedings
resulting in any distribution of all its assets to its stockholders,  before any
distribution  shall be made to the holders of the Common  Stock,  each holder of
shares of 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid
on  each  share  of such  stock  held  by him  the  sum of One  Hundred  Dollars
($100.00), plus an amount equal to accrued dividends.  After such payment to the
holders  of  the  5%  Cumulative   Convertible   Preferred  Stock  of  the  full
preferential amounts hereinbefore provided for, the holders of the 5% Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock  as such  shall  have no  right  or  claim  to the
remaining  assets and funds  shall  (subject  to the  rights,  if any, of others
therein) be divided and distributed among the holders of the Common Stock of the
Corporation according to their respective interests.  The Board of Directors, by
vote of a majority of the members thereof, may distribute in kind to the holders
of the  Common  Stock such  remaining  assets of the  Corporation  to which such
holders may be entitled at such  valuations as it in its sole  discretion  shall
determine.  The sale of all the property of the Corporation to, or the merger or
consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other corporation shall not be
deemed to be a distribution  of assets or a dissolution,  liquidation or winding
up  or  proceeding  resulting  in a  distribution  of  all  its  assets  to  its
stockholders for the purpose of this subdivision.

         (c) At the option of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,  the 5%
Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock may be redeemed in whole or in part, at
any time and from  time to time  after  the  issuance  thereof,  at One  Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) per share and accrued dividends to the date of redemption.  If
less than all the shares of the 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are to
be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or in such other
equitable manner as the Board of Directors shall determine.

         Notice of the intention of the  Corporation  to redeem shares of the 5%
Cumulative  Convertible Preferred Stock or any part thereof, and of the date and
place of  redemption,  shall be mailed not less than  thirty nor more than sixty
days  previous to the date of  redemption to each holder of record of the shares
to be redeemed at his last known post office  address as shown by the records of
the  Corporation.  Such notice shall also contain  notification  of the right of
each holder of record of the shares to be redeemed to convert any or all of such
shares into  shares of Common  Stock as  hereinafter  set forth,  provided  such
conversion right is exercised on or before, but not after, the close of business
on the seventh  calendar day preceding  the  redemption  date  specified in such
notice. The holders of any shares of 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock
so called for redemption  shall, as to any of such shares as to which they shall
not have  theretofore  exercised the right of  conversion  into shares of Common
Stock as hereinafter  provided, on the redemption date specified in such notice,
provided  the  redemption  price is then  made  available  to them,  cease to be
stockholders of the Corporation with respect to such shares, and all rights with
respect to said shares so called for redemption  shall, on such redemption date,
cease and terminate, except only


<PAGE>



the rights  of  the  holders thereof  to receive  the redemption  price therefor
without interest.

         At any time after the close of  business on the  seventh  calendar  day
preceding the redemption  date  specified in such notice,  the  Corporation  may
deposit the aggregate  redemption price (or the portion thereof not already paid
in the redemption of shares so to be redeemed) with any bank or trust company in
the City of New York,  State of New York, or in the City of Asheville,  State of
North  Carolina,  having a capital  and  surplus  of not less  than One  Million
Dollars  ($1,000,000.00),  named in a notice mailed to the holders of the shares
called  for  redemption  and   represented  by   certificates   not  theretofore
surrendered,  payable in the amounts  aforesaid to the respective  orders of the
record holders of such shares to be redeemed, on endorsement,  if required,  and
surrender of their  certificates for said shares,  and from and after the making
of any such deposit, said holders shall have not interest in or claim against or
rights as a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to said shares but shall
be entitled only to receive said moneys from said bank or trust company  without
interest,  on endorsement,  if required,  and surrender of their certificates as
aforesaid.  The  Corporation  shall be entitled to receive from any such bank or
trust company on any moneys deposited as in this subdivision  provided,  and the
holders of any shares so redeemed shall have no claim to any such interest.  Any
moneys so  deposited  and  remaining  unclaimed at the end of six years from the
date fixed for redemption  shall,  if thereafter  requested by resolution of the
Board of  Directors,  be  repaid  to the  Corporation,  and in the event of such
repayment to the  Corporation  such holders of record of the shares so redeemed,
as shall not have made claim against such moneys prior to such  repayment to the
Corporation,  shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Corporation,  but
only for a period of two years from the date of such repayment  (after which all
rights of the holders of said shares, as unsecured creditors or otherwise, shall
cease) for an amount  equivalent to the amount deposited as above states for the
redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Corporation but shall in no event
be entitled to any interest.

         (d)  Subject  to and  upon  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this
paragraph (d), each share of 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock may, at
the option of the holder thereof and at any time so long as the conversion right
shall  continue in effect as herein  provided,  be converted  into as many fully
paid and  non-assessable  whole  shares of Common  Stock of the  Corporation  as
result from  dividing the par value of the 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred
Stock so being converted by the conversion  price,  which shall be Eight Dollars
($8.00)  per  share  unless  such  price  has  been   adjusted  as  provided  in
subdivisions  A or B of this  paragraph  (d), in which case such adjusted  price
shall be the conversion price. The conversion right herein provided shall, as to
any share of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  continue  in effect
unless (and until such share shall be called for  redemption,  and in such case,
shall  continue  in effect  until) and  including,  but not after,  the close of
business on the seventh  calendar day preceding the redemption date which may be
specified in the notice of redemption issued with respect to such share.

         In order to exercise the conversion privilege, any holder of a share or
shares  shall  continue  in  effect  as  hereinabove  provided,   surrender  the
certificate for such share or shares of the 5% Cumulative  Convertible Preferred
Stock so to be converted,  duly endorsed for transfer, to the Corporation at its
home  office or any  place or places  where the  Corporation  shall  maintain  a
transfer agency,  together with written notice that the holder elects to convert
the  shares  represented  by  such  certificate.   As  promptly  as  practicable
thereafter, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder a certificate
or  certificates  for the number of whole shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon
such  conversion,  together  with  payment of accrued  dividends  to the date of
conversion.  The Corporation  shall not be required to issue fractions of shares
of Common  Stock upon  conversion  of the 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred
Stock,  but if any  fractional  interest  in a share of  Common  Stock  shall be
deliverable upon such conversion, the Corporation shall purchase such fractional
interest for an amount in cash equal to the product  obtained by multiplying the
conversion  price by such fraction.  The conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected on the date on which the


<PAGE>



certificate  for 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  shall  have been
surrendered  and  written  notice of the  election  to  convert  shall have been
received by the Corporation as aforesaid and the person or persons in whose name
or names any certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have become, at such
time, a holder or holders of record of the shares represented thereby.

         A. In case  the  Corporation  shall  at any  time or from  time to time
hereafter  issue or sell any shares of its Common  Stock  (except as provided in
clause (6) of this  subdivision A) for a  consideration  per share less than any
conversion price in effect  immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale,
then  forthwith  upon such issue or sale,  said  conversion  price shall  (until
another such issue or sale) be reduced to a price determined by dividing:

         (i) an  amount  equal to the sum of (a) the  number of shares of Common
         Stock outstanding  immediately prior to such issue or sale,  multiplied
         by the then existing  conversion price, and (b) the  consideration,  if
         any, received by the Corporation upon such issue or sale, by

         (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
         after such issue or sale;

provided,  however,  that no  adjustment  shall  be made if the  amount  of such
adjustment shall be less than 10 cents per share.

         For the purposes of any  computation to be made in accordance  with the
provisions of this subdivision A, the following provisions shall be applicable:

         (1) In case of the  issuance of  additional  shares of Common Stock for
cash, the consideration  received by the Corporation therefor shall be deemed to
be the  amount  of cash  received  by the  Corporation  for such  shares,  after
deducting  any all  commissions  and  other  expenses  paid or  incurred  by the
Corporation  for any  underwriting  of, or otherwise  in  connection  with,  the
issuance of such shares.

         (2) In case of the issuance (otherwise than upon conversion or exchange
of obligations or shares of stock of the  Corporation)  of additional  shares of
Common Stock for a  consideration  other than cash or a  consideration a part of
which shall be other than cash, the amount of the consideration  other than cash
received by the  Corporation  for such shares shall be deemed to be the value of
such  consideration as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

         (3) In the case of the  issuance of any rights to  subscribe  for or to
purchase,  or of any options for the  purchase of,  additional  shares of Common
Stock at a price per share for the  additional  shares of Common Stock  issuable
upon the  exercise  of such rights or options  less than the current  conversion
price in effect  immediately  prior to the  issuance  of such rights or options,
then the  issuance of such  rights or options  shall be deemed to be an issuance
(as of the date of issuance  of such  rights or  options)  of the total  maximum
number of shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon the exercise of all such rights
or options.  In such case, any amount  received or receivable by the Corporation
in  consideration  of the  issuance of such rights or options  (plus the minimum
aggregate  amount  of  premium  or  additional   consideration  payable  to  the
Corporation  upon the  exercise  of such  rights  or  options)  after  deducting
therefrom any  commissions or other expenses paid or incurred by the Corporation
for any  underwriting  of, or otherwise in connection with, the issuance of such
rights or options, shall be deemed to be the consideration actually received (as
of the date of  issuance of such  rights or  options)  for the  issuance of such
additional shares of Common Stock.



<PAGE>



         (4) In case of the  issuance  of any  obligations  or of any  shares of
stock of the  Corporation  that shall be convertible  into or  exchangeable  for
shares of Common Stock, then the issuance of such obligations or shares shall be
deemed to be an  issuance  (as of the date of issuance  of such  obligations  or
shares)  of the total  maximum  number  of  additional  shares  of Common  Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such  obligations or shares.  In
such case, any amount received or receivable by the Corporation in consideration
of the issuance of such  obligations or shares  convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common  Stock  (plus the  minimum  aggregate  amount of premium or
additional  consideration  payable to the  Corporation  upon the  conversion  or
exchange  of  such   obligations  or  shares)  after  deducting   therefrom  any
commissions  or other  expenses  paid or  incurred  by the  Corporation  for any
underwriting  of,  or  otherwise  in  connection  with,  the  issuance  of  such
obligations or shares, shall be deemed to be the consideration actually received
(as of the date of issuance of such additional shares of Common Stock.

         (5) In case of the issuance of  additional  shares of Common Stock as a
dividend,  the  aggregate  number of shares of Common Stock issued in payment of
such dividend  shall be deemed to have been issued and to be  outstanding on the
day next  succeeding  the  record  date for the  determination  of  stockholders
entitled  to such  dividend  and shall be deemed  to have  been  issued  without
consideration.

         (6) The number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding  shall
include  any shares of Common  Stock then owned or held by or for the account of
the Company.

         (7) No adjustment of the  conversion  price shall be made in connection
with the issuance of shares of 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock or in
connection  with the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon  conversion  of any
shares of 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.

         B. In case the  Corporation  shall at any time subdivide or combine the
outstanding   shares  of  Common   Stock,   each   conversion   price  shall  be
proportionately decreased in the case of subdivision or increased in the case of
combination,  effective at the close of business on the date of such subdivision
or combination.

         In case of any  reclassification  or  change of  outstanding  shares of
Common  Stock  (other  than a change in par  value,  or from par value to no par
value,  or from no par value to par value,  or as a result of a  subdivision  or
combination), or in case of any consolidation of the Corporation with, or merger
of the Corporation into, another  corporation (other than a consolidation with a
subsidiary in which consolidation the Corporation is the continuing  corporation
and which  does not  result  in any  reclassification  or change of  outstanding
shares of the Common  Stock),  or in case of any sale or  conveyance  to another
corporation of the property of the  Corporation as an entirety or  substantially
as an entirety,  the holders of the 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock
shall have the right to convert the 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock
into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other  securities  and  property
receivable upon such reclassification,  change,  consolidation,  merger, sale or
conveyance by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which the 5%
Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock might have been converted  immediately
prior  to  such  reclassification,   change,  consolidation,   merger,  sale  or
conveyance.

         If, in any case, the terms and conditions set forth in  subparagraphs A
or B of this paragraph (d) of ARTICLE FIFTH are for any reason not  specifically
applicable to any state of facts which shall in fact arise, the conversion price
shall be adjusted by the Board of Directors in its discretion so as to carry out
as nearly as practicable the purposes and objectives of the provisions as herein
set forth and any such  determination by the Board of Directors shall be binding
for the purposes  hereof on all persons  claiming rights as holders of shares of
Preferred Stock.



<PAGE>



         Whenever  a  conversion  price is  adjusted  as  herein  provided,  the
Corporation shall mail to the holders of the 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock a certificate  signed by or bearing the facsimile  signature of an officer
of the Corporation showing the new conversion price and the computation thereof.

         (e) The Corporation may purchase to the extent permitted by law, in the
open market, or otherwise,  for such consideration as its Board of Directors may
deem adequate,  any shares of its 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock or
any shares of its Common Stock.

         (f) Each holder of record of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote
for each share of stock  standing  in his name on the books of the  Corporation.
Except as  hereinafter  stated,  or as may be  otherwise  provided  by law,  the
holders of the 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock shall not be entitled
to vote at any  meeting  of  stockholders  or  election  of the  Corporation  or
otherwise  to  participate  in  any  action  taken  by  the  Corporation  or the
stockholders  thereof.  In any  instance  where  the  holders  of 5%  Cumulative
Convertible  Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to vote as  hereinafter  stated,
each  holder of record of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock shall be
entitled  to one vote for each share of stock  standing in his name on the books
of the Corporation.

         (g) Upon the vote of a majority of all the Directors of the Corporation
and of the holders of a majority  of the total  number of shares then issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, the Corporation may from time to time increase
or decrease the amount of the  authorized  5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred
Stock or Common Stock or both; provided,  however, that the authorized number of
shares of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock shall not be  increased,
unless the  stockholders  voting  therefor shall include the holders of not less
than  two-thirds  of the total  number of  shares of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding.

         Upon the vote of a majority of all the Directors of the Corporation and
of the  holders  of a majority  of the total  number of shares  then  issued and
outstanding  and entitled to vote, the  Corporation may from time to time create
or authorize one or more other classes of stock, any or all of which classes may
be stock with par value or stock without par value with such voting powers, full
or limited,  or without voting powers, and with such  designations,  preferences
and   relative,   participating,   optional   or  other   special   rights   and
qualifications,  limitations or restrictions as shall be determined by said vote
which  may be the  same  or  different  from  the  voting  powers,  designation,
preferences  and relative,  participating,  optional or other special rights and
qualifications,  limitations  or  restrictions  of the  classes  of stock of the
Corporation then authorized, provided, however, that no new class of stock shall
hereafter be created which is entitled to dividends or shares in distribution of
assets  on a  parity  with  or in  priority  to  the 5%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred  Stock unless either (1) the  stockholders  voting for the creation of
such new class of stock shall include the holders of not less than two-thirds of
the  number of shares of the 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  then
outstanding,  or (2) the  holders of not less than  two-thirds  of the number of
shares of 5%  Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock then  outstanding  shall
consent thereto in writing.

Neither the amounts which the holders of the 5% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock are  entitled  to receive as  dividends  or in  distribution  of assets in
preference  to the  holders of the Common  Stock,  nor the price at which the 5%
Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock may be redeemed shall be decreased nor
may the  conversion  privileges of the holder of the 5%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred Stock be adversely modified, unless the holders of at least 90% of the
number of shares of 5% Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred Stock then outstanding
consent in writing to or vote for such decrease.

         (h) The term "accrued dividends" shall be deemed  to mean in respect of
any share of the 5%


<PAGE>



Cumulative  Convertible  Preferred  Stock, as of any given date, the amount,  if
any, by which the product of the rate of the full dividend per annum  multiplied
by the  number of years  and any  fractional  part of a year  which  shall  have
elapsed from the date after which  dividends on such stock became  cumulative to
such given date,  exceeds the sum of the total  dividends  actually paid on such
stock  and  dividends  declared  and set  apart for  payment.  Accumulations  of
dividends shall not bear interest.

         (i) No holder of any stock of the  Corporation  shall be entitled as of
right to  purchase  or  subscribe  for any part of any stock of the  Corporation
previously  authorized by this  certificate  or of any  additional  stock of any
class to be  issued by reason of any  increase  of the  authorized  stock of the
Corporation or of any bonds,  certificates of indebtedness,  debentures or other
securities  convertible into stock of the Corporation,  but any stock previously
authorized or authorized by this certificate,  or any such additional authorized
issue of new stock or of  securities  convertible  into  stock may be issued and
disposed of by the Board of Directors to such persons,  firms,  corporations  or
associations  for such  consideration  and upon such terms and in such manner as
the Board of Directors  may in its  discretion  determine  without  offering any
thereof on the same terms or on any terms to the stockholders  then of record or
to any class of stockholders.

         The undersigned  corporation,  for the purpose of amending its Articles
of  Incorporation  and pursuant to the  provisions  of Chapter 55 of the General

         The undersigned  corporation,  for the purpose of amending its Articles

                                       OF
                            WELLCO ENTERPRISES, INC.

         The undersigned  corporation,  for the purpose of amending its Articles
of  Incorporation  (as stated in June 29, 1946  Agreement  of Merger with Wellco
Sales Company, Inc.) and pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 55 of the General
Statutes of North  Carolina,  and  particularly  pursuant to the  provisions  of
Section 55-103 thereof,  hereby executes the following  Articles of Amendment to
its Charter  heretofore  filed in the Office of the  Secretary of State of North
Carolina.

         1.  The name of the corporation is WELLCO ENTERPRISES, INC.

         2. The  following  amendments  to the charter of the  corporation  were
adopted  by  its  stockholders  at  the  annual  stockholders  meeting  of  said
corporation held on the 16th day of November,  1976, in the manner prescribed by
law:

         "RESOLVED,  that the present  'Article  Ninth' of the Charter of Wellco
         Enterprises, Inc., be deleted in its entirety and a new 'Article Ninth'
         provided as follows:

         Article Ninth: The property and business of this  corporation  shall be
         managed by its Board of Directors.  The number of Directors which shall
         constitute the whole Board shall be nine,  divided and classified  into
         three Classes,  to be designated,  respectively,  Class I, Class II and
         Class III, each Class to consist of three Directors. At the 1976 annual
         meeting of stockholders, all of the Directors shall be elected; Class I
         for a term to expire at the 1977 annual meeting of stockholders;  Class
         II for a term to expire at the 1978  annual  meeting  of  stockholders;
         Class  III for a new term to  expire  at the  1979  annual  meeting  of
         stockholders;  and in the case of each Class,  until  their  respective
         successors are duly elected and qualified,  or until their resignation,
         death, or removal by stockholders  for cause. At each annual meeting of
         stockholders commencing in 1977, directors shall be elected to fill any
         vacancies  then existing and to succeed those whose terms have expired,
         and the  directors so elected  shall be identified as being of the same
         class as the directors they succeed and shall be elected to hold office
         for the term of the class to which  each is  elected,  and until  their
         respective  successors are duly elected and  qualified,  or until their
         resignation,  death,  or removal  by  stockholders  for  cause.  If any
         vacancy  shall occur in the Board of  Directors by reason of the death,
         resignation, or disqualification as by law provided, the directors then
         in office,  although less than a quorum,  may by majority vote fill any
         such  vacancy,  and any  director so chosen shall hold office until the
         next annual meeting of the  stockholders  and until his successor shall
         be duly elected and qualified;  provided, however, that if in the event
         of any such vacancy, the directors remaining in office shall be unable,
         by majority  vote,  to fill such vacancy  within thirty (30) days after
         the  occurrence  thereof,  the  President or the  Secretary  may call a
         special  meeting of the  stockholders  at which such  vacancy  shall be
         filled. Any Director elected by stockholders may be removed from office
         as a Director at any time, but only for cause, by the affirmative  vote
         of stockholders of record holding a majority of the outstanding  shares
         of stock of the corporation  entitled to vote in elections of Directors
         given at a meeting of stockholders duly called for that purpose.

         AND FURTHER  RESOLVED,  that the present 'Article Tenth' of the Charter
         of Wellco  Enterprises,  Inc.,  be  deleted in its  entirety  and a new
         'Article  Tenth' be  substituted  in lieu  thereof,  said new  'Article
         Tenth' providing as follows:



<PAGE>



         Article Tenth:  This  corporation  reserves the right to amend,  alter,
         change,  or  repeal  any  provision  contained  in  this  corporation's
         Articles of  Incorporation  in effect from time to time,  in the manner
         new or hereafter  prescribed by statute,  and all rights conferred upon
         stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation;  provided,
         however,  that the  foregoing  Article Ninth may be amended only by the
         affirmative  vote of stockholders  of record holding  two-thirds of the
         outstanding  shares of stock of this corporation  entitled to vote upon
         such amendment given at a meeting of stockholders  duly called for that
         purpose  and  no  amendment  to  this  Article  Tenth   modifying  such
         requirement may be adopted except upon the same affirmative vote."

         3. The  number  of  shares  of the  corporation  outstanding  as of the
October 1, 1976 record  date for said  meeting  was  418,903,  all of which were
entitled to vote upon said amendments.

         4. The  number of  shares  represented  at the  meeting  at which  said
amendments  were  approved  was  338,201;  the  number of shares  voted for said
amendments was 274,782;  the number of shares voted against said  amendments was
46,210;  the number of shares withholding vote with reference to said amendments
was 17,209.

         5.  The amendments herein effected do not result in any change  in  the
stated capital of the corporation.

         6. The  amendments  herein  effected  do not give  rise to  dissenter's
rights to payment for the reason that the only effect of such  amendments  is to
increase the composition of the Board of Directors and related matters.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  these  articles are signed by the  President  and
Secretary of the corporation this 16th day of November, 1976.

                                                        WELLCO ENTERPRISES, INC.

law:

         "RESOLVED, that the Charter of Wellco Enterprises, Inc.  be  amended by
         adding a new Article Fourteenth thereof, said  new  Article  Fourteenth
         providing as follows:

         ARTICLE FOURTEENTH:  No director of the Corporation shall be personally
         liable  arising  out of an  action  whether  by or in the  right of the
         Corporation or otherwise, for monetary damages for breach of his duties
         as a director;  provided,  however,  that this Article Fourteenth shall
         not be effective with respect to (i) acts or omissions not made in good
         faith that the  director  at the time of such  breach  knew or believed
         were in conflict with the best interests of the  Corporation,  (ii) any
         liability  under  Section  55-32  of  the  General  Statutes  of  North
         Carolina,  (iii) any  transaction  from which the  director  derived an
         improper personal benefit, or (iv) acts or omissions occurring prior to
         the effective date of this charter amendment.  As used herein, the term
         'improper personal benefit' does not include a director's  compensation
         or other  incidental  benefits  for or on account of his  services as a
         director,  officer,  employee,  independent  contractor,   attorney  or

rights to payment for the reason that the only effect of  said  Amendment  is to
limit certain liabilities of members of the Board  of  Directors  and  does  not
relate to those matters enumerated in N.C.G.S. Sec. 55-101(b).

until his successor shall be duly elected and qualified; provided, however, that
if in the event of any such vacancy,  the directors remaining in office shall be
unable, by majority vote, to fill such vacancy within thirty (30) days after the
occurrence thereof, the president or the secretary may call a special meeting of
the shareholders at which such vacancy shall be filled.

         39. Any director  elected by stockholders may be removed from office as
a  director  at any  time,  but  only  for  cause,  by the  affirmative  vote of

         40. It is the policy of the corporation  that its officers,  directors,
employees and agents be and hereby are  indemnified by the  corporation  against
liability and litigation expense,  including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising
out of  their  status  as  such  or  their  activities  in any of the  foregoing
capacities  except in the case of an individual who undertakes or has undertaken
activities which are at the time taken known or believed by him to be clearly in
conflict with the best interest of the corporation.

         The corporation shall also indemnify to the same extent any person who,
at the request of the  corporation,  is or was  serving as a director,  officer,
employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or
other enterprise or as a trustee or administrator of the corporation's  employee
benefit plan.

         Pursuant  to  the  policy  of   indemnification   described  above,  an
individual so entitled  pursuant to said policy may recover from the corporation
reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys' fees in connection with enforcement of
such rights.

         Pursuant to N.C.G.S.  Section 55-20,  when by reason of the fact that a
person  is or was  serving  as  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  of the
corporation  or in any such  capacity at the request of the  corporation  in any
other corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or plan, any person is or
was a  party  uproot  or is  threatened  to be  made a  party  to any  criminal,
administrative or  investigative,  not brought by the corporation nor brought by
any party  seeking  derivatively  to  enforce a  liability  of such a person the
corporation  for any expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees, or any  liabilities
which he may have incurred in  consequence  of such action,  suit or proceeding,
under the following conditions:

         1. If such  person  is  wholly  successful  in his  defense,  or if the
proceeding  is an  administrative  or  investigative  proceeding  which does not
result in the indictment,  fine or penalty of such person, he shall b e entitled
to reimbursement from the corporation of all his reasonable  expenses of defense
or participation, including attorneys' fees.

         2. If such person is not wholly  successful or is  unsuccessful  in his
defense,  or the  proceeding to which he is a party  results in his  indictment,
fine or  penalty,  the  corporation  shall  pay  such  expenses  of  defense  or
participation,  including attorneys' fees, and the amount of any judgment, money
decreed, fine, penalty or settlement for which he may have become liable, if

         a. A plan for such  payment is approved by a consent in writing  signed
by the  holders  of all  shares  entitled  to vote  or such  plan is sent to the
holders of all shares entitled to vote, with notice of a shareholders'  meeting,
whether  annual or  special,  to be held to take  action  thereon and if at such
meeting plan is approved by the holders of a majority of such shares,  exclusive
of the shares held  directly or indirectly by any persons to be benefited by the
plan if approved, or

         b. A majority of a quorum  consisting  of directors who are not parties
to such action,  suit or proceeding  shall  determine  that such person acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonable believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the  corporation,  and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, and the
corporation  shall,  not later than 60 days before any such payment or agreement
to pay is made,  send to all  shareholders  of record on a record  date not more
than 10 days prior to the date of  mailing,  at their  registered  addresses,  a
statement  specifying  the persons to be paid,  the amounts to be paid,  and the
nature and status of the suit or proceedings at the time of mailing, or

         c. In a proceeding brought by such person for such determination in the
superior court of the district where the corporation  has its  registered office
it shall be determined that such person acted


<PAGE>



on good faith and in a manner he reasonable  believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation,  and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding,  had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  In
such a  proceedings,  the court in its discretion may order notice thereof to be
sent to the  shareholders  of the corporation in such manner and in such form as
it may deem appropriate, at the expense of the corporation; and it may allow all
shareholders  so  notified  to be  heard  in  opposition  to  the  determination
requested.

         The termination of any action,  suit or proceeding by judgment,  order,
settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of nolo  contendere or its  equivalent,
shall not, of itself,  create a presumption  that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably  believed to be in the best  interests
of the corporation,  and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

         Pursuant to N.C.G.S.  Section 55-21, when a present or former director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation or any person who has served or is
serving  in  such  capacity  at the  request  of the  corporation  in any  other
corporation,  partnership,  joint venture,  trust or other enterprise,  is sued,
alone or with others, in the courts of North Carolina,  in any action seeking to
establish  his  liability  to  the  corporation   arising  out  of  his  alleged
dereliction  of duty to the  corporation,  he  shall  in  turn  be  entitled  to
indemnification  or  reimbursement  from  the  corporation  for so  much  of his
expenses of defense,  including attorneys' fees, as the court in its discretion,
upon motion for  indemnification  or  reimbursement,  duly made in such  action,
finds to be reasonable, if;

         (1) Such person is successful in whole or in part in the action against
him or in any settlement thereof and the court finds that his conduct fairly and
equitable merits such relief; or

         (2) The court finds,  despite his adjudication of liability,  that such
person  has  acted  honestly  and  reasonable  an  that,  in  view  of  all  the
circumstances of the case, his conduct fairly and equitably merits such relief.

         When such action is brought in another state and the result  thereof is
such as would have entitled the  defendant  officer or director to make a motion
in the cause for  indemnification or reimbursement of his expenses of defense if
the action had been brought in North  Carolina,  but no such relief is available
in the state in which the action is actually  brought,  the defendant officer or
director may bring a separate  action against the  corporation in North Carolina
for such  indemnification  or  reimbursement  as he might have recovered had the
suit  against  him been  brought in North  Carolina.  Notice of said  action for
indemnification  or  reimbursement  shall be sent, in such form as the court may
approve and at the corporation's  expense,  to the party or parties plaintiff in
the prior action who shall be entitled to be heard.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  policy,  the  corporation  will  first
endeavor to avail itself of the proceeds,  cost of defense or other  benefits of
any insurance  policies  insuring the corporation or any individual  entitled to
indemnification  under  the  foregoing  policy  before  expending  funds  of the
corporation pursuant to the foregoing policy.



                       DUTIES OF OFFICERS MAY BE DELEGATED

         41. In case of the  absence of any officer of the  corporation,  or for
any other reason that the board may deem sufficient, the board may delegate, for
the time  being,  the  powers or duties or any of them,  of such  officer to any
other officer, or to any director.

the date for the  allotment or rights or the date when any change or  conversion
or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect;  provided,  however,  that in
lieu of closing the stock  transfer  books as aforesaid,  the board of directors
may fix in advance a date,  not exceeding  fifty days  preceding the date of any
meeting of stockholders or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date
for the  allotment  of  rights  or the date when any  change  or  conversion  or
exchange  of  capital  stock  shall go into  effect,  as a  record  date for the
determination  of the  stockholders  entitled  to notice of, and to vote at, any
such meeting,  or entitled to receive  payment of any such  dividend,  or to any
such  allotment  of  rights,  or to  exercise  the rights in respect of any such
change,  conversion,  or  exchange  of  capital  stock,  and in such  case  such
stockholders,  and only such  stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on
the date so fixed,  shall be  entitled  to such  notice of, and to vote at, such
meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of
rights,  or to exercise  such rights,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any
transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date
fixed as aforesaid.


                             REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS

or his legal  representative,  to give the  corporation  a bond,  sufficient  to
indemnify  the  corporation  against  any claim  that may be made  against it on
account of the alleged loss of any such  certificate.  A new  certificate of the
same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one


<PAGE>



alleged to be lost or destroyed may be issued without  requiring any bond, when,
in the judgment of the directors, it is proper so to do.
