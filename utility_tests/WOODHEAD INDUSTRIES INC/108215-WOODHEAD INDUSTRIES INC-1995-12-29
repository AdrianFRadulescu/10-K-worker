                                 PART I
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Woodhead Industries, Inc. was incorporated in Illinois in 1922 and
reincorporated in Delaware in 1978.  The corporation and its subsidiaries are
primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of devices for the control and
distribution of electrical power for industry.

    There were no material changes in the manner in which the Company
conducted its business during fiscal 1995.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     The Company consists of one business segment which can best be described
as specialty power and signaling devices.  That segment accounted for 99% of
the sales and 97% of the earnings in 1995 and during the past five years has
averaged 98% of sales and 96% of earnings.  Molded rubber products, an
immaterial business segment and therefore not reported separately, accounted
for the  remainder of the sales and earnings.

PRODUCTS

     The Company's products are designed for and used primarily in industrial
applications for the distribution of power, for signaling and for motion
control.  They can be classified into three groups: electrical specialties,
reels and power systems, and molded rubber products.  The electrical
specialty  product classification includes, among other items, portable
handlamps, low-voltage safety lights, wiring devices, weatherproof
receptacles, circuit testers, portable power distribution equipment, pendant
push-button enclosures, general-purpose power and control connectors, and
custom copper and fiber optic cable assemblies.  Reels and power systems
include such products as electric cord and cable reels, electric cable
festooning systems, collector rings, static discharge reels, tool balancers,
ergonomic workstations, hose reels, and multiple-cable carrier systems.

     There is widespread applicability for the Company's products throughout
a broad range of industries such as petro-chemical, automotive, steel,
airline, chemical, food processing, utility, communications, mining, heavy
construction, health care, and recreation.  A majority of the products are
used in plant maintenance and production with the balance becoming a
component part of another product.

                            PART I - CONT'D.

      The percent of sales and income for the three product classifications
over the past five years is as follows:

DISTRIBUTION

     All of the Company's products are of heavy-duty, industrial grade. These
products are sold directly to users, to original equipment manufacturers, and
through selected distributors, mainly in the United States, Canada and Europe
with some sales going to other parts of the world.  These distributors are
serviced by manufacturers' agencies whose sales personnel solicit sales for
the Company's products and promote them to the ultimate users.  These
agencies also represent other manufacturers whose lines, in general, are
complementary to the Company's products.

AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

     Parts and materials for the Company's products are readily available
from a variety of suppliers.  It has been a practice to develop and use more
than one source of supply for any item considered critical.

PATENTS/TRADEMARKS/LICENSING

     On certain of its products, the Company holds patents, trademarks, and
licensing arrangements which, while valuable, are not considered essential to
the maintenance or future growth of the business.

SEASONALITY

     The business is not considered to be seasonal.

INVENTORIES

     Products of the type manufactured and sold by the Company are also
available through other manufacturers as well.  As a result, delivery time as
well as quality and customer service are important to the success of the
business and therefore require that sufficient inventories be maintained to
insure fast turnaround time on orders.

CUSTOMER PROFILE

     The Company's sales are broad-based with no single customer accounting
for a significant portion of total sales and no single industry accounting
for a majority of its business.

BACKLOG

     On November 25, 1995, there were unshipped orders totalling
approximately $8.7 million.  Last year's backlog at approximately the same
date was $8.7 million.

                             PART I - CONT'D.
COMPETITION

     Products similar to those sold by the Company are manufactured and sold
by other companies as well, resulting in a very competitive environment.
However, the Company feels its ability to manufacture high quality products
that serve specialized needs of industry through its highly efficient
distribution channels differentiates the Company from its competitors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     For the years ended September 30, 1995, October 1, 1994, and October 2,
1993, the Company expended approximately $2,404,000, $2,148,000,  and
$2,105,000, respectively, on the development of new products and the
improvement of existing products.  These expenditures included the
compensation of engineers, designers, and drafters who were engaged in
product development.

EMPLOYEES

     The company has approximately 1,126 full-time employees.

FOREIGN AND EXPORT BUSINESS

     See footnote 8, page 31 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the
year ended September 30, 1995 which is incorporated herein by reference and
filed as an exhibit to this report.

ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

     The Company owns facilities in the following locations:

                             Land Owned            Plant Floor Area
    Northbrook, Illinois      4.7 acres             119,000 sq. ft.
    Kalamazoo, Michigan      39.1 acres             116,000 sq. ft.
    Franklin, Massachusetts   6.6 acres              60,000 sq. ft.
    El Paso, Texas            5.0 acres              50,000 sq. ft.
    Belvidere, Illinois       3.5 acres              36,000 sq. ft.
    Juarez, Mexico             .8 acres              36,000 sq. ft.
    Netherlands               1.3 acres              30,000 sq. ft.
    Wales, U.K.               4.5 acres              25,000 sq. ft.
    Uxbridge, Massachusetts   3.5 acres              20,000 sq. ft.


     All of the above properties are owned in fee except the land in Wales,
U.K. which is held under a lease expiring in 2105.

     The Company also leases approximately 20,000 square feet in Ontario,
Canada; 20,000 square feet in Remchingen, Germany; 9,000 square feet in Grand
Rapids, Michigan; 7,000 square feet in Buffalo Grove, Illinois; 3,400 square
feet in Thorigny sur Marne, France; and 2,000 square feet in Singapore.  All
plants are considered to be well-equipped and well-maintained.  They are of
masonry or steel construction.  In the judgment of management, sufficient
capacity is available at the above locations to cover the Company's needs at
least through fiscal 1996.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to federal and state hazardous substance cleanup laws
that impose liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting
from past spills, disposal or other releases of hazardous substances.  In
this regard, the  Company has incurred, and expects to incur, assessment,
remediation and related costs at one of the Company's facilities.  In 1991,
the Company reported to state regulators a release at that site from an
underground storage tank ("UST"),  The UST and certain contaminated soil
subsequently were removed and disposed of at an off-site disposal facility.
The Company's independent environmental consultant has been conducting an
investigation of soil and groundwater at the site with oversight by the state
Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ").  The investigation indicates
that additional soil and groundwater at the site have been impaired by
chlorinated solvents, including tetrachloroethane and trichloroethylene.
Also, the company learned that a portion of the site had been used as a
disposal area by the previous owners of the site.  The Company's consultant
is investigating and has begun to remediate this area and believes that it is
an additional likely source of contamination of soil and groundwater.  In
addition, the investigation of the site indicates that the groundwater
contaminants may have migrated off-site.  However, the extent of the
contamination has not been fully delineated at this time.  The Company is
conducting additional investigations to determine the extent of contamination
at and around the site and to determine the extent of other sources of
contamination in addition to the removed UST and the above-referenced
disposal area, including the possible presence of ongoing dumping activities
by others in the vicinity around the Company's facilities.

The Company's consultant has estimated that a minimum of $1.5 million of
investigation and remediation expenses will be incurred at the site. The
Company has a reserve for such purposes and has notified the previous owners
of the site and various insurers of possible claims by the Company relating
to the remediation of the site.  The consultant's cost estimate was based on
a review of currently available data, which is limited, and assumptions
concerning the extent of contamination, geological conditions, and the costs
and effectiveness of certain treatment technologies.  The cost estimate is
subject to substantial uncertainty until the extent of contamination and
geological conditions are fully understood, feasible remedial alternatives
are assessed, and the DEQ approves a remediation plan.  The Company is
continuing to investigate the environmental conditions at the site and will
adjust its reserve if necessary.  The Company may incur significant
additional assessment, remediation and related costs at the site, and such
costs could materially and adversely affect the Company's consolidated net
income for the period in which such costs are incurred.  The Company,
however, cannot estimate the time or potential magnitude of such costs at
this time.


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of the security holders
either through solicitation of proxies or otherwise during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCK MATTERS

    (a)  The Company's common stock trades on the NASDAQ stock market
         under the symbol WDHD.  The daily quotations as reported by
         NASDAQ are published in the Wall Street Journal and other
         leading financial publications.

         On April 26, 1995, the board of directors declared a three-for-
         two stock split effected in the form of a 50% common stock dividend,
         payable May 22, 1995, to holders of record on May 8, 1995.  On
         January 22, 1993, the board of directors declared a two-for-one stock
         split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, payable March 1,
         1993, to holders of record on February 12, 1993. All share and per
         share amounts in this filing have been adjusted to give retroactive
         effect to these stock splits.

         Common Stock Purchase Rights have been distributed to stockholders and
         deemed to be attached to the shares of Common Stock of the Registrant.
         If and when the rights become exercisable, the holders initially would
         be entitled to purchase one share of Common Stock at a purchase price
         of $13.33 (both the number of shares and the purchase price are
         subject to adjustment). See footnote 5, page 29 of the Annual Report to
         Stockholders for the year ended September 30, 1995, for further
         explanation.   This footnote is incorporated herein by reference and
         filed as an exhibit to this report.

                     ON SCHEDULES AND SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES



To Woodhead Industries, Inc.:


We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements of Woodhead Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries included in the Woodhead Industries, Inc. Annual Report to
Stockholders for the year ended September 30, 1995 incorporated by reference
in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated November 14,
1995.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
statements taken as a whole.  The schedules and supplementary notes included
on pages 11 through 12 of this Form 10-K are presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not
part of the basic financial statements.  These schedules and notes have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                   INDEMNIFICATION UNDERTAKING

 For the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Act"), the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which
undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into registrant's Registration
Statement on Form S-8 No. 33-40414 (filed May 6, 1991):

 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In
the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other
than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issue.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Woodhead Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WOODHEAD
INDUSTRIES, INC. (a Delaware corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of September
30, 1995, October 1, 1994, and October 2, 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' investment, and cash flows for the years
then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of WOODHEAD INDUSTRIES, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES as of September 30, 1995, October 1, 1994, and October 2,
1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

FISCAL 1995 RESULTS COMPARED WITH 1994
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SALES

Fiscal 1995 sales of $120.0 million were 13.5% ahead of the $105.7 million
reported for 1994.  International sales accounted for 54.7% of this year's
sales increase and were equal to 27.1% of total sales.  The higher unit
volumes in Asia, Canada and Europe were augmented by a weak U.S. dollar.
Strong domestic sales reflect improvements in core product lines, including
connectors and workstation products.  Price increases during the year netted
less than 1%.

The backlog of unfilled orders was $7.9 million at year end compared with
$8.0 million at the close of fiscal 1994.

GROSS PROFIT
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gross Profit of $52.5 million was $5.9 million or 12.5% greater than in 1994.
The reduced rate of 43.7% versus 44.1% in 1994 was due to strong
international price pressures which held price increases to a minimum.  In
fiscal 1995, inflationary increases in the cost of sales were somewhat offset
by the benefit of a devaluation in the Mexican peso which occurred during the
year.  The Company continued to invest in its manufacturing processes to
reduce costs and improve productivity.

OPERATING EXPENSES
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating expenses for 1995 totaled $35.3 million, representing an 8.3%
increase over the 1994 total of $32.6 million.  The increase was driven by
the Company's continued investment in new product development and marketing
programs. Overall, operating expenses declined as a percent of net sales to
29.4% from 30.8% in 1994 primarily due to limited increases in administrative
expenses.

OTHER EXPENSE/INCOME
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other expenses increased $.3 million to $2.8 million in fiscal 1995.  During
1995 the Company increased its reserve for litigation, environmental and
other contingencies.  For additional information regarding the environmental
matter, see footnote #6 concerning Contingent Liabilities.

NET INCOME
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net income increased $2.0 million to $9.2 million in 1995.  The earnings
improvement was achieved by leveraging sales increases with controlled
overhead spending and administrative expenses.  The Company's effective tax
rate also declined from 37.1% in 1994 to 35.7% in 1995 primarily due to
utilization of foreign tax credits.

FINANCIAL POSITION
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working capital increased to $19.7 million at the close of 1995 representing
an increase of $5.1 million over the 1994 year end level.  The current ratio
also increased slightly to 1.9/1 in 1995 from 1.8/1 in 1994.  The Company's
$15 million revolving credit line was unused at year end.  Looking forward,
projected cash flow is expected to exceed the operating requirements of the
Company in fiscal year 1996.

                                    Woodhead Industries Inc. 1995 Annual Report

FISCAL 1994 RESULTS COMPARED WITH 1993
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company's sales of $105.7 million exceeded fiscal 1993 results by $15.8
million or 17.6%.  The full year results of prior year acquisitions coupled
with increased unit demand worldwide drove the improvement.  International
sales increases were recorded at all subsidiaries with significant
improvements coming from Asia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Strong
domestic sales were supported through gains in the Company's core electrical
specialty products.  Price increases during the year netted slightly less
than 2%.

The backlog of unfilled orders grew 27% over the prior year and ended fiscal
1994 at $8.0 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gain in gross profit amounted to $7.0 million and was primarily due to
the higher level of sales.  Although price increases were limited, the
Company continued to invest in tooling and product redesigns which increased
manufacturing productivity and generated cost reductions.  These investments
allowed the Company to maintain its gross profit rate at 44.1% for fiscal
1994.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a percent of net sales, operating expenses fell to 30.8% from 32.7% in
1993. Operating expenses of $32.6 million in fiscal 1994 were $3.2 million or
10.9% ahead of the prior year.  Increased spending resulted mainly from the
first full year of expenses incurred by companies acquired in the prior year,
as well as higher levels of commissions due to increased volume.  Also, in
1994 the Company continued to invest in engineering for new products as well
as in efforts to achieve ISO 9000 certification.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other expenses increased to $2.5 million in fiscal 1994 from $.7 million in
1993.  The increase in 1994 was primarily attributable to two charges, one
for $.6 million to effect the reorganization and combination of the Company's
Advanced Interconnect, Inc. and FOCS subsidiaries.  In addition, the Company
took a $.9 million charge pertaining to an ongoing assessment and remediation
of an environmental matter at one of its subsidiaries.  For additional
information regarding the environmental matter, see #6 concerning Contingent
Liabilities.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net income of $7.3 million was 24.9% greater than 1993 primarily due to the
increase in sales volume coupled with a lower rate of spending in operating
expenses.  The total effect of these improvements was offset in part by the
charges incurred in other expenses.  During the year, the Company's effective
tax rate declined from 38.9% to 37.1% due to the utilization of tax credits.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a $4.1 million increase in working capital during 1994 which
brought the total to $14.6 million and raised the current ratio from 1.7/1 to
1.8/1. Strong cash flow allowed the Company to reduce total long-term debt
from $2.7 million to $.2 million.  The Company's $15 million revolving credit
line was unused at year end.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARES AND PER SHARE, IN ALL TABLES)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries,
each of which is wholly owned. Revenue is recognized when products are shipped.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company follows the practice of ending its fiscal year on the Saturday
closest to September 30.

INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using first-in first-out (FIFO) or last-in first-out (LIFO) method.
The total inventories at the balance sheet dates were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method for financial accounting purposes.  The estimated
useful lives are as follows:

     Asset Description                                                Asset Life
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Buildings and improvements                                   20 to 40 years
     Machinery and equipment                                       3 to 12 years
     Dies and molds                                                 4 to 5 years
     Furniture and office equipment                                3 to 10 years

The cost of property retired or otherwise disposed of is removed from the
property accounts, the accumulated depreciation is removed from the related
reserves, and the net gain or loss is reflected in income.  Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Major renewals and betterments
are capitalized.

The details of property, plant and equipment at the balance sheet dates were as
follows:

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOODWILL
Goodwill is the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of their
identifiable net assets and is amortized over a period not exceeding 40 years.
The Company regularly reviews the individual components of goodwill and
recognizes, on a current basis, any diminution in value.

INCOME PER COMMON AND COMMON SHARE EQUIVALENT
Income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
shares outstanding plus the  effect of common stock equivalents.  The weighted
average shares used in the computations were 10,816,000 in 1995, 10,666,000 in
1994, and 10,467,000 in 1993.

CASH FLOWS
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash on hand and short-term securities are
combined.  Short-term securities may include certificates of deposit, Euro-
dollars and commercial paper which must be held for three months or less in
order to be considered short-term for cash flows.

RESTATEMENTS
All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for a three-for-two stock
split effected in the form of a stock dividend in May, 1995 and a two-for-one
stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in March, 1993.  In
addition, certain other fiscal 1994 balances have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 1995 presentation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Agreement") with a bank that
provides for borrowings of up to $15,000,000 at the bank's prime rate or offered
rate.  This Agreement expires on October 31, 1996.  The average amount owing to
the bank was $811,000 in 1995, $1,964,000 in 1994, and $2,064,000 in 1993, at
weighted average interest rates of 6.9%, 4.2%, and 3.7%, respectively.  Under
the Agreement, the Company is required, among other things, to maintain
consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, of not less than $22,263,000 and a
minimum current ratio of 1.5 to 1.  In addition, there are some restrictions on
the creation or assumption of any lien or security interest upon any of its
assets.

Short-term borrowing averaged $6,000 in 1995, $3,000 in 1994, and $0 in 1993, at
weighted average interest rates of 9.3%, 6.2%, and 0.0%, respectively.


3. INCOME TAXES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effective October 3, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  SFAS 109 requires,
among other things, the application of current statutory income tax rates to
deferred income tax balances.  In the first quarter of fiscal 1994, the company
recognized the cumulative effect, through October 3, 1993, of the accounting
change, reflecting the difference between current statutory tax rates and the
generally higher rates that were used to establish the deferred income tax
balances, resulting in no material effect to the Company's financial condition.

                                                                             25

4. PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Company has defined benefit, defined contribution and government mandated
plans covering eligible, non-bargaining unit employees.  Pension benefits are
fully vested after five years and are based upon years of service and highest
five-year average compensation.  It is the Company's policy to fund its pension
costs by making annual contributions based upon the minimum funding provisions
of the "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974".  The total pension
expense of Company sponsored plans was $297,000 in 1995 and was $290,000 and
$394,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

In fiscal 1990, a supplemental retirement benefit plan was approved for certain
key executive officers which will provide supplemental payments upon retirement,
disability, or death.  The obligations are not funded apart from the Company's
general assets.  The Company charged to expense $205,000 in 1995, $299,000 in
1994, and $115,000 in 1993 under the plan.

Most of the Company's union employees are covered by union-sponsored,
collectively-bargained multi-employer pension plans.  The Company contributed
and charged to expense $154,000 in 1995, $130,000 in 1994, and $91,000 in 1993,
for such plans.  These contributions are determined in accordance with the
provisions of negotiated labor contracts and generally are based on the number
of man-hours worked.  Information from the plan's administrators is not
available to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded vested
benefits.


                                                                              27

4. PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONT.)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The annual profit sharing contributions which are the lesser of (a) a percentage
of income as defined in the plans or (b) 15% of the aggregate compensation paid
to participants during the year, were $698,000 in 1995, $634,000 in 1994, and
$505,000 in 1993.

The Company makes matching contributions of 50% of employees' contributions
up to 4% of compensation.  Matching contributions were $214,000 in 1995, and
were $206,000 and $227,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Plan assets of Company-sponsored plans are invested primarily in common stocks,
corporate bonds, and government securities.  Although the Company has a right to
improve, change or terminate the plans, they are intended to be permanent.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides an optional retiree medical program to a majority of its
U.S. salaried and non-union retirees.  All retirees are required to contribute
to the cost of their coverage.  These postretirement benefits are unfunded.

During the quarter ended January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS No. 106), "Employer's Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions," on a prospective basis.
Adopting this new standard resulted in a cumulative catch-up adjustment of
approximately $1,098,000 (pre-tax) which will be amortized over 20 years.  On an
on-going basis, the annual incremental expense, including $55,000 amortization
of the $1,098,000, will be approximately $181,000 (pre-tax).

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides certain postemployment benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement.

If the Company had adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", the effect of the change
would have been immaterial.  The Company will, on an annual basis, reevaluate
its liability under SFAS No. 112 to verify that it remains immaterial.


5. CAPITAL STOCK
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The total authorized stock is 40,000,000 shares, consisting of 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, and 30,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share.  No shares of preferred stock have
been issued to date.

In May, 1986, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one common
stock purchase right ("Right") for each share of common stock outstanding.
The plan authorizing these Rights was subsequently amended in July, 1990 and
January, 1993.  Each Right entitles the holder thereof, until May 29, 1996,
to buy one share of common stock at an exercise price of $13.33.  The
exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment in certain cases to prevent
dilution.  The Rights are evidenced by the common stock certificates and are
not exercisable, or transferable apart from the common stock, until ten days
after a person acquires or makes a tender offer for 15% or more of the common
stock or the Board of Directors determines that such person has become an
Adverse Person as that term is defined in the plan.  In the event the Company
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction (including
one in which the Company is the surviving corporation), it is provided that
each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the then current exercise
price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the surviving
company which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of
two times the exercise price of the Right.  The Rights do not have any voting
rights and are redeemable, at the option of the Company, at a price of $.0167
per Right at any time until ten days after the person acquires beneficial
ownership of at least 15% of the common stock.  The Rights expire on May 29,
1996.  So long as the Rights are not separately transferable, the Company
will issue one Right with each new share of common stock issued.

On April 26, 1995, the board of directors declared a three-for-two stock
split effected in the form of a 50% common stock dividend, payable May 22,
1995, to holders of record on May 8, 1995.  On January 22, 1993, the board of
directors declared a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100%
common stock dividend, payable March 1, 1993, to holders of record on
February 12, 1993.  All share and per share amounts have been adjusted to
give retroactive effect to these stock splits.

                                                                             29

6. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company is subject to federal and state hazardous substance cleanup laws
that impose liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting
from past spills, disposal or other releases of hazardous substances.  In
this regard, the Company has incurred, and expects to incur, assessment,
remediation and related costs at one of the Company's facilities.  In 1991,
the Company reported to state regulators a release at that site from an
underground storage tank ("UST").  The UST and certain contaminated soil
subsequently were removed and disposed of at an off-site disposal facility.
The Company's independent environmental consultant has been conducting an
investigation of soil and groundwater at the site with oversight by the state
Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ").  The investigation indicates
that additional soil and groundwater at the site have been impaired by
chlorinated solvents, including tetrachloroethane and trichloroethylene.
Also, the company learned that a portion of the site had been used as a
disposal area by the previous owners of the site.  The Company's consultant
is investigating and has begun to remediate this area and believes that it is
an additional likely source of contamination of soil and groundwater.  In
addition, the investigation of the site indicates that the groundwater
contaminants may have migrated off-site.  However, the extent of the
contamination has not been fully delineated at this time.  The Company is
conducting additional investigations to determine the extent of contamination
at and around the site and to determine the extent of other sources of
contamination in addition to the removed UST and the above-referenced
disposal area, including the possible presence of ongoing dumping activities
by others in the vicinity around the Company's facilities.

The Company's consultant estimates that a minimum of $1.5 million of
investigation and remediation expenses will be incurred at the site.  The
Company has a reserve for such purposes and has notified the previous owners
of the site and various insurers of possible claims by the Company relating
to the remediation of the site.  The consultant's cost estimate was based on
a review of currently available data, which is limited, and assumptions
concerning the extent of contamination, geological conditions, and the costs
and effectiveness of certain treatment technologies.  The cost estimate is
subject to substantial uncertainty until the extent of contamination and
geological conditions are fully understood, feasible remedial alternatives
are assessed, and the DEQ approves a remediation plan.  The Company is
continuing to investigate the environmental conditions at the site and will
adjust its reserve if necessary. The Company may incur significant additional
assessment, remediation and related costs at the site, and such costs could
materially and adversely affect the Company's consolidated net income for the
period in which such costs are incurred.  The Company, however, cannot
estimate the time or potential magnitude of such costs at this time.

10. ACQUISITIONS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On September 29, 1995, the Company acquired all of the stock of Elitec S.A.
for $1,138,000.  Located outside of Paris, France, Elitec is a distributor of
industrial connectors and sensors that serve the automation and
computer-control needs of many industries.

On January 1, 1993, the Company completed the purchase of H. F. Vogel GmbH, a
manufacturer of specialty connectors located near Stuttgart, Germany.

Effective April 1, 1993, the Company acquired all of the assets of FOCS, Inc.
in Marlborough, MA.  FOCS manufactures fiber optic cable assemblies and
systems.

On April 19,1993, the Company acquired all of the stock of AKAPP Electro
Industrie B.V. located in Barneveld, the Netherlands.  AKAPP is a
manufacturer of continuous multi-conductor electrical bar systems for the
transmission of power.

The combined purchase price paid for the three companies acquired in fiscal
1993 was $11,203,000 in cash.  Goodwill represents $5,182,000 of this total
purchase price and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
 Pro forma net sales for fiscal year 1993 would have been $96,360,000,
assuming all three acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the year.
Pro forma net income and earnings per share, however, would not have been
materially different.

All four acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method, and
their net assets and results of operations are included in the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements from the dates of acquisition.
