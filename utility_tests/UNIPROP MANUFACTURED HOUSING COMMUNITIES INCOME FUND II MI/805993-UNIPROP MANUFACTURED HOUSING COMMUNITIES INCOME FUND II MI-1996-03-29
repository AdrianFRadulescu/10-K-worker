ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General Development of Business

     Uniprop Manufactured Housing Communities Income Fund II, a Michigan
Limited Partnership (the "Partnership"), acquired, maintains, operates and
ultimately will dispose of income producing residential real properties
consisting of nine manufactured housing communities (the "Properties"). The
Partnership was organized and formed under the laws of the State of Michigan on
November 7, 1986.  Its principal offices are located at 280 Daines Street,
Birmingham, Michigan 48009 and its telephone number is (810) 645-9261.

     The Partnership filed an S-11 Registration Statement in November 1986
which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
December 23, 1986.  The Partnership thereafter sold 3,303,387 units (the
"Units") of beneficial assignment of limited partnership interest representing
capital contributions by unit holders (the "Unit Holders") to the Partnership
of $20 per unit.  The sale of all 3,303,387 Units was completed in December,
1987, generating $66,067,740 of contributed capital to the Partnership.

     On April 1, 1987, the Partnership acquired Sunshine Village, a 356-space
manufactured housing community located in Davie, Florida and Ardmor Village, a
339-space manufactured housing community located in Lakeville, Minnesota.  On
May 22, 1987, the Partnership acquired Camelot Manor, a 335-space manufactured
housing community located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  On July 1, 1987, Country
Roads, a 312-space manufactured housing community located in Jacksonville,
Florida and Paradise Village, a 611-space manufactured housing community
located in Tampa, Florida, were acquired by the Partnership.  On September 1,
1987, Dutch Hills, a 278-space manufactured housing community located in
Haslett, Michigan and Stonegate Manor, a 308-space manufactured housing
community located in Lansing, Michigan, were acquired by the Partnership.  On
January 8 and 15, 1988, respectively, the Partnership acquired West Valley, a
420-space manufactured housing community, and El Adobe, a 371-space
manufactured housing community, both located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

     The Partnership operates the Properties as manufactured housing
communities with the primary investment objectives of: (1) providing cash from
operations to investors; (2) obtaining capital appreciation; and (3) preserving
capital of the Partnership.  There can be no assurance that such objectives can
be achieved.

     On December 27, 1993, the Partnership participated in a financing
transaction (the "Mortgage Financing") which created mortgage financing for 28
manufactured housing communities (collectively, the "Projects," and
individually, a "Project").  Seven (7) of the Projects are owned by the
Partnership; thirteen (13) are owned by affiliates of Genesis Associates
Limited Partnership, the general partner of the Partnership (the "General

                                     -2-
<PAGE>   3

Partner"), and eight (8) are owned by unrelated third parties.  The Projects
owned by the Partnership (the "Fund II Projects") are as follows:

                        Ardmor Village
                        Camelot Manor
                        Dutch Hills
                        El Adobe
                        Stonegate
                        Sunshine Village
                        West Valley
                        
     Essentially, mortgage notes executed by the owners of each of the Projects
were issued in favor of Neutron-Uniprop, Inc. ("Neutron"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Uniprop, Inc. (an affiliate of the General Partner), and assigned
by Neutron to an independent trustee of a newly-formed trust (the "Trust").
The specific purpose of the Trust is to hold the mortgage notes and the
mortgages and other security provided in connection therewith for the benefit
of the owners of the newly-issued Uniprop MHC Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates (the "Mortgage Certificates").  The proceeds derived from the sale
of the Mortgage Certificates were used to fund the mortgage loans made to the
Project owners and pay the various expenses of the transaction.

     Five classes of Mortgage Certificates were issued with varying seniority
and carrying different interest rates.  The interest rate on the senior
securities (i.e. the Class A Certificates) floats and equals 1.67% in excess of
the LIBOR rate, computed monthly.  The Class B and D Certificates carry fixed
rates of interest of 7.04% and 7.5%, respectively.  The interest rate on the
Class C Certificate floats and equals 2.5% in excess of the libor rate,
computed monthly.  The Class R Certificates do not have a principal balance or
accrue interest.

     The original principal amounts of the mortgage loans for the Fund II
Projects and their terms are as follows:

                        Ardmor Village       $2,930,000

                        Dutch Hills          $2,580,000
                        El Adobe             $5,530,000
                        Stonegate            $3,015,000

        Term:               30 years

        Amortization:       Years 1-5; none
                            Years 6-30; 25 year schedule

        Interest Rate:      Weighted average cost of the Mortgage Certificates
                            plus 135 basis points (the "Excess Interest"),
                            computed monthly, but in no event greater than 9.9%
                            per annum in years 1 through 10 and 10.9% per annum
                            in years 11 through 30, or less than 7% per annum
                            in years 1 through 10 or 8% per annum in years 11
                            through 30. After payment of certain servicing
                            expenses and the costs of administering the Trust,
                            the Excess Interest will be used to reduce the
                            principal balance of the Mortgage Certificates,
                            which could ultimately result in an increase in the
                            value of the Class R Certificates.

        Prepayment:   Penalty of 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, and 1% of the principal 
                      amount outstanding for prepayment in years 1, 2, 3, 4, 
                      and 5, respectively.  No prepayment penalty after year 5.

        All prepayments of principal made under any of the mortgage notes will
be applied in reduction of the principal balance of the Mortgage Certificates
according to their respective payment priorities.   To the extent the Excess
Interest is not used to pay servicing fees and other costs of the trustee and
servicers, it will be applied first in reduction of the principal balance of
the Class B Certificates and Class C Certificates, pro rata until reduced to
zero, then in reduction of the principal balance of the Class A Certificates
until reduced to zero, and then in reduction of the Class D Certificates until
reduced to zero.  As a result of the foregoing, the weighted average cost of
the Mortgage Certificates and, therefore, the interest rate charged to each
Project owner, may increase due to prepayment by another borrower and as the
principal amount of the Mortgage Certificates is reduced.  In addition, because
the Fund II Projects all have a common owner, the loans to each of the Fund II
Projects are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with one another, such
that a default by Uniprop Income Fund II with respect to any one of its loans
will permit the enforcement of remedies on behalf of the Trust against all
seven (7) Fund II Projects and recovery against each Fund II Project in excess
of the amount of its mortgage loan.

        As a condition to participating in the mortgage-backed securities
transaction, each Project owner was required to use approximately 5% of its
mortgage proceeds to purchase a subordinated portion of the mortgage-backed
securities, the Class D Certificates.  The Class D Certificates are not rated,
carry a fixed interest rate of 7.5% per annum and are subordinated to the Class
A, Class B and Class C Mortgage Certificates, although, as long as there are
sufficient funds in the Trust, the holders of the Class D Certificates are
entitled to receive monthly payments of interest.  The Partnership was issued a
Class D Certificate with a face amount of $1,502,250.

                                     -4-

<PAGE>   5


        The Class R Certificates, which constitute the residual interest in the
Trust, are owned by Uniprop MHC Residual L.L.C., a newly created Michigan
limited liability company (the "R Holder"or "LLC").  The owners of the R Holder 
are the respective owners of the Projects participating in this mortgage-backed
securities financing, with their ownership interest determined based on the
amount each Project owner contributes to the value of the Class R Certificates.
Initially, the Partnership holds a 20.986% interest in the R Holder.

Financial Information About Industry Segment

        The Partnership's business and only industry segment is the operation of
its nine manufactured housing communities.  Partnership operations commenced in
April 1987 upon the acquisition of the first two Properties.  For a description
of the Partnership's revenues, operating profit and assets, please refer to
Items 6 and 8.

Narrative Description of Business

General

        The Sunshine Village, Ardmor Village and Camelot Manor Properties were
selected from 25 manufactured housing communities then owned by affiliates of
Genesis Associates Limited Partnership, the General Partner of the Partnership
(the "General Partner").  The other six communities were purchased from
unaffiliated third parties.  The Partnership rents space in the Properties to
owners of manufactured homes thereby generating rental revenues.  It is
intended that the Partnership will hold the Properties for extended periods of
time, originally anticipated to be seven to ten years after their acquisition,
although a Property may be disposed of earlier or later, if in the opinion of
the General Partner, it is in the best interest of the Partnership to do so.
The determination of whether a particular Property should be disposed of will
be made by the General Partner only after consultation with Hutton Manufactured
Housing Services Inc. (the "Consultant").  In making their decision, the
General Partner and Consultant will consider relevant factors, including,
current operating results of the particular Property and prevailing economic
conditions, and will make the decision with a view to achieving maximum capital
appreciation to the Partnership considering relevant tax consequences and the
Partnership's investment objectives.

Competition

        The business of owning and operating residential manufactured housing
communities is highly competitive, and the Partnership may be competing with a
number of established companies having greater financial resources.  Moreover,
there has been a trend for manufactured housing community residents to purchase
(where zoning permits) their manufactured home sites on a collective basis.
This trend may result in increased competition with the Partnership for
tenants.  In addition, the General Partner, its affiliates or both, has and may
in the future participate directly or through other partnerships or 

                                     -5-
<PAGE>   6


investment vehicles in the acquisition, ownership, development,
operation and sale of projects which may be in direct competition with one or
more of the Properties.

        Each of the Properties competes with numerous similar facilities
located in its geographic area.  The Davie/Fort Lauderdale area contains
approximately seven communities offering approximately 3,441 housing sites
competing with Sunshine Village.  Ardmor Village competes with approximately
nine communities in the Lakeville, Minnesota area offering approximately 2,362
housing sites. Camelot Manor competes with approximately 15 communities in the
Grand Rapids, Michigan area offering approximately 3,538 housing sites.  In 
the Jacksonville, Florida area, Country Roads competes with approximately five
communities offering approximately 1,332 housing sites. The Tampa, Florida 
area contains approximately four communities offering approximately 1,568 
housing sites competing with Paradise Village.  Dutch Hills and Stonegate 
Manor compete with approximately 13 other communities in the Lansing, Michigan
area offering approximately 3,887 housing sites.  In the Las Vegas, Nevada 
area, West Valley and El Adobe compete with approximately 10 other communities
offering approximately 2,948 housing sites.  The Properties also compete 
against other forms of housing, including apartment and condominium complexes.

Governmental Regulations

        The Properties owned by the Partnership are subject to certain state
regulations regarding the conduct of the Partnership operations.  For example,
the State of Florida regulates agreements and relationships between the
Partnership and the residents of Sunshine Village, Country Roads and Paradise
Village.  Under Florida law, the Partnership is required to deliver to new
residents of those Properties a prospectus describing the property and all
tenant rights, Property rules and regulations, and changes to Property rules
and regulations.  Florida law also requires minimum lease terms, requires
notice of rent increases, grants to tenant associations certain rights to
purchase the community if being sold by the owner and regulates other aspects
of the management of such properties.  The Partnership is required to give 90
days notice to the residents of Florida properties of any rate increase,
reduction in services or utilities, or change in rules and regulations.  If a
majority of the residents object to such changes as unreasonable, the matter
must be submitted to the Florida Department of Professional Business
Regulations for mediation prior to any legal adjudication of the matter.  In
addition, if the Partnership seeks to sell Florida Properties to the general
public, it must notify any homeowners association for the residents, and the
association shall have the right to purchase the Property on the price, terms
and conditions being offered to the public within 45 days of notification by
the owner.  If the Partnership receives an unsolicited bona fide offer to
purchase the Property from any party that it is considering or negotiating, it
must notify any such homeowners association that it has received an offer,
state to the homeowners association the price, terms and conditions upon which
the Partnership would sell the Property, and consider (without obligation)
accepting an offer from the homeowners association.  The Partnership has, to
the best of its knowledge, complied in all material respects with all
requirements of the States of Florida, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada, where
its operations are conducted.

                                     -6-

Employees

        The Partnership employs three part-time employees to perform
Partnership management and investor relations services.  The Partnership
retains an affiliate, Uniprop, Inc., as the property manager for each of its
Properties. Uniprop, Inc. is paid a fee equal to the lesser of 5% of the annual
gross receipts from each of the Properties or the amount which would be payable
to unaffiliated third parties for comparable services.  Uniprop, Inc. retains
local managers on behalf of the Partnership at each of the Properties. Salaries
and fringe benefits of such local managers are paid by the Partnership and are
not included in any property management fee payable to Uniprop, Inc.  Local
managers are employees of the Partnership and are paid semi-monthly.  The yearly
salaries and expenses for local managers range from $20,000 to $40,000.  Local
managers have no direct management authority, make no decisions regarding
operations and act only in accordance with instructions from the property
manager.  They are utilized by the Partnership to provide on-site maintenance
and administrative services.  Uniprop, Inc., as property manager, has overall
management authority for each Property.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

        The Partnership purchased all nine manufactured housing communities for
cash. As a result of the Mortgage Financing, seven of the nine Properties are
encumbered with mortgages in the following original principal amounts:


<TABLE>

                          Ardmor Village    $2,930,000
                          Camelot Manor     $3,490,000
                          Dutch Hills       $2,580,000
                          El Adobe          $5,530,000
                          Stonegate         $3,015,000
                          Sunshine Village  $4,290,000
                          West Valley       $8,210,000
</TABLE>


Each of the Properties is a modern manufactured housing community containing
lighted and paved streets, side-by-side off-street parking and complete
underground utility systems.  The Properties consist of only the underlying
real estate and improvements, not the actual homes themselves.  In January
1990, the Partnership did begin acquiring some homes in conjunction with its
home purchase/lease program for Country Roads and Paradise Village.  Each of
the Properties has a community center which includes offices, meeting rooms and
game rooms.  The Ardmor Village community includes a resident manager's
apartment.  Country Roads has a 1,200 square foot rental cottage.  Each of the
Properties, except Stonegate Manor, has a swimming pool.  Several of the
Properties also have laundry rooms, playground areas, garage and maintenance
areas and recreational vehicle or boat storage areas.

Partnership, material amendments to the partnership agreement and the sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets,
except in the ordinary course of the Partnership's disposing of the Properties.
Such matters must be approved by Unit Holders and Limited Partners, as a group,
holding more than 50% of the then outstanding interests.  There have been no 
matters submitted to a vote of the limited partners during the last fiscal year.





                                   PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
        SECURITY HOLDER MATTERS

        There is no established public trading market for the Units of the
Partnership and it is not anticipated that one will ever develop.  During the
last twelve months, less than two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the Units
have been transferred, excluding transfers on account of death or intra-family
transfers.  The Partnership believes there is no secondary market, or the
substantial equivalent thereof, and none will develop.

        The General Partner calculates the estimated net asset value of each
Unit by dividing (i) the amount of distributions that would be made to the
Limited Partners in the event of the current sale of the Properties at their
current appraised value, less the outstanding balances of the mortgages on the
mortgaged Properties and sales expenses (but without consideration to tax
consequences of the sale), by (ii) 3,303,387.  In March, 1996, the Properties
were appraised at an aggregate fair market value of $72,900,000.  Assuming a
sale of the nine properties in March 1996, at the appraised value, less payment
of selling expenses, the contingent purchase price due to sellers and mortgage
debt, the net aggregate proceeds available for distribution to the Unit Holders
is estimated to be $40,668,000 or $12.31 per unit.  There can be no assurance
that the estimated net asset value could ever be realized.  As of March 1,
1996, the Partnership had approximately 4,850 Limited Partners holding Units.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
        CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
 
Liquidity

        During 1995, the Partnership generated adequate amounts of cash to meet
its operating needs, fund capital improvements and pay distributions to
Partners.  The Partnership borrowed $30,045,000 in December of 1993 through the
Mortgage Financing.  The net proceeds from the Mortgage Financing, after
expenses and repayment of $2,350,523 in unsecured debt, were approximately
$24,800,000.  With the financing proceeds, the Partnership's Statement of Cash
Flows for the year ended December 31, 1993 reflected Cash and Cash Equivalents,
at year end of $25,701,460.  However, as discussed under the section entitled
"Capital Resources," $23,119,767 of the net proceeds of the Mortgage Financing
was distributed to the Unit Holders in February, 1994.

                                     -10-
<PAGE>   11



        The Partnership expects to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its
operating needs during the next fiscal year.

Capital Resources

        The capital formation phase of the Partnership began on April 1, 1987
when Sunshine Village and Ardmor Village were purchased by the Partnership and
operations commenced.  It ended on January 15, 1988 when El Adobe, the
Partnership's last property, was purchased.  The total capital raised through
December 1987 was $66,067,740 of which approximately $58,044,000 was used to
purchase the nine Properties after deducting sales commissions, advisory fees
and other organization and offering costs.

        In an effort to provide Unit Holders with a return of capital and
eliminate the cumulative preferred return deficit owed to them, the General
Partner, with majority consent from the Unit Holders, mortgaged seven of its
nine Properties through the Mortgage Financing at approximately 56.0% of their
appraised value, or $30,045,000.

        On or around February 15, 1994, the Partnership distributed $23,119,767
to the Unit Holders or $6.99 per $20.00 Unit held.  $13,572,978 (or $4.11 per
Unit), restored the shortfall in the Unit Holders 10.0% cumulative preferred
return, and $9,546,789 (or $2.89 per unit), was a partial return of the Limited
Partners' original capital contributions.

        After payment of the $23,119,767 distribution to the Unit Holders, the
Partnership had sufficient cash to establish a long-term capital improvement
reserve of $1,500,000.  This capital improvement reserve will be used to cover
expenses associated with the long term capital improvements budgeted for the
Properties over the next five years.

        As described in Note 3 to the Financial Statements, the term of the
mortgage notes executed in connection with the Mortgage Financing payable are
for a period of 30 years with interest only payments required for the first 5
years.  Beginning in year 6, principal and interest payments are required on a
self amortizing basis through December of 2023.  The minimum mortgage interest
rate is 7.0% per annum through December 2003 and 8.0% thereafter.  The maximum
mortgage interest rate is 9.9% per annum through December 2003 and 10.9%
thereafter.  Each of the seven mortgaged Properties is cross-collateralized.

        As part of the Mortgage Financing, the Partnership was required to
purchase $1,502,250 in mortgage-backed securities.  These mortgage-backed
securities equal approximately 5.0% of the seven mortgage notes payable and pay
interest computed at a monthly fixed rate of 7.5% per annum.

        The General Partner acknowledges that the mortgages impose some risks to
the Partnership, but that such risks are not greater than risks typically
associated with real estate financing.  In addition, as a result of the
borrowing, there is potential adverse impact on the amount of distributions to
the Unit Holders in future years.  The General Partner

                                     -11-

<PAGE>   12


anticipates, based on 1996 projections, that distributions to the Unit Holders
will be approximately 3.0% to 4.5% through 1997.

Results of Operations

        a.  Distributions

        Distributions to the Unit Holders totalled $2,195,720 in 1995,
$25,098,000 in 1994, and $4,624,742 in 1993.

        In February 1994, $23,119,767, a part of the Mortgage Financing
proceeds, was distributed to the Unit Holders, of which $13,572,978 represented
the elimination of the preferred return deficit that existed, and $9,546,789
which represented a partial return of capital.

        Annual distributable cash from operations was less than the amount
required for the annual 10% preferred return to Unit Holders in 1995, 1994 and
1993.  As described in Note 3 to the Partnership's financial statements, the
cummulative preferred return deficit, through December 1993 was paid in full in
February 1994.  The cummulative unpaid preferred return deficit that has
accumulated during 1995 totalled approximately $3,456,000.  No distributions can
be made to the General Partner until the cummulative preferred return deficit
has been distributed to the Unit Holders.  At December 31, 1995, the unpaid
amount to be distributed to the General Partner from future capital transactions
was approximately $5,300,000.

        b.  Net Income

        For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, net income was
$540,151, $1,444,879 and $2,852,634 on total revenues of $11,210,541,
$11,302,229, and $10,114,080, respectively.

        Net income plus depreciation and amortization,  less distributions to
Unit Holders, was $235,334, $1,329,538 and $(84,171) for 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The higher income reported in 1994 is a direct result of  the
Mortgage Financing completed in December 1993.

        c.  Partnership Management

        Net expenses for the management of the Partnership (i.e. gross expenses
for such management, less transfer fees, interest on reserves, interest on funds
awaiting distribution, and certain non-recurring income) were $149,523 in 1995,
$49,897 in 1994 and $288,651 in 1993.  Transfer fees, net income equity in the
LLC and interest on cash reserves totalled $608,464 in 1995, $717,137 in 1994
and $19,722 in 1993.


                                     -12-

<PAGE>   13



        The decrease in net management expenses between 1994 and 1993 is due to
the net income related to equity in the LLC as described in Note 3 of the
Financial Statements and interest income on cash reserves.



        d.  Property Operations


        Overall, as illustrated in the table below, the Partnership's nine
properties had a combined average occupancy of 88.2% (2,936/3,330 sites) as of
December 1995, versus 89.3% in December 1994; and 86.7% in December 1993.  The
average collected monthly rent was approximately $316 per home site in December
1995, versus $307 in December, 1994 and $289 in December, 1993, an increase each
year of 2.9% and 6.2%, respectively.

</TABLE>

        During the 1995 fiscal year, before Partnership management and
nonrecurring expenses and debt service, the Partnership's nine properties
generated net operating income of $5,069,250 or 47.4% of total revenues compared
to $5,424,401 or 51.2% of total revenues; and $5,082,161 or 50.3% of total
revenues, in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

        The decrease in net operating income between 1995 and 1994, is a direct
result of decreased occupancies and higher expenses.

(1)  Net operating income does not include depreciation or amortization.

        Each of the following three Properties had occupancy rates well below
the other six Properties which had occupancy rates between 90% and 97%.

        Ardmor Village, in Lakeville, Minnesota, had an occupancy of 87.9%
(298/339 sites) as of December, 1995 compared to 85.5% as of December, 1994 and
83.5% in 1993.  The average rent in December, 1995 was $304 per home site versus
$297 in December, 1994 and $291 in December, 1993, an increase of 2.4% and 2.0%
in each year, respectively.

        The property's 1995 net operating income of $563,269 represented 53.2%
of revenues versus $548,538 or 55.0% of revenues in 1994 and $471,314 or 50.5%
in 1993.  The increase in net operating income is primarily due to increased
occupancy and higher rents.  The General Partner has stopped placing
lease/purchase homes at the community and started a new home sales program,
which the General Partner anticipates will continue to help improve occupancy
during 1996.

        Country Roads, in Jacksonville, Florida, reported an occupancy of 84.9%
(265/312 sites) as of December, 1995 compared to 82.4% in 1994 and 72.8% in
1993.  The average rent in December, 1995 was $205, which represents no increase
from the $205 reported in  December 1994 and is a slight decrease from the $206
reported in December 1993.

        The property's 1995 net operating income loss of ($43,518) represented
- -7.0% of revenues versus $54,916 or 9.4% of revenues in 1994 and $5,398 or -1.0%
of revenues in 1993.  The decrease in net operating income from 1994 to 1995 is
primarily due to higher marketing expenses.

        Paradise Village, in Tampa, Florida, reported an occupancy of 71.2%
(435/611 sites) as of December, 1995 compared to 79.7% in 1994 and 71.0% in
1993.  The  average rent in December, 1995 was $257, versus $246 in 1994 and
$233 in 1993, an increase of 4.5% and 5.6% respectively.

        The property's 1995 net operating income of $78,478 represented 6.3% of
revenues compared to $304,769 or 20.6% of revenues in 1994 and $378,482 or 
28.1% in 1993.  During 1995, management has started to phase out the 
lease/purchase proram.  As a result, lease home income declined significantly 
and expenses to repair the lease homes increased.

        In 1996 and for the foreseeable future, the Partnership expects to meet
its expenditures from operating revenues and to distribute excess cash flow,
after retention of an adequate cash reserve, to its Unit Holders and Partners.

real estate management with Commodore Financial Services Corp.  Mr. Winter has
a B.B.A. in finance from Wayne State University.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

        The Partnership has no executive officers and therefore, no officers
received a salary or remuneration exceeding $100,000 during the last fiscal
year.  The General Partner of the Partnership and an affiliate, Uniprop, Inc.,
received certain compensation and fees during the fiscal year in the amounts
described in Item 13.  Depending upon the results of operations and other
factors, the Partnership anticipates that it will provide similar compensation
to the General Partner and Uniprop, Inc. during the next fiscal year.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
         MANAGEMENT

        The Partnership is a limited partnership duly formed pursuant to the
Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as amended, of the State of Michigan.  The
General Partner, Genesis Associates Limited Partnership, is vested with full
authority as to the general management and supervision of business and the
other affairs of the Partnership, subject to certain constraints in the
partnership agreement and consulting agreement.   Unit holders and/or limited
partners have no right to participate in the management of the Partnership and
have limited voting privileges only on certain matters of fundamental
significance.  No person owns of record or beneficially, more than five percent
of the Partnership's Units.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

        The following discussion describes all of the types of compensation,
fees or other distributions paid by the Partnership or others to the General
Partner or its affiliates from the operations of the Partnership during the
last fiscal year, as well as certain of such items which may be payable during
the next fiscal year.  Certain of the following arrangements for compensation
and fees were not determined by arm's length negotiations between the General
Partner, its affiliates and the Partnership.

        Paul M. Zlotoff has an interest in the original sellers of Sunshine
Village and Ardmor Village and is entitled to share in a contingent purchase
price with respect to each Property, when and if the Properties are sold and
the sellers become entitled thereto.  The maximum amounts which could be
payable to the sellers are as follows:  Sunshine Village, $1,108,260 and Ardmor
Village, $946,236.  The cash purchase price and contingent purchase price for
each Property were determined by reference to the average of two independent
real estate appraisals which were obtained by the General Partner.  Such
appraisals are only estimates of value and are not necessarily indicative of
the actual real estate.  Each seller will become entitled to any unpaid
contingent purchase price upon the sale, financing or other disposition of each
such Property, but, only after the receipt by each Unit Holder and Limited
Partner of aggregate distributions equal to the sum of (i) his 

                                    -17-
<PAGE>   18


10% cumulative preferred return plus (ii) 125% of his capital contribution.  
The actual amounts to be received, if any, will depend upon the results of the
Partnership's operations and the amounts received upon the sale, financing or
other disposition of the Properties and are not determinable at this time.  The
Partnership does not anticipate any such amount will become payable during the
next fiscal year.

        The Partnership will pay an incentive management interest to the
General Partner for managing the Partnership's affairs, including: determining
distributions, negotiating agreements, selling or  financing properties,
preparing records and reports, and performing other ongoing Partnership
responsibilities.  This incentive management interest is 15% of distributable
cash from operations in any quarter.  However, in each quarter, the General
Partner's right to receive any net cash from operations is subordinated to the
extent necessary to first provide each Unit Holder and Limited Partner his 10%
cumulative preferred return.  During the last fiscal year, the General Partner
received no distributions on account of its incentive management interest from
operations because distributions were approximately $3,456,375 less than the
10% cumulative preferred return due Unit Holders.  Any such amounts unpaid in a
taxable year will be accumulated and paid from distributable cash from capital
transactions, but only after each Unit Holder and Limited Partner has first
received his 10% cumulative preferred return and 125% of his capital
contribution.  For 1995, approximately $400,000 was accumulated for the General
Partner, and the General Partner's aggregate accumulated incentive management
interest as of December 1995 was approximately $5,300,000.  The actual
incentive management interest from operations to be accumulated or paid during
the next fiscal year will depend upon the results of the Partnership's
operations and is not determinable at this time.  The Partnership does not
anticipate any such amount will be distributed to the General Partner during
the next fiscal year and will again be accumulated with payment deferred.  No
distributions could be made to the General Partner until an approximately
$7,289,350  10% cumulative preferred return deficit as of December 31, 1995, is
first distributed to the Unit Holders.  In February of 1994, as part of the
Mortgage Financing, $23,119,767 was distributed to the Unit Holders,
$13,572,978 of which eliminated the Unit Holders' preferred return deficit
through December 31, 1993.

        The Partnership must also pay an incentive management interest from
capital transactions to the General Partner for its services rendered to the
Partnership.  The General Partner will be entitled to receive its share of
distributable cash from capital transactions after (i) each Unit Holder and
Limited Partner has received aggregate distributions in an amount equal to the
sum of (a) his 10% cumulative preferred return plus (b) 125% of his capital
contribution, (ii) any contingent purchase prices have been paid, and (iii) any
property disposition fees to Uniprop, Inc. have been paid.  The General
Partner's share of distributable cash from capital transactions so payable will
be (i) 100% of such distributable cash from capital distributions until the
General Partner's share of the aggregate capital distributions made under
section 11c(iii) and 11c(v) of the partnership agreement equal 25% and (ii)
thereafter, 25% of such distributable cash from capital transactions.  No
incentive management interest from capital transactions was paid to the General
Partner for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.  The Partnership does not

                                    -18-

<PAGE>   19


anticipate that any such amounts will be paid or become payable to the General
Partner during the next fiscal year.

        Uniprop, Inc. received and will receive property management fees for
each Property managed by it.  Uniprop, Inc. is primarily responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Properties and for the payment of the costs of
operating each Property out of the rental income collected.  The property
management fees are equal to the lesser of 5% of the annual gross receipts from
the Properties managed by Uniprop, Inc., or the amount which would be payable
to an unaffiliated third party for comparable services.  During the last fiscal
year, Uniprop, Inc. received the following property management fees totaling
$524,609: Ardmor Village, $51,610; Camelot Manor, $51,889; Country Roads,
$31,212; Dutch Hills, $42,510; El Adobe, $70,658; Paradise Village, $62,341;
Stonegate Manor, $47,290; Sunshine Village, $71,620; and West Valley, $95,479.
The actual amounts to be received during the next fiscal year will depend upon
the results of the Partnership's operations and are not determinable at this
time.

        Certain employees of affiliates of the General Partner were paid an
aggregate of $164,657 during 1995 to perform local property management, data
processing and investor relations services for the Partnership.  It is
anticipated comparable amounts will be paid in the next fiscal year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Partners
Uniprop Manufactured Housing
  Communities Income Fund II
  (a Michigan limited partnership)

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Uniprop Manufactured Housing
Communities Income Fund II (a Michigan limited partnership), as of December 31,
1995 and 1994 and the related statements of income, partners' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. We
have also audited the schedule listed under Item 14 of Form 10-K. These
financial statements and the schedule are the responsibility of the
Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and the schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and the schedule
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the schedule. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and the
schedule. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Uniprop Manufactured Housing
Communities Income Fund II at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Also, in our opinion, the schedule listed under Item 14 of Form 10-K presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

1.   SUMMARY OF    ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
     ACCOUNTING 
     POLICIES      Uniprop Manufactured Housing Communities Income Fund II,
                   a Michigan Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") acquired,
                   maintains, operates and will ultimately dispose of income
                   producing residential real properties consisting of nine
                   manufactured housing communities (the "properties") located
                   in Florida, Michigan, Nevada and Minnesota. The Partnership
                   was organized and formed under the laws of the State of
                   Michigan on November 7, 1986.

                   In accordance with its Prospectus dated December 1986,
                   the Partnership sold 3,303,387 units of beneficial assignment
                   of limited partnership interest ("Units") for $66,067,740.
                   The Partnership purchased the properties for an aggregate
                   purchase price of approximately $56,000,000. Three of the
                   properties costing approximately $16,008,000 were previously
                   owned by entities which were affiliates of the general
                   partner.

                   The general partner is Genesis Associates Limited
                   Partnership. Uniprop Beneficial Corporation was the initial
                   limited partner who assigned to those persons purchasing
                   units a beneficial limited partnership interest when the
                   minimum number of units were sold.

                   USE OF ESTIMATES

                   In preparing financial statements in conformity with
                   generally accepted accounting principles, management is
                   required to make estimates and assumptions that affect (1)
                   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
                   disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
                   date of the financial statements, and (2) revenues and
                   expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
                   differ from these estimates.

                   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                   The carrying amounts of the Partnership's financial
                   instruments, which consist of cash, marketable securities,
                   mortgage-backed securities, investments, notes payable, and
                   accounts payable, approximate their fair values.

                   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

                   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
                   is provided using the straight-line method over the following
                   estimated useful lives:

                   Buildings and improvements                30 years
                   Manufactured homes and improvements       30 years
                   Furniture and equipment                 3-10 years

                   Accumulated depreciation for tax purposes was
                   $12,057,650 and $10,490,657 as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
                   respectively.

                   MARKETABLE SECURITIES

                   Marketable securities consist mainly of U.S. Government
                   and Federal Agency Bonds with maturity dates ranging from
                   November 1996 to April 1998. These securities are carried at
                   amortized cost and management intends to hold such securities
                   to maturity. The rate of return on these securities ranges
                   from 4.37% to 7.87%.

                   MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

                   These mortgage pass-through certificates represent
                   beneficial ownership interests in a trust fund, the assets of
                   which consist of a pool of mortgage loans originated by the
                   issuer of the securities. Mortgages of seven of the
                   Partnership's properties are included in the assets of the
                   trust fund. Thirteen other properties owned in part by
                   affiliates of the general partner are also included in the
                   assets of the trust fund. These securities are carried at
                   cost, and management intends to hold such securities to
                   maturity. The rate of return on these securities is 7.5% per
                   annum.

                   FINANCING COSTS

                   Costs to obtain financing have been capitalized and are
                   amortized using the straight-line method over the 30-year
                   term of the related mortgage notes payable.

                   INCOME TAXES

                   Federal income tax regulations provide that any taxes on
                   income of a partnership are payable by the partners as
                   individuals. Therefore, no provision for such taxes has been
                   made at the partnership level.

2.   OTHER ASSETS  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, "Other assets" included cash
                   of approximately $88,000 in a security deposit escrow
                   account for two of the Partnership's properties, as
                   required by the laws of the state in which they are located,
                   which is restricted from operating use.

3.   NOTES PAYABLE Notes payable consisted of:

                   $258,967 in 1995 and 1994, respectively

</TABLE>

                   In December 1993, the Partnership mortgaged seven of its
                   properties in connection with a financing transaction which
                   involved twenty-one other properties, thirteen of which are
                   owned in part by affiliates of the general partner. The
                   borrowings, which are secured by the mortgages on the
                   Partnership's properties as well as the mortgages on the
                   other twenty-one properties, were funded through the issuance
                   of mortgage-backed securities. As part of the financing, the
                   Partnership was required to purchase $1,502,250 in
                   mortgage-backed securities. The entity that issued these
                   securities was a newly created trust fund.

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


                   The proceeds of the mortgage notes payable were obtained
                   primarily to eliminate the cumulative preferred return
                   deficit owed to the unit holders that existed as of December
                   31, 1993, and also to distribute a return of capital to the
                   unit holders. In February 1994, $23,119,767 was distributed
                   to the unit holders, of which $13,572,978 represented the
                   elimination of the preferred return deficit that existed, and
                   $9,546,789 which represented a return of capital.

                   The mortgage notes payable require monthly payments of
                   interest only through December 1998. Thereafter, monthly
                   payments of principal and interest are required through
                   December 2023. Principal payments to be made in 1999 and 2000
                   are approximately $363,000 and $395,000, respectively. The
                   minimum mortgage interest rate is 7.0% per annum through
                   December 2003 and 8.0% thereafter. The maximum mortgage
                   interest rate is 9.9% per annum through December 2003 and
                   10.9% thereafter. These minimum and maximum rates are
                   determined based on formulas specified in the borrowing
                   agreement. Each of the seven mortgaged properties of the
                   Partnership is cross-collateralized under the terms of the
                   agreement.

                   The Partnership also has a 20.98% interest in the
                   residual interest of the trust fund and will be entitled to
                   receive a pro-rata share of the proceeds of the remaining
                   assets of the trust fund after the principal balance of the
                   regular security holders have been paid. The residual
                   interest of the trust fund is a separate legal entity and is
                   organized as a Limited Liability Corporation ("LLC") for
                   federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
                   the Partnership's equity in the LLC was $998,995 and
                   $500,896, respectively, which was determined using a method
                   similar to the equity method of accounting. Under this
                   method, the investment is carried in the accompanying balance
                   sheets at an amount which approximates the Partnership's
                   equity in the underlying net assets of the LLC. The
                   Partnership recognizes its share of the net income of the LLC
                   for financial statement purposes in the statements of income.
                   During 1995 and 1994, $498,099 and $500,896, respectively,
                   was recognized in the statements of income.

5. RELATED PARTY   MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
   TRANSACTIONS
                   The Partnership has an agreement with an affiliate of
                   the general partner to manage the properties owned by the
                   Partnership. The management agreement is automatically
                   renewable annually, but may be terminated by either party
                   upon sixty days written notice. The property management fee
                   is the lesser of 5% of annual gross receipts from the
                   properties managed, or the amount which would be payable to
                   an unaffiliated third party for comparable services.

                   REPORT OF FEES

                   During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                   the affiliate earned property management fees of $524,609,
                   $523,331 and $503,855, respectively, as permitted in the
                   Agreement of Limited Partnership. These operating expenses
                   are included with "Administrative" expenses in the respective
                   statements of income.  The Partnership was owed $37,677 and
                   $9,469 by the affiliate at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
                   respectively, for overpayments made. Certain employees of the
                   Partnership are also employees of affiliates of the general
                   partner. These employees were paid by the Partnership
                   $164,657, $119,734 and $109,536 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                   respectively, to perform local property management and
                   investor relations services for the Partnership.

                   During 1994, the Partnership paid approximately $161,000
                   to an affiliate, representing an accrued incentive
                   acquisition fee.

                   CONTINGENT PURCHASE PRICE

                   A general partner of Genesis Associates Limited
                   Partnership has an interest in the sellers of two of the
                   properties acquired by the Partnership and is entitled to
                   share in a contingent purchase price with respect to these
                   properties, when and if the properties are sold and the
                   sellers become entitled thereto. The actual amounts to be
                   received, if any, will depend upon the results of the
                   Partnership's operations and the amounts received upon the
                   sale, financing or other disposition of the properties and
                   are not determinable at this time. The Partnership does not
                   anticipate any such amount will become payable during the
                   next fiscal year.

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7. PARTNERS'       Subject to the orders of priority under certain specified 
   CAPITAL         conditions more fully described in the Agreement of Limited
                   Partnership, distributions of partnership funds and 
                   allocations of net income from operations are principally
                   determined as follows:

                   DISTRIBUTIONS

                   Distributable cash from operations in the Agreement
                   (generally defined as net income plus depreciation and
                   amortization) is to be distributed to unit holders until they
                   have received a 10% cumulative preferred return. After the
                   unit holders have received their 10% cumulative preferred
                   return, all remaining cash from operations is distributed to
                   the general partner until the total amount received by the
                   general partner is equal to 15% of the aggregate amount of
                   cash distributed from operations in a given year. Amounts
                   payable to but not paid to the general partner will be
                   accumulated and paid from future capital transactions after
                   the unit holders have first received their 10% preferred
                   return and 125% of their capital contributions. Thereafter,
                   85% of distributable cash from operations is to be paid to
                   the unit holders and 15% to the general partner.

                   Annual distributable cash from operations was less than
                   the amount required for the annual 10% preferred return to
                   the unit holders by approximately $3,456,000 in 1995 and
                   $3,833,000 in 1994. No distributions can be made to the
                   general partner until the cumulative preferred return deficit
                   of approximately $7,289,000 has been distributed to the unit
                   holders.

                   At December 31, 1995, the unpaid amount to be
                   distributed to the general partner from future capital
                   transactions was approximately $5.3 million.

                   ALLOCATION OF NET INCOME

                   Net income is principally allocated 99% to the unit
                   holders and 1% to the general partner until the cumulative
                   amount of net income allocated to the unit holders equals the
                   aggregate cumulative amount of cash distributable to the unit
                   holders.  After sufficient net income has been allocated to
                   the unit holders to equal the amount of cash distributable to
                   them, all the net income is to be allocated to the general
                   partner until it equals the amount of cash distributed to it.

                   1996 ESTIMATED NET ASSET VALUE OF UNITS

Based on the March 1996 appraisal of the Partnership's properties, the General
Partner has calculated the estimated net asset value of each Unit, based on the
following assumptions:

- -    Sale of the Properties in March 1996 for their appraised value.
- -    Costs and selling expenses are 3.0% of the sale price.
- -    Tax consequences of a sale are not taken into consideration.

The estimated net asset value of each unit, assuming the sale of the properties
at their present appraised value is $12.31 and is calculated as follows:
