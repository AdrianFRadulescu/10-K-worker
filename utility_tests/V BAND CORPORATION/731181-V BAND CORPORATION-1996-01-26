Item 1.       Business

General

V Band Corporation,  which commenced business operations in 1980, (together with
its  subsidiaries,  the "Company") is a leading supplier of instant access voice
communications  systems.  These  systems  include  sophisticated  communications
workstations,  switching  equipment,  peripheral  products,  project management,
technical  services and WAN solutions.  V Band's  products and services are used
worldwide by financial services  organizations for the trading of stocks,  bonds
and other financial instruments. Other applications include the mission critical
communications requirements of the electric power industry and emergency service
providers.

The largest share of the Company's  sales derives from the sale of voice trading
systems to the financial services industry.  Traders and dealers require instant
access communication to a large constituency,  including peers,  customers,  and
market  information  providers.  In contrast to conventional  business telephone
systems,  voice trading systems utilize more network access lines than telephone
handsets.  Each workstation  provides the user with immediate push button access
to as  few as 30  and  as  many  as 320  telephone  lines  along  with a  visual
indication of the current  operational  status of each line. The Company's voice
trading systems offer a distributed  switching  architecture  (without a central
controller) and full software control for ease of moves, additions, and changes.
Other  markets for these  systems  include  government  and  military  agencies,
emergency  service E9-1-1  dispatch  centers,  power  utilities,  airlines,  and
railroads.

Through  a  subsidiary,   Licom,  Inc.  ("Licom"),  the  Company  also  designs,
manufactures   and  sells  fiber   optic-based   voice  and  data   multiplexers
specifically designed for the "mission critical"  communications of the electric
power industry, such as inter-substation communications. Other markets for Licom
multiplexers   include  command  and  control  applications  for  "right-of-way"
companies  such  as  utilities  and   transportation,   and  emergency   service
organizations.

In 1994, the Company completed the  transformation of its distribution  channels
into a direct sales and service  network in the United States and United Kingdom
with the acquisition of certain assets of four unrelated companies  distributing
and/or servicing the Company's  products.  The acquisitions of certain assets of
Windmill  Communications,  Inc.  ("WCI")  and  Advantage  Communications,  Inc.,
("ACI") in the United States,  provided the Company with a service  presence and
increased  its sales  strengths  in the New York City and  Boston  markets.  The
acquisitions of Mercury Dealing Systems ("MDS"),  formerly known as TR Financial
Communications  plc, and certain assets of ACT Computer  Support,  Ltd., both in
the United Kingdom,  increased the Company's  sales and service  presence in the
London market.  These  acquisitions  advanced the Company's  strategy to enhance
market  share  through the direct sale and full service of its  products,  which
includes project management, maintenance and other services in the United States
and United Kingdom. The Company utilizes a network of international distributors
to provide sales and service support in other global markets.  In addition,  the
Company further  expanded its direct sales and service  activities in the United
States by opening offices in Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco.

The MDS  operation,  which was  acquired in July 1994 and carries on business in
the  United  Kingdom  under the name of V Band PLC,  performs  assembly,  sales,
installation  and  maintenance  services.  For the fiscal year ended October 31,
1995, V Band PLC had sales of approximately $8.1 million. At October 31, 1995, V
Band  PLC had 52  employees.  See  Note 4 --  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for management's  pro forma financial  estimates of the impact of the
MDS  acquisition on the Company's  statements of operations,  if the acquisition
had occurred on November 1, 1992.

During fiscal 1995, the Company  executed an agreement with the Chicago Board of
Trade for the sale and  installation  of a major  trading  floor  communications
system  that  includes   approximately  1,700  custom-designed   exchange  floor
telephones  and  various  peripheral   equipment  in  transactions   valued,  in
aggregate,  at over $9 million.  The exchange  phones  employ the same  advanced
technology  base used in the  Company's  Power  Deck  product.  The  Company  is
providing full installation  services,  including project management and cabling
for the 9,000 line communication system. Construction of the trading floor began
in the  Company's  second  fiscal  quarter of 1995 and the first group of phones
were  installed  and  activated  in July 1995.  The  project is  expected  to be
completed by the end of fiscal 1996.  The Company  recognizes  revenue from this
contract under the percentage-of-completion method.

On October 11, 1995 the Company  announced  that it had engaged the  services of
the New York investment  banking firm of Benedetto,  Gartland & Greene,  Inc. to
assist the Company in the  exploration  of various  strategic  alternatives  for
maximizing shareholder value.

Products and Markets

The Company  introduced its first voice trading system in 1981.  Since then, the
Company has developed,  manufactured and distributed  several new generations of
systems, increasing power, features and flexibility,  while reducing repair cost
and space requirements.

In June 1990, the Company  introduced the industry's  first all digital console,
the VIAX DN. Digital connectivity reduces network costs,  improves  reliability,
and offers users the ability to program their station options  directly from the
console.  Digital  technology  has sharply  reduced the space  required  for the
common  equipment.  The Company's  current digital system,  the "Broad Band DN",
requires as little as  one-eighth  of the space that was required by the systems
first introduced in 1987.

In  1993,  the  Company   introduced  Power  Deck,  a  highly  advanced  digital
communications  workstation  for the  financial  community.  The Power Deck user
interface  is fully  compatible  with the  Company's  Broad  Band DN  technology
platform,  and  features  state-of-the-art  surface  mount  design.  Significant
innovations   include  a  high  resolution   graphics  display,   enhanced  user
programmability  and an ergonomically  designed  detachable keypad that improves
productivity and gives users precise control of critical phone functions.

In 1995,  the Company  introduced  Broad Band DN which is the latest  generation
distributed  digital  switch.  Broad Band DN is built on a high-speed  computing
platform  allowing  direct  connection  to the digital  facilities of the public
network and providing  digital  connectivity to the desktop.  The system's basic
architecture  allows for software  feature  enhancements and reduces the risk of
future obsolescence.  The administration  software empowers the user with system
control and configuration capability, allows diagnostic reporting, and eases the
ability to perform  moves,  adds,  and  changes  from a personal  computer.  The
Company's  digital  trading  consoles give the users access to all system lines,
paperless  button  labeling and fully  programmable  loudspeaker  monitoring  of
multiple lines simultaneously.

Additionally  in  1995,  the  Company  introduced  DXi,  a  high  speed  digital
communications  console.  The DXi is fully  compatible  with the Company's Broad
Band DN  technology  platform and employs the same base  technology as the Power
Deck. The Company also  introduced  its eXchange Phone which is currently  being
installed  at the  Chicago  Board of  Trade.  The  eXchange  Phone  employs  the
technology  base of the Power Deck product  line.  The eXchange  Phone  provides
state-of-the-art  telecommunications  designed  specifically  for the hectic and
demanding  environment  of an  exchange.  The eXchange  Phone was  ergonomically
designed to optimize  trading floor space and maintain high  efficiency  for the
member brokers.

In 1995,  the  Company  introduced  a suite of highly  sophisticated  networking
products  and tools  designed  to address  the needs of its  current  and future
customers.   These  products,   Global   Switching   Module  ("GSM"),   WAN  ONE
inter-networking  products,  PassPort Network  Management  Platform and F.A.S.T.
(Fast Access  Support  Technology),  represent  the leading  edge in  networking
capabilities for the financial trading environment.

GSM allows firms to take advantage of advanced communications architectures such
as ATM. The GSM, which employs a one gigabit switch for information  throughput,
can support a trading floor with over 2,400 user consoles and delivers access to
over 16,000 lines without system blocking.

The WAN ONE  product  enables  remote  trading  floor  communication  systems to
operate as if they were located  together.  For  example,  traders in London can
have instant,  local access to lines in New York,  Canada, or virtually anywhere
in the world.  The Company believes WAN ONE is the foundation for remote trading
and advanced network services of the next generation.

The PassPort Network Management Platform is a sophisticated  UNIX-based suite of
tools that controls and maintains large systems in a cost-effective manner. True
multi-tasking  and  simultaneous  multi-user  operations will allow large system
managers to effectively  administer  distributed trading systems across existing
corporate  LANs and WANs.  Higher level  protocols  such as SNMP,  CMIP/CMIS and
TCP/IP are all capable of being addressed.

The Company's F.A.S.T.  service enables service  technicians to troubleshoot and
modify system parameters remotely through phone lines, thereby increasing system
performance.   Management  believes  that  F.A.S.T.  constitutes  a  competitive
advantage and no competitors have introduced similar service technology.

Through  Licom's  product  ProMX,  the  Company is a leading  supplier  of fiber
optic-based  multiplexers  to the  electric  power  industry.  The  ProMX  is an
integrated,  modular  multiplexing  unit  designed to carry  "mission  critical"
communications and operate in circumstances and physical  environments for which
conventional  equipment is not usually  designed to withstand.  ProMX interfaces
with protective relays, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), voice,
data and  telemetry.  The ProMX units,  or nodes,  communicate  with fiber optic
networks at data transmission rates of 1.544 million bits per second (T1), 2.048
million bits per second (E1) or 51.84 million bits per second (SONET OC1). ProMX
nodes,  common in  transmission  substations,  are often  located  together with
console  systems  equipment  in the  command  center.  Licom,  based in Herndon,
Virginia, continues to develop, market, test, ship and support the ProMX product
line,  which is manufactured by a contract  manufacturer.  In 1995, sales to the
electric power industry were 11% of the Company's sales.

Product Development

The Company's product development strategy is to continually improve its current
product lines and to develop  advanced new products and technologies to meet the
evolving needs of the markets it serves.  The Company's  emphasis is on software
and features that  facilitate the  integration of computer  networks and digital
voice systems within the trading floor environment.

During 1995, the Company  developed and  implemented the second phase of the WAN
ONE product, which enables traders at remote sites, globally, to share telephone
lines and line  status  as if they were in the same  location.  In  addition,  a
remote system administration  function was developed which allows modifications,
or moves,  adds and changes  (MAC's),  to be performed  from a remote  location.
Combined  with  the  Company's  F.A.S.T.  remote  system  servicing  and WAN ONE
capabilities, the Company can provide service and enhancements to the customer's
system from remote locations.

The Company  developed the APL (Audio Processing Line) card, which increases the
capacity of telephone  lines that can be handled by each Broad Band DN node,  by
combining the AP-ACC (Audio Processing-Analog Control Card) and ALC (Analog Line
Card) cards into a single card.  Also,  a new speaker  interface  was  developed
which allows  speakers to be dynamically  programmed from the Power Deck and DXi
consoles.  The Company also  developed an ISDN PRI (private rate  interface) for
Broad Band DN, advanced intercom features for its digital trading consoles and a
speakerphone for its Power Deck trading console.

During  1995,  the  Company   finalized  the   development  of  several  product
initiatives  that were  undertaken in 1994,  such as DXi, a new digital  trading
console that features an internal  speaker phone and a  streamlined,  high-speed
trader  interface;  PassPort,  a  sophisticated  UNIX-based  suite of tools that
maintains large systems in a  cost-effective  manner;  and the Global  Switching
Module,  which employs a one gigabit switch, can unite up to 2,400 digital voice
trading  stations and is the  centerpoint of the Company's  Large System Support
package.

The Company is researching  ATM  (Asynchronous  Transfer Mode)  technology as it
applies to the trading room.  Application  development  efforts also continue on
CTI  (Computer  Telephone  Integration),  which  unites  the  computer  and  the
telephone,  and will serve as the  enabling  technology  for ATM in the  trading
room.  The Company has  deployed  CTI at several  customer  sites  during  1995,
utilizing various client database applications.

The Company continues to develop hardware and software enhancements to its ProMX
product line such as the  development  of an interface for  Synchronous  Optical
Network  (SONET),  an  international   standard  for  very  high  speed  digital
communications.

During the years ended October 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  the  Company's  annual
research and development  expenditures were $3.9 million,  $3.3 million and $3.3
million or 13%, 11% and 13% of sales, respectively.

Sales, Service and Distribution

In 1994, the Company completed the  transformation of its distribution  channels
into a direct sales and service  network in the United States and United Kingdom
with the acquisition of certain assets of four unrelated companies  distributing
and or servicing the Company's products.  These business  acquisitions  provided
the Company with a service  presence and increased its sales strength in the New
York City, Boston and London markets.  These acquisitions advanced the Company's
strategy to enhance market share through the direct sale and full service of its
products,  which includes project management,  maintenance and other services in
the United States and United Kingdom.

The Company  currently  maintains  direct sales and service  centers in New York
City,  Boston,  Chicago,  San  Francisco,  Atlanta and London to provide  sales,
services  and  support to  customers  in the United  States and London  markets.
Through these centers, the Company sells equipment,  including  modifications to
existing systems,  and support  services,  including  maintenance  contracts and
project management.

The Company  utilizes a network of  international  distributors to deliver sales
and service  support in other global markets,  such as Canada,  the Pacific Rim,
South America and Europe. Licom uses direct sales,  service,  project management
and  maintenance  in  the  United  States  and  Canada,   and  uses  independent
distributors for international sales.

Sales to Morgan  Guaranty Trust Company of New York and  affiliates  represented
14%,  14% and 5% of sales in 1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively.  In  addition,
sales to the Chicago  Board of Trade  represented  13% of sales in 1995.  During
1993, there was no customer that represented 10% or more of the Company's sales.

Equipment sales,  excluding  Licom's ProMX,  consisting of new systems installed
and modifications to existing systems, in all markets, were $20.5 million, $23.0
million and $21.2 million,  representing 69%, 74% and 82% of the Company's sales
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Licom sales represented 11%, 13%, and 10%
of the Company's  sales in 1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Service  sales,
which consist of maintenance contract sales, support,  service and miscellaneous
repairs  accounted  for 20%,  13%, and 8% of sales  during 1995,  1994 and 1993,
respectively.

The Company's  foreign sales for 1995,  1994 and 1993 were $10.5  million,  $8.7
million  and  $7.3  million,  or  36%,  27%  and  28%,  respectively,  of  total
consolidated sales. For further information  regarding foreign sales, see Note 8
- -- Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's sales of systems for application in "non-financial" communications
control centers of utilities,  railroads and other  "right-of-way"  companies as
well as E9-1-1 emergency  service centers and  government/military  applications
were, in the aggregate,  13%, 16% and 16% of the Company's  sales for 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

Manufacturing and Sources of Supply

During 1995, the Company restructured its manufacturing operations to reduce the
cost of its  products by  out-sourcing  the  production  of its printed  circuit
boards. As part of this restructuring,  the Company significantly down-sized its
production  facility by  relocating  its  operations,  in July 1995, to a 15,000
square foot facility in Elmsford,  New York,  from its former 67,000 square foot
facility  in  Yonkers,  New York,  for which  the  lease had  expired.  This new
facility houses the Company's  purchasing,  production control,  final assembly,
quality  control and testing  operations.  The lease for the  Elmsford  facility
expires in 2001, with an option to extend to 2003.

The Company  currently uses three outside  subcontractors to manufacture most of
its custom-fabricated, printed circuit boards.  The Company provides the product
designs,  engineering, bill of materials  and testing  procedures  to ensure the
suppliers meet the Company's quality and reliability standards. The Company will
be able to  further  reduce  its  product  cost  due to the  economies  of scale
afforded by the outside contractors in the purchase of components, after current
inventories are consumed.

The  Company's  Licom  subsidiary  performs  final  assembly  of  sub-assemblies
received  from one of the  Company's  outside  contractors,  tests and ships the
product at its headquarters in Herndon,  Virginia.  Licom relocated its facility
during 1995 to a nearby location,  which provides better utilization.  The lease
for this facility expires in 2000 with an option to extend for five years.

The  Company's  United  Kingdom  manufacturing  operation,  consisting  of final
assembly  product and addition of local  content and testing,  is located at its
facility in Beckton,  England,  approximately 20 miles southeast of London.  The
lease for this facility expires in 2005.

The Company  believes that relations with its  subcontractors  and suppliers are
good.  Most  components  and parts used in the Company's  products are available
from a number of different  sources.  A few components  are currently  available
from a single source of supply. The Company believes that alternative components
should be readily  available;  however,  there can be no assurance  that, in the
event of a supply shortage, such components will be available in the quality and
quantity  necessary to meet the Company's  needs.  To date,  the Company has not
experienced  any  significant  delays in the  delivery of  material  from either
subcontractors or vendors. The Company seeks to maintain inventory in quantities
sufficient to ship products within four to eight weeks of receipt of orders.

Patents

In 1994,  the Company was  granted a U.S.  patent  relating to the design of the
Power Deck  console  systems.  In 1993,  the Company  was granted a U.S.  patent
relating  to the design of the VIAX DN console  systems.  In 1992,  the  Company
received  patents  on its  system  digital  switch  architecture  and its  power
supplies.

The Company  believes that patent  protection  for its designs could enhance its
ability  to  successfully  market its  product  technology  at  reduced  risk to
competitors'  imitation of the Company's products.  However, no assurance can be
given  that  any  patent  issued  will  effectively  limit  competition  for the
Company's  products and the Company's  protection of its market position through
technological  development  has, to date,  derived  primarily from the Company's
ability to keep secret its  proprietary  information  and knowledge.  The unique
design  features of the Company's  products may be  susceptible  to discovery by
third  persons who have access to such  products.  Technological  changes in the
telephone  terminal  equipment  industry  occur  rapidly  and  new  patents  are
constantly  being issued for products sold in the industry.  No assurance can be
made that claims  will not be brought  against  the  Company  alleging  that the
Company's products,  or aspects thereof,  infringe on competitors'  patents. The
Company has no such claims pending. The Company seeks to protect its proprietary
rights to computer  software through  copyright,  non-disclosure  agreements and
software licenses.

Distributor Support and Warranty Policy

The Company's service personnel, together with third-party service firms engaged
by the Company or by the Company's customers,  perform all necessary maintenance
of products  sold by the Company or by its  distributors,  including  components
manufactured   by  others.   The  Company   performs   maintenance  and  assists
distributors and third-party  maintenance  companies under its standard warranty
policy.  The Company generally  warrants its products to be free from defects in
material and  workmanship for a period of one year from the date of installation
and repairs or replaces  defective products under warranty without charge to its
customers.

Competition

The market for the  Company's  products  is highly  competitive.  The  Company's
industry is characterized by advanced technology, rapid change and broad product
support.  Many of the  Company's  competitors,  both in the  United  States  and
globally,  are large  companies that  manufacture and distribute a wide range of
telephone  products,  and provide services such as installation and maintenance.
Management believes that the competitive factors in its product lines are price,
quality,  reliability,  product innovation, timely delivery, service and product
support.

The  Company's  largest  competitor  in the  United  States  is IPC  Information
Systems,  Inc.  ("IPCI",  formerly  known as Contel  IPC,  Inc.).  In the United
Kingdom,  the Company  competes  with British  Telecom  plc,  IPCI and Wyatts (a
subsidiary  of  Reuters  Holdings  plc).  The  Company  believes  that these two
markets, the United States and United Kingdom, comprise 65% of the global market
of the Company's  product.  The  competitors in markets served by ProMX products
are primarily RFL  Technologies,  Pulsar  Technologies,  Centronics  Division of
NORTEL and ASEA Brown Boveri.

Backlog

As of October 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Company's  backlog of purchase orders
that management  believes to be firm was $10.5 million,  $2.8 million,  and $5.1
million,  respectively.  The Company  expects to deliver all  products  from its
October 31, 1995 backlog  during  fiscal 1996.  The Company  generally  delivers
large system  configured  products to customers within six to eight weeks of its
receipt of firm orders.  Where the Company makes direct end-user  installations,
deliveries  generally  occur four to eight  weeks from  receipt of firm  orders.
Management  does  not  believe  that  the  Company's  backlog  is  a  meaningful
indication of future sales.

Employees

As of October 31, 1995, the Company had 241 full-time employees, of whom 48 were
product  development  personnel,  66 were production  personnel,  84 were sales,
marketing and service support  personnel and 43 were  administrative  personnel.
This  compares to 288 at October 31, 1994.  The decrease from 1994 was primarily
attributable  to a  restructuring  of the  Company's  manufacturing  operations.
Subsequent to year-end, the Company further reduced its personnel to 216, with a
restructuring of production and administrative personnel.

Many of the Company's employees are highly skilled,  and the Company's continued
success  will  depend,  in part,  on its  ability  to attract  and  retain  such
employees.  None  of  the  Company's  employees  are  covered  by  a  collective
bargaining agreement; however, five of the Company's employees, all of whom work
in the Boston service center, are members of a local collective bargaining unit.
The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.


Item 2.       Properties

The Company's  executive  offices and  engineering  facilities of  approximately
22,800 square feet, located at 565 Taxter Road, Elmsford,  New York, are subject
to a lease expiring in February 1999, with an option to further extend the lease
until February 2003. The Company, during 1995, relocated its production facility
from its 67,000 square foot facility in Yonkers,  New York, and currently leases
approximately 15,000 square feet at Three Westchester Plaza, Elmsford, New York,
where it conducts its assembly and quality  assurance  operations,  subject to a
lease expiring in 2001, with an option to renew into 2003.

During 1995, the Company  relocated its Licom  headquarters to a nearby facility
in Herndon,  Virginia.  The new facility consists of approximately  8,600 square
feet of office and production  space with a lease expiring in June 2000, with an
option to renew for five years.

The Company  leases office and  production  space related to its United  Kingdom
operation.  The Company has  exercised an option to  terminate  the sales office
lease of  approximately  1,700 square feet located in London  effective May 1996
and is  currently  pursuing  alternative  locations to lease office space in the
same area in London.  The production  facility and  administrative  offices with
approximately  20,000 square feet located  within 20 miles  southeast of London,
are subject to a lease expiring in 2005.

Leases  for  the  domestic   sales  and  service   support   locations   include
approximately: 5,900 and 2,500 square feet located in New York City, expiring in
April 1997 and July 1999,  respectively;  1,300  square feet  located in Boston,
Massachusetts,  expiring  in April  1996;  and,  1,800  square  feet in Chicago,
Illinois,  expiring  in  November  1996.  Subsequent  to the fiscal year end the
company  extended  its  lease  for  1,800  square  feet of  office  space in San
Francisco, California, for one year to expire in December 1996;

Management believes that all of its facilities are in good condition and working
order and have adequate capacity to meet its needs for the foreseeable future.


Item 3.       Legal Proceedings

In October 1994,  the Company  commenced an action against  Technical  Telephone
Systems, Inc. ("TTSI") in New York State Supreme Court,  Westchester County, for
minimum  payments  due  to the  Company  in  the  amount  of  $650,000  under  a
distribution  agreement  between the Company and TTSI.  In November  1994,  TTSI
filed a counterclaim  against the Company denying all allegations  stated in the
Company's  complaint and alleging a breach of good faith and fair dealing by the
Company,  claiming damages of $1 million. The Company believes its claim against
TTSI is meritorious and believes TTSI's counterclaim against the Company,  which
the Company will vigorously defend, is without merit.

There are no other material pending legal proceedings as of December 31, 1995.


Item 4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth fiscal
quarter of the year ended October 31, 1995.

* Presented as a percentage of the related sales categories.


Sales

Sales for the year ended October 31, 1995 were $29.4 million, a $1.7 million, or
5%, decrease from sales for 1994. The decrease in sales was  attributable to the
decrease in equipment  sales.  Equipment  sales for the year,  which include new
equipment  installations  plus moves,  adds and changes for customers'  existing
systems,  were $23.5 million in 1995 as compared to $27.0 in 1994.  Sales of the
Company's Power Deck product increased from $2.6 million in 1994 to $9.9 million
in 1995, or a 281% increase as product migration continued in favor of the Power
Deck and away from older products.  Sales for the Company's older products, Viax
DN and Viax  Analog,  decreased  from $19.0  million in 1994 to $9.4  million in
1995, or a 51% decrease.  Sales for the Company's Licom ProMX product  decreased
from $3.3 million to $3.1 million,  or 6%,  primarily due to higher  discounting
for the  product.  Service  sales  increased  from $4.1  million in 1994 to $5.8
million  in  1995,  or a 39%  increase  reflecting  the  transformation  of  the
Company's distribution channels to a direct sales and service network.

Sales in 1995 to non-financial customers (i.e.,  government agencies,  airlines,
public  utilities)  accounted for $3.7 million,  or 13% of sales, a $1.1 million
decrease  from 1994  non-financial  customer  sales.  The  decrease  was related
primarily  to lower sales of specially  enhanced  E9-1-1  products  made under a
contract with a division of AT&T which expired in 1994.

Sales for the year ended October 31, 1994 were $31.1 million,  a $5.4 million or
a 21%  increase  over sales for 1993.  The  increase  in sales was  attributable
primarily to the  introduction  of the Company's  latest user interface  product
named Power Deck, of $2.6 million.  In addition,  service sales increase of $2.1
million,  from $2.0  million in 1993 to $4.1 million in 1994,  was  attributable
primarily  to the sales and service  operations  acquired in 1994.  Furthermore,
sales for  Licom's  ProMX  product  increased  $.6  million,  or 18%, in 1994 as
compared to 1993.

Sales in 1994 to non-financial customers (i.e.,  government agencies,  airlines,
public  utilities)  accounted for $4.8 million,  or 15% of sales,  a $.8 million
increase  from 1993  non-financial  customer  sales.  The  increase  was related
primarily to increased business in the power utilities industry, offset by lower
E9-1-1 product sales.

Since the Company sells product to its foreign  customers  and  distributors  in
U.S. dollars,  it is unaffected by currency  translations.  The Company's United
Kingdom operations transacts sales in pounds sterling or US dollars. Those sales
transacted in pounds sterling were not materially  impacted by foreign  exchange
rate  fluctuations  during  1995 or 1994.  The Company  has,  from time to time,
hedged foreign currency transactions when deemed necessary.

Reflecting the transformation of the Company's  distribution channels from third
party distributors to a direct sales and service network,  $24.1 million, or 82%
of total  sales were  direct in 1995,  as  compared  to $21.5  million and $13.5
million, or 70% and 53% of sales in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Gross Profit Margins

Gross  profit  margins  were 19% in 1995 as compared  to 42% in 1994.  Equipment
gross profit  margins were 12% in 1995, as compared to 45% in 1994. The decrease
in equipment gross profit margins was attributable primarily to three factors --
$3.8 million of special  fourth quarter  expense  adjustments,  a  manufacturing
restructuring program initiated by the Company, and competitive  discounting for
the Company's product.

The Company  recorded  several special fourth quarter 1995 expense  adjustments,
including a $2.3 million increase in inventory reserves related to older product
lines, a $.9 million  write-off of an intangible  asset related to a license for
product technology no longer used, a $.3 million of inventory charges, and a $.3
million increase in warranty reserves.  Additionally,  the Company  restructured
its production operations during the year from an internal manufacturing process
to one which relies to a  significant  extent on  out-sourcing  of the Company's
sub-assemblies.   This  transition  process  yielded   significant   unfavorable
manufacturing variances during the year. Also, the Company found it necessary to
offer larger discounts for its products in order to meet competitive challenges.

Service gross profit margins increased to 52%, in 1995 from 28% in 1994. Service
sales  increased  39%  over  1994  levels  as  the  Company  transformed  from a
distributor  based network to that of a direct sales and service network,  while
the service  cost of sales  decreased  6%, due to economies of scales and better
efficiencies brought about by a larger customer base.

Gross  profit  margins  were 42% in both 1994 and 1993.  Equipment  gross profit
margins  improved  to 45%, in 1994,  from 41%, in 1993,  as a result of a higher
sales volume of the  Company's  Power Deck and VIAX DN product  which  typically
earn higher gross margins, combined with the effect of direct sales resulting in
higher gross margins and success of cost containment  efforts in  manufacturing.
Service  gross  profit  margins  declined  to 28%, in 1994 from 56% in 1993 as a
result of a lower percentage of high-margin  repair service sales,  coupled with
costs related to the integration of the Company's newly transformed direct sales
and service network developed largely through acquisitions.

Total operating expenses for 1995 increased to $17.0 million, representing a 33%
increase from $12.8 million for 1994.  Operating  expenses as a percent of sales
were  58% in  1995  as  compared  to 41%  in  1994.  The  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses  increase as a percentage  of sales to 45% in 1995 from
31% in 1994 was  attributable  primarily to the costs of the service  businesses
acquired in 1994,  combined with non-recurring  charges related to the Company's
restructuring during the year.

Total operating expenses for 1994 increased to $12.8 million,  representing a 3%
increase from $12.4 million for 1993.  Operating  expenses as a percent of sales
were 41% in 1994 as compared to 48% in 1993. Selling, general and administrative
expenses  decreased as a percentage  of sales from 35% in 1993 to 31% in 1994 as
the  equipment and service  sales,  derived from the business  acquisitions  and
product  introductions,  increased 21%, while the related fixed  operating costs
increased 13%.  Although research and development costs were consistent with the
1993 level of $3.3 million,  the sales increase of 21% from 1993 to 1994 brought
research and  development  expenses  down to 11% of sales in 1994 as compared to
13% of sales in 1993.

Selling,  general and  administrative  costs for 1995  increased $3.6 million to
$13.1 million, or 38%, from $9.5 million in 1994. Of the increase,  $2.4 million
was attributable to the full year impact of the Company's  London,  New York and
Boston sales and service  center  operations  which were  acquired  during 1994.
Additionally, the Company exercised its right to terminate its current lease for
67,000 square feet of manufacturing space in Yonkers, New York,  relocating to a
15,000 square foot production and assembly  facility in Elmsford,  New York. The
Company  recorded a $.4 million  non-recurring  restructuring  charge related to
expenses to be incurred  and assets to be disposed of during the  transition  of
the  manufacturing  facility  to the new  location.  Additionally,  the  Company
further   restructured  its   manufacturing,   engineering  and   administrative
departments,  resulting in a severance accrual and other  miscellaneous costs at
year-end of $.8 million.

Selling,  general and administrative costs for 1994 increased 5% to $9.5 million
from  $9.1  million  in  1993.  In  1994,  the  level of  selling,  general  and
administrative  costs was  positively  affected by a reversal  of the  remaining
relocation  reserve of $.4 million,  originally  established in 1990,  which was
attributable  to the  renegotiation  of the  lease  at the  Company's  executive
offices.  Additionally,  in 1993 the Company recorded a non-recurring  executive
severance  charge of $.5  million  and an increase in reserves of $.2 million on
potentially  uncollectible  accounts and notes receivable.  When excluding these
aforementioned non-recurring items, selling, general and administrative expenses
increased in 1994 by $1.5  million,  or 13%, over 1993,  which was  attributable
primarily  to  increased  expenses  as a result  of the  newly-acquired  service
operations in Boston and New York and  manufacturing  and service  operations in
the United Kingdom.

Research  and  development  expenses  for  1995 of $3.9  million  increased  $.6
million, or 18%, from $3.3 million in 1994. Research and development expenses as
a percent of sales  increased to 13% in 1995,  as compared to 11% in 1994.  This
increase  was a result  of the  development  of the new  products  and  services
introduced  during the latter part of the year including DXi, Broad Band DN, WAN
ONE and the exchange  phone,  which is being  installed at the Chicago  Board of
Trade.

Research and development  expenses for 1994, $3.3 million,  remained at the 1993
levels. Research and development expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 11%
in 1994,  as compared to 13% in 1993.  This  decrease was a result of developing
the final stages of the Power Deck in 1993, while sales for that product did not
occur until 1994. Additionally, service sales, which increased from $2.0 million
in 1993 to $4.1  million  in  1994,  do not  require  significant  research  and
development related expenditures.

Other Income and Expense

Net investment  income for 1995 was $.1 million,  a decrease of $.3 million from
1994.  The decrease  was  attributable  primarily to the decrease in  marketable
securities,  of which  $4.2  million  was used to fund the  current  year's  net
operating loss and net realized losses on certain securities sold.

Net investment  income for 1994 was $.4 million,  a decrease of $.2 million from
1993.  The decrease  was  attributable  primarily to the decrease in  marketable
securities,   of  which  $4.4  million  was  used  for  the  Company's  business
acquisitions.

Provision for Income Taxes

Effective   November  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),  "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under
SFAS 109, the deferred tax provision is determined  under the liability  method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized,  based on
differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of
assets and liabilities  using presently enacted tax rates. The cumulative effect
of the  adoption of SFAS 109 as of November 1, 1993,  was  $1,242,000,  net of a
valuation allowance of $150,000.  There was no change in the valuation allowance
during 1994.  During 1995 the Company recorded an additional  deferred tax asset
of $4,325,000 and also recorded an additional valuation allowance of $4,876,000.
The total valuation  allowance as of October 31, 1995 of $5,026,000  reduces the
deferred tax asset to the amount that  management  believes  will  ultimately be
realized.  During  1995,  the  Company  reversed  $250,000  of prior  years' tax
accruals which are no longer  required.  The Company's  1995,  1994 and 1993 tax
provisions  of $301,000,  $150,000 and $50,000  reflect  effective  tax rates of
(3)%, 19%, and (5)%, respectively.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

For 1995, the Company recorded a net loss of $11.6 million,  or $2.18 per share,
as  compared  to net  income  of $.6  million,  or $.12 per  share,  before  the
cumulative  effect in 1994 of the accounting  change for income taxes, and a net
loss of $1.1 million in 1993,  or $.21 per share.  Inclusive  of the  cumulative
effect of the accounting change, net income was $1.9 million, or $.35 per share,
in 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In order to meet its liquidity  demands during fiscal 1996, the Company may seek
to obtain a credit facility from a lending institution.  The Company has no debt
outstanding  and  believes  it will be able to obtain a credit  facility  which,
together  with other  resources,  would  provide  sufficient  liquidity  to meet
projected requirements.

The Company's  aggregate of cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities at
October 31,  1995,  declined  $4.8  million,  to $2.9  million,  compared to the
balances reported at October 31, 1994. This decline was largely  attributable to
the use of funds to support the Chicago Board of Trade  contract and to fund the
net operating loss.  Inventory,  net of accounts payable decreased $2.1 million,
from $8.2  million  in 1994 to $6.1  million  in 1995,  as the  Company  reduced
inventory as part of the Company's restructuring plans during the year. Accounts
receivable decreased $2.9 million,  from $7.7 million in 1994 to $4.8 million in
1995,  primarily  attributable  to a decrease  in fourth  quarter  sales of $2.3
million for 1995 as compared to 1994.  Capital  expenditures were $.9 million in
1995 as compared to $.6 million in 1994.

The Company's  aggregate of cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities at
October  31,  1994  declined  $6.4  million,  to $7.7  million,  compared to the
balances reported at October 31, 1993. This decline was largely  attributable to
the use of funds for business acquisitions made in 1994. In addition,  inventory
balances  increased to support the  introduction  of Power Deck and the multiple
inventory locations to support direct sales and maintenance customers.  Accounts
receivable  balances  increased  as a result of a  higher-than-normal  volume of
sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter  related to the  introduction  of
Power Deck. Cash levels were offset as a result of higher  accounts  payable due
to  increased  inventories  to meet sales  levels for the fourth  quarter  1994.
Customer  deposits  increased  during 1994 due to pre-payments  received against
future large sales orders.  Capital expenditures during 1994 were $.6 million as
compared to $.7 million in 1993.

The  Company's  working  capital was $9.6  million as of October 31, 1995 a $9.3
million decrease from $18.9 million as of October 31, 1994.  Working capital was
$18.9 million as of October 31, 1994, a $.8 million  decrease from $19.7 million
as of October 31, 1993.

The Company  has no  significant  commitments  for  capital  expenditures  as of
October 31, 1995.

The  Company's  cash  management  practice  is to  invest  mainly  in  medium to
high-grade  municipal  securities  and United States  Treasury and United States
Government Agency securities, with maturities ranging from 90 days to 3 years.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors and Stockholders
V Band Corporation

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  V  Band
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of October 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of operations,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the years then  ended.  Our audits  also  included  the 1995 and 1994  financial
statement  schedule  listed  at Item  14(a)2.  These  financial  statements  and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management as well as evaluating the overall financial  statement  presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such 1995 and 1994 consolidated  financial  statements  present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of V Band Corporation
and  subsidiaries  as of October  31,  1995 and 1994,  and the  results of their
operations  and their cash flows for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting  principles.  Also, in our opinion,  such 1995 and
1994  financial  statement  schedule,  when  considered in relation to the basic
consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  presents  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 7 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting  for income taxes during the year ended October
31, 1994.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To V Band Corporation:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  statements  of  operations,
shareholders'  equity,  and  cash  flows  of V  Band  Corporation  (a  New  York
Corporation)  and  subsidiaries  for the year  ended  October  31,  1993.  These
financial  statements and the schedule referred to below are the  responsibility
of the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material  respects,  the  results  of  operations  and cash flows of V Band
Corporation and  subsidiaries  for the year ended October 31, 1993 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic  financial
statements  taken as a whole.  The  schedule  listed in the  index of  financial
statements  is  presented  for  purposes of complying  with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial  statements.
This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit
of the basic  financial  statements  and, in our opinion,  fairly  states in all
material  respects  the  financial  data  required  to be set forth  therein  in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

installations  and modifications to existing systems at customer  locations,  is
recognized as the product is shipped. For long-term contracts, equipment revenue
is recognized under the percentage-of-completion  method. Service revenue, which
includes  maintenance  contract  revenue and  repairs,  is  recognized  when the
service has been completed.

Investment income

The Company's investment income is substantially comprised of interest earned on
tax-exempt  municipal  bonds  and  United  States  Treasury  and  United  States
Government  Agency  securities.  The Company  primarily  invests in medium-grade
(BBB) to high-grade (AAA) instruments with maturities  ranging from 90 days to 3
years.
<PAGE>
Income taxes

During 1995 and 1994,  deferred  income taxes were  provided  for the  temporary
differences  between the financial  reporting  basis and the income tax basis of
the Company's  assets and  liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 109.  During 1993,  the provision for income taxes was
provided under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11. See Note 7.

Income (loss) per share

Income (loss) per share has been computed  using the weighted  average number of
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents (stock options) outstanding,
unless anti-dilutive, during each year.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company  considers  all highly  liquid debt  instruments  purchased  with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Foreign currency translation

For  translation of the financial  statements of its United Kingdom  operations,
the Company has determined  that the local currency is the functional  currency.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at year end exchange
rates and income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for
the  year.  The  resulting  translation  adjustments  are made  directly  to the
Cumulative  Translation  Adjustment component of Shareholders'  Equity.  Foreign
currency  transactions  are  recorded at the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at the
transaction date.

Management estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues and  expenses  during the  reported  periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note 4: Other assets

The  Company  has  capitalized  software  costs of  $1,106,000  which  are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a five year period.

In 1988, the Company entered into a license and  development  agreement with CXC
Corporation  ("CXC") to develop and commercialize  certain switching  technology
for  $2,031,000.  The CXC  license  was  being  amortized  over ten  years,  the
anticipated  useful life of the  technology.  In March 1990, the Company amended
the 1988 licensing  agreement with CXC. The terms of such amendment provide for,
among other things,  a prepaid royalty of $1,040,000,  which was capitalized and
was being  amortized  based on projected units of sales for both the VIAX DN and
Power Deck  products  that contain the  licensed  technology.  The  amortization
commenced upon shipment of the Company's first product unit in 1991.  During the
year ended October 31, 1995,  the Company  reconfigured  the components in their
products,  whereby the CXC technology acquired was no longer utilized.  As such,
the Company  wrote-off the remaining net book value of the CXC intangible assets
in the amount of $867,000.

In July 1994,  the Company  acquired all of the issued share  capital of Mercury
Dealing Systems ("MDS"), a subsidiary of Mercury Communications Limited. MDS had
been a distributor  of the Company's  products in the United Kingdom since 1987.
The  aggregate  purchase  price for the  share  capital  of MDS was  $4,634,000,
inclusive of liabilities  assumed.  The  acquisition was accounted for under the
purchase method, whereby the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired was  $3,389,000,  and is being amortized over a ten-year
period.

The Company  periodically  evaluates  the  recoverability  of goodwill and other
intangible assets by assessing whether the unamortized  intangible assets can be
recovered through cash flows.

Note 5:  Commitments and contingencies

(a) Litigation

In October 1994,  the Company  commenced an action against  Technical  Telephone
Systems,  Inc.  ("TTSI") in New York State Supreme Court,  New York County,  for
minimum  payments  due  to the  Company  in  the  amount  of  $650,000  under  a
distribution  agreement  between the Company and TTSI.  In November  1994,  TTSI
filed a counterclaim  against the Company denying all allegations  stated in the
Company's  complaint and alleging a breach of good faith and fair dealing by the
Company,  claiming damages of $1 million. The Company believes its claim against
TTSI is meritorious and believes TTSI's counterclaim against the Company,  which
the  Company  will  vigorously  defend,  is  without  merit  and will not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial condition of the Company.
<PAGE>
(b) Leases

The Company leases office and  production  space under leases  expiring  between
1996 and 2005. Certain of these lease agreements provide the option for renewals
and include  escalation's  based on  increases in certain  costs.  Based upon an
amendment to the Company's office lease agreement, executed in 1994, the Company
reversed a lease cancellation fee in the amount of $365,000 in 1994.

Future minimum annual rental payments under these leases are as follows:

     1996          $1,028,000
     1997             897,000
     1998             833,000
     1999             555,000
     2000             329,000
  Thereafter          420,000

Rent expense for 1995, 1994, and 1993 was $1,152,000, $1,011,000 and $1,215,000,
respectively.

(c) Employment contracts

The Company has  employment  agreements  with certain  officers that provide for
compensation and other benefits upon termination without cause or upon change of
control of the Company.  The aggregate  compensation  to be paid under  existing
employment  agreements  is  $250,000  as of October  31,  1995,  and such future
compensation has not been reflected in the accompanying  consolidated  financial
statements.

The agreement  related to change of control has an expiration dates of May 1996.
The agreement related to the payment of severance upon termination without cause
has no expiration date.

Note 6:  Stock options

The Company has stock option plans that provide for the granting of options,  at
fair market value,  to certain key  employees  and  directors to acquire  common
stock of the Company.

Note 7:  Income taxes

Effective   November  1,  1993,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"),  "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under
SFAS 109,  deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
differences  between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial
reporting  amounts.  The  cumulative  effect of the  adoption of SFAS 109, as of
November 1, 1993, was to increase net income by  $1,242,000,  net of a valuation
allowance of $150,000.  There was no change in the  valuation  allowance  during
1994.  During 1995,  the Company  recorded an  additional  deferred tax asset of
$4,325,000  and also recorded an additional  valuation  allowance of $4,876,000.
The total valuation  allowance as of October 31, 1995 of $5,026,000  reduces the
deferred tax asset to the amount that  management  believes  will  ultimately be
realized.  Realization  of the deferred tax asset is dependent  upon  sufficient
future  taxable  income  during  the  period  that  temporary   differences  and
carryfowards  are expected to be available to reduce  taxable  income.  Prior to
November  1,  1993,  provisions  were  made  for  deferred  income  taxes  where
differences  existed between the time that transactions  affected taxable income
and the time that these  transactions  entered into the  determination of income
for financial statement purposes.

As  of  October  31,  1995,   the  Company  had  available  net  operating  loss
carryfowards for tax return purposes of approximately  $6,800,000 which begin to
expire in 2009.  During 1995 the Company  reversed  $250,000 of prior years' tax
accruals which are no longer required.

The income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following:

Note 9:  Capital transactions

(a) Treasury stock

During the year ended October 31, 1993, the Company repurchased 82,600 shares of
its common stock at the market price in effect at the time of purchase. The cost
of these shares are reflected in treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

(b) Stock rights plan

On February  20, 1989,  the Board of  Directors of the Company  adopted a common
share purchase  rights plan and declared a dividend  distribution  of one common
share purchase right (the "Right") on each of its common shares to  shareholders
of record on March 7, 1989.  Each Right will  entitle the  registered  holder to
purchase  from the  Company one  outstanding  common  share,  par value $.01 per
share,  at a  purchase  price of $45.00  per  share,  subject  to  anti-dilutive
adjustments (the "Purchase Price"). The Rights generally become exercisable if a
person or group  acquires,  or tenders for, 20% or more of the Company's  common
shares.  In such  event,  the holder of a Right will have the right to  receive,
upon  exercise  of the Right at the then  current  Purchase  Price,  a number of
common  shares with a total market value of two times the  Purchase  Price.  The
Rights will expire on February 19, 1999, unless they become  exercisable  before
then, but may be redeemed by the Company for $.01 per Right.

(c) Employee stock purchase plan

Under the Company's  Employees 1986 Stock  Purchase Plan (the "Purchase  Plan"),
all eligible  employees may authorize  payroll  deductions of up to 10% of their
base  salary to  purchase  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock at 85% of the
market price.  There are no charges or credits to income in connection  with the
Purchase Plan. The Company may terminate the Purchase Plan at any time.
