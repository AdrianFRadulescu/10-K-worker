                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
(A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
 
     The Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemical and
petroleum  products  for  use  in  a wide  variety  of  industrial  and consumer
applications. Most of the  Company's products are  sold to industrial  customers
for  use as additives and  intermediates which impart particular characteristics
to such customers' end products. The Company provides manufacturing  flexibility
and  a  high degree  of  technical service  to  create value-added  chemical and
petroleum products that meet customers' specialized needs. Established in  1920,
Witco  has ranked among the  Fortune 500 largest U.S.  industrial firms for many
years, ranking  212  for 1993.  At  December 31,  1994,  the Company  had  7,955
employees worldwide.
 
     The  Company's  operations  are  divided  among  three  business  segments:
Chemical, Petroleum and Diversified Products, which are described in Section (c)
below.
 
     In 1992 the Company completed  the acquisition of the Industrial  Chemicals
and   Natural  Substances  divisions  of   Schering  AG  Berlin  (the  'Schering
Acquisition'). As  a  result of  the  acquisition, the  Company's  international
presence  expanded with the  addition of a large  chemical manufacturing base in
Germany and operations in Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Ecuador.
 
     The Company completed the sale  of the Allied-Kelite Division's  businesses
in  1994.  The Company  expects to  complete the  sale of  its carbon  black and
battery container manufacturing businesses by mid-1995.
 
     On March 11, 1994, the Company called for redemption on March 28, 1994  all
of  its $150 million outstanding 5  1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due
2012. $149.9 million of this debt was converted into the Company's common stock.
The redemption  was  called to  provide  greater financial  flexibility  as  the
Company  continues  in  its  efforts  to  expand  product  lines  and  marketing
capabilities of its core businesses.
 
     Witco Corporation was incorporated  in 1958 under the  laws of Delaware  as
Witco  Chemical  Company, Inc.,  at which  time  it succeeded  by merger  to the
business of  Witco Chemical  Company, an  Illinois corporation  formed in  1920.
During  1994  the move  to the  Company's new  world headquarters  in Greenwich,
Connecticut was completed. Its executive offices are now located at One American
Lane, Greenwich, Connecticut 06831-2559, telephone (203) 552-2000.
 
(B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     Reference is made to Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements. See Item
8 --  Financial Statements  and Supplementary  Data following  Part IV  of  this
report.
 
(C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
     The  Company's  operations  are  divided  among  three  business  segments:
Chemical, Petroleum and Diversified Products.
 
Chemical Products
 
Oleochemicals/Surfactants
 
     Witco offers one of the broadest lines of surfactants and oleochemicals  in
the  chemical industry,  providing 'one-stop  shopping' for  its customers  on a
global basis.  These products  are  sold to  a  range of  industries,  including
cosmetics  and pharmaceuticals; personal care, soap and detergent; agricultural;
rubber; food; paint and protective coatings; and textile. Surfactants change the
surface tension of  liquids. They  include agricultural  emulsifiers, which  are
used  to break up pesticides into small particles, thereby increasing dispersion
and  improving  penetration,  and  food  emulsifiers,  which  impart  particular
characteristics (such as consistency) to certain foods. In addition, surfactants
are  used in personal care products, fabric softeners, and detergents to improve
penetration and cleaning capability. These
 
                                       1
 
<PAGE>
products complement  those offered  by the  Petroleum Specialties  Group of  the
Company's  Petroleum Products  segment in  this area.  Oleochemicals are derived
from natural fats and  oils, and include fatty  acids, fatty amines, esters  and
glycerines.  Oleochemicals modify  surfaces either  as direct  lubricants, or as
components of  ingredients  that  modify surfaces.  Examples  of  their  diverse
applications  include acting as  lubricants in plastics;  imparting mold release
features for the rubber industry; and  acting as curing systems for rubber.  The
Company  is a worldwide producer of cationic and amphoteric surfactant products.
These materials are major ingredients  in fabric softener, hair conditioner  and
other personal care products.
 
Polymer Additives
 
     Witco  is a worldwide  supplier of additives and  catalysts for the polymer
industry. It manufactures  stabilizers, lubricants,  plasticizers, and  peroxide
catalysts  used in  the manufacture of  polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  resin for such
applications as pipes, fittings, siding and packaging materials. The company  is
also   a  supplier  of  lubricants,  antioxidants,  and  peroxide  catalysts  to
polyolefin/polystyrene manufacturers.  These resins  are used  extensively in  a
broad  spectrum of applications  ranging from packaging  film to small appliance
housings. The Company  is a European  producer of aluminum  alkyls, used as  co-
catalysts   in  the  production  of   polyolefins  (including  polyethylene  and
polypropylene, which  are among  the  world's largest  volume plastics  used  in
packaging, cars, furniture, and appliances) and produces organotin compounds for
the production of PVC stabilizers and biocides for marine paints.
 
Resins
 
     The  Resins Group, based  in Germany, was  formed in 1994  to serve Witco's
diverse global customer base for polyurethane intermediates, coatings, and epoxy
resins  and   hardeners.   It  encompasses   Witco's   U.S.-based   polyurethane
intermediates   businesses  and   epoxy  resins,   hardeners  and  polyurethanes
manufacturing and marketing operations in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy,  and
Denmark.
 
     Witco  has  been  developing water-based  polyurethanes  to  replace higher
volatile organic compound solvent-based systems.  This has increased the  number
of new products and Witco's market share among multi-product customers. Witco is
conducting an effort to develop technical applications for these products in new
markets.  Examples  include  new  water-based textile  coatings  and  a patented
dimethyl pyrazol (DMP) polyurethane for anti corrosive coatings developed in the
U.K., polyurethane systems for footwear developed in France for manufacturers in
Asia and  South  America, low-fogging  polyesters  for the  European  and  Asian
markets,  water-based epoxy  resins and  hardeners and  polyurethane dispersions
worldwide.
 
     Worldwide,  footwear,  adhesives,  and  coatings  are  believed  to   offer
significant  new  business potential  for customers  with  both epoxy  resin and
polyurethane needs.  To  meet  these  needs,  Witco  is  investing  in  capacity
expansions at plants worldwide.
 
Customers
 
     The  Company markets its  specialty chemical products  directly through its
own sales force and through an organized distribution program to a large  number
of  customers  in a  broad range  of  industries. Its  chemical business  is not
dependent upon any  single customer or  a few customers.  During the year  ended
December  31, 1994, no customer accounted for more than 4.3% of Chemical Segment
sales, and sales to the ten largest customers accounted for approximately  14.5%
of Chemical Segment sales.
 
Competition
 
     Many  of  the  specialty  chemical products  produced  by  the  Company are
characterized by  a need  for  a high  degree  of manufacturing  competence  and
technical   service,   particularly   because   customer   specifications   vary
considerably and special formulations  must be devised  to meet customer  needs.
Competition  is fragmented, with no one  competitor offering products across all
of the Company's
 
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
chemical product lines. Competition is primarily on the basis of performance  of
the   Company's  products  compared  with   similar  products  produced  by  its
competitors.
 
Petroleum Products
 
Petroleum Specialties
 
     Witco is  an important  manufacturer and  marketer of  white mineral  oils,
petrolatums,  refrigeration oils and  telecommunication cable filling compounds,
as well as natural  and synthetic petroleum sulfonates.  White mineral oils  and
petrolatums are extensively refined, high purity petroleum products suitable for
food  grade,  pharmaceutical  and  cosmetic  applications.  They  are  inert and
non-reactive,  and  impart  emolliency,  moisture  resistance,  lubrication  and
insulation  properties.  These products  are marketed  in coordination  with the
Oleochemicals/Surfactants Group of the  Company's Chemical Segment. In  addition
to  personal care and food applications,  white mineral oils and petrolatums are
used in  plastics,  agriculture,  textiles and  chemical  processing.  Petroleum
sulfonates  are oil soluble,  surface active agents  derived from both synthetic
and natural  petroleum feedstocks.  They provide  properties of  emulsification,
dispersion,  wetting of solids, and rust  and corrosion inhibition, and are used
in lubricant additives and metalworking fluids.  The Company is also a  supplier
of  fully refined, FDA-quality microcrystalline  waxes, which are primarily used
in paper lamination and packaging applications including cheese coatings.
 
Lubricants
 
     The Company produces  motor oils and  lubricants which it  sells under  the
Kendall  and  Amalie brand  names. Kendall  and Amalie  brand products  are sold
worldwide through  a network  of over  300 warehouse  distributors. Kendall  and
Amalie  brand  products  are  also  sold  directly  to  large  national accounts
domestically. In addition, Witco  is the largest  domestic private label  grease
manufacturer  and markets  Lubrimatic brand  products and  lubricating equipment
directly to its  customers. Witco  is also  a supplier  of specialty  naphthenic
oils,  which  are  marketed  to  the  rubber,  plastics,  ink  and  agricultural
industries, and asphalt and surface treatment products, which are sold primarily
for highway construction and maintenance.
 
Customers
 
     The Company's  petroleum products  are marketed  directly through  its  own
sales  force and through distributors and agents. During the year ended December
31, 1994, no customer accounted for  more than 3.5% of Petroleum Segment  sales,
and  sales to  the ten  largest customers  accounted for  approximately 17.5% of
Petroleum Segment sales.
 
Competition
 
     Many of  the  specialty petroleum  products  produced by  Witco,  like  its
specialty  chemical products, are characterized  by a need for  a high degree of
manufacturing competence and technical service. The petroleum products market is
highly competitive with the Company's products competing primarily on the  basis
of  pricing, quality and service. The  Company believes its technical expertise,
reputation for quality products,  and, in the case  of consumer products,  brand
name recognition, give it advantages in the marketplace.
 
Diversified Products
 
     Diversified  Products include battery containers, covers and parts, as well
as carbon  black. In  the U.S.,  Witco is  the leading  independent producer  of
battery  containers. Carbon black is sold to  the domestic tire and other rubber
products industries. The Company is a leading supplier of specialty carbon black
for the tire industry. The  Company expects to complete  the sale of its  carbon
black and battery container manufacturing businesses by mid-1995. The Company is
divesting  these businesses as a part of its strategy to concentrate on its core
businesses.
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
Customers
 
     During the  year  ended  December  31, 1994,  one  customer  accounted  for
approximately 21% of this segment's 1994 sales and the ten largest customers for
approximately 91.2%.
 
International Operations
 
     Sales  of Witco's non-U.S. operations were  $650.7 million, or 29% of total
sales, for the  year ended  December 31,  1994. Witco's  operations outside  the
United States are in Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, England, France, Germany, Israel,
Italy,  Mexico, the Netherlands, and Spain.  Witco now operates 57 manufacturing
facilities in 12 countries.
 
Patents
 
     Witco owns and has been licensed to use a number of patents, some of  which
are  important in  connection with  particular products but  all of  which, as a
group, are not material to the Company.
 
Backlog
 
     The nature  of the  Company's business  is such  that customer  orders  are
usually  filled within 30  days. Accordingly, backlog is  not significant to the
Company's business.
 
Research and Development
 
     Witco expended approximately $43.1 million  in 1994, $42.6 million in  1993
and  $29.2  million in  1992 on  research  and development  of new  products and
services, and for  improvements and  new applications of  existing products  and
services.
 
General
 
     The  chemical  and  petroleum  industries  in  which  Witco  operates  have
experienced increased operating  costs and capital  investments due to  statutes
and regulations at the federal, state and local levels for the protection of the
environment  and the health  and safety of employees  and others. Witco believes
that expenditures  for  compliance  with these  statutes  and  regulations  will
continue  to have  a significant  impact upon the  conduct of  its business. The
trend for  greater  environmental  awareness and  more  stringent  environmental
regulations  is likely to continue and while Witco cannot accurately predict how
this trend will affect  future operations and earnings,  Witco does not  believe
its  costs will vary significantly from those of its competitors in the chemical
and petroleum industries.
 
     The  Company  evaluates  and  reviews  environmental  reserves  for  future
remediation  and  other  costs on  a  quarterly basis  to  determine appropriate
reserve amounts. Inherent in this  process are considerable uncertainties  which
affect  the  Company's ability  to estimate  the  ultimate costs  of remediation
efforts. Such uncertainties include  the nature and  extent of contamination  at
each  site, evolving governmental  standards regarding remediation requirements,
the number and financial condition  of other potentially responsible parties  at
multi-party  sites, innovations  in remediation and  restoration technology, and
the identification of additional environmental sites.
 
     At December 31,  1994, environmental  reserves amounted  to $97.4  million.
These  reserves  reflect  management's  assessment  of  future  remediation  and
compliance costs  in light  of  all available  information. Witco  expended  $11
million  in 1994  against these  reserves and  anticipates 1995  expenditures to
approximate $34 million.
 
     The Company's current construction projects include up-to-date methods  and
equipment  for protecting the environment. In  addition, Witco is continuing its
program for modification  of its facilities  to meet current  standards for  the
control  of  emissions,  effluents  and solid  wastes.  Capital  expenditures to
improve  safety  and  to  conform  to  environmental  regulations  amounted   to
approximately $14 million in 1994 and $17.6 million in 1993.
 
     Witco  is continuing  its efforts to  reduce hazardous  waste and emissions
generated  by   its  operations.   Through  improved   operating   efficiencies,
installation of additional environmental control equipment,
 
                                       4
 
<PAGE>
and  utilization  of  the  latest  innovations  in  waste  treatment technology,
management believes  that operating  costs  associated with  managing  hazardous
substances  and pollution  can be controlled.  Such operating  costs amounted to
$21.2 million in 1994 and $20 million in 1993.
 
(D) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES
 
     Witco's foreign subsidiaries generally manufacture products similar to  the
principal  products manufactured  domestically. Subsidiaries  in the Netherlands
and Canada  manufacture petroleum  products;  subsidiaries in  Canada,  Denmark,
Ecuador,  England, France, Germany, Israel,  Italy, Mexico and Spain manufacture
chemical products.
 
     In accord  with normal  market conditions,  sales made  outside the  United
States are generally made on longer terms of payment than would be normal within
the  United States. Foreign operations are  subject to certain risks inherent in
carrying  on  international  business,   including  currency  devaluations   and
controls,  export and import restrictions, inflationary factors, product supply,
economic controls,  nationalization and  expropriation. The  likelihood of  such
occurrences  varies from country to country and is not predictable. However, the
Company's primary foreign operations  are based in  Western Europe, Canada,  and
other  stable areas,  and, therefore, the  Company does not  believe these risks
will have a significant impact upon the Company.
 
     Reference is made to Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements. See Item
8 --  Financial Statements  and Supplementary  Data following  Part IV  of  this
report.
 
ITEM 2 -- PROPERTIES
 
     Witco  currently conducts its manufacturing  operations in 57 plants, owned
in fee or occupied under lease, of which  35 are in the United States and 22  in
other  countries.  Of these  facilities, 33  are  utilized for  Chemical product

ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The Company has  been notified, or  is named as  a potentially  responsible
party  ('PRP') or a defendant  in a number of  governmental (federal, state, and
local) and private actions associated with environmental matters, such as  those
relating  to hazardous wastes.  These actions seek  remediation costs, penalties
and/or damages for personal injury or  damage to property or natural  resources.
As  of December 31, 1994, the Company had been identified as a PRP in connection
with 38  sites which  are subject  to the  federal Superfund  Program under  the
Comprehensive  Environmental Response,  Compensation and  Liability Act  of 1980
('CERCLA'). The Company has also been identified as a PRP in connection with  22
sites  where state agencies have taken the lead role in overseeing site cleanup.
With 11  exceptions, all  the CERCLA  and state  controlled sites  in which  the
Company  is  involved  are multi-party  sites,  and,  in most  cases,  there are
numerous other  potentially  responsible parties  in  addition to  the  Company.
CERCLA  authorizes the federal  government to remediate  a Superfund site itself
and to  assess  the costs  against  the responsible  parties,  or to  order  the
responsible parties to remediate the site.
 
                                       6

     The  Company  evaluates  and  reviews  environmental  reserves  for  future
remediation and  other  costs on  a  quarterly basis  to  determine  appropriate
reserve  amounts. Inherent in this  process are considerable uncertainties which
affect the  Company's ability  to  estimate the  ultimate costs  of  remediation
efforts.  Such uncertainties include  the nature and  extent of contamination at
each site, evolving governmental  standards regarding remediation  requirements,
changes  in  environmental  regulations,  widely  varying  costs  of alternative
cleanup methods,  the  number  and  financial  condition  of  other  potentially
responsible  parties  at  multi-party  sites,  innovations  in  remediation  and
restoration technology,  and  the  identification  of  additional  environmental
sites.
 
     The  Company  has numerous  insurance  policies which  it  believes provide
coverage at  various  levels  for  environmental  liabilities.  The  Company  is
currently  in litigation with many of  its insurers concerning the applicability
and amount of insurance coverage for environmental costs under certain of  these
policies.  Except for  amounts reflected  in executed  settlement agreements, no
provision for recovery under any of these policies is included in the  Company's
financial statements.
 
     The  Company is a defendant  in a case filed in  October 1992 by the United
States Department  of  Justice on  behalf  of the  United  States  Environmental
Protection  Agency styled United States  v. Witco, et al.  pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The United  States
alleged that the Company has violated the Clean Air Act, the Safe Water Drinking
Act,  and the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act in connection with certain
activities at  its Oildale,  California, refinery.  The Company  has executed  a
consent  decree settling  this action  in which  the Company  neither admits nor
denies liability. Execution of the consent decree on behalf of the United States
is awaiting completion of its internal approval process. Thereafter, the consent
decree must be approved  by the court  in order to  become effective. Under  the
terms of the decree, Witco and a third party will jointly pay a civil penalty of
$700,000,  and Witco will, among other things: (i) make certain modifications to
existing equipment  in the  refinery, and  install certain  new equipment;  (ii)
close  deep injection wells on an agreed  timetable; (iii) install a storm water
and wastewater treatment  facility at the  refinery; and, (iv)  complete a  site
evaluation at the location of the refinery and adjacent properties.
 
     The  Company is a defendant in  three similar actions pending in California
state courts, which arise out of  the Company's involvement in the  polybutylene
resin  manufacturing business in the 1970's: East Bay Municipal Utility District
v. Mobil Oil Co., et al., filed in November 1993, and pending in Superior  Court
for the County of San Mateo; City of Santa Maria v. Shell Oil Co., et al., filed
in  May 1994, and pending  in Superior Court for the  County of San Luis Obispo;
and, City of Redding v. Mobil Oil Co.,  et al., filed in July 1993, and  pending
in  Superior Court for the County of  Tehama. In addition, a fourth action, City
of Morgan Hill  v. Mobil  Oil Co.,  et al., filed  in December  1987, which  was
pending in Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara has been dismissed by the
court,  but  the Company  expects  the plaintiff  in  the action  to  appeal the
dismissal. The  actions generally  allege  that the  Company and  several  other
defendants  negligently misrepresented the performance  of polybutylene pipe and
fittings installed  in water  distribution  systems. Other  allegations  include
breach of warranty, fraud, strict liability, and breach of the California Unfair
Practices Act.
 
     The   Company  is  not   a  party  to   any  legal  proceedings,  including
environmental matters, which it believes will have a material adverse effect  on
its consolidated financial position.
 
ITEM 4 -- SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
 
     There  were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise,  during the fourth quarter ended  December
31, 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
 
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
 
Liquidity  refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to satisfy
the financial needs of an enterprise. Cash flow from operations, a major  source
of  Witco's  liquidity, provided  funds of  $466.3 million  over the  past three
years. The generation  of cash through  operations during this  time period  was
sufficient  to fund working capital requirements, support the Company's internal
capital investment program, and  sustain an increasing  rate of dividends  paid.
Additional  details regarding operating, investing, and financing activities can
be found  in the  Consolidated Statements  of Cash  Flows. It  is the  Company's
belief  that  cash flow  from operations  will  be sufficient  to fund,  for the
foreseeable future,  capital  investments,  dividend  payments,  commitments  on
environmental remediation projects, and operating requirements.
 
Early in the year Witco redeemed its $150 million outstanding 5 1/2% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due 2012, of which $149.9 million was converted into the
Company's  common stock. The redemption was  called to provide greater financial
flexibility as the  Company continues its  efforts to expand  product lines  and
marketing capabilities of its core businesses. As a result of its strong balance
sheet, Witco has the financial capacity needed should an acquisition opportunity
present itself.
 
Further  progress has  been made  in divesting  non-core businesses.  During the
second quarter  of  1994, Witco  sold  its  metal finishing  and  metal  working
businesses  for  $24.2  million in  cash.  The Company  expects  its divestiture
program to be  completed by  mid-1995 with  the sale  of its  battery parts  and
carbon black operations. The resulting cash flow from these divestitures will be
used  to further strengthen the Company's  core businesses of specialty chemical
and petroleum products.
 
Currently, the Company's primary international  operations are based in  Western
Europe  and Canada.  Although there  are certain  risks inherent  in carrying on
international business, including currency devaluations and controls, export and
import restrictions,  product  supply, and  economic  controls, Witco  does  not
believe these factors will significantly affect its operations.
 
As  the Company continues to focus on  global expansion, it has, through certain
of its international sub-sidiaries, arrangements with various banks for lines of
credit. At December 31, 1994, these lines of credit aggregated $36.7 million, of
which $36.4 million was unused at year-end. Witco has also entered into  certain
long-term  hedging  arrangements to  protect  against possible  adverse currency
exchange and interest rate fluctuations (see  Note 13 of the Notes to  Financial
Statements for additional details).
 
Witco  periodically  evaluates its  liquidity  requirements, capital  needs, and
availability of external funds. As a result of this process, the Company has  in
the  past  and  may  in  the  future  seek  to  restructure  indebtedness, raise
additional capital, or take such other steps to increase or manage its liquidity
and financial resources.
 
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS
 
In 1994, Witco continued to upgrade  existing facilities and to expand  capacity
to  meet  changing market  demands.  Internal capital  expenditures  were $107.4
million, bringing the  total for  the past three  years to  $283.7 million.  The
capital  investment program in 1995 will continue to focus on capacity expansion
and market share growth  and is expected to  reach $144 million. Investments  in
the  form  of  research  and  development,  quality  initiatives,  and marketing
alliances will also continue in all key product lines.
 
The Company is  committed to developing  business opportunities in  Asia and  is
currently  focusing  on both  the  immediate and  longer  term actions  that are
necessary to expand and leverage new and existing business in this region of the
world.  The  strategy  includes  both  capital  investment  and  new   marketing
initiatives.  The Company presently anticipates that initial capital investments
may be in the form of  joint ventures. For non-capital initiatives,  cooperative
marketing   and  technical  agreements  will   be  pursued.  The  screening  and
development of  specific businesses  will take  place throughout  1995 with  the
focus  on:  surfactants for  agriculture, personal  care, and  laundry products;
polyurethane systems  for footwear  manufacturers; and  lubricants for  plastics
including polyethylene, polypropylene, and film.
 
In  addition, to  effectively service the  expanding customer base  in Asia, the
Company plans on  establishing a  local technical support  center. This  service
center will
 
                                                                               3

house lab personnel and technical service representatives whose function will be
to address the specific needs of customers in that part of the world.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
The  Company operates in an industry subject to extensive regulations related to
the protection of  the environment and  the health and  safety of employees  and
others.  Domestic operations are  subject to a  myriad of environmental statutes
and regulations at the federal,  state, and local levels. Witco's  international
production  facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which
governmental authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers  which
require  manufacturing  facilities  to  obtain  operating  permits  to  continue
operations.
 
Witco  believes   that  expenditures   for  compliance   with  these   statutes,
regulations,  and permits  will continue to  have a significant  impact upon the
conduct of its business.  The trend toward  greater environmental awareness  and
more  stringent environmental regulations is likely to continue, and while Witco
cannot accurately predict how this  will affect future operations and  earnings,
the Company does not believe its costs will significantly vary from those of its
competitors.
 
Consistent  with  Witco's  concern for  the  protection and  improvement  of the
environment worldwide, the Company continually monitors the environmental impact
of past  and present  operating  practices in  light of  changing  environmental
standards.  Where remedial action  is indicated, Witco  assesses the probability
and scope of potential remediation  costs. To determine the appropriate  reserve
amounts,   management  reviews,  on  a   quarterly  basis,  currently  available
information pertaining to each environmental site. Inherent in this process  are
considerable uncertainties which affect Witco's ability to estimate the ultimate
costs  of  remediation.  Such uncertainties  include  the nature  and  extent of
contamination  at   each  site,   evolving  governmental   standards   regarding
remediation  requirements, changes in  environmental regulations, widely varying
costs of alternate cleanup methods, the number and financial condition of  other
potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, innovations in remediation
and  restoration technology, and the  identification of additional environmental
sites. As a  result, as remediation  efforts proceed at  existing sites and  new
sites  are  assimilated  into the  review  process, charges  against  income for
environmental reserves could have a material effect on results of operations  in
a  particular quarter or year. However, such  charges are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on Witco's  consolidated financial position, cash  flow,
or liquidity.
 
The  Company has numerous insurance policies  which it believes provide coverage
for certain environmental  liabilities. Witco  is currently  in litigation  with
many  of  its  insurers concerning  the  applicability and  amount  of insurance
coverage for  environmental  costs  under these  policies.  Except  for  amounts
reflected in executed settlement agreements, no provision for recovery under any
of these policies is included in the December 31, 1994 balance sheet.
 
Environmental  reserves at  December 31, 1994  amounted to  $97.4 million, which
reflects management's  assessment  of  future  remediation  costs  in  light  of
currently  available  information.  Remediation  expenditures  charged  to those
reserves were $11 million in 1994 and include expenditures currently mandated as
well as  those not  required by  any regulatory  authority or  third party.  The
Company anticipates 1995 expenditures to approximate $34 million.
 
Capital  expenditures  for air,  water, and  solid  waste control  equipment and
facilities amounted to $8 million  in 1994, and $30  million for the past  three
years.  The Company  estimates that  from 1995  through 1997,  approximately $46
million will be expended on similar capital projects.
 
Witco is  continuing  its  efforts  to  reduce  hazardous  waste  and  emissions
generated   by   its  operations.   Through  improved   operating  efficiencies,
installation of additional environmental  control equipment, and utilization  of
the  latest innovations in waste  treatment technology, management believes that
direct recurring operating costs  associated with managing hazardous  substances
and  pollution can be controlled.  Such costs amounted to  $21.2 million in 1994
and $20 million in 1993.
 
CONTINGENCIES
 
The Company has been notified, or is named as a potentially responsible party or
a defendent in a number of governmental (federal, state, and local) and pri-
 
4
 
<PAGE>
vate actions associated with  environmental matters, such  as those relating  to
hazardous  wastes, including  certain sites which  are on the  United States EPA
National Priorities List.  These actions seek  cleanup costs, penalties,  and/or
damage for personal injury or damage to property or natural resources.
 
The  Company is not  a party to  any legal proceedings  or environmental matters
which it  believes will  have  a material  adverse  effect on  its  consolidated
financial  position. It is possible, however,  that future results of operations
and cash  flows,  for  any  particular quarterly  or  annual  period,  could  be
materially affected by such legal proceedings or environmental matters. However,
the  Company does  not expect the  results of such  proceedings or environmental
matters to materially affect its competitive position.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
The Company reported  record net income  in 1994 of  $107.1 million compared  to
$19.8  million in 1993 and $39.2 million in 1992. The three year period included
several non-recurring items which affect  comparison. The following table  shows
the effect of these non-recurring items on earnings. The pre-tax values of these
items, except the accounting change which was shown separately, were included in
the  'Other expense (income)  -- net' caption of  the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

Current  year  results  included  a  $3.1  million  gain  on  the  sale  of  the
Allied-Kelite  operations  which  reflects the  Company's  continued  efforts to
divest its non-core businesses.
 
Results  for  1993  included  a  $34.3  million  environmental  provision  which
reflected  the Company's assessment  of the remediation  and compliance costs it
will incur to comply with  regulatory requirements and standards.  Additionally,
the  Company established  provisions of  $12.4 million  in 1993  for the planned
divestiture of the Battery  Parts Division and $7.9  million for a reduction  of
the  Company's worldwide  work force,  as part  of its  strategy to  realign and
reorganize  operations  to  emphasize  core  businesses.  Consistent  with  this
strategy,  during  1993  the  Company  sold  the  operations  of  its  Chemprene
subsidiary for a net gain of $5.7 million.
 
The $7.6 million  legal settlement  recorded in  1993 resulted  from a  judgment
against  the Company in the  Lightning Lube litigation. A  loss of $6.1 million,
attributable to an agreement  to sublease two  office facilities resulting  from
the  Company's  commitment to  relocate to  a new  world headquarters,  was also
recorded in 1993.
 
The Company's decision in  1992 to bring  certain operating management  together
with executive management and administrative functions through the consolidation
of offices into a new world headquarters resulted in recording a charge of $13.3
million.  Additionally, as  a result of  the Company's adoption  of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards  No. 106 for  postretirement benefits other  than
pensions, the Company recorded a charge of $14.7 million in 1992.
 
                                                                               5

1994 VS. 1993
 
Excluding non-recurring items, net income totaled $104 million in 1994, compared
to  $87.8 million in 1993. Record sales, which were 4 percent above the previous
year, were  responsible  for  approximately  65 percent  of  the  $16.2  million
increase  in net income, before non-recurring  items. Despite the disposition of
certain operations in  late 1993 and  1994, sales rose  on the strength  of a  5
percent  increase  in  shipment  volume.  Although  increases  in  raw  material
feedstock costs caused gross  margins to deteriorate during  the second half  of
1994,  cost saving  initiatives and  lower feedstock  costs earlier  in the year
enabled full year margins to  be slightly ahead of  1993. Chiefly the result  of
the  Company's  redemption of  its 5  1/2% Convertible  Subordinated Debentures,
lower net  interest  costs  also  contributed to  the  higher  net  earnings.  A
comparison  of  1993  and  1994 selling  and  administrative  expenses  shows an
increase of 2 percent, however, through careful monitoring the Company was  able
to  reduce  these  expenses as  a  percentage of  sales.  Notwithstanding higher
domestic pension costs, attributable to plan amendments and assumption  changes,
that  had a $6 million  adverse effect on net  earnings, reported net income and
net income excluding non-recurring items reached all-time highs.
 
The Company  does  not  allocate income  and  expenses  that are  of  a  general
corporate  nature  to industry  segments  in computing  operating  income. These
include general corporate  expenses, interest  income and  expense, and  certain
other income and expenses.
 
Witco's  1994 operating income of $202.1 million represents an increase of $87.6
million over  1993. Comparison  of  these earnings  for  each of  the  Company's
industry  segments is affected by non-recurring items. Exclusive of these items,
operating income rose to $197.3 million in 1994 from $189.3 million in 1993. The
contribution  of  the  Company's  international  operations  to  net  sales  and
operating income, exclusive of non-recurring items, increased in 1994. Continued
emphasis on global growth and an overall improvement in the European economy led
to a change in geographic composition. International operations accounted for 30
percent  of the Company's net  sales in 1994 compared to  28 percent in 1993 and
its contribution to operating income, excluding non-recurring items, increased 6
percent to a 37 percent share.
 
The Company has decided  to change its  method of applying  LIFO in valuing  its
inventory effective January 1, 1995. This involves a change in the computational
technique  used within  Dollar Value LIFO  from Double Extension  to Link Chain.
This change is not expected to have a material effect on 1995 net income.
 
CHEMICAL SEGMENT
 
Net sales of $1.3 billion  in 1994 were $105  million greater than the  previous
year.  Each  of  the segment's  business  groups  participated in  an  8 percent
increase in shipment volume, while prices  remained stable. Growth in all but  a
few markets, both domestically and abroad, was achieved in 1994. Improvements in
both  the domestic and European  economies, and aggressive marketing, translated
into higher sales volume.
 
Prior year's operating income was adversely affected by a $5.6 million provision
for environmental  remediation  and  compliance.  Excluding  this  non-recurring
charge,  operating  income rose  $13.2 million,  or 12  percent, over  1993. The
segment's Polymer Additives  Group registered the  largest increase,  accounting
for  two-thirds of the  segment's total improvement. The  group benefited from a
strong domestic economy, evidenced by a rise in the construction industry, and a
more robust  European  economy. All  major  business units  contributed  to  the
group's  23 percent improvement in operating income. A 9 percent increase in net
sales attributable to greater  domestic shipment volume,  the introduction of  a
new  antioxidant product and a  favorable European sales product  mix led to the
group's higher earnings.  Process improvements, the  most notable involving  the
production  of amides, also  contributed to the  group's strong performance. The
International/Europe Group's  operating income  rose approximately  15  percent,
accounting  for  the  remaining  portion of  the  segment's  favorable operating
results. The overall strength of the  European economy led to greater sales  and
improved  earnings for each of the group's  major business units. An increase in
shipment volume of approximately  10 percent, a favorable  product sales mix  in
key  businesses, cost  saving programs,  and plant  efficiencies proved  to be a
successful  combination.  Although  the  Oleo/Surfactants  Group  increased  its
shipment   volume  by  9  percent,  its  operating  income  remained  relatively
unchanged. Sales
 
6
 
<PAGE>
growth was achieved through aggressive  marketing, new product introductions  in
the  Oilfield and Laundry  Products business units, and  an increase in overseas
shipments. However, significant increases  in raw material  costs in the  second
half  of 1994, which the group was  unable to fully recover through higher sales
prices due to competitive pricing pressures, offset the increase in sales.
 
PETROLEUM SEGMENT
 
Current year  segment sales  of  $759.5 million  were  slightly ahead  of  1993.
Shipment  volume  and  selling prices  remained  relatively flat  due  to market
conditions and highly competitive pricing. Both of the segment's business groups
reported an  increase in  volume of  approximately 3  percent which  offset  the
effect of a 1 percent drop in prices.
 
Non-recurring  charges of  $50.6 million for  environmental matters  and a legal
judgment severely  affected prior  year's  operating earnings.  Excluding  these
charges,  current year's operating income of  $57 million was $8.7 million lower
than 1993.  The  13 percent  drop  in operating  income  was attributable  to  a
substantial  decline in the Lubricants  Group's operating earnings. This group's
operating earnings were down a disappointing  55 percent as a result of  adverse
market  conditions for its asphalt products  and its inability to increase sales
prices to recoup  higher raw material  costs, advertising expenditures,  pension
costs,  and salaries.  These factors overshadowed  the positive impact  that a 6
percent volume increase in  the group's main  product line, branded  lubricants,
had on operating income.
 
Although segment results, excluding non-recurring charges, were down compared to
1993,  the  Petroleum  Specialties  Group  reported  a  10  percent  increase in
operating earnings.  The group's  strong  performance was  primarily due  to  an
improvement  in  material  margins attributable  to  a decline  in  raw material
feedstock costs  that  outpaced a  corresponding  decrease in  sales  prices.  A
favorable   product  sales  mix,  higher   sales  volume,  and  efficiencies  in
manufacturing techniques also contributed to the group's favorable results.
 
DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
The Company is  in the final  stages of  its program to  divest its  Diversified
Products  Segment. The  Company sold  its Chemprene  subsidiary in  1993 and its
Allied-Kelite operations in 1994.  It is expected that  the sale of the  Battery
Parts and Concarb divisions will be completed by the middle of 1995.
 
Reported segment operating income for 1994 included a non-recurring gain of $4.8
million from the sale of the Allied-Kelite operations, while prior year earnings
included  a  net  charge of  $18.7  million  covering an  expected  loss  on the
disposition of the Battery Parts  business and an environmental remediation  and
compliance provision, partially offset by the gain on the sale of the operations
of Chemprene. Sales and operating income for the segment's businesses which were
not  sold in 1993 or 1994 (Concarb and  Battery Parts) rose $13 million and $7.2
million, respectively. A 15 percent increase in carbon black net sales,  spurred
in  part  by greater  automotive market  demand  in both  the tire  and non-tire
sectors, accounted  for  approximately  75  percent  of  the  higher  sales  and
operating  earnings. The remaining  increase was attributable  to an increase in
demand for battery components due to the severe winter of 1994 and  understocked
customer inventory levels.
 
1993 VS. 1992
 
Net  income, adjusted to exclude non-recurring items, was $87.8 million in 1993,
compared to $67.2 million in 1992. The 31 percent increase in net income, before
non-recurring items, was primarily attributable  to record sales, which rose  24
percent  to $2.1  billion, and  a 1  percent improvement  in gross  margins. The
November 1992 acquisition  of the  Industrial Chemicals  and Natural  Substances
divisions  of Schering AG (Schering Acquisition)  accounted for the higher sales
and approximately 50 percent of the improved margins. The re-maining improvement
in margins was attributable to a  reduction in key raw material feedstock  costs
and  operating  efficiencies  in  both the  Petroleum  and  Diversified Products
Segments. Increases  in selling  and administrative  expenses, depreciation  and
amortization,  and interest, primarily attributable to the Schering Acquisition,
partially offset the higher sales and improved margins.
 
Income from operations in 1993 was $114.5 million, compared to $129.7 million in
1992. A  comparison of  the  results of  these periods  was  affected by  a  net
non-recurring  charge of $74.8 million recorded in 1993. Excluding non-recurring
items, operating income increased $59.6 million to $189.3 million. All seg-
 
                                                                               7
 
<PAGE>
ments reported operating earnings, exclusive  of non-recurring items, that  were
appreciably higher than the preceding year.
 
CHEMICAL SEGMENT
 
Chemical  net  sales of  $1.2  billion in  1993  exceeded the  previous  year by
approximately $396 million.  The segment  was able to  sustain sales,  excluding
those  relating to the acquisition, at 1992  levels despite a soft demand due to
sluggish domestic and  European economies.  Sales attributable  to the  Schering
Acquisition accounted for the 47 percent increase.
 
Excluding  the segment's $5.6 million of environmental charges recorded in 1993,
operating income  of $113.8  million  in 1993  increased  $39.5 million,  or  53
percent,  from  1992.  Each  of  the  segment's  business  groups  reported 1993
operating earnings that were substantially  higher than the preceding year.  The
inclusion  of the acquired  Schering businesses' full  year operating results in
1993, compared  to two  months  for 1992,  accounted  for the  higher  operating
earnings. The Schering Acquisition contributed $41 million to the segment's 1993
operating  earnings,  compared to  the reported  loss of  $2.2 million  in 1992.
International, principally Western Europe,  and domestic operations  contributed
equally  to  the Schering  Acquisition's  current year  operating  earnings. The
favorable operating earnings  were also,  in part, attributable  to cost  saving
programs  and the consolidation of sales and administrative functions in Europe,
which minimized the effect the persistent European recession had on  operations.
Partially  offsetting the positive impact that the Schering Acquisition and cost
saving programs  had on  operations, the  Oleo/Surfactants Group  was  adversely
affected  by  a $3  million decrease  in  operating earnings,  the result  of an
increase in the cost of major commodity raw material feedstocks.
 
PETROLEUM SEGMENT
 
Net sales in  1993 were  $746 million,  an increase  of $11.7  million over  the
$734.3  million  recorded  in  1992.  Despite  a  soft  global  economy  and the
strengthening of the  dollar overseas, both  1993 sales volume  and prices  were
generally  comparable to the prior year. The  acquisition of the business of IGI
Petroleum Specialties,  Inc.  (PSI) late  in  1992 bolstered  1993  sales.  This
business,  which  enhanced  the  segment's  white  oils  and  petroleum  jellies
marketing capabilities, contributed approximately $30 million to sales in  1993,
compared to $2 million in 1992.
 
Operating income for 1993, excluding $50.6 million of non-recurring charges, was
$65.6  million, an  increase of  $14.1 million,  or 27  percent, over  1992. The
Petroleum Specialties  Group  accounted  for  approximately  two-thirds  of  the
segment's  higher operating earnings, excluding non-recurring charges, while the
Lubricants Group's results  accounted for the  remaining improvement.  Operating
earnings from the Petroleum Specialties Group's domestic operations rose despite
a  sluggish economy  and a  shortage of  critical sulfonate  feedstocks. The PSI
business added approximately $3 million to 1993 operating earnings. In addition,
the ability  to hold  down  manufacturing expenses  and  the inclusion  of  $3.1
million  of  demolition  costs  in 1992  contributed  to  the  improved domestic
results.  The  group's  Holland  operation  reported  lower  operating  earnings
attributable  to  the  depressed European  economy  and a  stronger  dollar. The
Lubricants Group's operating earnings  improved approximately 20 percent  during
1993.  Higher operating earnings were primarily due to a stronger asphalt market
and a  10  percent  decline in  crude  oil  feedstock costs  at  its  California
refinery. Additionally, the group's lube oil and grease operations reported 1993
operating  earnings that were marginally higher  than the previous year's. Lower
crude oil and feedstock  costs boosted these operations'  material margins by  1
percent.
 
DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
Net sales, excluding those attributable to Chemprene, Inc., were $154 million in
1993,  an increase of 7 percent above  sales for the corresponding operations in
1992. Operating income,  excluding the  results of  Chemprene and  non-recurring
items  of $18.7  million, principally for  the divestiture of  the battery parts
business, increased $7.4  million from $.4  million in 1992  to $7.8 million  in
1993. Higher carbon black sales and earnings more than offset declines from each
of the segment's other businesses. The carbon black business benefited from a 12
percent increase in volume, higher sales prices, and manufacturing efficiencies.

OUTLOOK
 
The escalation in raw material prices experienced during the latter part of 1994
has begun to stabilize. Higher costs will continue to be recovered as the market
supports  additional sales price increases. New programs have been introduced to
enhance Witco's global manufacturing capabilities. This initiative includes  the
establishment of global cross-functional teams chartered to significantly reduce
manufacturing costs commencing in 1995.
 
Witco  continues to be committed to  global growth through expanding its markets
in its core chemical and petroleum specialty businesses. With the divestiture of
the Diversified Products' businesses in its final stages, the Company will  step
up  its efforts to evaluate its other operations to determine their contribution
potential in meeting long-term corporate goals. Resources that become  available
through further dispositions will be used to finance acquisitions.
 
A goal of $5 billion in sales and a 16 percent return on equity by the year 2000
has  been set. Major acquisitions, joint ventures, and continued internal growth
in existing core businesses are the key  elements in the Company's plan to  meet
this  goal. The  Company will  continue to  concentrate on  expanding its global
offerings in North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Witco Corporation
 
We   have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Witco
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies as of  December 31, 1994 and 1993, and  the
related  consolidated statements of income,  shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three  years in the period ended  December 31, 1994. Our  audits
also  included  the financial  statement schedule  listed in  the Index  at Item
14(a). These financial  statements and  schedule are the  responsibility of  the
Company's  management.  Our responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
 
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted   auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts  and disclosures  in the  financial  statements. An  audit includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the  financial statements referred to  above present fairly,  in
all  material respects, the consolidated financial position of Witco Corporation
and Subsidiary Companies  at December 31,  1994 and 1993,  and the  consolidated
results  of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December 31,  1994,  in conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting  principles. Also,  in our  opinion, the  related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic statements taken as a  whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
As  discussed  in Note  12 to  the  financial statements,  in 1992,  the Company
changed  its  method  of  accounting  for  postretirement  benefits  other  than
pensions.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS         Witco Corporation and Subsidiary Companies
 
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
PRINCIPLES  OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of  all   majority  owned  subsidiaries   after  the  elimination   of
inter-company transactions.
 
CASH  EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents consist of  highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less when purchased.
 
INVENTORIES: Inventories  are  stated  at  cost,  principally  on  the  Last-In,
First-Out  (LIFO)  basis  which is  not  in  excess of  market.  The  balance of
inventories is stated  at the lower  of cost on  the First-In, First-Out  (FIFO)
basis or market.
 
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost
and depreciation is provided principally using the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives.
 
INTANGIBLE  ASSETS: Intangible assets  primarily include the  excess of purchase
price paid over the estimated fair  value of net assets acquired (goodwill)  and
other  intangibles which are being amortized over periods not in excess of forty
years. The  Company  periodically evaluates  the  carrying value  of  intangible
assets  in relation to  the operating performance  and future cash  flows of the
underlying businesses. Impairment  losses would be  recorded in the  event of  a
significant  change in the environment in which  the business operates or if the
expected future cash flows are less than book value.
 
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: The Company  adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No.  112 'Employers'  Accounting for  Postemployment Benefits'
effective January 1,  1993. SFAS 112  requires employers to  accrue the cost  of
postemployment  benefits, such as medical  and disability benefits, as employees
render services instead of when benefits are paid. The adoption of SFAS 112  did
not  have  a material  impact on  the Company's  financial position,  results of
operations, or cash flow.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS: The Company's research and development costs are
charged to expense as  incurred. These charges  amounted to $43,119,000  (1994),
$42,635,000 (1993), and $29,207,000 (1992).
 
ENVIRONMENTAL  REMEDIATION COSTS: Environmental remediation costs are charged to
expense if the remediation  is the result  of past practices  or events and  the
expenditures  are not expected to benefit future operations. Projected costs are
accrued when it is probable  that a liability has  been incurred and the  amount
can  be  reasonably estimated.  Accruals  are recorded  at  undiscounted amounts
without regard to  any third  party recoveries,  and are  regularly adjusted  as
environmental assessments and remediation efforts proceed.
 
INCOME  TAXES:  The  Company  accounts  for incomes  taxes  under  SFAS  No. 109
'Accounting for Income Taxes.'
 
COMMON SHARE DATA: Net income per common share is based upon net income adjusted
for interest (net  of tax)  on the  5 1/2%  convertible subordinated  debentures
through  March 1994 and the preferred  stock dividend requirements. The weighted
average number of  common shares  outstanding during each  year includes  common
stock  equivalents, principally  shares issuable in  connection with  the 5 1/2%
convertible subordinated debentures through March  1994 and the Company's  stock
option  plans. Fully diluted  net income per  common share additionally reflects
the assumed conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock.
 
NOTE 2 -- DISPOSITIONS
 
In the second  quarter of 1994,  the Company  sold the operations  of the  metal
finishing  and  metalworking  businesses  of  its  Allied-Kelite  subsidiary  to
MacDermid,  Incorporated  and  Metal   Lubricants  Company,  respectively,   for
$24,200,000  which resulted in a  gain of $3,133,000, or  $.06 per common share.
Allied-Kelite  manufactures  plating  and  surface  preparation  products.   The
operating  results of this  subsidiary were not  significant to the consolidated
results of operations.
 
On November 1,  1993, the  Company sold the  operations of  its Chemprene,  Inc.
subsidiary to CMP Acquisition Corporation for $24,160,000 resulting in a gain of
$5,726,000,  or  $.11  per  common  share.  Chemprene  manufactures  lightweight
belting, coated fabrics,  and industrial  diaphragms. The  operating results  of
this subsidiary were not significant to the consolidated results of operations.
 
                                                                             F-6

$62,077,000  and $57,849,000 higher than reported  at December 31, 1994 and 1993
if the  FIFO method  (which approximates  current  cost) had  been used  by  the
Company for all inventories.

U.S.  federal income taxes have not  been provided on approximately $200,000,000
of unremitted earnings of the  Company's international subsidiaries at  December
31,  1994. As  a result  of the  availability of  foreign tax  credits, based on
current rates, no  significant U.S.  federal income  taxes would  be payable  if
these earnings were distributed.
 
Provision has not been made for foreign withholding taxes due upon remittance of
foreign earnings prior to 1992. If unremitted earnings accumulated prior to 1992
were  distributed it is estimated the related  taxes due on these earnings would
not be significant.
 
Cash payments  for federal  and  foreign income  taxes amounted  to  $40,462,000
(1994), $29,817,000 (1993), and $21,811,000 (1992).
 
Unamortized  investment tax credits aggregated  $1,085,000 at December 31, 1994,
and are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

NOTE 11 -- PENSION PLANS
 
The Company has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans  covering
substantially all of its domestic employees and certain international employees.
Benefits  are  primarily  based  upon levels  of  compensation  and/or  years of
service. The  Company's funding  policy is  based upon  funding at  the  minimum
annual  amounts required  by applicable federal  laws and  regulations plus such
additional amounts as the Company may  determine to be appropriate from time  to
time.  Plan  assets consist  of publicly  traded  securities and  investments in
commingled funds administered by independent investment advisors.
 
Certain union employees of the  Company participate in multi-employer plans  and
the  Company makes contributions primarily based  upon hours worked. These plans
provide defined benefits to these employees.
 
In November  1992,  the  Company acquired  certain  domestic  and  international
operations  of  Schering  AG.  The  related  international  plans  accounted for
approximately $6,100,000  and  $4,800,000 of  the  1994 and  1993  net  periodic
pension  cost, respectively.  In the years  prior to 1993,  net periodic pension
cost of the international plans was not significant.
 
Employees of international subsidiaries are  covered by various pension  benefit
arrangements,  some  of which  are considered  to be  defined benefit  plans for
financial reporting purposes.  Assets of  the plans are  comprised of  insurance
contracts  and equity securities. Benefits under these plans are primarily based
upon levels of compensation. Funding  policies are based on legal  requirements,
tax considerations, and local practices.
 
Net pension cost (credit) includes the following components:

Effective  January 1, 1995, the Company  revised the domestic discount rate from
7% to 8.5%. This change resulted in a decrease of approximately $48,000,000  and
$56,000,000  in the  1994 accumulated  benefit obligation  and projected benefit
obligation, respectively.
 
Effective January 1, 1994, the pension benefit formula of the Retirement Plan of
the Company was amended to a 'final average pay offset' formula and several plan
provisions were revised. Also  effective January 1,  1994, the Company  modified
the  benefit  formula  of  the  Supplemental  Executive  Retirement  Plan. These
amendments, together with the 1994  actuarial assumption changes, increased  the
1994 domestic net periodic pension cost by approximately $9,200,000.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution savings plan, the Witco  Corporation
Employee  Retirement Savings Plan, which is  organized under sections 401(k) and
401(a) of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  The  Plan  allows  salary  and  hourly
non-bargaining  employees to contribute up to a maximum of 15% of their base pay
with the Company providing  a matching contribution up  to 3%. The Plan  permits
employees  to  make  contributions  on  both  a  pre-tax  and  after-tax  basis.
Participants are  immediately vested  in their  contributions and  become  fully
vested  in the matching contribution  upon meeting certain service requirements.
Union employee's participation,  provisions, contributions,  and employer  match
are based upon terms of their respective collective bargaining agreement.
 
The  Company's matching  contribution was $4,300,000  (1994), $4,800,000 (1993),
and $4,000,000 (1992).
 
NOTE 12 -- POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
The Company  provides health  and life  insurance benefits  to certain  domestic
retired  employees,  most  of whom  contribute  to its  cost.  Substantially all
employees presently become eligible for  retiree health benefits after  reaching
retirement  age while working for  the Company. The cost  of the retiree medical
plan is provided by retiree contributions that are adjusted annually to  reflect
current  health costs. For  domestic employees subject  to collective bargaining
arrangements the cost is shared by the Company in accordance with the
 
                                                                            F-14

bargained agreements. Life insurance benefits for certain retired employees  are
provided with the Company assuming the cost. The Company's policy is to fund the
plans at the discretion of management.
 
In  1992, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 106, 'Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement Benefits  Other  Than Pensions.'  This  statement
requires the accrual of the cost of providing postretirement benefits, including
medical  and life  insurance coverage, during  the active service  period of the
employee. The  Company  elected to  record  the effect  of  this adoption  as  a
cumulative  effect of a change in accounting principle and immediately recognize
the accumulated liability  measured as of  January 1, 1992.  This resulted in  a
one-time after-tax charge of $14,690,000.
 
Postretirement  benefit  obligations  at  December 31,  1994  and  1993  were as

For measuring  the  expected postretirement  benefit  obligation, a  10  and  11
percent  annual rate of increase  in the per capita  claims cost was assumed for
1994 and 1993, respectively. The rate was  assumed to decrease by 1 percent  per
year  to 6  percent in 1998  and remain  at that level  thereafter. The weighted
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 8.5  percent for 1994  and 7 percent  for 1993. A  change in  the
discount rate for valuing the obligations at December 31, 1994 from 7 percent to
8.5   percent  resulted  in  a  decrease  of  approximately  $6,700,000  in  the
accumulated postretirement  benefit obligation.  The weighted  average  discount
rates  used in  determining the  net periodic  postretirement benefit  costs for
1994, 1993, and 1992 were 7, 7.9, and 8.2 percent, respectively.
 
The effect of a one percent increase in the health care cost trend rate would
increase the present value of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
at December 31, 1994 by approximately $4,400,000 and the net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 1994 by approximately $400,000.
 
Certain union employees of the Company participate in multi-employer plans that
provide defined postretirement health and life insurance benefits. The net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for these employees is not distinguishable.
The Company's cost associated with these plans on a cash basis is not
significant.
 
Employees in operations  in countries outside  the U.S. are  covered by  various
postretirement  benefit arrangements, none of  which are presently considered to
be defined benefit plans.

NOTE 13 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts, currency swaps,  and
other  financial  market instruments  to hedge  the  effect of  foreign currency
fluctuations on the  financial statements.  The foreign  exchange contracts  are
accounted  for as hedges of net  investments, commitment hedges, and transaction
hedges. Gains  and losses  on hedges  of  net investments  are recognized  as  a
component of shareholders' equity. Generally, gains and losses on the commitment
hedges  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction underlying the
commitment. Gains and losses on transaction hedges are recognized in income  and
offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related transaction.
 
At  December 31, 1994 and  1993, the Company had  outstanding contracts to hedge
its foreign  net investments  and other  foreign exposures.  The aggregate  face
value  of these contracts, with  notional amounts of approximately $209,326,000,
also fix the interest  rates on the  same amount of  indebtedness at a  weighted
average  interest  rate  of  approximately  8  percent.  The  net  interest rate
differentials that are paid or  received are reflected currently as  adjustments
to  interest expense.  The foreign  currency contracts  are primarily  in German
marks and expire in March 2003.
 
These contracts have been  entered into with  major financial institutions.  The
risk  associated with  these transactions is  the cost of  replacing, at current
market rates,  agreements  in  the  event  of  default  by  the  counterparties.
Management believes the risk of incurring such losses is remote.
 
The  following  notes  summarize  the  major  methods  and  assumptions  used in
estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  The carrying amount approximates  fair value due  to
the short maturity of these instruments.
 
NOTES  RECEIVABLE: The  fair value is  estimated by discounting  the future cash
flows using  the interest  rates at  which  similar loans  would be  made  under
current conditions.
 
LONG-TERM  DEBT (INCLUDING  SHORT-TERM PORTION):  The fair  value for  the 6.60%
Notes and the 7.75% Debentures were based on quoted market values. For all other
long-term debt which have no quoted market price, the fair value is estimated by
discounting  projected  future  cash  flows  using  the  Company's   incremental
borrowing rate.
 
FOREIGN  CURRENCY/INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: The  fair value is the amount at
which the contracts  could be  settled based  on quotes  provided by  investment
banking firms.
 
FAIR  VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The following table presents the carrying
amounts and estimated fair values of material financial instruments used by  the
Company in the normal course of its business.

Superfund  Program under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980  (CERCLA). The Company has  also been identified as  a
PRP in connection with 22 sites where state agencies have taken the lead role in
overseeing site cleanup. With 11 exceptions, all the CERCLA and state controlled
sites  in which  the Company  is involved  are multi-party  sites, and,  in most
cases, there are numerous other  potentially responsible parties in addition  to
the  Company. CERCLA authorizes the federal  government to remediate a Superfund
site itself and to assess the costs against the responsible parties, or to order
the responsible parties to remediate the site.
 
The Company evaluates and reviews environmental reserves for future  remediation
and  other costs on a quarterly  basis to determine appropriate reserve amounts.
Inherent in  this  process  are  considerable  uncertainties  which  effect  the
Company's  ability to estimate  the ultimate costs  of remediation efforts. Such
uncertainties include  the nature  and  extent of  contamination at  each  site,
evolving  governmental standards regarding  remediation requirements, changes in
environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternative cleanup  methods,
the  number and financial condition of  other potentially responsible parties at
multi-party sites, innovations  in remediation and  restoration technology,  and
the identification of additional environmental sites.
 
At  December 31, 1994, the Company's  reserves for environmental remediation and
compliance costs amounted  to $97,356,000,  reflecting Witco's  estimate of  the
costs which will be incurred over an extended period of time in respect of these
matters which are reasonably estimable.
 
The  Company has numerous insurance policies  which it believes provide coverage
at various levels  for environmental  liabilities. The Company  is currently  in
litigation  with many of its insurers concerning the applicability and amount of
insurance coverage  for environmental  costs under  certain of  these  policies.
Except for amounts reflected in executed settlement agreements, no provision for
recovery  under any  of these  policies is  included in  the Company's financial
statements.
 
The Company is a defendant in three similar actions pending in California  state
courts,  which arise out of the  Company's involvement in the polybutylene resin
manufacturing business in  the 1970's:  East Bay Municipal  Utility District  v.
Mobil Oil Co., et al.; filed in November 1993, and pending in Superior Court for
the  County of San Mateo; City of Santa Maria v. Shell Oil Co., et al.; filed in
May 1994, and pending in Superior Court  for the County of San Luis Obispo;  and
City  of Redding v.  Mobil Oil Co., et  al.; filed in July  1993, and pending in
Superior Court for the County of Tehama.  In addition, a fourth action, City  of
Morgan  Hill v. Mobil Oil Co., et al.; filed in December 1987, which was pending
in Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara has been dismissed by the  court,
but the Company expects the plaintiff in the action to appeal the dismissal. The
actions   generally  allege  that  the  Company  and  several  other  defendants
negligently misrepresented  the performance  of polybutylene  pipe and  fittings
installed in water distribution systems. Other

                        1994 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                         AS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 1994

<PAGE>
                               WITCO CORPORATION
                        1994 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
 
I. NAME AND PURPOSE
 
     The  name of this plan is  the Witco Corporation 1994 Deferred Compensation
Plan (the  'Plan').  Its  purpose  is to  provide  certain  employees  of  Witco
Corporation   and  its   subsidiary  companies   (Witco  Corporation   and  such
subsidiaries being  hereinafter  collectively  called the  'Company')  with  the
opportunity  to defer  some or  all of  the bonus  and/or base  salary otherwise
payable to them by the Company.
 
II. EFFECTIVE DATE
 
     The Plan shall be effective as of December 1, 1994.
 
III. PARTICIPANTS
 
     Each employee of the  Company who is a  participant in either the  Officers
Annual  Incentive Plan or the Management Incentive Plan (an 'Employee') shall be
eligible to participate in the Plan. (Any Employee who elects to participate  in
the  Plan is hereinafter called a 'Participant'.) The Company will establish for
each Participant an unfunded deferred  compensation account to be maintained  in
the manner specified in Section V.
 
IV. ELECTION OF DEFERRAL
 
     A.  A Participant shall be  entitled to defer the  base salary and/or bonus
otherwise payable to him  for the period  beginning January 1  of each year  and
ending  December 31  of each  year by giving  irrevocable written  notice to the
Company which notice must be received by  the Company prior to January 1 of  the
deferral  year  and  be  in the  form  of  Exhibit A  hereto  (and  otherwise in
accordance with the Plan) setting forth (i) the amount to be deferred, (ii)  the
period  of deferral and (iii) the Participant's  election as to the amount to be
credited with interest and the amount to  be converted to phantom shares in  the
manner  described in Section V(C). The amount to be deferred may be expressed as
(1) a percentage of the total amount,  (2) a specified dollar amount or (3)  any
amount in excess of a specified dollar amount.
 
     B.  Each such election shall  be irrevocable as to  the period of deferral,
which deferral period may not  end earlier than two  years after December 31  of
the  deferral year or later than the later  of (i) 15 years after December 31 of
the deferral year or  (ii) the Employee's retirement  and which deferral  period
shall end on December 31 except in the case of retirement.
 
     C.  Each such election shall include an  election (which may be modified as
described in Section V(D) below) as to the percentage of the amount deferred  to
be  credited with interest at the rate  specified in Section V(B) and the amount
deferred to  be converted  to phantom  shares  of the  Company Common  Stock  as
described in Section V(C).
 
V. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS
 
     A.  A  separate  account  shall  be  established  and  maintained  for each
Participant, which account shall reflect amounts deferred pursuant to this  Plan
and  interest  credited pursuant  to Section  (B)  below and  dividends credited
pursuant to Section (C) below.
 
     B. The portion of  each Participant's account balance  to be credited  with
interest  shall  be credited  quarterly  with interest  as  of the  end  of each
calendar quarter. In the  event a Participant's  account balance is  distributed
other than at the end of any calendar quarter, the Participant shall be credited
with interest thereon from the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter
to  the date of distribution.  No interest shall be  credited to a Participant's
account after the distribution  in full of  such Participant's account  balance.
Interest  to be credited for any period shall  be at an annual rate equal to the
yield quotation as  of the end  of the  calendar quarter for  the U.S.  Treasury
10-year note or an annual
 
<PAGE>
rate  selected by the Administrator  (as defined in Section  XIII) in good faith
prior to the beginning of any calendar year (the 'Interest Rate'). Interest will
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year, 30-day month.
 
     C. The portion of salary and/or bonus to be deferred in the form of phantom
shares of the  Company's stock  ('Phantom Shares')  shall be  converted to  such
Phantom Shares by dividing the dollar amount of the salary and/or bonus deferred
by  the closing price  per share of the  Company's Common Stock  on the New York
Stock Exchange (the  'Exchange') on the  last trading  day prior to  the day  on
which  the salary and/or bonus would otherwise  be paid and shall be credited to
the Participant's account balance. Each  Participant's account balance shall  be
credited  with additional  Phantom Shares  on each day  that the  Company pays a
dividend by  multiplying  the number  of  Phantom Shares  in  the  Participant's
account  balance by (i)  in the case of  a cash dividend,  the dividend paid per
share of the  Company's Common Stock  and dividing such  product by the  closing
price  per share of the Company's stock on  the Exchange on the last trading day
prior to such payment date and (ii) in the case of a stock dividend, the  number
of  shares of the Company's Common Stock  distributed per share of the Company's
Common Stock.
 
     D. A Participant  shall be entitled  to make  an election (in  the form  of
Exhibit  A hereto) to change the percentage of  his or her account balance to be
credited with interest and the  percentage of his or  her account balance to  be
credited  with Phantom Shares.  Such election to  change shall not  be made more
frequently than quarterly and may be made  by giving written notice to the  Vice
President  of Human Resources of  the Company or his  or her designee during the
period beginning on the third business day following the Company's  announcement
of  its quarterly earnings and ending on the twelfth business day following such
date. Such election  shall be effective  as of the  last day of  the quarter  in
which such election is delivered to the Vice President of Human Resources of the
Company  or his or her designee at  which time the Participant's account balance
shall be adjusted to reflect the  percentages specified in such election by  (i)
reducing  the balance to be  credited with the Interest  Rate and converting the
amount of the reduction to Phantom Shares by dividing such amount by the closing
price per  share of  the Company's  Common Stock  on the  Exchange on  the  last
trading  day  prior to  such conversion  or  (ii) increasing  the balance  to be
credited with the Interest Rate and reducing the Phantom Shares by the number of
Phantom Shares that  is equal  to the  amount of  such increase  divided by  the
closing  price per share  of the Company's  Common Stock on  the Exchange on the
last trading day prior to such conversion.
 
     E. Amounts credited to a Participant's  Account shall remain a part of  the
general  funds of the Company and nothing contained in this Plan shall be deemed
to create a  trust or fund  of any  kind or create  any fiduciary  relationship.
Nothing  contained herein shall be deemed  to give any Participant any ownership
or other proprietary,  security or other  rights in any  funds, stock or  assets
owned  or possessed by the  Company, whether or not  earmarked for the Company's
own purposes  as a  reserve  or fund  to  be utilized  by  the Company  for  the
discharge of its obligations hereunder. To the extent that any person acquires a
right  to receive  payments or distributions  from the Company  under this Plan,
such right shall be no greater than  the right of any unsecured creditor of  the
Company.
 
VI. METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION
 
     A. No distribution of a Participant's account balance may be made except as
provided in this Section VI or in Sections VII or VIII.
 
     B.  Subject to  the provisions  of Sections  VII and  VIII, the  value of a
Participant's account balance shall be payable in cash, at the time selected  by
the  Participant in a lump  sum or in installment payments  on January 1 of each
year during a period  of years specified by  the Participant in accordance  with
the  election made  pursuant to  Section IV  (B). Subject  to the  provisions of
Section IV  (B),  in  the  event  that no  election  is  made  with  respect  to
distribution  of the Participant's account balance,  in the event of termination
by retirement, death, or disability such balance shall be payable in a lump  sum
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of termination.
 
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
     C. Subject to the provisions of Section IV (B), in the event of termination
other  than  by reason  of  retirement, death,  or  disability, the  value  of a
Participant's account balance shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as  reasonably
practicable following the date of termination.
 
     D.  A Participant  may petition  the Administrator  of this  Plan to permit
distribution of some or  all of the Participant's  account balance prior to  the
time  selected by the Participant in accordance  with Section IV(B) above in the
event of extraordinary personal financial hardship, including but not limited to
hardship due to  medical emergencies.  In no  case may  such distribution  occur
earlier  than the  earliest date specified  in Section IV(B).  The Company shall
have no  liability  for any  penalties  including but  not  limited to  any  tax
penalties resulting from such distribution.
 
VII. DISTRIBUTION UPON DEATH
 
     A  Participant may designate one or more persons to whom payments are to be
made if  the  Participant dies  before  receiving  payment of  all  amounts  due
hereunder.  A designation of  beneficiary will be effective  only after a signed
designation is filed with the Vice  President of Human Resources of the  Company
or  his  or her  designee while  the Participant  is alive  and will  cancel all
designations of  beneficiary signed  and filed  earlier. If  a Participant  dies
before  receiving all amounts credited to his or her account, the unpaid amounts
in the  Participant's account  shall  be paid  to the  Participant's  designated
beneficiary  in a single lump sum or, in  the absence of any designation, to the
Participant's estate in a single lump sum.
 
VIII. CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
     A. A change in control ('Change in Control') of Witco Corporation ('Witco')
shall be deemed to have  occurred if (i) any 'person',  as such term is used  in
Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 'Exchange
Act'),  other than an affiliate or any  employee benefit plan sponsored by Witco
or an affiliate becomes a 'beneficial owner', as such term is used in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the  Exchange Act, of  20% or  more of the  'Voting Stock'  of
Witco  (which means the capital  stock of any class  or classes of a corporation
having general  voting power  under ordinary  circumstances, in  the absence  of
contingencies,  to elect the directors of such corporation); (ii) 33 1/3% of the
Board of Directors of  Witco consists of individuals  other than the members  of
the  Board  of  Directors  on  December  1,  1994  (the  'Incumbent Directors');
provided, however, that any person becoming  a director subsequent to such  date
whose  election or nomination for election was approved by two-thirds (but in no
event less  than two)  of the  directors who  at the  time of  such election  or
nomination comprise the Incumbent Directors shall, for purposes of this Plan, be
considered  an Incumbent  Director; (iii) Witco  adopts any  plan of liquidation
providing for the distribution of all  or substantially all of its assets;  (iv)
Witco  combines  with another  company (whether  or not  Witco is  the surviving
corporation) and immediately  after the combination,  the shareholders of  Witco
immediately  prior to the combination  (other than shareholders who, immediately
prior to the combination, were 'affiliates' of such other company, as such  term
is  defined  in the  rules of  the  Securities and  Exchange Commission)  do not
beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more  than 20% of the Voting Stock  of
the combined company; or (v) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one
transaction  or a series of related  transactions) of all, or substantially all,
the assets of Witco.
 
     B. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event
of a Change in Control, each Participant in the Plan shall receive an  automatic
lump-sum  cash distribution of all amounts  accrued in the Participant's account
not later  than 15  days after  the  date of  the Change  in Control.  For  this
purpose,  the  balance in  the portion  of a  Participant's account  invested in
Phantom Shares shall be determined by  multiplying the number of Phantom  Shares
by the higher of (i) the highest closing price per share of the Company's Common
Stock  on the Exchange 30 days  prior to such Change in  Control, or (ii) if the
Change in Control  of the Company  occurs as a  result of a  tender or  exchange
offer  or consummation of  a corporate transaction, then  the highest price paid
per share of Common  Stock pursuant thereto. Any  consideration other than  cash
forming  a part or all of the consideration for Common Stock to be paid pursuant
to the applicable  transaction shall be  valued at the  valuation price  thereon
determined by the Administrator.
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
     In  addition, the Company shall reimburse  a Participant for the legal fees
and expenses  incurred if  the Participant  is  required to  seek to  obtain  or
enforce  any right to distribution. In the event that it is determined that such
Participant  is  properly  entitled  to  a  cash  distribution  hereunder,  such
Participant  shall also  be entitled  to interest  thereon payable  in an amount
equivalent to the Interest Rate from the date such distribution should have been
made to and including the date it is made. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Plan to the contrary,  this Section VIII  may not be amended  after a Change  in
Control  occurs  without  the  written  consent  of  a  majority  in  number  of
Participants.
 
IX. BENEFIT PLANS
 
     The amount of base salary and/or bonus which a Participant elects to  defer
under  the Plan shall be included as compensation for the purpose of calculating
the amount of a Participant's benefits or contributions under a pension plan  or
retirement  plan (qualified under Section 401(a)  of the Internal Revenue Code),
the amount of life insurance payable  under any life insurance plan  established
or  maintained by the Company, or the  amount of any disability benefit payments
payable under  any disability  plan established  or maintained  by the  Company,
except to the extent specifically limited in any such plan.
 
X. ADJUSTMENTS IN CERTAIN EVENTS
 
     In  the event of any change in  the outstanding common stock of the Company
by  reason  of  any  stock  split,  share  dividend,  recapitalization,  merger,
consolidation,  reorganization, combination, or  exchange or reclassification of
shares, split-up, split-off,  spin-off, liquidation or  other similar change  in
capitalization,  or  any distribution  to  common shareholders  other  than cash
dividends, the  number  of Phantom  Shares  credited  under the  Plan  shall  be
automatically  adjusted so that  the proportionate interest  of the Participants
shall be maintained  as before  the occurrence  of such  event. Such  adjustment
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
 
XI. PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS
 
     Establishment  of the Plan shall not be construed as giving any Participant
the right to  be retained in  the Company's service  or employ or  the right  to
receive any benefits not specifically provided by this Plan. A Participant shall
not  have any interest in  the base salary and/or  bonus deferred or interest or
appreciation in Phantom  Shares credited to  his account until  such account  is
distributed in accordance with the Plan.
 
XII. NON-ALIENABILITY AND NON-TRANSFERABILITY
 
     The  rights of  a Participant  to the  payment of  deferred compensation as
provided in the Plan shall not  be assigned, transferred, pledged or  encumbered
or  be subject in any  manner to alienation or  anticipation. No Participant may
borrow against his or her account. No account shall be subject in any manner  to
anticipation,  alienation,  sale,  transfer,  assignment,  pledge,  encumbrance,
charge, garnishment,  execution  or  levy  of any  kind,  whether  voluntary  or
involuntary,  including but  not limited to  any liability for  alimony or other
payments for the support of a spouse or former spouse, or for any other relative
of any Participant.
 
XIII. ADMINISTRATION
 
     The Administrator of this Plan  shall be the Organization and  Compensation
Committee  of the Board of Directors of  Witco except as otherwise determined by
such Board of Directors. Such Committee shall have authority to adopt rules  and
regulations  for carrying out the Plan  and to interpret, construe and implement
the provisions hereof. Any  decision or interpretation of  any provision of  the
Plan  adopted by such Committee shall be final and conclusive. A Participant who
is also a member of the Board of Directors shall not participate in any decision
involving any request made by  him or relating in any  way solely to his  right,
duties and obligation as a Participant under the Plan.
 
                                       4
 
<PAGE>
XIV. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
     The  Plan may, at  any time or from  time to time,  be amended, modified or
terminated  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Witco.  However,  no   amendment,
modification  or  termination  of  the  Plan shall,  without  the  consent  of a
Participant, adversely affect such Participant's rights with respect to  amounts
then accrued in his or her account.
 
XV. GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
     A.  Controlling  Law.  The  laws  of  the  State  of  Connecticut  shall be
controlling in all matters relating to the Plan, including the construction  and
performance hereof.
 
     B.  Captions. The captions of Sections and  paragraphs of this Plan are for
convenience of reference  only and shall  not control or  affect the meaning  or
construction of any of its provisions.
 
     C. Facility of Payment. Any amounts payable thereunder to any person who is
under  legal  disability  or  who,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Organization and
Compensation Committee of the Board of  Directors, is unable to properly  manage
his  financial affairs may be paid to the legal representative of such person or
may be applied for the benefit of such person in any manner which such Committee
may select, and any such payment shall be deemed to be payment for such person's
account and shall be a complete discharge  of all liability of the Company  with
respect to the amount so paid.
 
     D.  Withholding Payroll Taxes.  To the extent required  by law, the Company
shall withhold  from  any payments  made  hereunder  any taxes  required  to  be
withheld for federal, state or local government purposes.
 
     E.  Administrative Expenses. All expense of administering the Plan shall be
borne by  the  Company  and  no  part  thereof  shall  be  charged  against  any
Participant's account or any amounts distributed hereunder.
 
     F.  Severance Clause. Any provision  of this Plan prohibited  by the law of
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof.
 
     G. Disclaimer of Liability. Except as otherwise expressly provided  herein,
no  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Witco  or  the  Organization  and
Compensation Committee and no officer, employee, or agent of the Company,  shall
have any liability to any person based on or arising out of the Plan.
 
XVI. UNFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN
 
     Any  and all payments made to the Participant pursuant to the Plan shall be
made only from the general  assets of the Company.  All accounts under the  Plan
shall  be for bookkeeping purposes only and  shall not represent a claim against
specific assets of the Company. Nothing  contained in this Plan shall be  deemed
to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship.
 
     IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, Witco Corporation, has caused this Plan to be executed
this 15th day of December, 1994.

TO: VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES OF WITCO CORPORATION
 
     In  accordance with the  provisions of the  Witco Corporation 1994 Deferred
Compensation Plan, I hereby elect to defer the portion of the base salary and/or
