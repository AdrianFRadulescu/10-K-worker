                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1 -- BUSINESS
 
(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
 
     The Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemical and
petroleum  products  for  use  in  a wide  variety  of  industrial  and consumer
applications. Most of the  Company's products are  sold to industrial  customers
for  use as additives and  intermediates which impart particular characteristics
to such customers' end products. The Company provides manufacturing  flexibility
and  a  high degree  of  technical service  to  create value-added  chemical and
petroleum products that meet customers' specialized needs. Established in  1920,
Witco  has ranked among the  Fortune 500 largest U.S.  industrial firms for many
years, ranking  242  for 1992.  At  December 31,  1993,  the Company  had  8,161
employees worldwide.
 
     The  Company's  operations  are  divided  among  three  business  segments:
Chemical, Petroleum and Diversified Products. Principal products of the Chemical
segment include  surface  active  agents,  resins,  oleochemicals,  and  polymer
additives.  Surface  active  agents  (also known  as  surfactants)  are  used as
emulsifiers in agricultural and food  products, and are ingredients in  personal
care,  laundry, and cleaning products; resins  are used as adhesion promoters in
shoes, coatings, flooring, and construction materials; oleochemicals are used in
the production of personal care products, rubber, plastics, paper, and textiles;
and polymer  additives are  used  in the  production  and processing  of  vinyl,
polyethylene,  and other polymers.  Principal products of  the Petroleum segment
include white  oils, and  petrolatums used  in cosmetics,  pharmaceuticals,  and
plastics;  petroleum sulfonates used  as additives in  lubricating oils, greases
and metalwork fluids; Lubrimatic brand and private label lubricating greases and
equipment; asphalt, napthenic  oils and road  restorative products; and  Kendall
and  Amalie brand  motor oils and  lubricants. The  Diversified Products segment
manufactures battery containers and other  molded plastics products, as well  as
carbon black and metal finishing and metalworking products.
 
     In  1992 the Company completed the  acquisition of the Industrial Chemicals
and  Natural  Substances  divisions  of   Schering  AG  Berlin  (the   'Schering
Acquisition')  for approximately $440  million. As a  result of the acquisition,
the Company's  international presence  expanded  with the  addition of  a  large
chemical  manufacturing  base in  Germany and  operations  in Spain,  the United
Kingdom, France,  Italy,  and  Ecuador. In  addition,  the  Company's  specialty
businesses  in  surfactants,  polymer  additives,  and  oleochemicals  broadened
significantly.
 
     The Company completed a  two-for-one common stock  split during the  fourth
quarter  of 1993.  In 1993 the  Company also  disposed of the  operations of its
Chemprene, Inc.  subsidiary,  a  manufacturer  of  conveyor  belting  and  other
specialized belts. The Company expects to complete the sale of its Allied-Kelite
and Battery Parts divisions' businesses in 1994.
 
     On  March 11, 1994 the Company called  for redemption on March 28, 1994 all
of its 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2012 of which $150 million
are outstanding. The debentures are convertible into common stock of the Company
at a conversion  price of $27.28  per share,  which price was  below the  market
price for the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 10,
1994.  If  all debentures  are converted,  approximately 5.5  million additional
shares of common stock will become issued and outstanding. However, the issuance
of additional common stock by reason  of conversion of any debentures will  have
no  effect  upon the  Company's earnings  per share  calculations as  the shares
underlying the debentures have  been considered as  common stock equivalents  in
such  calculations. If all debentures were to be redeemed rather than converted,
the total cost to the Company would be $152.8 million. The Company will fund any
redemptions through a combination of available cash and short-term borrowings.
 
     Witco Corporation was incorporated  in 1958 under the  laws of Delaware  as
Witco  Chemical  Company, Inc.,  at which  time  it succeeded  by merger  to the
business of Witco Chemical Company, an Illinois corporation formed in 1920.  Its
executive  offices  are  located  at  520 Madison  Avenue,  New  York,  New York
10022-4236, telephone (212) 605-3800.

(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
     Reference is made to Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements. See Item
8 --  Financial Statements  and Supplementary  Data following  Part IV  of  this
report.
 
(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
     The  Company's  operations  are  divided  among  three  business  segments:
Chemical, Petroleum and Diversified Products.
 
Chemical Products
 
Oleochemicals/Surfactants
 
     Witco offers one of the broadest lines of surfactants and oleochemicals  in
the  chemical industry, providing  'one-stop shopping' for  its customers. These
products  are  sold  to   a  range  of   industries,  including  cosmetics   and
pharmaceuticals;  personal care, soap and detergent; agricultural; rubber; food;
paint and  protective  coatings; and  textile.  Surfactants change  the  surface
tension  of liquids.  They include agricultural  emulsifiers, which  are used to
break up  pesticides into  small particles,  thereby increasing  dispersion  and
improving   penetration,   and   food  emulsifiers,   which   impart  particular
characteristics (such as consistency) to certain foods. In addition, surfactants
are used in personal care products, fabric softeners, and detergents to  improve
penetration and cleaning capability. These products are marketed in coordination
with  the  Petroleum  Specialties  Group  of  the  Company's  Petroleum Products
segment. Oleochemicals are derived from natural fats and oils, and include fatty
acids, fatty  amines,  esters,  and glycerines.  Oleochemicals  modify  surfaces
either  as  direct  lubricants,  or as  components  of  ingredients  that modify
surfaces. Examples of their diverse applications include acting as lubricants in
plastics; imparting mold release features for the rubber industry; and acting as
curing systems for rubber.
 
     The Schering Acquisition significantly broadened the Company's  surfactants
product  base  to include  offerings  in all  significant  specialty surfactants
product categories  and made  Witco a  leading U.S.  and worldwide  producer  of
cationic  surfactants. Cationic surfactants  are the major  ingredient in fabric
softeners, hair conditioners, and other personal care products. The  acquisition
also  complements Witco's  oleochemical business  with additional  fatty amines,
which are used as chemical intermediates and to make cationic surfactants.
 
Polymer Additives
 
     Witco is a worldwide supplier of polymer additives, producing an  extensive
array  of  chemicals  used  as additives  in  the  plastics  industry, including
stabilizers for use in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride products (PVC)  for
such  applications as pipes, fittings, siding, and packaging materials. It is an
international  supplier   of  lubricant   additives   to  polyolefin   and   PVC
manufacturers.  The Company also  makes peroxides for use  in the polyolefin and
PVC industries,  epoxy plasticizers,  and stearates  used as  lubricants in  the
plastics  industry. As a result of the  Schering Acquisition, the Company is the
leading European  producer  of aluminum  alkyls,  used as  co-catalysts  in  the
production  of polyolefins (including polyethylene  and polypropylene, which are
among the world's largest  volume plastics used  in packaging, cars,  furniture,
and  appliances)  and produces  organotin compounds  for  the production  of PVC
stabilizers and biocides for the marine paints.
 
Polyurethanes
 
     Witco has long been a major supplier of polyesters, coatings, and  urethane
chemicals  to  the  construction,  leather  and  textile  finishing,  and  paint
industries. The Company  is a  leading producer of  saturated polyester  polyols
which  are used  in the  manufacture of  flexible foam  that is  sold to  a wide
variety of  industries, including  textile and  automotive. Witco  is  currently
expanding  its  polyester  polyol  business  for  use  in  non-cellular urethane
applications such  as coatings,  adhesives, cast  elastomers, and  thermoplastic
urethanes.
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
Resins
 
     With  the Schering  Acquisition, the  Company added  a resins  product line
augmenting its polyurethane business, broadening  the range of products sold  to
similar   industries   and   adding  complementary   research   and  development
capabilities. As a result, Witco  has a major share  of the European market  for
thermoplastic  polyamide and polyester products used  by the adhesives, shoe and
textile industries, adhesion promoters used  in vinyl plastisol production,  and
amine  and  polyamide  epoxy  resin  curing  agents  and  epoxy  resins  used to
manufacture  industrial   floorings   and   adhesives  and   as   coatings   for
infrastructure and building purposes.
 
Customers
 
     The  Company markets its  specialty chemical products  directly through its
own sales force and through an organized distribution program to a large  number
of  customers  in a  broad range  of  industries. Its  chemical business  is not
dependent upon any  single customer or  a few customers.  During the year  ended
December  31, 1993, no customer accounted for more than 5.2% of Chemical Segment
sales, and sales to the ten largest customers accounted for approximately  15.8%
of Chemical Segment sales.
 
Competition
 
     Many  of  the  specialty  chemical products  produced  by  the  Company are
characterized by  a need  for  a high  degree  of manufacturing  competence  and
technical   service,   particularly   because   customer   specifications   vary
considerably and special formulations must be devised to meet customers'  needs.
Competition  is fragmented, with no one  competitor offering products across all
of the Company's chemical product lines.  Competition is primarily on the  basis
of performance of the Company's products compared with similar products produced
by its competitors.
 
Petroleum Products
 
Petroleum Specialties
 
     Witco  is an  important manufacturer  and marketer  of white  mineral oils,
petrolatums, refrigeration oils and  telecommunication cable filling  compounds,
as  well as natural  and synthetic petroleum sulfonates.  White mineral oils and
petrolatums are extensively refined, high purity petroleum products suitable for
food grade,  pharmaceutical  and  cosmetic  applications.  They  are  inert  and
non-reactive,  and  impart  emolliency,  moisture  resistance,  lubrication  and
insulation properties.  These products  are marketed  in coordination  with  the
Oleochemicals/Surfactants  Group of the Company's  Chemical Segment. In addition
to personal care and food applications,  white mineral oils and petrolatums  are
used  in  plastics,  agriculture, textiles  and  chemical  processing. Petroleum
sulfonates are oil soluble,  surface active agents  derived from both  synthetic
and  natural petroleum  feedstocks. They  provide properties  of emulsification,
dispersion, wetting of solids, and rust  and corrosion inhibition, and are  used
in  lubricant additives and metalworking fluids.  The Company is also a supplier
of fully refined, FDA-quality microcrystalline  waxes, which are primarily  used
in paper lamination and packaging applications including cheese coatings.
 
Lubricants
 
     The  Company produces  motor oils and  lubricants which it  sells under the
Kendall and  Amalie brand  names. Kendall  and Amalie  brand products  are  sold
worldwide  through a  network of  over 300  warehouse distributors.  Kendall and
Amalie brand  products  are  also  sold  directly  to  large  national  accounts
domestically.  In addition, Witco  is the largest  domestic private label grease
manufacturer and  markets Lubrimatic  brand products  and lubricating  equipment
directly  to its  customers. Witco  is also  a supplier  of specialty naphthenic
oils,  which  are  marketed  to  the  rubber,  plastics,  ink  and  agricultural
industries, and asphalt and surface treatment products, which are sold primarily
for highway construction and maintenance.
 
                                       4
 
<PAGE>
Customers
 
     The  Company's  petroleum products  are marketed  directly through  its own
sales force and through distributors and agents. During the year ended  December
31,  1993, no customer accounted for more  than 3.0% of Petroleum Segment sales,
and sales to  the ten  largest customers  accounted for  approximately 17.0%  of
Petroleum Segment sales.
 
Competition
 
     Many  of  the  specialty petroleum  products  produced by  Witco,  like its
specialty chemical products, are  characterized by a need  for a high degree  of
manufacturing competence and technical service. The petroleum products market is
highly  competitive with the Company's products competing primarily on the basis
of pricing and quality. The Company believes its technical expertise, reputation
for quality  products,  and,  in  the case  of  consumer  products,  brand  name
recognition, give it advantages in the marketplace.
 
Diversified Products
 
     Diversified   Products  include  battery   containers,  covers  and  parts,
metalworking and  metal finishing  substances, and  carbon black.  In the  U.S.,
Witco  is the leading  independent producer of  battery containers. Metalworking
and  metal  finishing  products  are  marketed  to  the  aerospace,  automotive,
electronics,  and hardware industries. The Company  expects to complete the sale
of its Allied-Kelite  and Battery  Parts divisions' businesses  in 1994.  Carbon
black  is sold to  the domestic tire  and other rubber  products industries. The
Company is a leading supplier of specialty carbon black for the tire industry.
 
Customers
 
     During the  year  ended  December  31, 1993,  one  customer  accounted  for
approximately  15.9% of this segment's 1993  sales and the ten largest customers
for approximately 70.0%.
 
International Operations
 
     Sales of Witco's non-U.S. operations were  $588.7 million, or 28% of  total
sales,  for the year ended December  31, 1993. Through the Schering Acquisition,
Witco added two plants in Germany (surfactants, polymer additives, and  resins),
one  each  in  Spain  (surfactants), the  United  Kingdom  (surfactants), France
(resins), Italy (resins),  and Ecuador (oleochemicals/surfactants),  as well  as
three  in  the U.S.  which manufacture  oleochemicals, surfactants,  and polymer
additives. With the ten properties acquired from Schering, Witco now operates 64
manufacturing facilities in 12 countries.
 
Patents
 
     Witco owns and has been licensed to use a number of patents, some of  which
are  important in  connection with  particular products but  all of  which, as a
group, are not material to the Company.
 
Backlog
 
     The nature  of the  Company's business  is such  that customer  orders  are
usually  filled within 30  days. Accordingly, backlog is  not significant to the
Company's business.
 
Research and Development
 
     Witco expended approximately $49.5 million  in 1993, $29.2 million in  1992
and  $27.9  million in  1991 on  research  and development  of new  products and
services, and for  improvements and  new applications of  existing products  and
services.
 
General
 
     The  chemical  and  petroleum  industries  in  which  Witco  operates  have
experienced increased operating  costs and capital  investments due to  statutes
and regulations at the federal, state and local levels for the protection of the
environment  and the health  and safety of employees  and others. Witco believes
that expenditures  for  compliance  with these  statutes  and  regulations  will
continue to have a
 
                                       5
 
<PAGE>
significant  impact  upon the  conduct of  its business.  The trend  for greater
environmental awareness and more  stringent environmental regulations is  likely
to continue and while Witco cannot accurately predict how this trend will affect
future   operations  and  earnings,  Witco  does  not  believe  its  costs  will
significantly vary from those of its  competitors in the chemical and  petroleum
industries.
 
     Witco  evaluates and reviews environmental  reserves for future remediation
and compliance costs on a quarterly basis. To determine the appropriate  reserve
amounts,  management reviews all  available facts and  evaluates the probability
and scope of potential  liabilities. Inherent in  this process are  considerable
uncertainties  which affect  Witco's ability to  estimate the  ultimate costs of
remediation efforts.  Such  uncertainties  include  the  nature  and  extent  of
contamination   at   each  site,   evolving  governmental   standards  regarding
remediation  requirements,  the   number  and  financial   condition  of   other
potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, innovations in remediation
and  restoration technology, and the  identification of additional environmental
sites. As a  result, as remediation  efforts proceed at  existing sites and  new
sites  are  assimilated  into the  review  process, charges  against  income for
environmental reserves could have a material effect on results of operations  in
a  particular quarter or year. However, such  charges are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on Witco's consolidated financial position, cash flow or
liquidity.
 
     At December 31, 1993, environmental reserves amounted to $99.6 million,  of
which   $52.8  million  was  provided  for   in  1993.  These  reserves  reflect
management's assessment of future remediation  and compliance costs in light  of
all  available information. Witco  expended $15.1 million  in 1993 against these
reserves and anticipates 1994 expenditures to approximate $29 million.
 
     The Company's current construction projects include up-to-date methods  and
equipment  for protecting the environment. In  addition, Witco is continuing its
program for modification  of its facilities  to meet current  standards for  the
control  of  emissions,  effluents  and solid  wastes.  Capital  expenditures to
improve  safety  and  to  conform  to  environmental  regulations  amounted   to
approximately $17.6 million in 1993 and $15.6 million in 1992.
 
     Witco  is continuing  its efforts to  reduce hazardous  waste and emissions
generated  by   its  operations.   Through  improved   operating   efficiencies,
installation  of additional environmental control  equipment, and utilization of
the latest innovations in waste  treatment technology, management believes  that
operating  costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution can
be controlled. Such operating costs amounted to $23.6 million in 1993.
 
(d) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES
 
     Witco's foreign subsidiaries generally manufacture products similar to  the
principal  products manufactured  domestically. Subsidiaries  in the Netherlands
and Canada  manufacture petroleum  products;  subsidiaries in  Canada,  Denmark,
Ecuador,  England, France, Germany, Israel,  Italy, Mexico and Spain manufacture
chemical products.
 
     In accord  with normal  market conditions,  sales made  outside the  United
States are generally made on longer terms of payment than would be normal within
the  United States. Foreign operations are  subject to certain risks inherent in
carrying  on  international  business,   including  currency  devaluations   and
controls,  export and import restrictions, inflationary factors, product supply,
economic controls,  nationalization and  expropriation. The  likelihood of  such
occurrences  varies from country to country and is not predictable. However, the
Company's primary foreign operations  are based in  Western Europe, Canada,  and
other  stable areas,  and, therefore, the  Company does not  believe these risks

ITEM 3 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
     The Company has  been notified, or  is named as  a potentially  responsible
party  ('PRP') or a defendant  in a number of  governmental (federal, state, and
local) and private actions associated with environmental matters, such as  those
relating  to hazardous wastes.  These actions seek  remediation costs, penalties
and/or damages for personal injury or  damage to property or natural  resources.
As  of December 31, 1993, the Company had been identified as a PRP in connection
with 40  sites which  are subject  to the  federal Superfund  Program under  the
Comprehensive  Environmental Response,  Compensation and  Liability Act  of 1980
('CERCLA'). With 2 exceptions, all the  Superfund sites in which the Company  is
involved  are multi-party  sites, and, in  most cases, there  are numerous other
potentially responsible parties  in addition to  the Company. CERCLA  authorizes
the  federal government to remediate  a Superfund site itself  and to assess the
costs against the responsible  parties, or to order  the responsible parties  to
remediate the site.
 
     The  Company  evaluates  and  reviews  environmental  reserves  for  future
remediation and  other  costs on  a  quarterly basis  to  determine  appropriate
reserve  amounts. Inherent in this  process are considerable uncertainties which
affect the  Company's ability  to  estimate the  ultimate costs  of  remediation
efforts.  Such uncertainties include  the nature and  extent of contamination at
each site, evolving governmental  standards regarding remediation  requirements,
the  number and financial condition of  other potentially responsible parties at
multi-party sites, innovations  in remediation and  restoration technology,  and
the identification of additional environmental sites.
 
     The  Company is a defendant  in a case filed in  October 1992 by the United
States Department  of  Justice on  behalf  of the  United  States  Environmental
Protection  Agency styled United States v. Witco, et. all. pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The United  States
alleged that the Company has violated the Clean Air Act, the Safe Water Drinking
Act,  and the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act in connection with certain
activities at  its  Oildale,  California,  refinery.  The  United  States  seeks
unspecified civil penalties and certain injunctive relief in this action.
 
     The  Company  has numerous  insurance  policies which  it  believes provide
coverage at  various  levels  for  environmental  liabilities.  The  Company  is
currently  in litigation with many of  its insurers concerning the applicability
and amount of insurance coverage for environmental costs under certain of  these
policies.  No provision for recovery under any  of these policies is included in
the Company's financial statements.

     The  Company  is  not   a  party  to   any  legal  proceedings,   including
environmental  matters, which it believes will have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated financial position.

          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES
 
     Cash  flow from  operations continues  to be  a prime  source of  funds for
Witco. Over the  past three  years, cash  provided by  operations exceeded  $436
million,  an amount sufficient to fund working capital requirements, support the
Company's internal capital investment program, and sustain an increasing rate of
dividends paid. The Company anticipates that  cash flow from operations will  be
sufficient  to fund, for  the foreseeable future,  capital investments, dividend
payments, commitments  on  environmental  remediation  projects,  and  operating
requirements.
 
     In the fourth quarter Witco sold the operations of a subsidiary, Chemprene,
Inc.,   for  $24.2  million  in  cash.   This  divestiture  is  consistent  with
management's intent to divest  assets that do not  meet the Company's  long-term
strategic  objectives. Management expects to complete the sale of other non-core
businesses in 1994, with the resulting  cash flow from these divestitures  being
used  to further strengthen the Company's  core businesses of specialty chemical
and petroleum products.
 
     During 1993 Witco repaid the $440 million short-term indebtedness  incurred
in connection with the November 1992 acquisition of the Industrial Chemicals and
Natural  Substances divisions of  Schering AG (Schering  Acquisition). The funds
used to repay this  debt were provided  by the completion of  all phases of  the
Company's  long-term  financing strategy,  which included  a public  offering of
common stock, issuance of 10 and 30 year notes and debentures, and 5 year German
bank loans.  Net  proceeds  from  these  long-term  financings  totalled  $457.8
million.  Additional details regarding  the impact of  operating, investing, and
financing activities  on  the  Company's  cash position  can  be  found  in  the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 
     On  March 11, 1994 the Company called  for redemption on March 28, 1994 all
of its 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2012 of which $150 million
is outstanding. The debentures are convertible into common stock of the  Company
at  a conversion  price of $27.28  per share,  which price was  below the market
price for the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 10,
1994. Therefore, the Company believes most  of the debentures will be  converted
into  common stock. If  all debentures are  converted, approximately 5.5 million
additional shares of common stock  will become issued and outstanding.  However,
the  issuance of additional common stock by reason of conversion of any of these
debentures  will  have  no  effect   upon  the  Company's  earnings  per   share
calculations  as the  shares underlying the  debentures have  been considered as
common stock equivalents  in such  calculations. If  all debentures  were to  be
redeemed  rather than converted, the  total cost to the  Company would be $152.8
million. The  Company  will  fund  any  redemptions  through  a  combination  of
available cash and short-term borrowings.
 
     The  Company,  through  certain  of  its  international  subsidiaries,  has
arrangements with various banks for lines of credit. At December 31, 1993, these
lines of credit aggregated $40.2 million,  of which $37.4 million was unused  at
year-end.  Witco has also entered into certain long-term hedging arrangements to
protect  against   possible  adverse   currency  exchange   and  interest   rate
fluctuations  (see Note  8 of the  Notes to Financial  Statements for additional
details).
 
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS
 
     In 1993 the Company continued its program of upgrading existing  facilities
for  efficiencies  to  best  meet  changing  market  demands.  Internal  capital
expenditures in 1993 were $103.7 million, bringing the total for the past  three
years  to $250.6 million. Capital expenditures  are expected to approximate $110
million in 1994.
 
     The Company's European  manufacturing base, which  was greatly expanded  by
the  Schering Acquisition, remains  a focal point  of Witco's capital investment
program. In  1993  management  authorized  capital  projects  at  the  Company's
European  facilities  of $44.4  million,  reflecting management's  commitment to
enhancing manufacturing capabilities to better position itself to take advantage
of growth opportunities as the European economy stabilizes.
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
     In the fourth  quarter of 1993  the Board of  Directors authorized  certain
amendments  to  the  domestic  salaried pension  plans.  These  improvements, in
conjunction with changes to actuarial assumptions relating to the discount  rate
on pension obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets,
will  increase 1994  pension costs  by approximately  $9.2 million.  The Company
anticipates that cash flow will not be materially affected by these changes.
 
     Also in the fourth quarter, the Company announced its intention to sell its
Battery Parts Division, and to effect a reduction of approximately four  percent
in  its worldwide employee  population of 8,200. Reserves  of $31.4 million have
been recorded, principally for severance costs  and the anticipated loss on  the
sale  of Battery Parts' net assets. The Company anticipates that cash outlays of
$16.9 million relative to these  reserves will be made  over the next two  years
and will be funded through cash flow from operations.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
     The  chemical  and  petroleum  industries  in  which  Witco  operates  have
experienced increased operating  costs and capital  investments due to  statutes
and  regulations at the federal,  state, and local levels  for the protection of
the environment  and  the health  and  safety  of employees  and  others.  Witco
believes  that expenditures for  compliance with these  statutes and regulations
will continue to have a significant impact upon the conduct of its business. The
trend for  greater  environmental  awareness and  more  stringent  environmental
regulations  is likely to continue and while Witco cannot accurately predict how
this trend will affect  future operations and earnings,  Witco does not  believe
its  costs will significantly vary from those of its competitors in the chemical
and petroleum industries.
 
     Witco evaluates and reviews  environmental reserves for future  remediation
and  compliance costs on a quarterly basis. To determine the appropriate reserve
amounts, management reviews  all available facts  and evaluates the  probability
and  scope of potential  liabilities. Inherent in  this process are considerable
uncertainties which affect  Witco's ability  to estimate the  ultimate costs  of
remediation  efforts.  Such  uncertainties  include  the  nature  and  extent of
contamination  at   each  site,   evolving  governmental   standards   regarding
remediation   requirements,  the   number  and  financial   condition  of  other
potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, innovations in remediation
and restoration technology, and  the identification of additional  environmental
sites.  As a result,  as remediation efforts  proceed at existing  sites and new
sites are  assimilated  into the  review  process, charges  against  income  for
environmental  reserves could have a material effect on results of operations in
a particular quarter or year. However, such  charges are not expected to have  a
material  adverse effect on Witco's  consolidated financial position, cash flow,
or liquidity.
 
     At December 31, 1993, environmental reserves amounted to $99.6 million,  of
which   $52.8  million  was  provided  for   in  1993.  These  reserves  reflect
management's assessment of future remediation  and compliance costs in light  of
all  currently  available  information.  Witco expended  $15.1  million  in 1993
against these  reserves and  anticipates 1994  expenditures to  approximate  $29
million.
 
     Capital  expenditures  for environmental  control equipment  and facilities
amounted to $12.3 million in 1993, and  $34.1 million for the past three  years.
The  Company estimates  that from 1994  through 1996,  approximately $45 million
will be expended on environmental capital projects.
 
     Witco is continuing  its efforts  to reduce hazardous  waste and  emissions
generated   by   its  operations.   Through  improved   operating  efficiencies,
installation of additional environmental  control equipment, and utilization  of
the  latest innovations in waste  treatment technology, management believes that
direct recurring operating costs  associated with managing hazardous  substances
and pollution can be controlled. Such costs amounted to $23.6 million in 1993.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The  Company's  reported net  income of  $19.8 million  for 1993  and $39.2
million for 1992 included several non-recurring items. Comparisons of net income
for the three year period ended December  31, 1993 are affected by these  items.
The following table shows the effect of these non-recurring items on net income.
The  pre-tax values of these items, except the accounting change which was shown

</TABLE>
 
     The  current  year's $34.3  million  environmental provision  reflected the
Company's assessment of the  remediation and compliance costs  it will incur  to
comply with regulatory requirements and standards. Additionally, the Company has
established  provisions  of $12.4  million for  the  planned divestiture  of the
Battery Parts Division  and $7.9 million  for the reduction  of approximately  4
percent  of  the Company's  worldwide work  force,  as part  of its  strategy to
realign and reorganize operations to emphasize core businesses. Consistent  with
this  strategy, during  1993 the  Company sold  the operations  of its Chemprene
subsidiary for a  net gain of  $5.7 million. The  $7.6 million legal  settlement
recorded  in 1993 resulted from a judgment  against the Company in the Lightning
Lube litigation.  Current year  results also  included a  loss of  $6.1  million
attributable  to an agreement  to sublease two  office facilities resulting from
the Company's commitment to relocate to a new world headquarters.
 
     1992 results included a charge of  $13.3 million relating to the  Company's
decision   to  bring  certain  operating   management  together  with  executive
management and  administrative functions  through the  consolidation of  offices
into  a new world headquarters. An accounting change resulting from the adoption
of Statement  of  Financial  Accounting Standards  No.  106  for  postretirement
benefits  other than  pensions further  reduced net  income by  $14.7 million in
1992.
 
1993 VS. 1992
 
     Net income, adjusted to exclude  non-recurring items, was $87.8 million  in
1993,  compared to $67.2 million in 1992. The 31 percent increase in net income,
before non-recurring items,  was primarily attributable  to record sales,  which
rose  24 percent to $2.1 billion, and  a 1 percent improvement in gross margins.
The acquisition of the  Schering businesses accounted for  the higher sales  and
approximately  50 percent of the improved  margins. The remaining improvement in
margins was attributable to a reduction in key raw material feedstock costs  and
operating  efficiencies in both the Petroleum and Diversified Products Segments.
Increases in selling and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization,
and interest,  primarily attributable  to  the Schering  Acquisition,  partially
offset the higher sales and improved margins.
 
     The  Company does not  allocate income and  expenses that are  of a general
corporate nature  to  industry segments  in  computing operating  income.  These
include  general corporate  expenses, interest  income and  expense, and certain
other income and expenses (see Note 15 of the Notes to Financial Statements).
 
                                       5
 
<PAGE>
     Current year's  operating income  was $114.5  million, compared  to  $129.7
million  in 1992. A comparison of the results of these periods was affected by a
net  non-recurring  charge  of  $74.8   million  recorded  in  1993.   Excluding
non-recurring items, operating income increased $59.6 million to $189.3 million.
All segments reported operating earnings, exclusive of non-recurring items, that
were appreciably higher than the preceding year (see segment information below).
 
CHEMICAL SEGMENT
 
     Chemical  net sales of $1.2  billion in 1993 exceeded  the previous year by
approximately $396 million.  The segment  was able to  sustain sales,  excluding
those  relating to the acquisition, at 1992  levels despite a soft demand due to
sluggish domestic and  European economies.  Sales attributable  to the  Schering
Acquisition accounted for the 47 percent increase.
 
     Excluding  the segment's $5.6 million  of environmental charges recorded in
1993, current year's operating income of $113.8 million increased $39.5 million,
or 53 percent, from  1992. Each of the  segment's business groups reported  1993
earnings  that were substantially higher than  the preceding year. The inclusion
of the  acquired  Schering businesses'  full  year operating  results  in  1993,
compared to two months for 1992, accounted for the higher earnings. The Schering
Acquisition  contributed $41 million  to the segment's  1993 operating earnings,
compared  to  the  reported  loss  of  $2.2  million  in  1992.   International,
principally  Western Europe, and domestic  operations contributed equally to the
Schering Acquisition's current year earnings. The favorable earnings were  also,
in part, attributable to cost saving programs and the consolidation of sales and
administrative  functions in Europe,  which minimized the  effect the persistent
European recession had on operations.  Partially offsetting the positive  impact
that  the Schering Acquisition  and cost saving programs  had on operations, the
Oleochemicals/Surfactants Group was adversely affected by $3 million as a result
of an increase in the cost of major commodity raw material feedstocks.
 
     Many  of  the  benefits  derived  from  the  actions  initiated  in   1993,
particularly  cost reduction programs in  the acquired Schering businesses, will
not be fully realized until 1994 and beyond.
 
PETROLEUM SEGMENT
 
     Net sales in 1993 were $746 million, an increase of $11.7 million over  the
$734.3  million  recorded  in  1992.  Despite  a  soft  global  economy  and the
strengthening of the  dollar overseas, both  1993 sales volume  and prices  were
generally  comparable to the prior year. The  acquisition of the business of IGI
Petroleum Specialties,  Inc.  (PSI) late  in  1992 bolstered  1993  sales.  This
business,  which  enhanced  the  segment's  white  oils  and  petroleum  jellies
marketing capabilities, contributed approximately $30 million to sales in  1993,
compared to $2 million in 1992.
 
     Operating  income for 1993 included  non-recurring charges of $50.6 million
attributable to an  environmental provision and  legal judgment. 1993  operating
income,  excluding  these  charges,  was $65.6  million,  an  increase  of $14.1
million, or 27 percent, over 1992. The Petroleum Specialties Group accounted for
approximately  two-thirds   of   the  segment's   higher   earnings,   excluding
non-recurring  charges, while the  Lubricants Group's results  accounted for the
remaining improvement. Earnings from the Petroleum Specialties Group's  domestic
operations  rose despite a sluggish economy and a shortage of critical sulfonate
feedstocks. The  PSI business  added approximately  $3 million  to current  year
earnings.  In addition, the ability to  hold down manufacturing expenses and the
inclusion of  $3.1  million of  demolition  costs  in 1992  contributed  to  the
improved domestic results. The group's Holland operation reported lower earnings
attributable to the depressed European economy and a stronger dollar.
 
     Lubricants  Group's earnings improved approximately 20 percent during 1993.
Higher earnings were primarily due to a stronger asphalt market and a 10 percent
decline in crude oil feedstock  costs at its California refinery.  Additionally,
the  group's lube  oil and  grease operations  reported 1993  earnings that were
marginally higher than the previous year's. Lower crude oil and feedstock  costs
boosted these operations' material margins by 1 percent.
 
                                       6
 
<PAGE>
DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
     Segment  operating earnings for 1993 included a net non-recurring charge of
$18.7 million. The  charge covered an  expected loss on  the disposition of  the
Battery  Parts Division and environmental provisions, partially offset by a gain
on the sale of the operations of the segment's Chemprene, Inc. subsidiary.
 
     Net sales,  excluding  those attributable  to  Chemprene, Inc.,  were  $154
million  in 1993,  an increase  of 7 percent  above sales  for the corresponding
operations in 1992. Operating income,  excluding the results of Chemprene,  Inc.
and  non-recurring items, increased  $7.4 million, from $.4  million in 1992, to
$7.8 million in 1993.  Higher carbon black sales  and earnings more than  offset
declines  from each of the segment's other businesses. The carbon black business
benefited from  a  12 percent  increase  in  volume, higher  sales  prices,  and
manufacturing efficiencies.
 
     The divestiture of assets that do not meet the Company's long-term business
objectives  is an  important part of  Witco's strategic focus  to reorganize and
grow core businesses.  Hence, two  of the segment's  three remaining  divisions,
Battery  Parts  and  Allied-Kelite,  are slated  for  disposition  in  1994. The
disposition of the Battery Parts Division is expected to result in a loss, which
was recognized in 1993.
 
1992 VS. 1991
 
     Excluding non-recurring charges,  net income amounted  to $67.2 million  in
1992,  a decrease of 9 percent compared to  net income of $73.5 million in 1991.
Included in the  $67.2 million was  a net loss  of $2.8 million  related to  the
Schering Acquisition.
 
     1992  sales,  which  included  $72.3 million  from  the  operations  of the
acquired Schering businesses,  rose 6 percent  above 1991 to  a record level  of
$1.7 billion. Despite record sales attributed to a 5 percent increase in volume,
earnings  declined as a result of increased selling and administrative expenses,
higher depreciation  and  amortization, and  an  erosion of  sales  prices.  The
Schering  Acquisition and  increased litigation  costs accounted  for the higher
expenses, while  competitive pressures,  reflective of  a soft  global  economy,
resulted in depressed selling prices.
 
     Operating  income generated by the Company's  business segments in 1992 was
$129.7 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or 5 percent, from 1991.
 
CHEMICAL SEGMENT
 
     1992 net sales,  which included  $72.3 million from  the acquired  Schering
businesses,  reached $836.8 million, an increase of 12 percent from 1991. Sales,
excluding those credited to the  Schering Acquisition, increased $14.7  million,
or 2 percent, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in sales volume attributable
to  the segment's  domestic operations.  Operating income  was $74.3  million in
1992, an increase of $3.7 million,  or 5 percent, from 1991. Operating  earnings
for  1992  contained a  $2.2  million operating  loss  reported by  the acquired
Schering businesses.  These  operations were  adversely  affected by  the  sharp
downturn in the German economy and normal cyclical weaknesses.
 
     Income  from the segment's domestic operations improved $7.1 million, while
international earnings for 1992 were $3.4 million below those reported in  1991.
The  segment's  Oleochemicals/Surfactants Group's  domestic  operations reported
increased operating income  as a result  of greater shipment  volume and  higher
sales  prices, while the Polymer Additives Group's domestic operation's earnings
declined due to the  recession sensitive nature of  its business. The  segment's
international  operating results reflected a  loss from the Schering Acquisition
and lower sales volume reported by Witco Israel.
 
PETROLEUM SEGMENT
 
     Segment net sales increased less than 1 percent from $732.1 million in 1991
to $734.3 million in 1992.  The effect of a 5  percent increase in sales  volume
during this period was offset by a decline in prices. Operating income was $51.5
million for 1992, a decrease of $14 million, or 21 percent, from 1991.
 
                                       7
 
<PAGE>
     The  decline  in  profitability  was  confined  to  the  segment's domestic
operations, which reported a $14.5 million, or 30 percent, decrease in operating
income. These results were  indicative of a  soft economy, as  evidenced by a  5
percent decline in sales prices. Material margins were adversely affected by the
reduction  in sales prices that outpaced  a reduction in average material costs.
Also contributing  to the  decline  in operating  income were  significant  1992
charges  for litigation and demolition costs. Operating income for the segment's
international subsidiaries increased  $.5 million,  a result  of lower  material
costs and higher sales volume.
 
DIVERSIFIED PRODUCTS SEGMENT
 
     Net  sales in  1992 were  $175.1 million,  a $10.1  million, or  6 percent,
increase over 1991. Improved sales were attributed to greater volume and  higher
sales  prices. Operating  income reported in  1992 of $4  million represented an
increase of $3.5 million  over 1991. Despite  significant losses experienced  in
carbon  black products  before industry  price increases  took hold  and volumes
increased late in  the year,  the segment's improved  operating performance  was
reflective of increased sales and a gain from the sale of a former manufacturing
facility.
 
OUTLOOK
 
     Witco will divest its Allied-Kelite and Battery Parts divisions' businesses
in  1994 as a  part of its effort  to concentrate on its  core businesses in the
Petroleum and Chemical  Segments. Evaluation  of possible  divestiture of  other
business  units  within Witco  will continue  on  the basis  of return-on-equity
performance, strategic significance, and other factors.
 
     Global expansion of core businesses in the Chemical and Petroleum  Segments
will  remain a  Company focus  in 1994.  With the  continuation of  the European
recession, Witco's businesses in  Europe may not  exceed their 1993  performance
levels  in  1994. Witco's  European  operations should  benefit  from additional
operational efficiencies  and any  future economic  recovery in  Europe. As  the
North  American recovery slowly  grows in 1994,  Witco's results from operations
for its businesses operating there should continue to improve.
 
     The Pacific Rim has been targeted as a growth market for certain of Witco's
product lines and implementation  of the market entry  strategy for that  region
will  continue  in  1994. Acquisitions  and  joint ventures  which  will enhance
existing market positions  in core product  lines will be  evaluated on a  case-
by-case basis in 1994.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
 
Board of Directors and Shareholders
WITCO CORPORATION
 
We   have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Witco
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies as of  December 31, 1993 and 1992, and  the
related  consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three  years in the period ended  December 31, 1993. Our  audits
also  included the  financial statement  schedules listed  in the  Index at Item
14(a). These financial statements  and schedules are  the responsibility of  the
Company's  management.  Our responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
 
We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted   auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above  present
fairly,  in all material respects, the  consolidated financial position of Witco
Corporation and Subsidiary  Companies at  December 31,  1993 and  1992, and  the
consolidated  results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in  the period  ended  December 31,  1993,  in conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles. Also,  in our  opinion, the  related financial
statement schedules, when considered in  relation to the basic statements  taken
as  a whole, present fairly  in all material respects  the information set forth
therein.
 
As discussed  in Note  12 to  the  financial statements,  in 1992,  the  Company
changed  its  method  of  accounting  for  postretirement  benefits  other  than
pensions.

                   WITCO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
     Principles  of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts  of  all  majority  owned subsidiaries  after  the  elimination  of
inter-company transactions.
 
     Cash  Equivalents: Cash  equivalents consist  of highly  liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
 
     Inventories: Inventories are  stated at cost,  principally on the  Last-In,
First-Out  (LIFO)  basis  which is  not  in  excess of  market.  The  balance of
inventories is stated  at the lower  of cost on  the First-In, First-Out  (FIFO)
basis or market.
 
     Property,  Plant and Equipment: Property, plant  and equipment is stated at
cost and depreciation  is provided  principally using  the straight-line  method
based on estimated useful lives.
 
     Intangible  Assets:  Intangible  assets  primarily  include  the  excess of
purchase price  paid  over the  estimated  fair  value of  net  assets  acquired
(goodwill)  and  other intangibles  which are  principally being  amortized over
periods not in excess of forty years.
 
     Postemployment  Benefits:  The  Company  adopted  Statement  of   Financial
Accounting  Standards (SFAS)  No. 112 'Employers'  Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits' effective January 1, 1993. SFAS  112 requires employers to accrue  the
cost  of postemployment  benefits, such as  medical and  disability benefits, as
employees render services  instead of when  benefits are paid.  The adoption  of
SFAS  112 did not  have a material  impact on the  Company's financial position,
results of operations, or cash flow.
 
     Research and  Development Costs:  The  Company's research  and  development
costs  are charged to expense as incurred. These charges amounted to $49,494,000
(1993), $29,207,000 (1992), and $27,908,000 (1991).
 
     Environmental  Remediation  Costs:  Environmental  remediation  costs   are
charged  to expense if the remediation is the result of past practices or events
and the  expenditures  are not  expected  to contribute  to  future  operations.
Projected  costs  are accrued  when it  is  probable that  a liability  has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
 
     Income Taxes: The  Company elected to  adopt SFAS No.  109 'Accounting  for
Income  Taxes' effective January  1, 1992. The  Company previously accounted for
income taxes under  SFAS 96. There  was no significant  effect on the  financial
results of the Company as the result of this change in accounting.
 
     Common  Share Data:  On September  2, 1993, the  Board of  Directors of the
Company authorized a two-for-one common stock split in the form of a 100 percent
stock distribution issuable to shareholders of record as of September 16,  1993.
The  distribution was made  on October 5,  1993. All common  stock share and per
share data  for 1993  and prior  years, except  for prior  years'  shareholders'
equity, have been adjusted to reflect the split.
 
     Net  income per common share is based upon net income adjusted for interest
(net of tax) on the 5 1/2% convertible debentures and the dividend  requirements
of  preferred stock.  The weighted average  number of  common shares outstanding
during each year includes common stock equivalents, principally shares  issuable
in  connection with  the 5 1/2%  convertible debentures and  the Company's stock
option plans. Fully diluted  net income per  common share additionally  reflects
the assumed conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock.
 
NOTE 2 -- ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
 
     On November 1, 1993, the Company sold the operations of its Chemprene, Inc.
subsidiary to CMP Acquisition Corporation for $24,160,000 resulting in a gain of
$5,726,000,  or  $.11  per  common  share.  Chemprene  manufactures  lightweight
belting, coated fabrics,  and industrial  diaphragms. The  operating results  of
this subsidiary were not significant to the consolidated results of operations.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     In  October  1992  the Company  acquired  the businesses  of  IGI Petroleum
Specialties, Inc. (PSI), a wholly  owned subsidiary of The International  Group,
Inc.  (U.S.) and  certain associated  Canadian assets  for $14,500,000.  PSI was
involved in  the  manufacturing and  selling  of white  oils,  petrolatums,  and
refrigeration  oils. The acquisition was recorded  as a purchase and the results
since the acquisition have not been  significant to the consolidated results  of
operations.
 
     On November 2, 1992, the Company acquired for cash the Industrial Chemicals
and  Natural  Substances  divisions  of  Schering  AG.  The  acquired  divisions
manufacture and market  surfactants, oleochemicals, and  polymer additives  with
operations  at ten manufacturing facilities  in seven countries. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase and results of operations have been included  in
the  consolidated financial statements  from the acquisition  date. The purchase
price of approximately $440,000,000 is subject to adjustment based on changes in
net worth of  the businesses acquired  for a defined  period to the  acquisition
date.  The  amount of  any  net worth  based adjustment  is  not expected  to be
material in relation to the purchase price. An allocation of the purchase  price
resulted  in an  excess over  the estimated  fair value  of net  assets acquired
(goodwill)  of  approximately  $119,000,000.  This  is  being  amortized  on   a
straight-line  basis over  forty years. Results  for 1993 included  net sales of
$474,700,000 and net income of $16,200,000,  or $.30 per common share,  compared
to  net sales of  $72,300,000 and a net  loss of $2,800,000,  or $.06 per common
share, in 1992 as the result of the acquisition, including associated  financing
costs.
 
     The   following  unaudited   pro  forma   results  present   the  estimated
consolidated financial results as  if the Schering  Acquisition had occurred  at
the  beginning of the years indicated and are not indicative of the results that
would have occurred had this acquisition been  made on these dates, and are  not
indicative of future results.

NOTE 8 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
     In 1993 and 1992, the Company entered into several foreign currency forward
contracts,  currency swaps, and other financial  market instruments to hedge the
effect of foreign currency fluctuations on the financial statements. The foreign
exchange contracts are accounted  for as hedges  of net investments,  commitment
hedges,  and transaction hedges.  Gains and losses on  hedges of net investments
are recognized  as a  component of  shareholders' equity.  Generally, gains  and
losses  on the commitment hedges  are deferred and included  in the basis of the
transaction underlying the  commitment. Gains and  losses on transaction  hedges
are recognized in income and offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the
related transaction.
 
     At  December 31,  1993 and 1992,  the Company had  outstanding contracts to
hedge its foreign  net investments  and other foreign  exposures. The  aggregate
face  value of these contracts, with notional amounts of $210,626,000 (1993) and
$414,894,000 (1992), also fix the  interest rates on approximately  $209,326,000
of  indebtedness at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 8 percent.

interest rate differentials that are paid or received are reflected currently as
adjustments to interest expense. The foreign currency contracts are primarily in
German marks and expire at various dates through March 2003.
 
     These contracts have been entered  into with major international  financial
institutions.  The  risk  associated  with these  transactions  is  the  cost of
replacing, at current market  rates, agreements in the  event of default by  the
counterparties. Management believes the risk of incurring such losses is remote.
 
     The  following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial  instruments  as  required by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 107, 'Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.'
 
     Cash  and cash equivalents: The carrying amount approximates fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments.
 
     Notes receivable: The  fair value  is estimated by  discounting the  future
cash  flows using the interest rates at  which similar loans would be made under
current conditions.
 
     Long-term debt (including short-term portion): The fair value of the 5 1/2%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures and the 7.45% Debentures are based on  their
quoted market price on the New York Stock Exchange. The fair value for the 6.60%
Notes  and the  7.75% Debentures  were based  on market  values as  furnished by
investment banking  firms. For  all other  long-term debt  which has  no  quoted
market  price, the fair value is  estimated by discounting projected future cash
flows using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.
 
     Foreign currency/interest rate swap contracts: The fair value is the amount
at which the contracts could be  settled based on quotes provided by  investment
banking firms.
 
     Fair  Values  of  Financial  Instruments:  The  following  table  shows the
carrying amounts and  estimated fair  values of  material financial  instruments
used by the Company in the normal course of its business.

     U.S.  federal  income  taxes  have  not  been  provided  on   approximately
$160,000,000  of unremitted earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries
at December 31, 1993. As  a result of the  availability of foreign tax  credits,
based  on  current rates,  no  significant U.S.  federal  income taxes  would be
payable if these earnings were distributed.
 
     Provision has been made for  foreign withholding taxes due upon  remittance
of  1993 and 1992 foreign earnings.  If unremitted earnings accumulated prior to
1992 were distributed it  is estimated the related  taxes due on these  earnings
would not be significant.
 
     Cash  payments for federal and foreign income taxes amounted to $29,817,000
(1993), $21,811,000 (1992), and $39,879,000 (1991).
 
     Unamortized investment tax  credits aggregated $2,068,000  at December  31,
1993  and are  being amortized  over the estimated  useful lives  of the related
assets.
 
NOTE 11 -- PENSION PLANS
 
     The Company  has various  non-contributory  defined benefit  pension  plans
covering  substantially all of its  domestic employees and certain international
employees. Benefits are primarily based upon levels of compensation and/or years
of service. The Company's  funding policy is based  upon funding at the  minimum
annual  amounts required  by applicable federal  laws and  regulations plus such
additional amounts as the Company may  determine to be appropriate from time  to
time.  Plan  assets consist  of publicly  traded  securities and  investments in
commingled funds administered by independent investment advisors.
 
     Certain union employees of the Company participate in multi-employer  plans
and  the Company  makes contributions primarily  based upon  hours worked. These
plans provide defined benefits to these employees.
 
     In November 1992  the Company acquired  certain domestic and  international
operations  of  Schering  AG.  The  related  international  plans  accounted for
approximately $4,800,000 of  the 1993 net  periodic pension cost.  In the  years
prior  to 1993,  net periodic  pension cost of  the international  plans was not
significant.
 
     Employees of  international subsidiaries  are  covered by  various  pension
benefit  arrangements, some of which are  considered to be defined benefit plans
for financial reporting purposes. Assets of the plans are comprised of insurance
contracts and equity securities. Benefits under these plans are primarily  based
upon  levels of compensation. Funding policies  are based on legal requirements,
tax considerations, and local practices.

     Effective January 1, 1994,  the pension benefit  formula of the  Retirement
Plan  of Witco was amended  to a 'final average  pay offset' formula and several
plan provisions  were  revised. Modifications  were  also made  to  the  benefit
formula and plan provisions of the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. These
amendments resulted in increases of approximately $11,800,000 and $19,600,000 in
the  1993  accumulated  benefit  obligation  and  projected  benefit obligation,
respectively.
 
     Also effective January 1, 1994, Witco revised the discount rate,  long-term
rate of return on plan assets and rate of future compensation levels to 7%, 10%,
and  4.5%, respectively.  These changes  resulted in  increases of approximately
$28,000,000 and  $24,000,000  in the  1993  accumulated benefit  obligation  and
projected  benefit obligation, respectively. The  plan amendments and assumption
changes together are anticipated to increase domestic net periodic pension  cost
for 1994 by approximately $9,200,000.
 
     The  funded  status and  amounts recognized  in the  Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December 31, 1993 and 1992 for the international plans were as

     The  1993  funded  status  includes  the  Netherlands'  pension  plan.  The
inclusion of this  plan resulted  in an increase  of approximately  $14,000,000,
$17,500,000,  and $19,800,000, in the  accumulated benefit obligation, projected
benefit obligation, and plan assets, respectively.
 
NOTE 12 -- POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
 
     The Company provides health and life insurance benefits to certain eligible
retired employees,  most  of whom  contribute  to its  cost.  Substantially  all
employees  presently become eligible for  retiree health benefits after reaching
retirement age while working for  the Company. The cost  of the medical plan  is
provided  by retiree contributions that are adjusted annually to reflect current
estimates of  health  costs.  For employees  subject  to  collective  bargaining
arrangements  the cost is shared by the Company in accordance with the bargained
agreements. Life insurance benefits for  certain retired employees are  provided
with the Company assuming the cost. The Company's policy is to fund the plans at
the discretion of management.
 
     In  1992  the  Company  adopted  Financial  Accounting  Standard  No.  106,
'Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  Pensions'.   This
statement requires the accrual of the cost of providing postretirement benefits,
including  medical and life insurance coverage, during the active service period
of the employee. The Company elected to record the effect of this adoption as  a
cumulative  effect of a change in accounting principle and immediately recognize
the accumulated liability, measured  as of January 1,  1992. This resulted in  a
one-time after-tax charge of $14,690,000. In accordance with the standard, prior
year's  costs  have not  been restated.  In November  1992 the  Company acquired
certain U.S.  operations  of  Schering AG.  These  operations  provided  certain
retiree  medical and life insurance benefits.  In 1993 the Company negotiated or
revised many of the provisions and  assumptions related to these benefits to  be
in compliance with the Company's other comparable plans.
 
     Postretirement  benefit obligations at  December 31, 1993  and 1992 were as
follows:

postretirement benefit obligation  was 7 percent  for 1993 and  7.9 percent  for
1992.  The weighted average discount rates  used in determining the net periodic
postretirement benefit  costs  for 1993  and  1992  were 7.9  and  8.2  percent,
respectively.
 
     The  effect of a  one percent increase  in the health  care cost trend rate
would increase  the  present value  of  the accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation at December 31, 1993 by approximately $4,300,000 and the net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by approximately $400,000.
 
     Certain  union employees of the Company participate in multi-employer plans
that provide defined postretirement health and life insurance benefits. The  net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for these employees is not distinguishable.
The  Company's  cost  associated  with  these  plans  on  a  cash  basis  is not
significant.
 
     Employees in  operations  in countries  outside  the U.S.  are  covered  by
various  postretirement  benefit  arrangements,  none  of  which  are  presently
considered to be defined benefit plans.

NOTE 14 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
     Leases:  At   December  31,   1993,   minimum  rental   commitments   under
noncancelable  operating  leases  amounted  to  $14,834,000  (1994), $15,241,000
(1995),  $12,693,000   (1996),  $9,829,000   (1997),  $7,858,000   (1998),   and
$103,345,000  (1999  and thereafter).  Aggregate  future minimum  rentals  to be
received under noncancelable  subleases, the  majority of which  are subject  to
barter provisions, amount to $26,921,000.
 
     Rental expenses under operating leases were $19,849,000 (1993), $16,518,000
(1992), and $17,114,000 (1991).
 
     Capital  Commitments: At December 31, 1993, the estimated costs to complete
authorized projects under construction amounted to $100,906,000.
 
     Litigation, Claims and Contingencies: The Company has been notified, or  is
a named or a potentially responsible party in a number of governmental (federal,
state,  and local)  and private  actions associated  with environmental matters,
such as those relating to hazardous wastes, including certain sites which are on
the United  States EPA  National  Priorities List.  These actions  seek  cleanup
costs,  penalties, and/or damages  for personal injury or  damage to property or
natural resources.
 
     The  Company  evaluates  and  reviews  environmental  reserves  for  future
remediation  and compliance costs on a  quarterly basis to determine appropriate
reserve amounts. Inherent in this  process are considerable uncertainties  which
affect  the  Company's ability  to estimate  the  ultimate costs  of remediation
efforts. Such uncertainties include  the nature and  extent of contamination  at
each  site, evolving governmental  standards regarding remediation requirements,
the number and financial condition  of other potentially responsible parties  at
multi-party  sites, innovations  in remediation and  restoration technology, and
the identification of additional environmental sites.

                   WITCO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
     At December 31, 1993, the Company's reserves for environmental  remediation
and  compliance costs amounted to $99,613,000 reflecting Witco's estimate of the
costs which will be incurred over an extended period of time in respect of these
matters which are reasonably estimable.
 
     The Company  has  numerous insurance  policies  which it  believes  provide
coverage  at  various  levels  for  environmental  liabilities.  The  Company is
currently in litigation with many  of its insurers concerning the  applicability
and  amount of insurance coverage for environmental costs under certain of these
policies. No provision for recovery under  any of these policies is included  in
the Company's financial statements.
 
     The  Company is also a  defendant in certain suits  relating to the sale of
lubricants to a quick lube oil franchisor. In one of such suits, Lightning Lube,
Inc. v. Witco, in the United States District Court of New Jersey, after a  trial
the  plaintiff  was awarded  $9,500,000 in  compensatory  damages for  breach of
contract and tortious  interference, and  approximately $2,000,000  pre-judgment
interest.  Both the plaintiff and the Company  appealed this result to the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals. In an opinion  filed on September 10, 1993, the  Third
Circuit  Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's result. On October 8, 1993,
the Company deposited $11,600,000 with the  trial court in payment of the  total
amount  of the judgment,  together with interest, to  discharge its liability in
this action.
 
     The Company  is not  a  party to  any  other legal  proceedings,  including
environmental  matters and the  other suits relating to  the sale of lubricants,
which it  believes will  have  a material  adverse  effect on  its  consolidated
financial position.

Notes:
 
(a) The weighted average interest rate was affected by interest rates associated
    with  the utilization of bank lines of credit by the Company's international
    subsidiaries.
 
(b) The average amount outstanding  during the period  was computed by  dividing
    the  total  of  daily  outstanding  principal  balances  by  the  total days
    outstanding.
 
(c) The weighted  average  interest rate  during  the  period  was  computed  by
    dividing   the   actual   interest  expense   by  average   short-term  debt
    outstanding.
 
(d) To  finance  the  acquisition  of  the  Industrial  Chemicals  and   Natural
    Substances divisions of Schering AG, the Company entered into a $440 million
    short-term  financing arrangement  on October 1,  1992, with  a syndicate of
    banks. This borrowing was  repaid during the period  from March through  May
    1993  with a combination of proceeds from public offerings for shares of the
    Company's  common  stock,  long-term  debt  securities,  and  proceeds  from
    international borrowings.

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
 
     SECTION 1. All meetings of the  stockholders for the election of  directors
or  for any other lawful purpose shall be held at such time and at such place as

of the meeting.
 
     SECTION  2. Annual  meetings of  stockholders shall  be held  on the fourth
Wednesday in April, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on  the

before  the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors pursuant to
a vote of not less  than a majority of the  entire Board of Directors, or  (iii)
otherwise  properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to

each item  of business  the  stockholder proposes  to  bring before  the  annual
meeting  (i) a brief  description of such  item of business  and the reasons for
conducting it  at the  meeting and,  in the  event that  such item  of  business
includes  a proposal  to amend  either the  certificate of  incorporation of the
corporation or these by-laws, the language  of the proposed amendment, (ii)  the
name  and address of  the stockholder proposing  such item of  business, (iii) a
representation that  the stockholder  is a  holder  of record  of stock  of  the
corporation  entitled to vote at such meeting  having a market value of at least
one thousand dollars and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the  meeting
to  propose  such  item of  business,  and  (iv) any  material  interest  of the
stockholder in such  item of  business. Only  business which  has been  properly
brought  before  an  annual meeting  of  stockholders in  accordance  with these
by-laws shall be conducted at such meeting, and the Chairman of such meeting may
refuse to permit any business  to be brought before  such meeting which has  not
been properly brought before it in accordance with these by-laws.
 
     SECTION 3. Written notice of the annual meeting stating the place, date and

corporation  shall prepare and make,  at least ten days  before every meeting of
stockholders, a  complete list  of  the stockholders  entitled  to vote  at  the
meeting,  arranged  in  alphabetical  order, and  showing  the  address  of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the  examination of any stockholder, for any  purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten  days prior  to the  meeting, either at  a place  within the  city where the
meeting is to  be held,  which place  shall be specified  in the  notice of  the
meeting, or, if not so specified,
 
                                       1
 
<PAGE>
at  the place where the meeting is to be  held or the office of the Secretary of
the corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and  place
of  the  meeting during  the whole  time thereof,  and may  be inspected  by any
stockholder who is present.
 
     SECTION 5.  Special  meetings  of  the stockholders,  for  any  purpose  or
purposes,  unless  otherwise  prescribed by  statute  or by  the  certificate of
incorporation, shall be  called only  by the Board  of Directors  pursuant to  a
resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.
 
     SECTION  6. Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and
hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called,
shall be given not  less than 10 nor  more than 60 days  before the date of  the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
 
     SECTION 7. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall
be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
 
     SECTION  8. The holders of  a majority of the  stock issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote thereat, present  in person or represented by proxy,  shall
constitute  a quorum at all meetings of  the stockholders for the transaction of
business except  as otherwise  provided  by statute  or  by the  certificate  of
incorporation.  If, however, such quorum shall  not be present or represented at
any meeting  of the  stockholders, the  stockholders entitled  to vote  thereat,
present  in person  or represented  by proxy,  shall have  power to  adjourn the
meeting from  time  to time,  without  notice  other than  announcement  at  the
meeting,  until  a quorum  shall be  present or  represented. At  such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum  shall be present or  represented any business may  be
transacted  which  might  have  been transacted  at  the  meeting  as originally
notified. If the  adjournment is  for more  than thirty  days, or  if after  the
adjournment  a new record date  is fixed for the  adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given  to each stockholder of record entitled  to
vote at the meeting.
 
     SECTION 9. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders
of  a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented
by proxy  shall decide  any question  brought before  such meeting,  unless  the
question  is one upon which by express provision of applicable statute or of the
certificate of incorporation, a different vote  is required, in which case  such
express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.
 
     SECTION  10. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation,
each stockholder shall at every meeting  of the stockholders be entitled to  one
vote  in person or  by proxy for each  share of the  capital stock having voting
power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted or acted upon  after
three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
 
     SECTION   11.  Any  action  required  or  permitted  to  be  taken  by  the
stockholders of the  corporation must  be effected at  a duly  called annual  or
special  meeting of  stockholders, and  may not  be effected  by any  consent in
writing by such stockholders.
 
                                  ARTICLE III
 
                                   DIRECTORS
 
     SECTION 1. The number of directors  which shall constitute the whole  Board
shall  not be  less than twelve  (12), nor  more than eighteen  (18). Within the
limits so specified, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time by
the Board of Directors  pursuant to a  resolution adopted by  a majority of  the
entire  Board  of Directors.  At the  1983 Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders, the
directors shall be  divided into  three classes, as  nearly equal  in number  as
possible,  with the  term of  office of the  first class  to expire  at the 1984
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the term of office of the second class to expire
at the 1985 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the term of office of the  third
class  to expire  at the  1986 Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders. At  each annual
meeting of  stockholders following  such  initial classification  and  election,
directors elected to succeed those directors whose term expired shall be elected
for  a  term of  office  to expire  at the  third  succeeding annual  meeting of
stockholders after their election.
 
     SECTION 2. Newly created  directorships resulting from  an increase in  the
authorized  number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors shall
be filled by a  majority of the  directors then in office  although less than  a
quorum,  or by  a sole  remaining director, and  directors so  chosen shall hold
 
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
office for a term expiring  at the annual meeting  of stockholders at which  the
term  of the  class to which  they have been  elected expires. If  the number of
directors is changed, any  increase or decrease shall  be apportioned among  the
classes  so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal
as possible. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shall
shorten the term of any incumbent director. If there are no directors in office,
then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
 
     SECTION 3. Nominations  for the election  of Directors may  be made by  the
Board  of Directors or by  any stockholder entitled to  vote for the election of
Directors. Any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons for election as
a director only if written notice  of such stockholder's intention to make  such
nomination  or nominations is given in  accordance with the procedures set forth
in Article II, Section 2 of these by-laws. Each such notice shall set forth,  in
addition  to any information required to be  set forth by Article II, Section 2,
(a) the name and address of the  stockholder who intends to make the  nomination
and  of the  person or persons  to be  nominated; (b) a  representation that the
stockholder is a holder of record of  stock of the corporation entitled to  vote
at  such meeting and intends to  appear in person or by  proxy at the meeting to
nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all
arrangements or understandings  between the  stockholder and each  person to  be
nominated  and  any other  person  or persons  (naming  such person  or persons)
pursuant to  which  the  nomination  or  nominations  are  to  be  made  by  the
stockholder; (d) such other information regarding each person to be nominated as
would  have been required to be included  in a proxy statement filed pursuant to
the proxy rules of the Securities  and Exchange Commission had such person  been
nominated,  or intended to be nominated, by  the Board of Directors; and (e) the
consent of each person to be nominated to serve as a director of the corporation
if elected at such meeting. The Chairman of any meeting of stockholders, and the
Board of Directors,  may refuse to  recognize the nomination  of any person  not
made in accordance with the foregoing procedures.
 
     SECTION 4. The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the
direction  of its Board of  Directors which may exercise  all such powers of the
corporation and do all such lawful acts and  things as are not by statute or  by
the  certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws directed or required to be
exercised or done by the stockholders.
 
                       MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
     SECTION 5. The  Board of Directors  of the corporation  may hold  meetings,
both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.

or these by-laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated
by the  Board  of Directors,  may  participate in  a  meeting of  the  Board  of

communications equipment  by means  of which  all persons  participating in  the
meeting  can  hear  each  other,  and  such  participation  in  a  meeting shall
constitute presence in person at the meeting.

     In the absence or disqualification of  a member of a committee, the  member
or  members thereof  present at  any meeting  and not  disqualified from voting,
whether or not he or they  constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint  another

Board of  Directors  in  the management  of  the  business and  affairs  of  the
corporation,  and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all
papers which may  require it;  but no  such committee  shall have  the power  or

merger or consolidation,  recommending to  the stockholders the  sale, lease  or
exchange  of all or substantially all  of the corporation's property and assets,
recommending  to  the  stockholders  a  dissolution  of  the  corporation  or  a

for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and/or a stated  annual
sum  as a director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the
corporation in any other capacity  and receiving compensation therefor.  Members
of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending
committee meetings.

     SECTION  1. Whenever, under the provisions of statute or of the certificate
of incorporation or  of these by-laws,  notice is  required to be  given to  any
director  or stockholder, it shall not  be construed to require personal notice,
but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director  or
stockholder,  at his address  as it appears  on the records  of the corporation,
with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the
time when deposited in the United States  mail. Notice to directors may also  be
given by facsimile.

     SECTION 2. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions
of  statute or of the certificate of incorporation or of these by-laws, a waiver
thereof in writing,  signed by the  person or persons  entitled to said  notice,
whether  before or  after the  time stated  therein, shall  be deemed equivalent
thereto. The attendance of a director  at any meeting shall constitute a  waiver
of  notice of such  meeting, except where  a director attends  a meeting for the
express purpose of  objecting to  the transaction  of any  business because  the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

meeting of stockholders shall choose a Chairman of the Board and a Secretary.
 
     SECTION 3.  The Board  of Directors  may appoint  such other  officers  and
agents  as it shall deem necessary, who  shall hold their offices for such terms
and shall exercise such  powers and perform such  duties as shall be  determined
from time to time by the board.
 
     SECTION  4. The  compensation of all  officers of the  corporation shall be
fixed by the Board of Directors.

the  Board of Directors. Any vacancy occurring  in any office of the corporation
may be filled by the Board of Directors at such times as it sees fit.
 
                           THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
 
     SECTION 6. The Chairman of the Board  shall preside at all meetings of  the

the Board of Directors has authorized to be executed, except in cases where  the
signing  and execution  thereof shall be  expressly otherwise  designated by the
Board of  Directors or  by these  by-laws, or  shall be  required by  law to  be
otherwise signed or executed.
 
                                 THE SECRETARY
 
     SECTION  7.  The  Secretary  shall  attend all  meetings  of  the  Board of
Directors and all meetings of the stockholders and record all the proceedings of
the meetings of the corporation  and of the Board of  Directors in a book to  be
kept  by him  for that purpose  and shall  perform like duties  for the standing
committees when required. He  shall give, or  cause to be  given, notice of  all
meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and
shall  perform such other duties as may  be prescribed by the Board of Directors
or the Chairman of the Board. He shall have custody of the corporate seal of the
corporation and he  shall have  authority to affix  the same  to any  instrument
requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by his signature. The Board
of  Directors may give general authority to  any other officer to affix the seal
of the corporation and to attest the affixing by his signature.

                              CERTIFICATE OF STOCK
 
     SECTION 1. Every holder  of stock in the  corporation shall be entitled  to
have  a  certificate, signed  by,  or in  the name  of  the corporation  by, the
Chairman of  the Board  and the  Secretary of  the corporation,  certifying  the
number of shares of stock owned by him in the corporation.
 
     If  the corporation  shall be  authorized to issue  more than  one class of
stock  or  more  than  one  series  of  any  class,  the  powers,  designations,
preferences  and relative,  participating, optional  or other  special rights of
each class of  stock or series  thereof and the  qualifications, limitations  or
restrictions  of such preferences  and/or rights shall  be set forth  in full or
summarized on the face or back  of the certificates which the corporation  shall
issue  to represent  such class  or series  of stock,  provided that,  except as
otherwise provided in  the Delaware Corporation  Law, in lieu  of the  foregoing
requirements,  there may  be set forth  on the  face or back  of the certificate
which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock,  a
statement  that the corporation will furnish  without charge to each stockholder
who  so   requests  the   powers,   designations,  preferences   and   relative,
participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series
thereof  and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences
and/or rights.
 
     SECTION 2.  Any  of  or  all  the signatures  on  the  certificate  may  be
facsimile.  In case any officer,  transfer agent or registrar  who has signed or
whose facsimile signature has been placed  upon a certificate shall have  ceased
to  be  such officer,  transfer agent  or registrar  before such  certificate is
issued, it may be issued by the corporation  with the same effect as if he  were
such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
                               LOST CERTIFICATES
 
     SECTION  3.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  direct  a  new  certificate or

theretofore  issued  by the  corporation alleged  to have  been lost,  stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit  of that fact by the person  claiming
the  certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such
issue of a new certificate or certificates,  the Board of Directors may, in  its
discretion  and as  a condition precedent  to the issuance  thereof, require the
owner of such  lost, stolen  or destroyed  certificate or  certificates, or  his
legal  representative, to advertise the same in  such manner as it shall require
and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as  indemnity
against  any claim that may be made  against the corporation with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
                               TRANSFER OF STOCK
 
     SECTION 4. Upon surrender to the  corporation or the transfer agent of  the
corporation  of a certificate for shares  duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of succession,  assignment or authority  to transfer, it  shall be  the

thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
                               FIXING RECORD DATE
 
     SECTION 5. In  order that  the corporation may  determine the  stockholders
entitled  to  notice  of  or to  vote  at  any meeting  of  stockholders  or any
adjournment thereof,  or  to express  consent  to corporate  action  in  writing
without  a meeting,  or entitled  to receive  payment of  any dividend  or other
distribution or allotment of any rights,  or entitled to exercise any rights  in
respect  of any change, conversion or exchange  of stock or for any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix,  in advance, a record date, which  shall
not  be more than sixty nor less than  ten days before the date of such meeting,
or the date of the action  to be taken, and shall  comply with the rules of  any
national  securities exchange  on which  any securities  of the  corporation are
listed at the time. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting, provided, however,  that the Board  of Directors may  fix a new  record
date for the adjourned meeting.

any funds of the  corporation available for  dividends such sum  or sums as  the
Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper
as  a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or
for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such  other
purpose  as the Board of Directors shall  think conducive to the interest of the
corporation, and the Board of Directors  may modify or abolish any such  reserve
in the manner in which it was created.
 
                                     CHECKS
 
     SECTION  3. All checks  or demands for  money and notes  of the corporation

                                INDEMNIFICATION
 
     SECTION  6. (a) The corporation shall indemnify  any person who was or is a
party or  is  threatened to  be  made a  party  to any  threatened,  pending  or
completed  action, suit or proceeding,  whether civil, criminal, administrative,
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent  of
the  corporation, or is  or was serving at  the request of  the corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust,  or other  enterprise,  against expenses  (including  attorneys'
fees),  judgments, fines and amounts paid  in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he  acted
in  good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal  action
or  proceeding, had no reasonable cause to  believe his conduct was unlawful. In
this connection, the termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement,  conviction,  or  upon  a plea  of  nolo  contendere  or  its
equivalent,  shall not, of itself, create a  presumption that the person did not
act in good faith and in a manner  which he reasonably believed to be in or  not
 
                                       7
 
<PAGE>
opposed  to the  best interests  of the  corporation, and,  with respect  to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his  conduct
was unlawful.
 
     (b)  The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action  or
suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason  of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of
the corporation, or is  or was serving  at the request of  the corporation as  a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually  and  reasonably incurred  by  him in  connection  with the  defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he  acted in good faith and in a manner  he
reasonably  believed  to be  in  or not  opposed to  the  best interests  of the
corporation and except that no indemnification  shall be made in respect of  any
claim,  issue, or matter as to which such  person shall have been adjudged to be
liable to  the corporation  unless and  only to  the extent  that the  Court  of
Chancery  or the court in which such  action or suit was brought shall determine
upon application that, despite the adjudication or liability but in view of  all
the  circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such  expenses which  the Court of  Chancery or  such other  court
shall deem proper.
 
     (c)  To the  extent that  a director,  officer, employee,  or agent  of the
corporation has been  successful on the  merits or otherwise  in defense of  any
action,  suit,  or proceeding  referred to  in  subsections (a)  and (b),  or in
defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified  against
expenses  (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith.
 
     (d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by  a
court)  shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee, or
agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable  standard
of  conduct set forth  in subsections (a)  and (b). Such  determination shall be
made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting  of
directors  who were not parties  to such action, suit,  or proceeding, or (2) if
such a  quorum is  not obtainable,  by independent  legal counsel  in a  written
opinion,  or (3) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a majority
of a quorum consisting of directors who  were not parties to such action,  suit,
or proceeding so directs, or (4) by the stockholders.
 
     (e) Expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by an officer or director
in  defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit
or proceeding  shall  be  paid  by  the corporation  in  advance  of  the  final
disposition  of such action, suit, or  proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that  he is not entitled to be  indemnified
by  the  corporation as  authorized in  this  section. Such  expenses (including
attorney's fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
 
     (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or  granted
pursuant  to the provisions of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which one seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may
be entitled under any by-law,  agreement, vote of stockholders or  disinterested
directors  or otherwise, both  as to action  in his official  capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office.
 
     (g) The corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of
the corporation, or is  or was serving  at the request of  the corporation as  a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture,  trust, or other enterprise against  any liability asserted against him
and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as  such,
whether  or not the  corporation would have  the power to  indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of this section.
 
     (h) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VII  shall, unless otherwise provided when  authorized
or  ratified, continue as to a person who  has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee, or agent and shall inure to  the benefit of the heirs, executors,  and
administrators of such person.

     (i)  A director of  the corporation shall  not be personally  liable to the
corporation or its  stockholders for  monetary damages for  breach of  fiduciary
duty  as a director  except for liability  (i) for any  breach of the director's
duty of  loyalty  to the  corporation  or its  stockholders,  (ii) for  acts  or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation  of law, (iii) for  a stock repurchase which  is illegal under Section
174 of the General  Corporation Law of  the State of Delaware,  or (iv) for  any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the
Delaware  General Corporation Law hereafter is  amended to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability
provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended
Delaware General Corporation Law. Any  repeal or modification of this  paragraph
by  the stockholders of the corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not
adversely affect any limitation on the  personal liability of a director of  the
corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
 
                                  ARTICLE VIII
 
     SECTION  1.  These by-laws  may be  altered, amended,  or repealed,  or new
by-laws may be  adopted by  the Board  of Directors  at any  regular or  special
meeting  of  the Board  of Directors  if notice  of such  alteration, amendment,
repeal, or adoption of new by-laws is  contained in the notice of such  meeting.
The  by-laws of  the corporation  may be altered,  amended, or  repealed, or new
by-laws may be adopted by the stockholders at any regular or special meeting  of
the stockholders if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal, or adoption of
new  by-laws be contained in the notice of such meeting, and if such alteration,
amendment, repeal,  or adoption  is  approved by  the  affirmative vote  of  the
holders  of not less than 80% of the voting  power of all shares of stock of the
corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors.

                                       OF

Plan  of Witco Corporation (the  'Plan') effective January 1,  1994, in order to

     The Plan is intended  to be an unfunded  plan maintained primarily for  the
purpose  of providing deferred compensation for  a select group of management or
highly compensated  employees as  described in  Section 201(2)  of the  Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

before receiving all amounts due him under the Plan, any remaining amounts shall

                                 PARTICIPATION
 
     2.1.   Initial  Participation.  The  Board  of  Directors  shall  designate
specified Officers to  be Participants in  the Plan. In  determining whether  an
Officer  shall  be  designated as  a  Participant,  the Board  of  Directors may
consider the nature of the services  rendered by the Officer, his  contributions

                                  ARTICLE III
                                    BENEFITS
 
     3.1.  Normal Supplemental Retirement Benefit.  Each Participant who retires
from the employ of an Employer as an active Officer on or after attaining age 65
shall be entitled to  receive a monthly  Normal Supplemental Retirement  Benefit
commencing  at his  Normal Retirement  Date equal  to one-twelfth  of the annual
benefit which is equal to:
 
          (a) 50% of the Participant's Final Average Compensation; reduced by
 
          (b) the sum of (1), (2) and (3) where (1), (2) and (3) are defined  to
     mean:
 
             (1) any amount payable pursuant to the Retirement Plan;
 
             (2)   any  amount  payable  pursuant  to  the  Excess  Benefit  and
        Compensation Cap Plan of Witco Corporation; and
 
             (3) an amount equal to 50% of his Social Security Primary  Benefit.
        The  Social Security  Primary Benefit  shall be  converted to  an annual
        benefit and shall be adjusted to the amount that would be payable at age
        65 if his Social Security retirement age is greater than age 65.
 
The amounts determined under (b)(1) and (b)(2)  shall, in the case of a  married
Participant,  be  determined as  if they  were to  be  paid on  a 50%  joint and
survivor basis; or, in the case of a single Participant or a married Participant
whose beneficiary is other than spouse, be determined as if they were to be paid
on a 10 year certain and life basis regardless of the actual form of payment.
 
     3.2. Early Retirement Benefit. Each Participant who retires from the employ
of an Employer as an  active Officer prior to attaining  age 65 but on or  after
attaining age 62 shall be entitled to receive a
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
monthly pension commencing on the first day of the month coinciding with or next
following  his date  of retirement  equal to  one-twelfth of  the annual benefit
which is equal to:
 
          (a) 50% of  the Participant's  Final Average  Compensation reduced  by
     5/9ths  of 1%  for each month  that the  Participant's Benefit Commencement
     Date precedes his Normal  Retirement Date; provided,  however, that at  the
     discretion of the Board of Directors, this reduction may be waived; reduced
     by
 
          (b)  the sum of (1), (2) and (3) where (1), (2) and (3) and defined to
     mean:
 
             (1) any amount payable  pursuant to the Retirement  Plan as of  his
        Benefit Commencement Date;
 
             (2)   any  amount  payable  pursuant  to  the  Excess  Benefit  and
        Compensation  Cap  Plan   of  Witco  Corporation   as  of  his   Benefit
        Commencement Date; and
 
             (3)  an amount equal to 50% of his Social Security Primary Benefit.
        The Social  Security Primary  Benefit shall  be converted  to an  annual
        benefit and shall be adjusted to the amount that would be payable at his
        Benefit Commencement Date.
 
The  amounts determined under (b)(1) and (b)(2)  shall, in the case of a married
Participant, be  determined as  if they  were  to be  paid on  a 50%  joint  and
survivor basis; or, in the case of a single Participant or a married Participant
whose beneficiary is other than spouse, be determined as if they were to be paid
on a 10 year certain and life basis regardless of the actual form of payment.
 
     3.3.  Disability Retirement Benefit. Each Participant whose employment with
an Employer is terminated  prior to his  Normal Retirement Date  as a result  of
Disability  shall  be entitled  to  receive his  Normal  Supplemental Retirement
Benefit determined  in  accordance  with  the formula  in  Section  3.1  payable
commencing  on the first day of the  month coinciding with or next following the
determination that  he has  incurred a  Disability; provided,  however, that  in
determining  the reduction applicable under  Section 3.1(b), the reduction shall
be determined as of the later of the date of the Participant's Disability or the
earliest commencement date  of such  benefit under  the applicable  plan or  the
Social  Security Act.  In the event  that a  Participant's Disability retirement
benefit commences prior  to the date  a benefit can  be paid under  one of  such
plans  or the Social Security Act, the reduction shall only be applied to reduce
his benefit under this Plan when  reducing benefit is actually available to  the
Participant.  In addition,  a Participant's Disability  retirement benefit under
this Plan  shall  be reduced  by  any amounts  paid  under the  Witco  Long-Term
Disability  Plan.  In the  event the  Participant  recovers from  his Disability
before his Normal  Retirement Date  and does  not resume  participation in  this
Plan, he shall only be entitled to a termination benefit as described in Section
3.4  or, if eligible at the time  of his Disability, an early retirement benefit
as described in Section 3.2.
 
     3.4. Termination  Benefit. Except  as provided  in this  Section 3.4,  each
Participant  whose  employment  with the  Employer  is terminated  prior  to his
attainment of age 62 other than as a result of Disability or death, shall not be
entitled to any benefits under this Article III; provided, however, that in  the
event  his employment is  terminated at the  option of his  Employer for reasons
other than Cause, the Board of Directors, in its absolute discretion, may decide
to  provide  him  with  his  Normal  Supplemental  Retirement  Benefit   payable
commencing on his Normal Retirement Date. In the event of the death prior to his
Benefit  Commencement Date of such a Participant  with respect to whom the Board
of Directors has decided  to provide a  Normal Supplemental Retirement  Benefit,
his Beneficiary shall be entitled to the death benefit described in Section 3.6.
 
     3.5. Form of Pension Payments.
 
     (a)  The normal form of payment of benefits payable under this Article III,
shall be a monthly  pension equal to the  amount determined under Sections  3.1,
3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, as the case may be, payable to the Participant for life with no
further payments due after the Participant's death.
 
     (b)  Alternatively, at any  time prior to his  Benefit Commencement Date, a
Participant may elect to receive his pension in one of the following forms:
 
          (1) Joint and Survivor Option -- a monthly pension equal to the amount
     determined under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, as the case may be, payable
     to the Participant  for life  with the provision  that after  his death,  a
     monthly  pension  shall continue  to his  surviving spouse  (to whom  he is
 
                                       4
 
<PAGE>
     married at his Benefit Commencement Date) for the remainder of the spouse's
     life  in  an  amount  equal  to  50%  of  the  Participant's  pension.  The
     Participant  may elect to receive the Actuarial Equivalent of the joint and
     50% survivor option payable as a joint and 75% or 100% survivor option,  in
     which  case 75% or 100%, respectively, of the Participant's pension will be
     continued to his surviving spouse for life.
 
          (2) 15-Year Certain and Life Option -- a monthly pension equal to  the
     amount  determined under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, as the case may be,
     payable to the Participant for life  or for 15 years, whichever is  longer.
     If  a Participant dies before the expiration of the 15-year period certain,
     payments shall  be  continued  to the  Participant's  Beneficiary  for  the
     remainder of such period or, in the absence of a surviving Beneficiary, the
     Actuarial  Equivalent of such payments  shall be paid in  a lump sum to the
     Participant's estate.
 
          (3) Full Cash Refund Option --  a monthly pension equal to the  amount
     determined  under  Sections 3.1,  3.2, 3.3.  or  3.4, as  the case  may be,
     payable to the Participant for  life and, at his  death, any excess of  the
     Actuarial  Equivalent  value  of  the  pension  determined  at  his Benefit
     Commencement Date (on a 15-year certain and life basis) over the amount  of
     payments  actually  received  by him  shall  be paid  to  the Participant's
     Beneficiary in a single sum.
 
     Each Participant shall elect a form of payment upon becoming a Participant.
Such election may be changed at any time prior to his Benefit Commencement Date.
 
     3.6. Death  Benefits.  In the  event  of the  death  prior to  his  Benefit
Commencement  Date of a Participant (a) who is  an active Officer at the time of
his death, (b) who has ceased to be  a Participant as a result of a demotion  in
accordance  with Section 2.2 but who is  still employed by Witco or an Affiliate
at his date of death or (c) whose employment was terminated at the option of his
Employer and  the  Board of  Directors  elected to  provide  him with  a  Normal
Supplemental  Retirement Benefit in accordance with Section 3.4, his Beneficiary
shall receive a death benefit. Such death  benefit shall be equal to his  Normal
Supplemental Retirement Benefit payable commencing on the first day of the month
coinciding  with or  next following the  Participant's date  of death; provided,
however, that in determining the reduction applicable under Section 3.1(b),  the
reduction  shall be determined as of the  later of the date of the Participant's
death or the  earliest commencement date  of such benefit  under the  applicable
plan  or the Social  Security Act. In  the event that  a death benefit commences
hereunder prior to the date a benefit can be paid under one of such plans or the
Social Security Act, the reduction shall  only be applied to reduce his  benefit
under  this  Plan  when  the  reducing  benefit  is  actually  available  to the
Participant. Such  benefit  shall be  paid  in the  form  last selected  by  the
Participant  prior to  his death, i.e.,  (i) as an  annuity for the  life of his
spouse equal to 50% of the Participant's Normal Supplemental Retirement  Benefit
if  he elected the joint  and survivor option, (ii) over  15 years if he elected
the 15-year  certain and  life  option, or  (iii)  in a  lump  sum that  is  the
Actuarial  Equivalent of the benefit  payable on a full  cash refund basis if he
elected the full cash refund option.
 
                                   ARTICLE IV
                        BENEFITS ON A CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
     4.1. Change in Control Benefit. In  addition to any other benefits  payable
hereunder,  in the event of the termination of a Participant's employment within
three years after a Change in Control, by an Employer (other than for Cause), or
by the Participant for Good Reason, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
an amount equal to  three times his average  annual total compensation  received
from  Witco or any Affiliate for the  five calendar years ending before the year
in which  the Change  in  Control occurs  (determined  in accordance  with  Code
Section  280G(b)) less one dollar.  Such benefit shall be paid  in a lump sum as
soon as practicable following the Participant's termination of employment.
 
     4.2. Limitation. Notwithstanding Section 4.1, in the event that any payment
received or to be  received by the  Participant in connection  with a Change  in
Control  (whether  pursuant  to  the  terms of  this  Plan  or  any  other plan,
arrangement or agreement  with Witco or  an Affiliate) would  be subject to  the
excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, then the payments under this Article IV
shall  be  reduced to  the  extent necessary  so that  no  portion of  the total
payments payable under  this Plan  or any  other arrangement  or agreement  with
Witco or an Affiliate is subject to such excise tax.

                                 ADMINISTRATION
 
     5.1.  Administration. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee which
may employ  agents  and may  delegate  any of  its  rights, powers,  duties  and
responsibilities with respect to the operation and administration of the Plan to
any other person (whether or not an employee of an Employer) or organization.
 
     5.2.  Powers and Duties. In addition to  any implied powers and duties that
may be needed to carry out the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall  have
the following specific powers and duties:
 
          (a)  to make and enforce  such rules and regulations  as it shall deem
     necessary or proper for the efficient administration of the Plan;
 
          (b) to interpret the  Plan and to decide  any and all matters  arising
     under  the  Plan,  including  the  right  to  remedy  possible ambiguities,
     inconsistencies  or   omissions;   provided,   however,   that   all   such
     interpretations   and  decisions  shall   be  applied  in   a  uniform  and
     nondiscriminatory manner to all Officers similarly situated;
 
          (c) to compute  the amount of  benefits that shall  be payable to  any
     Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of the Plan;
 
          (d)  to authorize disbursements with respect  to the Plan on behalf of
     Witco; and
 
          (e) to allocate, from time to time, to one or more of its members  any
     of  its rights,  powers, duties  and responsibilities  with respect  to the
     operation and administration of the Plan.
 
     5.3. Benefit Claim Procedures. Applications for benefits shall be processed
in the same manner as applications for benefits under the Retirement Plan.
 
     5.4. Member's Own Participation. No member  of the Committee may act,  vote
or  otherwise influence a decision of the Committee specifically relating to his
participation under the Plan.
 
                                   ARTICLE VI
                           AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
 
     The Board of Directors may, in its absolute discretion, without notice,  at
any time and from time to time, modify or amend, in whole or in part, any or all
of  the provisions of the  Plan, or suspend or  terminate it entirely, provided,
that no  such  modification, amendment,  suspension  or termination  may  apply,
without his consent, to or affect the payment or distribution to any Participant
or  adversely affect the right of any Participant to any benefits provided under
the Plan as in effect as of the date on which he first became a Participant.
 
                                  ARTICLE VII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
     7.1. Funding. Distributions under  the Plan shall be  made solely from  the
general assets of Witco. A Participant or Beneficiary shall have only the rights
of  a general unsecured creditor  of Witco with respect  to any rights under the
Plan. Except as provided  in the next sentence,  no Participant, Beneficiary  or
any other person shall have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset or
assets  of Witco by reason of the right to receive a benefit under the Plan. The
Board of  Directors shall  establish  a trust  to  accumulate funds  to  provide
benefits  under the Plan. Such trust shall at all times be subject to the claims
of general creditors of Witco and  shall comply with such other requirements  as
the Internal Revenue Service may require for so-called 'rabbi trusts'.
 
     Prior to a Change in Control, Witco may, but is not required to, contribute
cash or other property to the trust from time to time. Upon a Change in Control,
Witco  or any successor corporation shall, as  soon as possible, but in no event
later than  30  days  following  the  Change  in  Control  make  an  irrevocable
contribution to the trust in an amount sufficient to pay each Participant or, in
the  event of the death of a Participant, his Beneficiary, the benefits to which
he would be entitled as of the date on
 
                                       6
 
<PAGE>
which the Change in Control occurred  assuming termination of employment on  the
date  of  the  Change in  Control  under  circumstances that  would  entitle the
Participant to benefits pursuant to Article IV.
 
     7.2. No Guarantee of Employment. The Plan shall not be deemed to constitute
a contract between an Employer and any Participant or to be a consideration for,
or an inducement for, the employment of any Participant by an Employer.  Nothing
contained  in the Plan shall  be deemed to give any  Participant the right to be
retained in the service  of an Employer  or to interfere with  the right of  the
Employer to discharge or to terminate the service of any Participant at any time
without  regard to  the effect  such discharge  or termination  may have  on any
rights under the Plan.
 
     7.3. Payments to Minors and Incompetents.  If a person entitled to  receive
any  payments under  the Plan is  a minor  or is deemed  by the  Committee or is
adjudged to be legally incapable of giving valid receipt and discharge for  such
payments,  the Committee may direct payments to the legal representative of such
person, or if none, to a person  designated by the Committee for the benefit  of
such  person, or  the Committee  may direct application  of the  payment for the
benefit of such person in such manner as the Committee considers advisable. Such
payment shall,  to  the extent  made,  be deemed  a  complete discharge  of  any
liability for such payment under the Plan.
 
     7.4. Nonalienation of Benefits. To the extent permitted by law, no benefits
payable  under  the  Plan  will  be  subject  in  any  manner  to  anticipation,
assignment, garnishment  or  pledge;  and any  attempt  to  anticipate,  assign,
garnish  or pledge the same will be void; no such benefits will be in any manner
liable for or  subject to the  debts, liabilities, engagements  or torts of  any
person entitled to receive such benefits.
 
     7.5.  Applicable  Laws;  Severability. This  document  shall  be construed,
administered and governed in all  respects under and by  the laws of the  United
States  and, to the extent applicable, under and by the laws of the State of New
York. If any provision of this document shall be held by a court or governmental
agency of competent jurisdiction to  be invalid or unenforceable, the  remaining
provisions of this document shall continue to be fully effective.
