                                     PART I

ITEM 1                              BUSINESS

A.   GENERAL

     York Research Corporation ("York" or the "Company") is a developer, owner
and marketer of energy related projects and products.  York, through its
subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures and affiliates, currently
participates in two broad areas of the energy business -- power project
development and services, including cogeneration and wind energy, and the
marketing of energy generated by others for sale in the wholesale power
business.  The company believes that continuing deregulation of world energy
markets, privatization of electric power generation and distribution systems,
and increasingly open markets are creating a demographic opportunity that York
is well positioned to exploit.  The Company believes that its several areas of
expertise will converge to create potential for growth as the twenty-first
century approaches.

     The Company has developed two power projects in New York City and is
currently completing a third much larger one.  A 7 megawatt ("MW") engine
powered facility in Coney Island, Brooklyn, was completed in 1989, and was
subsequently replaced by a 28 MW combined cycle gas turbine facility at the same
site, known as the Warbasse Project.  The third much larger project is the 286
MW facility owned by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. ("BNY
Facility").  Both projects have Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.
("Con Edison") and various host entities as the main customers.

     As a result of these projects and various others under development, the
Company is capable of developing a gamut of projects from very small to very
large, using both fossil fuels and wind power as energy sources, serving utility
grids, merchant sales, and self-contained residential complexes or industrial
users.

     The wholesale power business in the United States was previously limited to
inter-utility and power pool purchases and sales.  More recently, due to federal
deregulation, power may be purchased, transmitted over existing utility systems,
and then sold in the wholesale markets.  When fully deregulated, the retail
energy market would approximate $200 billion per year.  Under the current
regulatory regime, the Company does not take title to electric power, but acts
as a broker in conjunction with North American Energy Conservation, Inc.
("NAEC"), which does take title.  The Company is therefore not regulated as a
utility.

     Through its subsidiary, York Windpower Corporation ("York Windpower") (see
Item 1.E), the Company is proceeding to develop selected very large wind power
projects, and a series of mid-size projects.  In some areas, the indigenous wind
regimes provide a competitive source of power to meet expanding needs.  In
others, although there is a current surplus of energy, there is a long-term
need.  The current driving force behind the large projects is economic
development, combined with future capacity needs and the natural desire to
replace fossil fuels with environmentally clean renewable energies.
<PAGE>

     York will meet these needs by combining the Company's prowess in project
development, energy services and marketing with a European manufacturer's
technologically advanced wind turbine products.

     As a consequence of York's mutual cooperation agreement with this European
manufacturer, the Company will offer selected countries the opportunity to
create new jobs by locating production facilities for these technologically
advanced products in their areas, while acquiring for York large scale long-term
power contracts.  This arrangement assures the manufacturer of an economic
production level, while providing to the Company the advantages of domestic
content, product availability and competitive costs.

     Management believes that these areas of current concentration will allow
the Company to capitalize on its strengths and experience while positioning it
for the future.  During the past several years, the Company has invested a
significant portion of its revenues and capital resources in developing and
nurturing new markets and projects.  These efforts and expenditures, which need
to continue at some level in the near term, have not yet begun to generate
revenues, but management believes their potential warrants the efforts.

B.   COGENERATION

     1.   THE WARBASSE PROJECT

     Between 1987 and 1989, York constructed and operated a 7 MW engine powered
cogeneration project that supplied all of the utility services including
electricity, heat, hot water and air conditioning to Amalgamated Warbasse
Houses, Inc. ("AWH"), a 10,000 resident middle income housing complex in
Brooklyn, New York.  During 1989, York, as agent for the project owner,
Warbasse-Cogeneration Technologies Partnership L.P. ("WCTP") (see Item 1.E),
negotiated a 20 MW Power Sale Agreement between Con Edison and WCTP based upon
expansion of the project.  The Power Sale Agreement required WCTP to replace and
expand its facility, converting it from an engine facility to a larger gas
turbine facility, interconnect with the utility system and achieve commercial
operation by the end of 1991, and to achieve full rated capacity no later than
December 31, 1994, all of which was accomplished ahead of schedule.  This
Agreement was approved by the Public Service Commission ("PSC") in October 1989
and includes capacity, energy and operation and maintenance payments continuing
through the year 2011, with payments indexed to prevailing fuel price levels and
inflation.  The Warbasse facility is on land leased from its thermal host, AWH.

     The Company and WCTP executed an Agreement to Provide for Construction of
Additional Capacity in 1990, pursuant to which the Company constructed the
expansion of the facility to service the Con Edison contract.  The Company and
WCTP also executed an Operations and Maintenance ("O&M") Agreement in 1989
pursuant to which the Company agreed to operate the facility for its life (see
Note 5).

      In September 1994, pursuant to the O&M Agreement, the Company resumed full
operation of the Warbasse facility, and since that date has supplied all of the
thermal and electric needs of AWH on a continuous basis, and the full capacity
requirements of its electric power contract with Con Edison, as dispatched.  See
Note 5 for further information regarding the conclusion, in 1994, of certain
legal proceedings related to the Warbasse facility.


                                       -3-

     2.   BROOKLYN NAVY YARD PROJECT

     Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. ("BNYLP"), is owned and
controlled equally by a subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy ("Mission"), which
is a wholly owned subsidiary of SCE Corp., and B-41 Associates L.P. ("B-41LP").
BNYLP was formed to develop, construct, finance, own and operate the 286
megawatt natural gas fired combined cycle BNY Facility, which is now nearing
completion.

     The Company estimates the total capital costs of the Brooklyn Navy Yard
("BNY") Facility, when completed, to be approximately $420,000,000.  On December
22, 1995, the New York City Industrial Development Agency (the "IDA") issued
$253,925,700 of Industrial Development Revenue Bonds for the purpose of
financing certain costs incurred to date in constructing and developing the BNY
Facility.  These bonds are recourse to a letter of credit ("LOC") in like
amounts arranged by Mission, which LOC is in turn supported by a Mission
guarantee.  BNYLP has agreed to reimburse Mission if the guarantee is called,
out of future cash flow as and if available.  The proceeds of this bond sale are
being used to reimburse Mission for a portion of its construction loans made to
date and to reimburse the Company for engineering and other costs that had been
expensed in prior periods and for services that have been and will be performed
by the Company.


     In March 1996, the project delivered initial test quantities of power to
Con Edison, equivalent to existing contract capacity. Construction is still in
progress and it is likely that the portion of construction, not funded by the
IDA Bonds, will be completed prior to the receipt of additional third party
financing.  As a result, Mission is likely to fund all remaining construction
costs, or to be required to provide additional guarantees to secure project
financing.  The Company has no obligation to fund the project or provide
guarantees and all obligations incurred by BNYLP to date are non-recourse to the
Company.

     Pursuant to the provisions of the partnership agreement, Mission retains
the right, because it has spent in excess of $13,258,043 in development costs,
to take all the votes on the Management Committee that controls the day to day
operations of BNYLP.  Mission has informed B-41LP that they have incurred gross
costs in excess of $349,000,000 through February 28, 1996 for this project.  If
Mission decides to exercise its right to cast all votes on the BNYLP Management
Committee, B-41LP still remains a 50% general and limited partner in the Navy
Yard project and retains all its other rights, and Mission retains all its
funding and other obligations to the Project and B-41LP.

     Like other large projects of this nature, the BNY cogeneration project is
subject to various risks.  There can be no assurance that the facility, when
completed, will operate at sufficient levels to cover all operation and
maintenance expenses and debt service.  The Company has no liability for any
such shortfalls.


                                       -4-

C.   BULK ELECTRIC POWER TRANSACTIONS

     Through an affiliate, NAEC, York has been arranging wholesale electric
power transactions since the beginning of 1994.  These activities depend upon
open access to the utility-owned transmission grid through which power flows
between regions.  On April 24, 1996 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC") exercised its authority over the transmission grid by setting
comprehensive rules for open and comparable access to the entire grid for all
parties.  These rules will apply to NAEC and to York cogeneration and power
projects.  The newly deregulated United States market consumes 2.8 trillion
kilowatt hours of electric energy each year for which the retail cost is nearly
$200 billion.  The $70 billion wholesale market is now open.  During the next
several years the retail market is also expected to be substantially
deregulated.

     The Company currently participates as follows:

     (i)  NAEC, a wholesale power marketer enters into contracts to buy, sell,
transmit and otherwise deal in energy and energy products.  NAEC, as a licensed
entity, takes title to the commodities and is regulated and licensed by FERC.
Initially for regulatory and competitive reasons, the sole shareholder of NAEC
has been York's chairman (see Item 1.O).

     (ii) To date, York has acted solely as a broker for NAEC providing required
staff and services.  NAEC capital requirements have been provided by the
shareholder.  NAEC compensates the Company through brokerage fees, cost
reimbursements and success premiums.  In Fiscal 1996, the Company recognized a
total of $1,875,000 (see Note 13) as reimbursements of costs and power brokerage
fees.

     The Company believes that emerging opportunities in the wholesale and
retail markets and broader geographic activity will lead to services and
products not currently available, and that the project development and operating
expertise of the Company will be combined with the marketing of energy
commodities on a value added basis.

     While the Company believes that its creative capability, its several
relationships, and its level of performance to date can lead to long-term
success, there can be no assurance as to future results or as to how competitive
this business will become.

     To date, activities have been limited to Eastern Canada, New England, and
the Middle Atlantic states.   The Company believes that its marketing concepts
can be applied over a much broader area and a greater breadth of product
offerings.

D.   WIND ENERGY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

     Consistent with its strategy of developing environmentally beneficial power
projects for long-term operation, and for marketing power in future competitive
markets, the Company has been actively pursuing a variety of renewable energy
projects, particularly those that utilize wind energy in strategic locations.
York Windpower currently plans to develop selected very large wind projects and
a series of mid-sized ones.

     The current driving force behind these wind projects will be a combination
of short and long-term energy needs, economic development in the regions, and
the environmentally friendly nature of wind energy.

E.   SUBSIDIARIES, PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES

     The Company conducts a substantial portion of its business through
subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, in some of which affiliates of
the Company have an interest.

     York owns 100% of the outstanding shares of B-41 Management Corp.
("B41MC"), a Delaware corporation, Cogeneration Technologies, Inc. ("Cogen"), a
Delaware corporation , and York Research Canada, Inc. ("York Canada"), an entity
incorporated under the laws of Canada.  York Canada owns 100% of the outstanding
shares of York Windpower Corp., an entity incorporated under the laws of Canada.

     York and its subsidiaries own approximately 74.7% of B-41LP, the 50%
partner in BNYLP, as a result of the following:

     B-41MC holds a 5% general partnership interest in B-41LP.

     Cogen holds a 22% limited partnership in B-41LP resulting from assignment
     of a 40 MW Power Contract to B-41LP.

     York holds a 90% limited partnership interest in York Cogen Partners L.P.
     ("YCP"), which in turn holds a 53% limited partnership interest in B-41LP
     resulting from assignment of a 90 MW power contract to B-41LP.

     RV Associates L.P. ("RVA"), an entity controlled by the chairman of the
     Company, holds a 5% general partnership interest and a 15% limited
     partnership interest in B-41LP, resulting from assignment of a 40 MW
     contract to B-41LP, assumption of certain partnership liabilities and
     acceptance of a reduced share of development fees and reimbursements.  Its
     general partner, RRR'S Ventures Ltd., also holds a 10% general partnership
     interest in YCP (see Item 13).

     A portion of B-41LP's partnership interest in BNYLP has been pledged as
     collateral to unaffiliated third parties to secure certain obligations of
     B-41LP.


                                       -6-
<PAGE>

     WCTP is a limited partnership whose 25% general partner is RRR'S.  Entities
unaffiliated with the Company or RRR'S own an aggregate of 75% limited
partnership interest in WCTP.

     North American Energy Conservation, Inc. is owned by the Chairman of the
Company.

F.   BACKLOG

     The Company does not currently calculate backlog because the revenue
streams are dependent upon a number of variable factors such as inflation, fuel
prices and electric utility rates and utilizations.

G.   PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

     The Company and its subsidiaries have no patents or trademarks that can be
considered material to the Company's or its subsidiaries' businesses.

H.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Since research and development costs are not significant, the Company does
not account separately for these costs.

I.   RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS

     The Company and its subsidiaries are not dependent on any single source of
supplies or services for their activities.

J.   MARKETING

     York markets its projects through a dedicated sales staff, supplemented by
technical support personnel and management personnel from the Company, and by
representatives internationally.

K.   EMPLOYEES

     As of April 30, 1996, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 33 people
on a full-time basis.  Most of the Company's executives are technically trained
and actively engaged in the engineering and sales areas.

L.   COMPETITION

     There are many companies with access to greater financial resources that
are active in various aspects of the Company's energy business.  These companies
will continue to compete in the energy marketplace.  The Company cannot assess
the effect of competition in the future.


                                       -7-
<PAGE>

M.   CUSTOMERS

     During Fiscal 1996, all of the services revenues were derived from WCTP and
BNYLP.  Development and other fees were realized from BNYLP and NAEC.

N.   ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The Company believes that the technology it employs, which provides for
increased efficiency, compared to conventional power generation facilities, is
not environmentally sensitive.  The construction of cogeneration facilities
requires typical environmental impact statements and permitting procedures which
may result in delays.  The Company believes that it is in compliance with
federal, state and local laws involving the protection of the environment.  The
Company does not believe that continued compliance will require any material
capital expenditures.  The Company's cogeneration facilities are designed to
comply with all applicable environmental laws.

O.   REGULATION

     A subsidiary of the Company operates the Warbasse cogeneration facility in
New York that is a qualifying cogeneration facility ("QF") pursuant to the
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 ("PURPA").  The Company is also
engaged in the development of the BNY cogeneration project in New York that has
filed for and obtained QF status.

     Projects that meet the QF criteria stated in the federal rules generally
are exempt from federal, state and local regulation that applies to generating
facilities which are not QFs.  However, the New York State Public Service
Commission ("NYPSC") has determined that it has the authority to regulate sales
of electricity by QFs to retail customers, though the regulatory regime is less
burdensome than that applied to traditional utilities.  The NYPSC has not made
any determination as to whether this policy would apply to the Projects.

     One of the criteria for QF status is that a total of no more than 50
percent of the equity interests may be owned by one or more companies that are
electric utility holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 ("PUHCA").  Under PUHCA, an entity which owns 10 percent or more of the
voting securities of, or otherwise controls, an electric utility company, is an
electric utility holding company.  An electric utility company is defined in
PUHCA to mean a company that owns or operates physical facilities for the
generation, transmission or distribution of electricity for sale.  QFs are
expressly exempt from this definition, and the Company therefore is not a public
utility holding company by virtue of its interests in QFs.

     POWER BROKERING

     A power broker is not considered to be a public utility under the Federal
Power Act ("FPA") and is not subject to regulation by the


                                       -8-
<PAGE>

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), which administers the FPA.  A
power broker arranges transactions for a buyer and seller and receives a fee for
its services.  To date, no company that is a power broker has been found by the
SEC to be an electric utility company under PUHCA.  Accordingly, the Company
believes that its activities as a broker of electricity also would not result in
its becoming an electric utility company or an electric utility holding company
under PUHCA, and would not affect the QF status of the Projects.

     POWER MARKETING

     NAEC is considered to be a public utility under the FPA and its
transactions are regulated under the FPA.  A power marketer takes title to
electricity and resells it at wholesale in interstate commerce.  To date, no
company that is a power marketer has been found by the SEC to be an electric
utility company under PUHCA, but there can be no assurance as to the future.
NAEC is owned by a single individual, not by any company.  To date, no
individual has been found to be a public utility holding company.  The Company
believes that NAEC's activities as a power marketer would not result in the
Company becoming an electric utility company or an electric utility holding
company under PUHCA and would not affect the QF status of the Projects.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
ITEM 7          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     BROOKLYN NAVY YARD PROJECT

     Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. ("BNYLP"), a joint venture,
was formed on October 19, 1992.  BNYLP is owned and controlled equally by a
subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy ("Mission"), which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of SCE Corp., and a limited partnership, B-41 Associates, L.P.("B-41
LP"), in which the Company is the majority partner (see Note 4).

     The Company estimates the total capital costs of the BNY Facility, when
completed, to be approximately $420,000,000.  On December 22, 1995, the New York
City Industrial Development Agency (the "IDA") issued $253,925,700 of Industrial
Development Revenue Bonds for the purpose of financing certain costs incurred to
date in constructing and developing the BNY Facility.  These bonds are recourse
to a letter of credit ("LOC") in like amounts arranged by Mission, which LOC is
in turn supported by a Mission guarantee.  BNYLP has agreed to reimburse Mission
if the guarantee is called, out of future cash flow as and if available.  The
proceeds of this bond sale are being used to reimburse Mission for a portion of
its construction loans made to date and to reimburse the Company for engineering
and other costs that had been expensed in prior periods and for services that
have been and will be performed by the Company.

     In March 1996, the project delivered initial test quantities of power to
Con Edison, equivalent to existing contract capacity.  Construction is still in
progress and it is likely that the portion of construction not funded by the IDA
Bonds will be complete prior to the receipt of additional third party financing.
As a result, Mission is likely to fund all remaining construction costs, or to
be required to provide additional guarantees to secure project financing.  The
Company has no obligation to fund the project or provide guarantees and all
obligations incurred by BNYLP to date are non-recourse to the Company.

     Pursuant to the provisions of the partnership agreement, Mission retains
the right, because it has spent in excess of $13,258,043 in development costs,
to take all the votes on the Management Committee that controls the day to day
operations of BNYLP.  Mission has informed B-41 LP that they incurred gross
costs in excess of $349,000,000 through February 28, 1996 for this project.  If
Mission decides to exercise its right to cast all votes on the BNYLP Management
Committee, B-41 LP still remains a 50% general and limited partner in the Navy
Yard project and retains all its' other rights, and Mission retains all its
funding and other obligations to the Project and B-41 LP.

     Like other large projects of this nature, the BNY cogeneration project is
subject to various risks.  There can be no assurance that the facility, when
completed, will operate at sufficient levels to cover all operation and
maintenance expenses and debt service.  The Company has no liability for any
such shortfalls.

     WARBASSE PROJECT

     In September 1994, the Company resumed full operations of the Warbasse
facility, and since that date has supplied, on a continuous basis, all the
electric and thermal energy needs of the host, Amalgamated Warbasse Houses,
Inc., and is supplying up to the full capacity requirements of its electric
power contract with Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc, when
dispatched.

     The Company is in the final stages of completing the Warbasse project, and
expects to spend approximately $1,000,000 during the next year, on certain
remaining items.

     GENERAL

     During the year ended February 28, 1996, cash balances increased by
approximately $3.8 million.  Net income from operations generated approximately
$4.4 million offset by approximately $3.0 million spent on construction of the
Warbasse project, and an increase in service receivables of approximately $1.7
million, resulting in cash used in operating activities of approximately
$759,000.  During Fiscal 1995, the Company had net income of approximately
$222,000, and spent approximately $1,846,000 on construction, with virtually no
change in service receivables, resulting in cash used in operating activities of
approximately $2.5 million.

     Cash generated by financing activities in Fiscal 1996 was approximately
$4,666,000, due to the repayment by the York Research Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Trust ("ESOP") of $3,079,000 of the demand purchase money loans due to
the Company, and $1,455,000 due to proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants
and options.  In Fiscal 1995, the ESOP repaid $2,153,000, and there were no
material exercises of warrants or options.

     The ESOP  purchased from the Company a total of 3,793,500 shares of the
Company's Common Stock between 1988 and February 28, 1996 in exchange for demand
purchase money loans, totaling approximately $14,462,000 (see Note 10).  During
the fiscal year ended February 28, 1994, the ESOP trustee sold 1,149,500 shares
of the Company's common stock at a profit to the ESOP, repaid $6,165,000 of the
demand purchase loans, and used a portion of the ESOP's common shares as
collateral for loans to the ESOP by third parties, totaling approximately
$931,000 at February 28, 1994.  During Fiscal 1995, the ESOP trustee sold
380,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a profit to the ESOP, and repaid
$2,153,000 of the demand purchase loans.  The ESOP also repaid approximately
$370,000 of third party loans during Fiscal 1995, leaving a balance owed to
third parties of approximately $561,000.  During Fiscal 1996, the ESOP trustee
sold 606,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a profit to the ESOP, and
repaid approximately $3,079,000 of the demand purchase money loan.  The Company
expects the ESOP to repay up to an additional $1,300,000 of demand purchase
money loans in Fiscal 1997.

     During the year ended February 28, 1995, cash used in operating activities
was approximately $2,535,000, in contrast to approximately $8,893,000 used
during the prior year.  Due to the resumption of


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

construction of the Warbasse Project, the Company spent approximately $1,846,000
on construction in progress in Fiscal 1995.  Additionally, the remaining
approximately $572,000 due to bank was paid during Fiscal 1995.  During the year
ended February 28, 1994, amounts paid to bank and equipment vendor were
approximately $4,934,000.

     Cash generated by financing activities during Fiscal 1995 was approximately
$2,133,000, due mainly to the repayment by the ESOP of $2,153,000 of the demand
purchase money loans due to the Company.  In Fiscal 1994, the repayment by the
ESOP was approximately $7,233,000.

     In Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company's York Canada, Inc. subsidiary
incurred approximately $884,000, $793,000 and $349,000, respectively, of
selling, general and administrative expenses.  Fiscal 1995 was the first fully
staffed year.

     The Company has an agreement with NAEC which provides for the Company to be
reimbursed for all costs associated with its activities related to NAEC and the
Company receives brokerage fees to be mutually agreed upon based on level of
activity.  In Fiscal 1996, the Company received from NAEC $1,200,000 as a
reimbursement of costs and $675,000 as brokerage fees.  In Fiscal 1995, the
Company received from NAEC $1,200,000 as a reimbursement of costs and $250,000
as brokerage fees.

     The Company has no significant capital commitments other than completion of
construction of the Warbasse facility.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

     In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of ("SFAS No. 121"), which
provides guidance on when to assess and how to measure impairment of long-lived
assets, certain intangible assets and goodwill related to those assets to be
held and used, and for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to
be disposed of.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board also issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"), which gives companies a choice of the method of
accounting used to determine stock-based compensation.  Companies may account
for such compensation either by using the intrinsic value-based method provided
in APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25") or
the fair market value-based method provided in SFAS No. 123.  These accounting
standards are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995.  The Company believes that the impact of adopting SFAS
No. 121 will not have a material effect on the Company.  The Company intends to
continue to use the intrinsic value-based method provided in APB No. 25, to
determine stock-based compensation.  The sole effect, on the Company, of the
adoption of SFAS No. 123 will be the obligation to comply with the new
disclosure requirements provided thereunder.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1996 COMPARED TO 1995

     Total revenues increased approximately $6,868,000 when comparing the years
ended February 28, 1996 to February 28, 1995.  This was mainly due to a
reimbursement by BNYLP of $5,000,000 for certain engineering services and other
costs that had been expensed in prior periods.  Services revenues increased
approximately $2,290,000 when comparing year to year, since the Warbasse project
resumed operations in September 1994, thereby reflecting only six months of
revenue in Fiscal 1995 versus a full year in Fiscal 1996.  Development fees paid
by Mission to B-41LP to compensate B-41LP for certain services rendered
increased $2,000,000 and power brokerage fees increased $425,000.  These
increases were offset by decreases of $2,500,000 and $533,000 due to the
conclusion of certain monthly development fees from BNYLP in December 1994 and
June 1995, respectively.

     Cost of services increased approximately $2,490,000 when comparing Fiscal
1996 to Fiscal 1995.  This was principally due to an increase in cost of
services to WCTP, which include fuel and other operations and maintenance costs,
of approximately $1,728,000, commensurate with service revenues to WCTP and an
increase in related overhead expenses allocated from selling, general and
administrative expenses.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately
$300,000 when comparing Fiscal 1996 to Fiscal 1995.  An increase of
approximately $478,000 is attributable to payroll and related expenses, as a
result of salary increases, additional personnel, and continually increasing
health insurance costs.  An increase of approximately $407,000 was related to
expenditures for development of new projects, and an increase of $181,000 in
Fiscal 1996 related to public company and corporate communications expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $778,000,
as a result of an increase in overhead expenses allocated to cost of services.

     Interest and other income increased approximately $876,000 from year to
year.  Of this increase, approximately $1,083,000 was due to interest received
from WCTP related to the long-term note receivable acquired by B-41LP in
September 1994, thereby reflecting only six months of interest income in Fiscal
1995 versus a full year in Fiscal 1996.  The realization of a deferred gain of
approximately $244,000 in Fiscal 1995 resulted in a decrease when comparing year
to year.

     Income allocated to minority interest increased $500,000 when comparing
year to year.  This was the minority portion of the income of B-41LP.

1995 COMPARED TO 1994

     Total revenues increased approximately $1,031,000 when comparing the year
ended February 28, 1995 to the year ended February 28, 1994 due to a number of
factors:  (a) services to WCTP increased approximately $2,146,000 due to
resumption of operations of the Warbasse Project in September, 1994, (b)
brokerage fees of $250,000 were earned from NAEC in the year ended February 28,
1995, offset by (c) a decrease in engineering and other


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

services-BNYLP revenues of approximately $637,000 due to a reduced level of
services rendered commensurate with the project status, and (d) a decrease in
development fees-BNYLP of approximately $729,000 as a result of the extension of
the development period over which deferred revenues are being amortized and the
conclusion of certain development fee receipts in December 1994.

     Cost of services increased approximately $1,494,000 when comparing the year
ended February 28, 1995 to the corresponding period in 1994.  Cost of services
to WCTP increased approximately $2,131,000 when comparing these periods, due to
the resumption of operations of the Warbasse project.  Cost of engineering and
other services-BNYLP decreased approximately $637,000 for these periods due to
the same reason as the decrease in revenues mentioned above.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately
$72,000 when comparing the year ended February 28, 1995 to the corresponding
period in 1994, resulting from the following changes:  (a) The classification of
certain selling, general and administrative expenses to cost of services
decreased approximately $431,000 in fiscal 1995 due to the reduced level of
services billed to BNYLP, (b) Canadian subsidiary expenses increased
approximately $444,000 during fiscal 1995 due to the establishment and full
staffing of the subsidiary in early fiscal 1995, offset by: (c) A decrease in
professional fees of approximately $246,000 for the year ended February 28, 1995
due to the resolution of existing litigation against the Company, and (d) an
increase in reimbursement of overhead and other costs by NAEC of approximately
$810,000 for the year ended February 28, 1995.

     Interest and other income increased approximately $1,213,000 for the year
ended February 28, 1995 as compared to the year ended February 28, 1994 mainly
due to interest income of approximately $1,277,000 received from WCTP (see
Note 5) and realization of a deferred gain of approximately $244,000 in the
current year.

     On April 26, 1990 the Company issued to Mr. Beningson warrants exercisable
for 10 years, to purchase 475,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of
$11.00 per share (the closing price of the Company's common stock on that date).
On July 16, 1993, the purchase price of Mr. Beningson's 475,000 warrants was
reset to $6.00 per share.

     On January 10, 1991, the Company issued to Mr. Beningson warrants
exercisable for 10 years to purchase 475,000 shares of common stock at a
purchase price of $8.00 per share (the closing price of the Company's common
stock on that date).  On July 16, 1993, the purchase price of these warrants was
reset to $6.00 per share.

     At February 28, 1994, the Company forgave an advance to Mr. Trachtenberg of
$147,555, which had been disbursed in Fiscal 1990.  The forgiveness of this
amount was reflected as compensation expense in Fiscal 1994.

     On July 16, 1993, the Company issued warrants exercisable for 10 years to
Mr. Beningson and Mr. Whiteman to purchase 800,000 and 40,000 shares,
respectively, of common stock at a purchase price of $6.00 per share (the
closing price of the Company's common stock on that date).

     At February 28, 1996 and 1995, approximately $75,000 and $37,000,
respectively, was due to the Company from RRR'S as a result of general partners'
and administrative fees due to RRR'S by YCP, offset by, the cumulative effect of
expenses paid by the Company on behalf of RRR'S.

     The Company recognizes that potential conflicts of interest may arise by
reason of the fact that Mr. Beningson controls RRR'S Ventures, Ltd., NAEC and
RVA, and is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Beningson
has advised the Company that in all transactions between or affecting any
affiliated entity and the Company he will act in the best interests of the
shareholders of the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company, excluding himself.

               REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
York Research Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of York
Research Corporation and Subsidiaries as of February 28, 1996 and 1995, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 1996.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     As of February 28, 1996, a substantial portion of the Company's assets are
related to the Warbasse Project (See Note 5).

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
York Research Corporation and Subsidiaries at February 28, 1996 and 1995, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 1996, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

                   YORK RESEARCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS

     York Research Corporation ("York" or the "Company") is a developer, owner
and marketer of energy related projects and products and through its
subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures and affiliates, currently
participates in two broad areas of the energy business -- power project
development and services, including cogeneration and wind energy, and the
marketing of energy generated by others for sale in the wholesale power
business.

     The principal markets for the Company's products and services currently are
the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada.  Revenues are principally
derived from entities that supply, broker or market energy to utilities,
residential complexes, and industrial concerns.

2.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements of York and subsidiaries and all
majority owned partnerships include the accounts of Cogeneration Technologies,
Inc. ("Cogen"), B-41 Associates L.P. ("B-41LP"),  B-41 Management Corporation
("B-41MC"), York Cogen Partners L.P. ("YCP"), York Internet Power Services,
Inc., York Research Canada, Inc. ("York Canada") and York Windpower Corp., which
is 100% owned by York Canada.  All material intercompany profits and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company recognizes service revenues and power brokerage fees in the
period in which the work is performed.  Development fees


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

received are either amortized over the related development period, or recognized
as received, based on their nature.

     LONG-TERM CONTRACT AND CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS

     Due to the uncertainties that had surrounded the Warbasse Project (see
Note 5), the Company accounts for the Warbasse Project construction contract
using the completed contract method.  Construction in progress includes
equipment, building structure and installation subcontract costs, and
construction period interest.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

     Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are being depreciated
or amortized on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

               Machinery and equipment       5-10 years
               Furniture and fixtures        5-10 years
               Motor vehicles                3 years

     INCOME TAXES

     Effective March 1, 1993, the Company implemented the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes".  Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are
computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities including net operating loss carryforwards,
using the enacted marginal tax rate.  Deferred income tax expense or benefits
are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period.  As
permitted under the new rule, prior years' financial statements were not
restated.  A valuation allowance is recognized in certain circumstances.
Adoption of SFAS No. 109 has no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

     EXCESS OF INVESTMENT OVER NET ASSETS ACQUIRED, NET

     The Company's acquisition of Cogen in 1985 resulted in an $828,000 excess
of investment over net assets acquired, which is being amortized on a straight-
line basis over 20 years.  Accumulated amortization at February 28, 1996 and
1995 is $451,000 and $411,000, respectively.  At each balance sheet date, the
Company evaluates the realizability of goodwill based upon expectations of
nondiscounted


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

cash flows and operating income for each subsidiary having a material goodwill
balance.  Based upon its most recent analysis, the Company believes that no
material impairment of goodwill exists at February 28, 1996.

     PER SHARE DATA

     Per share data is based on the weighted average number of common shares and
common share equivalents (warrants and options) outstanding during the year,
calculated using the modified treasury stock method in 1996, and the treasury
stock method in 1995.  Common share equivalents were omitted in 1994, since the
effects were antidilutive.

</TABLE>

(a)  Amount reflects average unreleased ESOP shares (see Note 10) for the
     periods presented.  As of 2/28/96, the balance of unreleased ESOP shares
     was 1,009,256.
(b)  Amount reflects average dilution for the periods presented.  Fiscal 1996
     includes an average of 1,199,300 options and warrants exercisable at prices
     above market; Fiscal 1995 includes only options and warrants below market.
(c)  Not applicable to Fiscal 1994.
(d)  Because there was a loss in 1994, common share equivalents were anti-
     dilutive.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying amounts of cash, service, engineering and other receivables,
accrued expenses and accounts payable approximate fair value, principally
because of the short maturity of these items.  For long-term receivables-WCTP,
advances to minority partner and due to SBCC there are no quoted market prices,
and a reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without incurring
excessive costs.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain amounts in the 1994 consolidated financial statements were
reclassified to conform to the 1996 and 1995 presentation.

     A joint venture, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, L.P. ("BNYLP")
was formed as of October 19, 1992.  BNYLP is owned and controlled equally by a
subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy ("Mission"), which is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SCE Corp., and B-41LP.  BNYLP was formed to develop, construct,
finance, own and operate the 286 megawatt ("MW") natural-gas-fired, combined-
cycle Brooklyn Navy Yard ("BNY") cogeneration facility with Consolidated Edison
of New York, Inc. ("Con Edison") and various host entities as the principal
customers.

     B-41LP was formed to more effectively develop and manage the original
partners' investments in the BNY facility.  The profit sharing and ownership
percentages in the  B-41LP partnership agreement, as amended, are as follows:

     1.   RV Associates L.P. ("RVA"), whose general partner, RRR'S Ventures Ltd.
          is controlled by the Chairman of the Company, is a 5% general partner.
          B-41MC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of York, is also a 5% general
          partner.

     2.   RVA is also a 15% limited partner.  RVA contributed a power purchase
          agreement totaling 40 MW.

     3.   Cogen, a wholly-owned subsidiary of York, is a 22% limited partner.
          Cogen contributed a power purchase agreement totaling 40 MW.

     4.   YCP is a 53% limited partner.  RRR'S Ventures Ltd. is the 10% general
          partner of YCP, and York is the 90% limited partner in YCP.  YCP
          contributed a power purchase agreement totaling 90 MW.

     For tax purposes, depreciation, operating losses and capital transactions
are subject to other sharing percentages.

     The BNYLP partnership agreement contains provisions, among other things,
with respect to funding obligations of Mission, security for loans and
guarantees by Mission, the allocation of cash flow and tax depreciation under
various circumstances, profits and losses both before and after Mission's
advances have been repaid, management of the Partnership, and dispute resolution
(including provisions for a buy out of either Mission's or B-41LP's general
partnership interest).


                                      -36-

B-41LP and Mission are in the process of amending the Partnership agreement to
reflect certain additional agreements between the partners pertaining to funding
obligations, management, and operations.

     Upon formation of BNYLP, all of the project-related assets, contract
rights, leases or other intangible assets that had been accumulated by the
Company and B-41LP during the pre-joint venture development period, as well as
all related liabilities, were transferred to BNYLP.  Although BNYLP accounts for
B-41LP's contribution at an agreed upon value of $7,000,000, B-41LP recorded its
investment in BNYLP at the historical carrying value of the assets contributed
of zero.  B-41LP accounts for its investment in BNYLP under the equity method.

      For the years ended February 28, 1996 and 1995, BNYLP's only activity was
the construction of the BNY facility, and therefore BNYLP did not recognize any
revenues, expenses, or operating profits or losses.  The summarized financial
information of BNYLP at February 28, 1996 and 1995 is as follows:

                                   (Unaudited)
                                       1996                1995
                                   ------------        ------------
     Current assets                $ 15,138,000        $    903,000
     Noncurrent assets             $351,980,000        $123,454,000
     Current liabilities           $ 93,277,000        $ 31,947,000
     Noncurrent liabilities        $253,926,000        $ 79,652,000
     Net assets                    $ 19,915,000        $ 12,758,000

     The Company estimates the total capital costs of the BNY Facility, when
completed, to be approximately $420,000,000.  On December 22, 1995, the New York
City Industrial Development Agency (the "IDA") issued $253,925,700 of Industrial
Development Revenue Bonds for the purpose of financing certain costs incurred to
date in constructing and developing the BNY Facility.  These bonds are recourse
to a letter of credit ("LOC") in like amounts arranged by Mission, which LOC is
in turn supported by a Mission guarantee.  BNYLP has agreed to reimburse Mission
if the guarantee is called, out of future cash flow as and if available.  The
proceeds of this bond sale are being used to reimburse Mission for a portion of
its construction loans made to date and to reimburse the Company for engineering
and other costs that had been expensed in prior periods and for services that
have been and will be performed by the Company.

     Substantial construction is still in progress and it is likely that the
portion of construction not funded by the IDA Bonds will be


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

complete prior to the receipt of additional third party financing.  As a result,
Mission is likely to fund all remaining construction costs, or to be required to
provide additional guarantees to secure project financing.  The Company has no
obligation to fund the project or provide guarantees and all obligations
incurred by BNYLP to date are non-recourse to the Company.

     In consideration for certain development services for the BNY facility
performed by the Company, RVA has assumed the obligation for certain credit
facilities totaling $9,750,000 which are repayable only from amounts received
from third party BNYLP financings or BNY facility operations.

     As of February 28, 1996, the Company and B-41LP have received a total of
$21,541,000 for development fees, a nonrefundable commission from a vendor in
connection with the procurement of certain BNYLP equipment, and for
reimbursement of development costs net of related liabilities assumed by BNYLP.
In Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company recognized development fee revenue of
$3,267,000, $4,300,000 and $5,029,000, respectively.  At February 28, 1996,
revenues of $3,460,000 have been deferred, which is one half of the
nonrefundable commission, to be recognized over the estimated useful life of the
related equipment.

     In consideration for Mission being solely responsible for any cancellation
fee in connection with the BNYLP equipment contract, B-41LP will pay Mission
$3,750,000 contingent upon and solely out of distributions received from BNYLP
as a result of third party financings or BNY facility operations.

     In accordance with the joint venture agreement, the Company provides
engineering services for BNYLP.  During Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company
recognized revenue from engineering services of approximately $780,000, $593,000
and $1,231,000, respectively, which are reflected in service revenues and cost
of services.  During Fiscal 1996, the Company also recognized a reimbursement of
$5,000,000 for certain engineering and other costs that had been expensed in
prior periods.  At February 28, 1996 and 1995, the Company had receivables from
BNYLP of approximately $138,000 and $132,000, respectively.  These amounts are
included in service receivables and were fully collected subsequent to the
respective year ends.

     Pursuant to the provisions of the partnership agreement, Mission retains
the right, because it has spent in excess of $13,258,043 in


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

development costs, to take all the votes on the Management Committee that
controls the day to day operations of BNYLP.  Mission has informed B-41LP that
they had incurred gross costs in excess of $349,000,000 for this project as of
February 28, 1996.  If Mission decides to exercise its right to cast all votes
on the BNYLP Management Committee,  B-41LP still remains a 50% general and
limited partner in the Navy Yard project and retains all its other rights, and
Mission retains all its funding and other obligations to the Project and B-41LP.

     Like other large projects of this nature, the BNY cogeneration facility is
subject to various risks.  There can be no assurance that the facility, when
completed, will operate at sufficient levels to cover all operation and
maintenance expenses and debt service.  The Company has no liability for any
such shortfalls.

5.   WARBASSE PROJECT

     In May 1990, an agreement was entered into between Warbasse-Cogeneration
Technologies Partnership L.P. ("WCTP") (see Note 13) and the Company whereby the
Company agreed to construct the expansion of the Warbasse facility converting it
from the engine facility previously constructed for WCTP by the Company, to a
larger gas turbine facility (the "Warbasse Project") to enable it to service Con
Edison pursuant to the existing contract between WCTP and Con Edison (see
Note 7).

     The Company also contracted with WCTP to provide operations and maintenance
services for the Warbasse Project at its direct cost.  The services agreement
includes providing fuel, operating, manning and maintaining the facility.
During Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company recognized approximately
$4,700,000, $2,400,000 and $230,000, respectively, for operations and
maintenance services revenues, which has been reflected in service revenues.
Cost of services for the same periods was approximately $4,700,000, $2,400,000
and $242,000, respectively.

     In 1991, WCTP received notice from Sanwa Business Credit Corporation
("Sanwa" or "SBCC"), its senior lender, that it was in default.  Thereafter WCTP
instituted an action against Sanwa for breach of contract and fraud.  In 1992,
Sanwa initiated settlement discussions.


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

     On July 27, 1994, B-41LP purchased from Sanwa the note obligation of WCTP
to Sanwa together with all related collateral and ancillary rights owned by
Sanwa.  In payment, Sanwa will receive a share of the cash flow, if any, from
the BNY project.  The note obligation of WCTP to B-41LP (the "B-41LP Note") has
been recorded as a Long-term note receivable - WCTP and has a face value of
$28,522,000, which includes accrued interest of $6,022,000 from April 1, 1991
through July 27, 1994.  This obligation is payable to B-41LP from the net
operating cash flow of the Warbasse project.

     The obligation of B-41LP to Sanwa has been recorded as Due to SBCC of
$20,682,000, which is the net present value of the maximum annual amount payable
to SBCC, over 30 years discounted at 7%.  Other than $700,000 to be paid over
the first three years (of which $450,000 has been paid to date), the amount to
be paid to Sanwa will be a function of B-41LP's share of the actual cash flow
generated from the BNY project, with no guaranteed minimum amount.  B-41LP's
obligation to SBCC is recourse only to and secured only by B-41LP's cash flow,
if any, from the BNY project.

     The B-41LP Note has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at an
amount equal to the obligation to SBCC.  The $7,840,000 difference between the
face amount of the note and the amount reflected will be adjusted to income over
time as principal payments of the long-term note receivable are made by WCTP.

     In 1991, Amalgamated Warbasse Houses, Inc. ("AWH"), the host entity,
commenced a lawsuit against the Company, WCTP and Sanwa.  In addition, AWH
suspended all payments to WCTP and Cogen.  As a result, the Company was unable
to collect service revenue from WCTP.  On May 4, 1994, an agreement was signed
between WCTP and AWH settling all disputes between the parties.  The agreement
further provides for the repayment over approximately 22 months, which commenced
in September 1994, of certain amounts due to Cogen by AWH.  At February 28, 1996
and 1995, Cogen had $0 and $568,000, respectively, due from AWH.

     In September 1994, the Company resumed operations of the Warbasse Facility,
supplying on a continuous basis all the thermal and electric energy needs of the
host, AWH, and supplying up to the full capacity requirements of its electric
power contract with Con Edison, when dispatched.

     On November 17, 1994, the B-41LP Note due from WCTP was restructured along
with other long-term debt of WCTP.  Such other


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

long-term debt of WCTP includes a note payable to Tomen Power Corporation
("Tomen") and will include a note payable to Cogen when full construction of the
facility is completed.  The three notes will share in the net operating cash
flow of WCTP, as defined, pro rata in proportion to the principal balances of
the notes, and would share pari passu in the collateral of WCTP in the event of
a default.  Management expects that all three notes will be paid from the
operations of WCTP over 15 years, and each note carries an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 2%.  In addition, B-41LP and Cogen will receive a restructuring fee
of $3,000,000 each, to be paid the year after the three notes are fully paid.

     The Cogen note will include the full construction cost of the Warbasse
plant upon completion plus the unpaid balance of the Other long-term receivables
- - WCTP, which relate to operation and maintenance services performed for WCTP
prior to September 1994 and have been reclassified to long-term.  At both
February 28, 1996 and 1995, the balance of Other long-term receivables - WCTP
was approximately $1,530,000, which was included in service and other
receivables.  The balance of Company advances to WCTP at February 28, 1996 and
1995 were $137,000 and $0, respectively.

     The Company is in the final stages of completing construction of the
Warbasse project.  The Company expects that the Warbasse Project requires
approximately $1,000,000 to complete construction which includes installed
capacity beyond the requirements of the power purchase agreements and certain
enhancements for increased efficiency.

     In 1988, the Company made a $500,000 cash payment in lieu of a performance
bond to WCTP which is returnable upon completion of the expansion of the
Warbasse Facility.

6.   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

     Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

7.   CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS

     Construction in Progress ("CIP") as of February 28, 1996 and 1995 includes
all of the personal property procured, to which the Company has title, for
expansion of the Warbasse Project.  Also included in CIP is $1,012,000 of
interest and professional fees capitalized through February 28, 1996.  CIP was
reduced approximately $412,000 in Fiscal 1994 as a result of an insurance
settlement for equipment damaged in a December 1992 storm.

     The Company believes that the carrying value of CIP is fully realizable
through the present value of future net cash flow of the project (see Note 5).
Due to the initial uncertainty of timing and collection under the contract, the
Company is accounting for this project using the completed contract method.

8.   ACCRUED EXPENSES

     Accrued expenses at February 28, 1996 and 1995 include:


                                            1996                1995

9.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     COMMON STOCK - The Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of common
stock.  In addition, the Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of Class A
common stock, none of which have been issued.  Each Class A common share has
one/hundredth of a vote as compared with the regular common stock and is
entitled to a $.20 dividend priority before any dividends are payable on the
full voting common stock.


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

     The Company, from time to time, issues shares of unregistered common stock
for payment of certain nonemployee services.  The shares are valued at 70% of
the market value of registered common stock on the date of issue, which
management believes approximates the fair market value of services rendered.
This consideration has been included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the appropriate period.

     The following table presents the number of shares issued and the value of
services rendered:

     Fiscal Year         Shares         70% of Market Value

        1994             60,000              $278,250

     INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION ("ISO") PLAN - In 1982, the Company authorized
1,400,000 qualified stock options, which have all been granted.  Option prices
must not be less than fair market value at the time of grant.  The 1982 Plan
expired on April 26, 1992.  In September 1993, the Company adopted the 1993 ISO
Plan, authorizing a total of 3,000,000 qualified and nonqualified stock options,
of which 1,469,000 qualified stock options were granted to employees, and 56,000
nonqualified stock options were granted to two consultants to the Company.

10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

     During 1988, the Company adopted the York Research Corporation 401(k) Plan
("401(k) Plan").  The 401(k) Plan allows employees of the Company to defer a
portion of their earnings on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the 401(k)
Plan.  The Company may at its discretion make a contribution to the 401(k) Plan.
To date the Company has elected not to contribute to the 401(k) Plan.

     DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

     The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  The benefits are
based on years of service and the highest consecutive five years of the
employees' compensation.  The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually
the amount necessary to satisfy the Internal Revenue


                                      -45-
<PAGE>

Service's funding standards.  Contributions are intended to provide, not only
for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.

     Pension cost for the years ended February 28, 1996, 1995 and 1994 include
the following components:

                                      1996          1995            1994

     The Company had an additional minimum liability and an offsetting
intangible asset of $74,000 and $45,000 at February 28, 1996 and 1995,

     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     During 1988, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP")
that covers substantially all employees.  Effective March 1, 1994, the Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Position 93-6, "Employers' Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans" ("SOP 93-6").  The following table presents the
number of shares of common stock, which were unregistered at the time and
subsequently registered (except for the 250,000 shares purchased in Fiscal
1996), the ESOP purchased from the Company, at prices which represented 70% of
the NASDAQ closing prices at the date of purchase:

     Management believes the valuation represented the fair market value of the
unregistered shares on those dates.

     The Company contributed approximately $413,000, $373,000 and $320,000 to
the ESOP during Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company makes
annual contributions to the ESOP as determined by the Board of Directors and
subject to certain limitations dictated by tax regulations.

     To purchase the shares from the Company, the ESOP borrowed funds from the
Company.  Repayment of these loans has been and is expected from employer
contributions, borrowing by the ESOP from third parties, and by sale of
unreleased ESOP shares to third parties.  The Company has recorded all amounts
loaned to the ESOP as deferred compensation, a contra-equity account, and has
included the third party loans to the ESOP in other long-term liabilities.
Certain of the unreleased ESOP shares are used as collateral for a third party
loan to the ESOP.

     During the quarter ended August 31, 1993, the ESOP borrowed $1,150,000 from
third parties.  These funds, along with an additional $12,537,000 generated
through February 28, 1996 by the sale of the


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

Company's stock owned by the ESOP, were used to repay the demand purchase money
loans due to the Company.  The $1,150,000 initially borrowed by the ESOP was
included in other long-term liabilities and as deferred compensation, a contra-
equity account, and had a balance of approximately $561,000 at February 28, 1996
and 1995 as a result of repayments by the ESOP.  The ESOP incurred interest
expense of approximately $65,000 and $48,500, respectively related to these
loans during Fiscal 1996 and 1995.

     ESOP shares are released and allocated to participant accounts based upon
Company contributions and certain payments made to reduce ESOP debt to the
Company.  The Company reports compensation expense as shares are committed to be
released equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares then
become outstanding for earnings-per-share ("EPS") computations.

     A summary of the ESOP shares as of February 28, 1996 and 1995 is as
follows:

                                                1996           1995

     Shares released for allocation             195,872        125,842
     Unreleased shares                        1,000,348      1,563,927
                                             ----------     ----------
                                              1,551,997      1,975,500
                                             ----------     ----------
                                             ----------     ----------

     Fair value of unreleased shares
        at February 28, 1996 and 1995        $9,893,981     $9,383,562
                                             ----------     ----------
                                             ----------     ----------

     Prior to adoption of SOP 93-6, the unreleased shares were considered
outstanding for the EPS computation.  Accordingly, for the years ended February
28, 1996 and 1995, 1,035,363 and 1,604,666 shares, respectively, were no longer
considered outstanding.  The effect of adopting SOP 93-6 increased income per
share by $.03 for the year ended February 28, 1996, and resulted in no effect on
the income per share for the year ended February 28, 1995.

     At February 28, 1996, the Company also has alternative minimum tax net
operating loss carryforwards totaling $2,976,000 ($2,827,000 expiring after
September 30, 2007 and $149,000 expiring after September 30, 2009).  The
difference between these loss carryforward amounts is attributable to
adjustments required in the alternative minimum tax computation.

     Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the utilization of
carryforwards when an ownership change, as defined in the tax law, occurs.
Generally, an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than 50 percent
change in ownership.  If such a change should occur, the actual utilization of
carryforwards, for tax purposes, would be limited annually to a percentage,
approximately 5.5%, of the fair market value of the Company at the time of such
change.

     The reconciliation between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal
income tax rate is as follows:

                                       Year           Year            Year

     During the year ended February 28, 1996, the reduction in the valuation
allowance of $3,119,000 was the result of current utilization of net operating
losses of approximately $1,768,000, current utilization of other deferred tax
assets and other adjustments of approximately $667,000, and recognition of
deferred tax assets of approximately $684,000, based on the Company's
expectation of future taxable income.

     The deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance relating to
net operating loss carryforwards of $4,119,000 include tax benefits of $900,000
relating to stock options and warrants that will be allocated directly to paid-
in capital in the year they are realized.

     The Company paid income taxes for:
          Year ended February 28, 1996  $ 298,000
          Year ended February 28, 1995  $ 110,000
          Year ended February 28, 1994  $ 291,000

     In July 1990, in connection with a lease for office space, the Company
received from the prior tenant a rent subsidy equal to the difference between
the market rate for the premises and the rental provided for in the lease.  This
subsidy, which totaled $625,000, was paid to the Company in April 1991 and was
being amortized over the life of the lease as a monthly reduction to rent
expense.  At February 28, 1995, the unamortized balance was $126,000.  In May
1995, the lease was restructured and the remaining unamortized balance of
$72,000 was recognized.  The restructuring of the lease extended the life to
2003 at a reduced expense, and added another 2,500 square feet of office space.

     Total rent expense for operating leases was approximately $623,000 in
Fiscal 1996, $419,000 in Fiscal 1995 and $462,000 in Fiscal 1994.

13.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


     In Fiscal 1993, the Company loaned Mr. Whiteman $100,000, which is
outstanding at February 28, 1996 and is payable on demand, and earns interest at
prime.  In each of Fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company paid Mr. Whiteman
$24,000 for consulting services.  In Fiscal 1995, the Company issued 40,000
shares of common stock, valued at $87,500, 70% of the fair market value on the
date of issue, to Mr. Whiteman for consulting services.

     In Fiscal 1996, the Company paid Mr. Weinstein $18,000 for consulting
services and granted warrants to purchase 20,000 shares of the Company's common
stock at $5.44 per share.

     As discussed in Note 5, WCTP contracted with the Company to procure,
construct, design and place in operation a cogeneration facility.  The Company's
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer are shareholders of the general partner of
WCTP.  The general partner has a 25% interest in WCTP and receives a general
partner's fee of 1% of WCTP revenues and an administrative services payment of
4% of WCTP revenues.  The limited partners are not related parties to the
Company.  The general partner may have the potential for substantial future
distributions from WCTP.

     Mr. Beningson is President and a major stockholder of RRR'S Ventures Ltd.
("RRR'S"), which is a 25% general partner of WCTP, general partner of RVA, and a
10% general partner of YCP.  In Fiscal 1996, RVA received $500,000 which was the
minority portion of the income of B-41LP.  In Fiscal 1993, RVA received a
distribution of $2,000,000 from B-41LP, which is expected to be charged against
capital, concurrent with future allocations of income.  At February 28, 1993,
there was $212,500 due to RRR'S as a result of expenses


                                      -52-
<PAGE>

paid by RRR'S on behalf of the Company, and there was an additional $280,000 due
to RRR'S by YCP for general partner's and administrative fees pursuant to the
YCP limited partnership agreement.  Through Fiscal 1995, these amounts, along
with additional general partner's and administrative fees, were offset against
the $673,500 included in Notes receivable - sale of common stock (see Note 9),
reducing the amount due from RRR'S to $0.

     At February 28, 1994, the Company forgave an advance to the Chief Financial
Officer of $147,555, which had been disbursed in Fiscal 1990.  Such forgiveness
was reflected as compensation expense in Fiscal 1994.

     Mr. Beningson is president and sole shareholder of North American Energy
Conservation, Inc. ("NAEC").  The Company has an agreement with NAEC which
provides for the Company to be reimbursed for all costs associated with its
activities related to NAEC and the Company will receive a fee to be mutually
agreed upon based on level of activity.  At February 28, 1996, NAEC was indebted
to the Company for approximately $600,000 related to various costs.  This was
fully paid in April 1996.  In Fiscal 1996 and 1995, the Company recognized
$1,200,000 each year as reimbursement of costs, and power brokerage fees of
$675,000 and $250,000, respectively.

14.  SALE OF YORK SERVICES CORPORATION

     On January 31, 1990, the Company sold 90% of its interest in York Services
Corporation ("York Services"), its environmental consulting business, in
exchange for a maximum of $600,000 to be paid over the following five years.  At
February 28, 1995, the receivable for the sale of York Services was $144,000,
and was included in Other current assets.

     During the five months ended February 28, 1991, the Company loaned $100,000
to York Services.  At February 28, 1995, the loan receivable was $26,000,
including interest, and was included in Other current assets.  On April 3, 1995,
the Company received $170,000 from York Services as full payment for all amounts
receivable.

15.  LITIGATION

     The Company, while denying any liability, and in the opinion of management,
in order to avoid a protracted and costly litigation, settled in May 1993 a
class action lawsuit which shareholders brought against the Company and certain
directors and officers of York.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, in
March 1995 the Company issued to the members of the class warrants to purchase
600,000 shares of its common stock at $8.00 ("Class A Warrants") per share and
warrants to purchase 180,000 shares of its common


                                      -53-
<PAGE>

stock at $6.15 ("Class B Warrants") per share (collectively the "Warrants").
The Class A Warrants expired on November 1, 1995.  When the Class A Warrants
expired, the holders of such warrants became entitled to and did surrender them
for $6.9 million drawn under a letter of credit which had been posted on
February 16, 1995 by Edison Mission Energy, which is recourse only to future
distributions from BNYLP, if any.  The Class B Warrants remain outstanding
except that at February 28, 1996, 7,511 Class B Warrants had been exercised.
Under the terms of the settlement other principal provisions of the Warrants
include the following:

(i)    The Company has the right to redeem the Class B Warrants in whole or in
part for $11.50 per Warrant.

(ii)   The Company has the right to reduce the Class B Warrant exercise price in
its discretion (the "adjusted exercise price").

(iii)  Unless the Class B Warrants have previously been redeemed or accelerated
the warrants may be exchanged by the holders thereof on the Expiration Date,
which has been extended, for $11.50 in cash per warrant (the "Surrender Price").

(iv)   All unexpired Class B Warrants may no longer be exchanged for the
Surrender Price if the closing price of the Company's stock on NASDAQ shall have
equaled or exceeded the exercise price or adjusted exercise price of the
Warrants plus $11.50 on at least seventy-five of ninety consecutive trading days
at any time prior to the Expiration Date.

(v)    The Surrender Price of the Class B Warrants is collateralized by a 35%
limited partnership interest in BNYLP held by B-41LP.  This limited partnership
interest will be released when it is replaced by a letter of credit or if the
event described in (iv) above occurs.

(vi)   On March 18, 1996, the Company agreed with counsel for the Class Action
litigants to issue up to 180,000 new Warrants to holders of Class B Warrants as
consideration for an extension until December 31, 1996 of the obligation of B-
41LP to provide a letter of credit to secure the Surrender Price of the
remaining Class B Warrants.  The agreement is subject to Court approval.  When
issued, the new warrants will have a term of two years, an exercise price of
$6.48 per share and will not have any provisions for surrender or collateral.
