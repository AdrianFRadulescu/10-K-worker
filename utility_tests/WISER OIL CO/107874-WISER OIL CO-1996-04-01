                             THE WISER OIL COMPANY
                             ---------------------

                                     PART I

     ITEM 1 -  BUSINESS
     ------------------

          The Wiser Oil Company ("Wiser" or the "Company") is a Delaware
     corporation formed in 1970, but was originally organized in Oklahoma in
     1905.  Wiser is currently engaged in the exploration for, production and
     acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves onshore in the United
     States and Canada.  The Company has its primary United States oil and gas
     property interests located in Texas, New Mexico, Kentucky and Michigan.
     Its primary oil and gas property interests in Canada are located in the
     Province of Alberta.  On December 15, 1993, the Company listed its stock on
     the New York Stock Exchange, after having been traded on the NASDAQ Over-
     the-Counter market since 1972.

     1995 RESULTS

          In 1995, Wiser reported net income of $2,193,000 or $0.25 per share on
     revenues of $71,681,000. These results compare to 1994 income of $8,988,000
     or $1.01 per share on revenues of $65,356,000. Included in 1995 earnings
     are pre-tax gains of $14,092,000, primarily from the sale of a portion of
     Wiser's security holdings and, to a lesser extent, oil and gas property
     sales. Without these gains, Wiser would have reported a $8,111,000 pre-tax
     loss in 1995 compared to a pre-tax loss net of $9,367,000 in asset sales of
     $65,000 in 1994. The Company's 1995 pre-tax U.S. profit of $1,624,000,
     excluding property and security gains, was largely offset by a pre-tax loss
     of $9,735,000 in Canada. Canadian results were unfavorably impacted by weak
     natural gas prices, higher than anticipated DD&A costs, and a $4,893,000
     non-cash property impairment charge. Operating cash flow for 1995 was $19.2
     million.

          Wiser's 1995 oil and condensate sales increased 10%, while 1995
     natural gas sales declined 13%.  The sharp decline in gas revenues was
     fueled by a 21% drop in price from $1.73 per MCF in 1994 to $1.37 per MCF
     from 1995.  This decrease in price was offset by increased sales volumes of
     1.1 million MCF or 10% from 1994.  The daily production averaged
     approximately 5,700 BBL of oil, 33,346 MCF of natural gas, and 642 BBL of
     Natural Gas Liquids.

          The Company's estimated proved reserves at December 31, 1995, were
     50,527,000 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE), of which 64% was oil. The
     Company increased its proved reserves by 22% over 1994.

     WISER'S GROWTH STRATEGY

          The Company's growth in production, proved reserves, and cash flow is
     through a combination of acquisitions, moderate risk exploration and
     exploitation of its inventory of existing projects.  The Company also
     emphasizes reducing operating costs and selling marginal or nonstrategic
     properties.

          The Company believes the reduced margins and low domestic returns will
     continue to cause the major integrated oil companies' migration of
     investments overseas, and that undercapitalized domestic independents will
     continue to be compromised by ongoing price volatility.  These events will
     create opportunities by bringing desirable properties to market. Wiser
     believes that it has the financial resources and skills to take advantage
     of these opportunities.

          For Wiser, a property acquisition is only one phase in a continuing
     process of business growth.  Acquisitions are followed by a cycle of
     reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration,
     enabling asset growth and debt reduction.  This approach requires well-
     planned and carefully executed property development and commitment to a
     selective program of ongoing property dispositions.  Wiser targets
     acquisitions that have ascertainable additional reserve potential, Wiser
     applies an active drilling, workover and recompletion program to the
     acquired undeveloped and partially developed properties.  Wiser prefers to
     operate its properties so that it can best influence their exploitation,
     and the Company therefore operates over two thirds of its production.

          In 1991, Wiser embarked on a plan to cautiously increase its
     exploration risk profile by drilling prospects with larger reserves
     potential per well, taking larger working interests in attractive
     prospects, and concentrating on properties with significant additional
     development drilling opportunities.  To achieve these goals while
     controlling risk at an acceptable level, a program was implemented to
     identify prospects in a handful of focus areas where three dimensional (3-
     D) seismic technology can be used to reduce risk and where there are
     multiple well drilling opportunities.  Four major onshore areas were
     identified:  the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the Gulf of
     Texas and Louisiana.

          While Wiser's focus is on medium risk prospects where technology can
     improve project economics, the Company also evaluates selected higher
     potential/high risk opportunities and will allocate a small portion of its
     exploration budget to these projects where there appears to be exposure to
     large reserve potential at reasonable cost.

          This focused approach to exploration maximizes Wiser's resources and
     allows the Company to limit its investment in unproven properties by
     maintaining holdings in undeveloped leases only in areas of active
     interest.  At yearend 1995, Wiser held 122,378 net acres of undeveloped
     oil and gas leases.

          The Company's domestic exploration and production activities are in
     four principal areas, West Texas, San Juan Basin, Kentucky and Michigan.
     In addition, the Company recently acquired assets in Canada which are
     discussed further in Recent Acquisitions and Rationalizations.

     WEST TEXAS

          The West Texas area includes the Permian Basin of both Texas and New
     Mexico. Since 1991, the Company has participated in 3-D seismic activity in
     the Horseshoe Atoll area and made acquisitions in both New Mexico and Texas
     which have made this area the Company's largest and most important.

          The Scurry Reef 3-D Seismic Project
          -----------------------------------

          In the Horseshoe Atoll area, only a few exploration opportunities
     remain to be drilled from an original 3-D survey.  During 1995, the Company
     drilled eight wells, five of which were successfully completed.  The most
     significant well was the O'Daniel B1 well, drilled on the Bull's Ear
     Prospect. Wiser has a 60% working interest in the well, which encountered
     natural gas in the Cisco Reef.  The Company's working interest in the other
     four wells ranged between 15% and 17%.  There are approximately six
     prospects remaining in Wiser's Pinnacle Reef prospect inventory.

          Wellman Unit, Terry County, Texas
          ---------------------------------

          Wiser has a 62% working interest in the Wellman Unit, a Wolfcamp Reef
     reservoir located on the northwest edge of the Horseshoe Atoll in the
     Permian Basin. Wellman produces from an 824 foot gross section under a
     carbon dioxide (CO\\2\\) enhanced recovery flood.  A $6.0 million gross AFE
     to install CO\\22\\ membranes and reactivate the gas plant was completed in
     June 1995.  Gross natural gas liquids (NGL) averaged 925 barrels per day
     (BPD) since this time.

          An active remedial program increased gross oil production by 10% over
     1994 volumes to 1,951 BOPD.  During the last six months of 1995, oil
     production averaged over 2,100 BOPD.

          Operating costs were again significantly lower than originally
     expected primarily due to the purchased CO\\2\\ volumes being reduced to
     three MMCF per day due to high bottom hole pressure.  This decrease in
     purchased CO\\2\\volume reduces gross operating costs by $3.0 million per
     year.  It is expected to continue at this lower-purchased volume rate for
     at least two more years.

          An active remedial program will continue into 1996 to maintain current
     production rates.  A compressor reactivation should be completed by June
     1996 to gain an additional 4 million MCF per day of reinjection capacity
     which will accelerate production rates by over 300 barrels of liquids per
     day for a total gross cost of $500,000.

                                       5

          Maljamar Area, Lea County, New Mexico
          -------------------------------------

          In the Maljamar area of Lea County, Wiser has a 100% working interest
     in two oil units with substantial waterflood potential. After a successful
     six well pilot program in 1993, the Company began a multi-year 79 well
     drilling program in 1994 to increase well density to 20 acres spacing from
     40 acres currently and reduce the five spot water injection pattern to 40
     acres from 80 acres.

          In a further expansion of our efforts in the Maljamar area, Wiser
     traded for and assumed operatorship of the Skelly Unit on September 1,
     1995.  This unit, formerly operated by Texaco, will be developed in a
     fashion similar to that planned for the other two units  (discussed further
     in Recent Acquisitions and Rationalizations).

          Wiser plans to spend $48.0 million exploiting these three units over
     the next two years.  Average gross production from the area at December 31,
     1995 was 1,300 BBL of oil per day and is expected to increase to 4,000 BBL
     per day at December 31, 1996, and 5,400 BBL per day at December 31, 1997.

          In order to capture the economy of scale provided by the now three
     unit development project, closer cooperation with several large service
     companies was investigated during 1995.  At the end of that investigation,
     alliance agreements were finalized with Halliburton and Continental Emsco.
     The services provided by these two companies cover approximately 35% of the
     remaining capital cost for this project and significant cost reductions are
     expected to result from these arrangements.  In fact, a 10% reduction
     relative to our pre-alliance cost basis has already been achieved,
     representing almost $2,000,000 in savings for the project as a whole.

     SAN JUAN BASIN, NEW MEXICO

          Wiser has small non-operated interests in over 2,200 natural gas wells
     in the San Juan Basin of Northwestern New Mexico.  Its share of daily
     production averaged 6,650 MCFD of natural gas in 1995 versus 5,160 MCFD in
     1994.  Approximately half of Wiser's San Juan Basin output is from coal
     seams, which generate Section 29 tax credits.  During 1995, the Company
     participated in a 15 well Dakota/Mesaverde drilling program in the Rincon
     Unit, where it owns a 2.5% working interest.  All of the wells were
     successfully completed and are on production.  During the year, the Company
     also began marketing directly a portion of its production and, through new
     gathering agreements, has increased deliveries from its properties.
     Although Wiser does not operate in this area and its working interests are
     small, these properties represent a steady, long-lived production base that
     provide a reliable ongoing stream of cash flow and tax credits.

     KENTUCKY

          Wiser has operated in Kentucky since 1917 and has interest in 22
     shallow natural gas fields with over 300 wells.  In most of its Kentucky
     wells, the Company has a 100% working interest.  Although daily production
     from individual wells is low, this Appalachian production receives a
     premium price because of its location near high-value markets in the
     Northeastern United States.  Typically, Wiser's gas is priced at a premium
     to the benchmark price for natural gas traded on New York Mercantile
     Exchange.  In addition, Wiser owns and operates an extensive gas gathering
     system in Kentucky and Tennessee, which gives it a strategic position to
     deliver gas to market at low cost.

          In early 1995, Wiser expanded its Appalachian operations by acquiring
     a 75% interest in several gas properties in Clay and Kanawha Counties, West
     Virginia, including 13,431 acres mostly held by production and began an
     active drilling program during the year  (discussed further in Recent
     Acquisitions and Rationalizations).

          During 1995, net sales from the Kentucky and West Virginia operations
     were 7,700 MCFD of natural gas compared to 6,050 MCFD in 1994.  Operating
     costs were reduced during the year and efficiency improved through reducing
     personnel and increasing employee productivity.  Improved lift systems were
     installed to maximize deliverability and well equipment from marginal
     producers is being redeployed in drilling operations. Through these
     efforts, lifting costs in Kentucky were reduced to less than $4.00 per BOE
     from a cost in excess of $5.00 per BOE.

          Wiser drilled nine wells in Kentucky during 1995 with four gas and two
     oil completions. In its new West Virginia operation, the Company
     successfully completed seven natural gas wells, with eight additional wells
     scheduled for early 1996.

     MICHIGAN

          Wiser owns a 99.5% working interest in the South Buckeye Dundee
     waterflood project which was largely completed in 1992. In 1994, one
     additional well was drilled, which offset natural declines. As a result,
     net oil production for the year averaged  485 BPD, and output is expected
     to decline slowly over the foreseeable future.

     RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND RATIONALIZATIONS

          Canadian Acquisition
          --------------------

          The Wiser Oil Company Canada Ltd. ("Wiser Canada") was formed in June
     1994 to acquire US$53 million in Canadian oil and gas assets from Eagle
     Resources Ltd.  The Eagle acquisition and the formation of the Canadian
     subsidiary represented a significant strategic development for The Wiser
     Oil Company by creating an important new core focus area for the Company
     and greatly expanding its exploration opportunities.  As part of the
     acquisition, Wiser Canada acquired:

                                       7
<PAGE>

          [ ] Proved reserves (after royalties of 21.4 BCF of natural gas and 
              3.7 million barrels of crude oil and other liquids

          [ ] Probable reserves (before royalties) of 8 BCF and 1.5 million
              barrels
          [ ] Exploration prospects, many of which were ready to drill
          [ ] 99,000 net undeveloped leasehold acres
          [ ] An extensive seismic database

          As part of the transaction, Wiser Canada also acquired an interest in
     a favorable natural gas sales contract, as well as accounting, land,
     marketing and operating systems and equipment.  In addition, the Company
     will receive significant tax benefits from certain tax attributes of the
     acquired properties.

          Substantially all of Wiser Canada's properties are located in Alberta
     and are balanced between oil and natural gas. Eight fields account for more
     than 70% of total reserves. The most important fields include two Wiser
     operated fields: the Evi oil field, a Paleozoic Granite Wash sandstone
     producer that accounts for 21% of the Company's total reserves, and the
     Grande Prairie oil field, which produces from the Triassic Halfway
     Formation and accounts for 13% of total reserves. The Provost (Wiser
     operated), Leahurst and Pine Creek Fields account for another 24% of
     reserves.

          Net daily production (after royalties) during 1995 averaged 1,850 BPD
     of liquids and 705 MCFD of natural gas from 242 gross wells (68 net wells).

          Wiser Canada is currently active in seven principal Alberta plays:
     Pine Creek, Groat, Evi, Provost, Portage, Maria and Joan.  During 1995, the
     Company participated in the drilling of 13 wells (8 net), of which 7
     wells (4 net) were successful.  On a net well basis, the Company has a 50%
     success rate.  Spending in Canada totaled $9.6 million in 1995, most of
     which was for exploration and development.  Drilling activities accounted
     for more than 1.2 million equivalent barrels of reserve additions, more
     than replacing production during the year.  Combined with upward revisions
     and reserve purchase, reserve additions were 184% of production during the
     year.

          Agaritta Field Sale and Subsequent Acquisitions
          -----------------------------------------------

          During February 1995, The Wiser Oil Company sold its interest in the
     Agaritta Field and several smaller properties located in Concho County,
     Texas, to a private company. Wiser operated the 59.9% owned Agaritta
     Field, which it discovered in 1989, and drilled a total of 55 wells through
     1994.  The sale price was $6.2 million and the total proved reserves at
     February 28, 1995  was estimated to be 704,000 BOE.

          In February 1995 and March 1995, Wiser purchased properties in
     Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia in two unrelated transactions.  The
     Louisiana and Texas properties were purchased from a private company in
     Midland, Texas, for $2.5 million.  Total proved reserves, all of which are
     producing, are estimated to be 2.0 BCF of natural gas. Approximately 83%
     of the reserves are located in Reeves County, Texas, one of the

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
     Company's primary focus areas.

          The West Virginia properties were purchased for approximately $3.4
     million, and have an estimated 5.0 BCF of proved reserves.  The properties
     are located in Clay and Kanawha Counties, West Virginia and include a 75%
     working interest in 55 wells, 16,000 undeveloped acres on the
     properties and a field gathering system.  Wiser has agreed to drill a
     minimum of 15 wells on the properties by December 1996.  The Company has
     drilled 7 wells during 1995, and plans  to drill the other 8 wells in 1996.

          These transactions were completed as a tax-free exchange and resulted
     in a net increase of 502,000 BOE of total proved reserves.  The acquired
     properties have a much longer reserve life than the Agaritta Field which
     will cause a modest reduction in our operating income and cash flow in 1995
     and 1996.  However, management believes that the increase in proved
     reserves plus the West Virginia developmental opportunities will add
     substantially more long term value to the Company.

          Skelly Field Property Exchange
          ------------------------------

          In a further expansion of our efforts in the Maljamar area, Wiser
     traded for and assumed operatorship of the Skelly Unit on September 1,
     1995.  Wiser traded several Permian Basin properties for the Skelly Unit.
     The deal netted Wiser 5.3 million BOE's. Wiser traded 7.7 BCF and 774,000
     BBL of crude oil and liquids for 2.7 BCF and 6,946,000 BBL of crude oil.
     In addition, Wiser will have to incur approximately $30.9 million to
     develop this property over the next two years.

          Property Rationalization
          ------------------------

          As part of the Company's goal of focusing its operations in a small
     number of key areas, Wiser completed an active domestic property
     rationalization program during the year. In 1994, the Company sold oil and
     gas properties with reserves of 2.7 million BOE. Most of these properties
     had either marginal revenues,  high operating expenses or high depletion
     rates.  Wiser completed the transactions without intermediaries, which
     resulted in an efficient and timely sales process with maximum financial
     yields. Proceeds of approximately $14 million were used to reduce debt.
     Because of the active divestiture program in 1994, few properties were
     earmarked for disposition in 1995.  However, several unusual opportunities
     materialized which allowed Wiser to make tax-free exchanges of mature or
     non-strategic reserves for properties that hold greater long-term potential
     for the Company (discussed further in Recent Acquisitions and
     Rationalizations).  The Company completed property exchanges with a total
     value of $14 million.

          Future Acquisitions
          -------------------

          Wiser regularly pursues and evaluates acquisition opportunities and at
     any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities.
     Such stages may take the form of internal financial and oil and gas
     property analysis, preliminary due diligence, the 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
     submission of an indication of interest, preliminary negotiations,
     negotiation of a letter of intent, or negotiation of a definitive
     agreement. While Wiser is currently evaluating a number of potential
     acquisition opportunities (some of which could be material in size to
     Wiser), it has not signed a letter of intent with respect to any such
     material acquisition and currently has no assurance of completing any
     particular material acquisition or of entering into negotiations with
     respect to any particular material acquisition.

          Although Wiser expects that its primary acquisition focus for 1996
     will be in areas where it currently operates wells, it may acquire
     properties located outside those areas if desirable opportunities arise.
     Wiser may also acquire interests in producing or other properties located
     offshore United States, in foreign countries, or offshore foreign
     countries.  Future acquisitions of properties may take many forms,
     including purchases for cash or securities, and may include various forms
     of direct or indirect ownership of oil and gas properties or companies
     associated with the oil and gas business.

     OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES

          In the current market environment, natural gas prices remain volatile.
     Until recently, demand for natural gas has tended to be seasonal in nature,
     with peak demand and higher prices occurring in the colder winter months.
     Wiser's gas price averaged $1.73 per MCF in 1994, 21% higher than the 1995
     average of $1.37 per MCF.

          Oil prices, especially vulnerable to complex and unpredictable
     political and economic forces, plunged to a five year low in December 1993.
     Management believes that, absent a comprehensive U.S. energy policy, oil
     prices will continue to fluctuate in response to changes in the policies of
     the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and events in the Middle
     East. Wiser's oil price averaged $16.91 in 1995 or 8% higher than the prior
     year average of $15.60.

          From time to time, Wiser buys or sells contracts for the future
     delivery of oil or gas to hedge a limited portion of its production against
     exposure to spot market price changes. See Note 1 to the Company's
     financial statements under Item 8 below.

          The Company's business will be affected by future changes in domestic
     and international oil and gas prices and the relationship between oil and
     gas prices.  No assurance can be given as to the trend in, or level of,
     future oil and gas prices.

     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

          The Company's exploration, production and marketing operations are
     regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by
     other countries, in which the Company does business.  Oil and gas
     exploration, development and production activities are subject to various
     laws and regulations governing a wide variety of matters.  For example,
     hydrocarbon-producing states have statutes or regulations addressing
     conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights, and such
     regulations may 

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
     affect Wiser's operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons Wiser may
     produce and sell. Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing,
     transportation, and valuation of royalty payments.

          Federal legislation and regulatory controls in the United States have
     historically affected the price of the natural gas produced by the Company
     and the manner in which such production is marketed.  The transportation
     and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated
     pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the "NGA"), the Natural Gas Policy
     Act of 1978 (the "NGPA") and the FERC regulations promulgated thereunder.
     Maximum selling prices of "first sales" of certain categories of natural
     gas, whether sold in interstate or intrastate commerce, previously were
     regulated pursuant to the NGPA.  "First sales" typically include sales made
     by producers and by non-pipeline, non-local distribution company marketers
     of natural gas.  The NGPA established various categories of natural gas and
     provided for gradual deregulation of prices for such sales of several
     categories of natural gas.  All price deregulation contemplated under the
     NGPA has now taken place.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas
     Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all
     "first sales" of natural gas, which includes all sales by the Company of
     its own production; consequently, sales of the Company's natural gas
     currently may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract
     provisions.

          The FERC also regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation
     rates and service conditions, which affect the marketing of natural gas
     produced by the Company, as well as the revenues received by the Company
     for sales of such natural gas.  Since the latter part of 1985, through
     Order No. 436, Order No. 500 and Order No. 636 rule makings, the FERC has
     endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers
     and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis.  The FERC's efforts
     have significantly altered the marketing and pricing of natural gas.  A
     related effort has been made with respect to intrastate pipeline operations
     pursuant to the FERC's NGPA Section 311 authority, under which the FERC
     establishes rules by which intrastate pipelines may participate in certain
     interstate activities without becoming subject to full NGPA jurisdiction.
     These orders have gone through various permutations, but have generally
     remained intact as promulgated.  The FERC considers these changes necessary
     to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas industry
     and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into
     more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers than has
     historically been the case.

          The FERC's latest action in this area, Order No. 636 issued April 8,
     1992, reflected the FERC's finding that under the current regulatory
     structure, interstate pipelines and other gas merchants, including
     producers, do not compete on a "level playing field" in selling natural
     gas.  The FERC asserted that Order No. 636 was designed to equalize that
     marketplace.  This equalization process was to be implemented through
     negotiated settlements in individual pipeline service restructuring
     proceedings, designed specifically to "unbundle" those services (e.g.,
     transportation, sales and storage) provided by any interstate pipeline so
     that producers of natural gas may secure services from the most economical
     source, whether interstate pipelines or other parties.  In many instances,
     the 

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
     result of the FERC initiatives has been to substantially reduce or bring to
     an end the interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers of natural
     gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services. The
     FERC has issued final orders in virtually all pipeline restructuring
     proceedings.

     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

          Wiser, as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties,
     is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign country laws and
     regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the
     environment.  These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose
     liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of
     pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to
     liability for pollution damages, require suspension or cessation of
     operations in affected areas and impose restrictions on the injection of
     liquids into subsurface aquifers that may contaminate groundwater.

          Wiser has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts
     to comply with these requirements, which it believes are necessary business
     costs in the oil and gas industry.  These costs are inextricably connected
     to normal operating expenses such that the Company is unable to separate
     the expenses related to environmental matters; however, the Company does
     not believe any such additional expenses materially affect its business.
     Although environmental requirements do have a substantial impact upon the
     energy industry, generally these requirements do not appear to affect Wiser
     any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than to other companies
     in the industry.

          Wiser does not believe that compliance with federal, state or local
     provisions regulating the discharge of Wiser's materials into the
     environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment,
     will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings
     or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries, but there is no
     assurance that changes in or additions to laws or regulations regarding the
     protection of the environment will not have such an impact.

     OPERATIONAL RISKS AND INSURANCE

          The Company's operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to
     the drilling and production of oil and natural gas, such as blowouts,
     catering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well
     fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pollution, releases of
     toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards can
     cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of
     property and equipment, pollution or environmental damages and suspension
     of operations.  As a result, the Company could incur substantial
     liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which
     could reduce or eliminate the funds available for development, acquisitions
     or exploration, or result in the loss of the Company's properties.

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
          The Company maintains insurance of various types to cover its
     operations.  The Company presently maintains a $1 million general liability
     policy and a $20 million excess liability policy.  The Company also carries
     additional insurance, including policies covering certain commercial
     property (including the Company's gas gathering and processing plants),
     workers' compensation policies, a business auto policy and an electronic
     equipment protection policy.

          The Company's insurance does not cover every potential risk associated
     with the drilling and production of oil and natural gas.  Among other
     things, coverage is not obtainable for certain types of environmental
     hazards.  The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which
     are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on
     the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

     COMPETITION

          The oil and gas industry is highly competitive.  As an independent oil
     and gas company, the Company frequently competes for reserve acquisitions,
     exploration leases, licenses, concessions and marketing agreements against
     companies with substantially larger financial and other resources that the
     Company possesses.

     EMPLOYEES

          On December 31, 1995, Wiser had 123 full-time employees.

     OFFICES

          Wiser's principal office is located at 8115 Preston Road, Suite 400,
     Dallas, Texas 75225.  The Company maintains a regional office in Corbin,
     Kentucky.  The office of Wiser's Canadian subsidiary, The Wiser Oil Company
     Canada Ltd. is 645 7th Avenue, S.W., Suite 2550, Calgary, Alberta T2P-4G8.

 ITEM 7 -  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
 -----------------------------------------------------------
     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     -----------------------------------

 COMPARISON OF 1995 RESULTS TO 1994

 Net income for 1995 was $2.2 million, compared to net income in 1994 of $9.0
 million. In 1995, Wiser adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets
 to be Disposed of" (SFAS 121). As a result of the new accounting standard and
 low gas prices in Canada, the Company recognized a non-cash charge of $4.9
 million against 1995 earnings, all related to impairments of its Canadian
 properties. No such charge was required in 1994. Wiser continued to liquidate
 its portfolio of marketable securities in 1995, with a realized gain of $13.1
 million, which exceeded the $7.5 million in security sales gains realized in
 1994. Deferred taxes increased by $3.2 million in 1995 as the Company did not
 benefit from the recognition of previously reserved deferred tax assets as it
 had in 1994. Earnings per share was $0.25 in 1995 compared to $1.01 in 1994.

 Total revenues for 1995 were $71.7 million, a $6.3 million increase from 1994.
 The increase was primarily attributed to a $5.6 million increase in security
 sales gains in 1995 as the Company continued to liquidate its portfolio of
 marketable securities. Oil and gas sales revenues remained relatively constant,
 increasing approximately 2.0% to $54.4 million due to a 6.0% growth in
 production of barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), partially offset by a 4.0% drop
 in the average price received per BOE. Natural gas prices dropped by 21.0% in
 1995 to $1.37 per MCF, while oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) prices improved
 8.0% and 12.0% from 1994 to average $16.91 and $10.11, respectively, during
 1995.

 Revenues from production for 1995 were $54.4 million, slightly greater than
 1994 net revenue. Average daily production during 1995 was 11,949 BOE, up from
 11,296 BOE in 1994, although average product prices dropped $0.51 per BOE to
 $12.47 per BOE in 1995. The Company placed 64 wells on production in 1995,
 including 16 wells in the expanded Maljamar project and 7 wells on Wiser's
 Canadian prospects. The Company plans to continue the development of the
 expanded Maljamar project in 1996, as well as pursue various projects in the
 United States and Canada. Additionally, in 1995 the Company completed several
 exchanges of properties to enhance its interests in strategic locations.
 Production and operating expenses for 1995 decreased by 7% to $20.7 million as
 Wiser realized the benefits of non-strategic property sales in late 1994.
 Operating costs per BOE, were $4.74 per BOE, down from $5.41 per BOE in 1994.

 Dividends and interest revenues were down 25.0% in 1995, to $1.2 million from
 $1.6 million, due primarily to the Company's continued liquidation of its
 marketable securities portfolio and less cash on-hand for investment.

 Depreciation and depletion (D&D) costs increased 9.0% to $19.8 million in 1995.
 The increase was due to an additional $4.8 million in Canadian D&D (due to a
 full year of ownership in 1995), partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease
 from the 1994 sale of non-strategic properties with high D&D rates. 

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
 The D&D rate per BOE increased slightly to $4.54 per BOE in 1995 from $4.41 per
 BOE in 1994. Management anticipates that the D&D rate will stabilize in 1996
 based on engineering estimates.

 Exploration costs in 1995 increased $1.7 million, a 41.0% increase from 1994.
 The increase was due primarily to higher dry hole costs in 1995.

 General and administrative expenses increased 26.0% in 1995 to $8.2 million.
 $1.0 million of the increase was due to a full year of Canadian operations,
 while another $0.7 million was attributable to legal costs.

 Interest expense increased to $5.6 million in 1995 from $3.9 million in 1994
 due to a full year's interest on the $52.0 million in debt incurred for the
 purchase of Wiser Canada. In February 1995, the Company entered into an
 agreement to cap interest rates on its debt at 7.0% from April 1995 through
 September 1996. The agreement provides a notional principal amount of $78.0
 million. The cost of the cap of $445 thousand will be amortized over the life
 of the agreement. Any benefits realized as a result of the agreement will be
 recorded as a reduction in interest expense. Management believes that in the
 current environment of interest rate uncertainty, this agreement provides
 stability and will better position the Company to manage its cost of funds.

 The effective income tax rate jumped to 63.3% in 1995 from 4.7% in 1994, due
 primarily to 1994 benefits realized from recognition of previously reserved
 deferred tax assets and an increased impact of foreign net operating losses for
 which no current tax benefit is available.


 COMPARISON OF 1994 RESULTS TO 1993

 Net income for 1994 was $9.0 million compared to $1.0 million in 1993.
 Increased earnings were due to gains on the sales of both securities and oil
 and gas properties of $7.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Pre-tax
 results of operations, excluding gains on asset sales were $65 thousand in 1994
 contrasted with a loss of $1.0 million in 1993.

 Oil and gas sales increased 33% over 1993, primarily due to a full year impact
 of the mid-1993 Mobil acquisition and revenues from the mid-1994 Canadian
 purchase. Increased production was partially offset by lower average prices in
 1994. Average oil and gas prices dropped 5% and 16%, respectively from 1993.
 Reported 1994 results from Canadian operations were slightly lower than
 expected as a result of unanticipated dry hole costs and slightly higher
 operating costs.

 Total 1994 revenues jumped to $65.4 million from $42.9 million in 1993. The
 increase was due to gains on asset sales of  $9.4 million and  an increase
 totaling $13.1 million, or 31%, in oil and gas sales revenues. The 31% jump was
 due to increased production of all products, partially offset by lower average
 prices compared to 1993. Major factors in the increase were a full year of
 production on the Mobil acquisition, which accounted for $9.3 million, and the
 effects of the Canadian purchase, which added $6.7 million. Increased
 production and revenues were also realized in the  Maljamar Grayburg and
 Caprock Maljamar Units as a result of enhanced recovery projects. This area
 generated production revenues of $2.9 million in 1994 compared to $2.1 million
 in 1993. These increases were slightly offset by a $1.4 million decline in
 revenues due to sales of non-strategic properties.

 Production and operating expenses increased 24.6% in 1994 to $22.3 million, in
 line with production. 

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
 The increase was partially offset by savings of $3.0 million due to increased
 cost controls and approximately $0.9 million of benefits realized due to non-
 strategic property sales. Production and operating expenses per BOE dropped
 from $6.27 in 1993 to $5.41 in 1994. Significant cost reductions were realized
 in both the Maljamar Field and the Wellman Unit. As a result of fully
 implementing enhanced recovery projects and focusing on controlling field level
 expenses, costs per BOE in these areas dropped from $9.85 in the Maljamar Field
 and $19.00 in the Wellman Unit, respectively in 1993, to $7.19 and $9.00,
 respectively, in 1994. The Canadian properties also contributed to the overall
 decline in costs per BOE by averaging $3.22 per BOE in operating costs in 1994.

 D&D increased 24% in 1994 to $18.2 million. The effects of increased production
 from the Canadian and Mobil acquisitions were slightly offset by property
 sales. D&D per BOE dropped from $5.14 in 1993 to $4.41 in 1994.

 1994 exploration expenses increased slightly to $4.1 million from $3.6 million
 due mostly to new exploratory drilling activity in the Company's Canadian
 operations.

 The acquisition of Wiser Canada also required additional personnel, which
 caused $0.9 million of the $1.1 million increase in general and administrative
 expenses from 1993.

 Interest expense increased in 1994 as the Company paid a full year of interest
 on the debt related to the Mobil acquisition and incurred interest on an
 additional $52.0 million in debt related to the mid-1994 Canadian acquisition.

 Income taxes in 1994 were reduced by utilizing $1.3 million in tax credits
 generated from the Company's San Juan Basin properties. Wiser was able to
 utilize only $0.5 million of these credits in 1993. In 1994, management
 determined that certain tax assets that had been reserved were likely
 realizable due to Company plans to liquidate its marketable securities
 portfolio. As a result, in 1994 Wiser reduced income tax expense by $2.3
 million and its effective income tax rate for 1994 dropped to 4.7%.

 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS

 During 1995, Wiser incurred $31.0 million in capital expenditures, composed of
 $16.6 million in costs to develop oil and gas properties, $6.2 million in
 property acquisitions, $5.0 million for exploration and $3.2 million on gas
 plant expansion projects.

 The main focus of development and exploration costs in 1995 was in the Maljamar
 area, where the Company continues to be involved in a significant development
 project. In 1995, Wiser  spent approximately $8.7 million  on the project,
 resulting in 16 productive wells, with 5 wells in various stages of completion
 or drilling at yearend. The project increased average daily gross production in
 the Maljamar area to 890 barrels per day from 650 barrels per day in 1994.
 Average daily gross production exceeded 1,300 barrels per day in December 1995.
 In Canada, 4 development wells were completed in 1995, focusing on the Pine
 Creek Field, where Wiser has a 26.25% interest. In total, the Company
 participated in 82 wells, completing 64 as producing, compared to 63 and 42
 wells in 1994. Exploration and development expenditures are expected to
 approach $53 million in 1996 as the expanded Maljamar project is further
 developed.

 The Company spent $6.2 million in acquisitions in 1995, of which $3.2 million
 related to Canadian acquisitions in and around owned properties. During 1995,
 Wiser completed several property exchanges, the most significant of which was
 the acquisition of the Skelly Unit in Eddy County, New Mexico. This acquisition
 was treated as an exchange of similar assets and has increased the scope of the
 Maljamar project, with estimated net proved reserves totaling
 approximately 7.4 million BOE at yearend 1995.

 In 1995, the Company expended $3.2 million on the Wellman Unit in conjunction
 with a $6 million project to enhance recovery of gas and NGLs. Results have
 been positive, with oil and NGL production up to 2,175 barrels per day (BPD)
 and 1,000 BPD from 1,800 BPD of oil and no NGLs prior to project
 implementation.

 CAPITAL RESOURCES

 Wiser had total assets of $203.4 million at December 31, 1995. Total
 capitalization was $175.3 million, composed 42% of long-term debt and 58% of
 stockholders' equity. During 1995, net cash provided by operations was $19.2
 million, a decrease of 17% from 1994.

 The Company maintains a $150.0 million revolving credit facility (1994
 Revolver). The amounts available for borrowing are determined under formulas
 related to oil and gas reserves. The borrowing base at December 31, 1995 was
 $80.0 million. Available loan and interest options are base rate loans at the
 bank's prime interest rate and one to six month term loans with fixed interest
 at either the LIBOR or CD rate plus .63%. A .25% commitment fee is charged on
 the unused borrowing base. The credit agreement requires the Company to, among
 other things, maintain certain minimum net worth and current ratio
 requirements, as well as certain other restrictions. At December 31, 1995,
 $73.0 million was outstanding on the 1994 Revolver.

 During 1995, the Company obtained a $50.0 million multiple advance term credit
 facility (Maljamar Debt) (see Footnote 3 to financial statements) to finance
 its expanded Maljamar project. The credit facility is collateralized by and has
 recourse against only the Maljamar project properties. By entering into this
 agreement, the Company has limited its liabilities while retaining a higher
 borrowing base under the 1994 Revolver. These benefits come with a cost of  a
 1.37% to 1.80% higher interest rate on the Maljamar Debt as compared to the
 terms of the 1994 Revolver. At December 31, 1995, $1.2 million was outstanding
 on the Maljamar Debt.

 In 1994, the Company decided to begin an orderly liquidation of its securities
 portfolio. Wiser plans to liquidate the portfolio in such a manner as to
 maximize available tax credits in order to minimize the tax impact of
 liquidation. Proceeds will initially  be used to reduce debt but may be
 reinvested in oil and gas assets.

 LIQUIDITY

 The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to meet the requirements
 of its business. However, future cash flows are subject to many variables
 including production levels and oil and gas prices. No assurances can be made
 that operations or capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to
 maintain planned levels of capital expenditures.

 Wiser's Canadian operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuations based on
 the relative value of the Canadian dollar (CDN) to the U.S. dollar. Exchange
 rate fluctuations are recorded as translation adjustments directly to
 stockholders' equity. The Company could be subject to risk of loss to the
 extent that Canadian assets are sold at lower exchange rates than when they
 were acquired. Historically, Wiser has not entered into agreements to hedge
 this risk, but may in the future if it is deemed advantageous.

 FUTURE TRENDS

 Wiser intends to continue increasing production and reserves through drilling
 and property acquisitions. Although future performance is difficult to predict,
 the following factors will likely impact future operating results and financial
 condition:

 CONTINUING VOLATILITY OF PRODUCT PRICES

 Spot gas prices remained volatile during 1995. Average 1995 monthly prices
 ranged from approximately $1.61 per MCF in December to $1.18 per MCF in August.
 The overall average gas price received dropped from $1.73 per MCF in 1994 to
 $1.37 per MCF in 1995. Spot oil prices, which are volatile due to a myriad of
 unpredictable political and economic forces, improved during 1995. Wiser's 1995
 average realized price varied from a low of $16.05 per BBL in October to a high
 of $18.21 per BBL in April. The annual average oil price increased from $15.60
 per BBL in 1994 to $16.91 per BBL during 1995. Absent a comprehensive U.S.
 energy policy, management believes that oil prices will continue to fluctuate
 in response to changes in OPEC policies and events in both the Middle East and
 certain other non-OPEC countries. Management also believes that gas price
 volatility will continue and may not conform to historical cycles based on
 heating seasons. To mitigate some of this volatility, the Company plans to
 continue to prudently use various commodity hedging techniques. In 1996, the
 Company has entered into positions to hedge 3.1 BCF of 1996 gas production and
 1.3 million barrels of oil at average prices of $1.92 per MMBTU and oil price
 collars from $15.91 to $19.66 per BBL, respectively.

 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

 The Company operates under numerous state and federal laws regulating the
 discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. In the
 ordinary course of business, Wiser conducts an ongoing review of the effects of
 these various environmental laws on its business and operations. The estimated
 costs of continued compliance with current environmental laws, based on
 currently available information, is not material to the Company's financial
 position or results of operations.

 INFLATION
 
 While certain costs are affected by the general level of inflation, factors
 unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations. Over
 the past five years, significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and gas
 prices. Although it is particularly difficult to estimate future prices of oil
 and gas, price fluctuations have had, and will continue to have, a material
 effect on the Company.

  THE WISER OIL COMPANY
  
  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
  
  1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  
    a. Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
    include the accounts of The Wiser Oil Company (Company), a Delaware
    corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries: T.W.O.C., Inc., The Wiser
    Marketing Company, Maljamar Wiser Inc., Maljamar Development Partnership,
    L.P., and The Wiser Oil Company Canada Ltd. T.W.O.C., Inc. is a Delaware
    holding company responsible for the management of investment activities. The
    Wiser Marketing Company functions as a natural gas marketer and broker.
    Maljamar Wiser Inc. was formed in 1995 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of
    the Wiser Oil Corporation. It was formed in order for the Company to fund
    its $53,000,000 development of the Maljamar area with the use of nonrecourse
    debt. The Maljamar Development Partnership, L.P. was formed in 1995 for the
    same reason. The Company is the general partner of the Maljamar Development
    Partnership, L.P. and owns 99% of the partnership. Maljamar Wiser Inc. owns
    1% of the Maljamar Development Partnership, L.P. as a limited partner. Wiser
    Canada was formed in 1994 to conduct the Company's Canadian activities.
    Prior to the formation of Wiser Canada, the Company's oil and gas operations
    were conducted primarily in the United States. Intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made
    to conform prior years' amounts to current presentation.
  
    b.   Risks and Uncertainties - The preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
    date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
    expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.
  
    c.   Oil and Gas Properties - The Company is engaged in the exploration and
    development of oil and gas in the United States and Canada. The Company
    follows the "successful efforts" method of accounting for its oil and gas
    properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs of property
    acquisitions and exploratory wells are initially capitalized. If a well is
    unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of drilling the well, net of any salvage
    value, are charged to expense. The capitalized costs of unproven properties
    are periodically assessed to determine whether their value has been impaired
    below the capitalized cost, and if such impairment is indicated, a loss is
    recognized. Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of retaining
    undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for
    maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments
    are capitalized. Upon disposal, the asset and related accumulated
    depreciation and depletions are removed from the accounts, and any resulting
    gain or loss is reflected currently in income.

         Prior to 1995, the Company evaluated the carrying value of its oil and
    gas properties based on undiscounted future net revenues on a company wide
    basis. During 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 121 ("SFAS 121"), "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
    Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of". SFAS 121 requires the
    Company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and
    gas properties on a property-by-property basis. If an impairment is
    indicated based on undiscounted expected future cash flows, then an
    impairment is recognized to the extent that net capitalized costs exceed
    discounted future cash flows. During 1995, the Company provided impairments
    of $4,893,000. Management's estimate of future cash flows is based on their
    estimate of reserves and prices. It is reasonably possible that a change in
    reserve or price estimates could occur in the near term and adversely impact
    management's estimate of future cash flows and consequently the carrying
    value of properties.
  
    d.   Depreciation and Depletion - Depreciation and depletion of the
    capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties are computed for
    individual properties using the units-of-production method based on total
    proved reserves. Depreciation of transportation, office and other properties
    is computed generally using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of these assets.
  
    e.   Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents generally consist of 
    short-term investments maturing in three months or less from the date of
    acquisition. These investments of $3,058,000 in 1995, $1,662,000 in 1994 and
    $1,476,000 in 1993 are recorded at cost plus accrued interest, which
    approximates market.
  
    f.   Inventories - Oil and gas product inventories are recorded at the
    average cost of production. Materials and supplies are recorded at the lower
    of average cost or market.
  
    g.   Accrued Liabilities - Accrued liabilities include accrued vacation and
    payroll of $535,000 in 1995, $519,000 in 1994 and $517,000 in 1993.
  
    h.   Postretirement Benefits - The Financial Accounting Standards Board's
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 106, Employers'
    Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, has no
    significant impact on the Company. The Company has no significant
    liabilities for postretirement benefits, other than pensions, and has
    historically recognized such liabilities as they are incurred.

    I.   Gas Imbalances - Gas imbalances are accounted for using the sales
    method. The Company's net imbalance position is not material at December 31,
    1995, 1994 and 1993.
  
    j.   Hedges - During 1995 and early 1996, the Company entered into numerous
    natural gas price swap agreements to hedge approximately 10,000 to 12,000
    MMBTU per day for January 1996 through September 1996. During 1994, 1995 and
    early 1996, the Company has entered into numerous oil price collar
    agreements, with three contracts at 1,000 barrels per day and one contract
    at 800 barrels per day to hedge against price fluctuations during 1996. The
    Company is exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter
    parties to its oil and gas swap agreements.  
    These arrangements are summarized as follows:

    is the Canadian dollar. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, The Wiser Oil
    Company Canada's financial statements have been translated from Canadian
    dollars to U.S. dollars with the cumulative translation adjustment gain of
    $722,000 for 1995 and a loss of $696,000 for 1994 classified in

    established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in its Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities (Statement No. 115). Under Statement No. 115,
    marketable securities, such as those owned by the Company, are classified as
    available-for-sale securities and are to be reported at market value, with
    unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, excluded from earnings and
    reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The market value
    of these securities at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $19,592,000,
    $27,337,000 and $34,781,000, respectively.
  
    During 1995 and 1994, the Company liquidated a portion of its marketable
    securities portfolio and recognized a pretax gain of $13,101,000 for 1995,

  3.     Long Term Debt
  
    a.   On June 23, 1994, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement
    with NationsBank of Texas, N. A. as agent. The agreement provides the
    Company with up to a $150 million line of credit through September 30, 2000.
    The amounts available for borrowing are determined under formulas related to
    oil and gas reserves. The Company's borrowing base at December 31, 1995 is
    $80,000,000. Available loan and interest options are base rate loans, at the
    bank's prime interest rate and one to six month term loans with 

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
fixed interest at either the LIBOR or CD rate plus 0.63%. The average interest
rate during 1995 under the revolver was 6.62%. A 0.25% commitment fee is paid on
the unused borrowing base. The credit agreement requires the Company to, among
other things, maintain certain minimum net worth and current ratio requirements
as well as certain restrictions on sales of assets, payment of dividends and
incurrence of indebtedness.

      On November 29, 1995, the Company entered into a credit agreement with
NationsBank of Texas, N.A. as agent.  The agreement   provides the Company with
up to a $50 million nonrecourse facility to develop the expanded Maljamar
project area.  The amounts   available for borrowing  are determined under
formulas related to oil and gas reserves and capital spent on the Maljamar area
properties   offset by net operating  income from these same properties.  The
Company's borrowing base at December 31, 1995 was $35,000,000.    Available loan
and interest options are base rate loans, at the bank's prime interest rate and
one to six month term loans with fixed interest   at LIBOR plus 2.0%.   The
average interest rate during 1995 under the multiple advance term credit
facility was 7.94%.  A 0.375%   commitment fee is paid on the unused borrowing
base.  The credit agreement requires the Company to, among other things,
maintain certain minimum collateral value requirements as well as certain
restrictions on sales of assets, payment of dividends and incurrence of
indebtedness.
 
The Company paid $5,618,000 in interest during 1995, $3,889,000 during 1994, and
$501,000 during 1993.

4.   Property Acquisitions and Sales

     During 1995, the Company traded some of its Permian Basin properties for
properties located mainly in New Mexico (the Skelly Unit) and West Virginia.
The acquisition of these properties was accounted for as an exchange of similar
assets.  The overall results of these trades increased Wiser's total proved
BOE's as of December 31, 1995 by 5,846,000.

     On June 24, 1994, the Company acquired the Eagle Properties, which consist
of certain oil and gas properties located in Alberta, Canada, for US$52
million.  The purchase was funded through the Company's revolving credit
agreement, see Note 3, and with existing cash and cash equivalents. The purchase
method of accounting was followed.

     During 1994, the Company disposed of various non-strategic higher operating
cost properties with combined production of 1,000 barrels per day and 3,000 MCF
per day.  The majority of these property sales were closed during the 4th
quarter.

     Unaudited pro forma results of operations, as if the 1994 acquisition of
the Eagle properties took place at January 1, 1994, are as follows (000's):
 
                                                1994(1)

                                                =======
 
          (1) The pro forma results exclude the gain of $1.9 million of property
sales recognized in 1994.

     On October 1, 1993, the Company purchased oil and gas properties from Mobil
Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc. and the Mobil Foundation, Inc., for $58.8
million.  The purchase was funded through the Company's revolving credit
agreement, see Note 3, and with existing cash and cash equivalents.  The
purchase method of accounting was followed.
 

5.   Income Taxes

     The Company provides deferred income taxes for differences between the tax
reporting basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities.
The Company follows the accounting procedures as established by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board in its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  The Company paid $1,967,000 in 1995, no
income taxes in 1994, and $1.0 million in 1993.

     The provisions (credits) for income taxes for the three years ended
December 31, 1995 were as follows (000's):

     The only way to realize the benefits of  tax credit carryforwards is to
generate future regular tax liability in excess of alternative minimum tax
liability.  Prior to 1994,  a valuation allowance was provided due to
uncertainty of realizing these tax credits.  Due to the Company's sale of a
portion of its marketable securities portfolio during 1995 and 1994 and the
Company's plans relating to its remaining marketable securities, the Company
believes it is more likely than not that the alternative minimum tax credits
will be fully realized.  Accordingly, during 1994 the valuation allowance was
reversed.  As of December 31, 1995, Wiser had Canadian net deferred tax assets
of $3,930,000 and United States deferred tax assets of $549,000.  A valuation
allowance has been provided against all of these net deferred tax assets at
December 31, 1995.

7.   Employee Pension Plan

     The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which
covers substantially all full-time employees.  Plan participants become fully
vested after five years of continuous service.  The retirement benefit formula
is based on the employee's earnings, length of service and age at retirement.
Contributions required to fund plan benefits are determined according to the
Projected Unit Credit Method.  The assets of the plan are primarily invested in
equity and debt securities.

     The net periodic pension costs were determined as follows (000's):

 
                                              1995       1994      1993
                                             -------     -----     -----
Current service cost                       $    368    $  362    $  362
Interest cost on projected benefit              
 obligation                                     802       779       755
Actual return on assets                      (1,575)      (37)     (981)
Net amortization and deferral                   932      (648)      328
                                             ------      ----      ----
Net periodic pension cost                  $    527    $  456    $  464
                                             ======      ====      ====
 

     The principal assumptions for 1995 and 1994 utilized in computing pension
expense include an 8.0% discount rate, an 8.5% rate of return on plan assets,
and a 5.0% rate of increase in compensation levels.  For 1993, the assumptions
utilized included a 7.5% discount rate, an 8.5% rate of return on plan assets,
and a 5.0% rate of increase in compensation levels.  An amendment to the pension
plan, effective January 1, 1993, reduced the normal retirement age from 65 years
to 62 years.

8.   The Employee Savings Plan

     The Company has a qualified Savings Plan available to all employees.  An
employee may elect to have up to 10% of the employee's base monthly
compensation, exclusive of other forms of special or extra compensation,
withheld and placed in the Savings Plan account.  On a monthly basis, the
Company contributes to this account an amount equal to 50% of the employee's
contribution, limited to 3% of the employee's base compensation.  Company
contributions to the Savings Plan were $122,000, $116,000 and $108,000, in 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.

     Annually, four or five of the Company's purchasers of oil and natural gas
individually account for 10% to 15% of gross revenues.  However, due to the
nature of the oil and natural gas industry, the Company is not dependent upon
any of these purchasers.  The loss of any major customer would not have a
material adverse impact on the Company's business.  In Canada, one customer
accounts for approximately 80% of Wiser Canada's sales.

10.  Treasury Stock

     During 1993,  the Company issued 1,250 shares of its Common Stock, at a
book value of $19,000, under the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan, see Note 11.  During
1991,  the Company acquired on the open market 100,000 shares of its Common
Stock at a cost of $1,578,000, and awarded 5,000 shares at a cost of $77,000
under the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan, see Note 11.

11.  Stock Option Plan

     At the 1995 Annual Meeting, the shareholders approved an amendment to the
1991 Stock Incentive Plan increasing the number of shares of the Company's
Common Stock from 240,000 to 600,000 and the date through which options and
awards may be made from June 30, 1996 to June 30, 2001 to key employees.  The
1991 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan remains at 30,000 shares of the
Company's Common Stock with options and awards being made through June 30, 1996
to Directors.  No options  are exercisable before six months after the date of
the grant and expire five or ten years after the date of the grant.  The option
prices may not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of
the grant.  Stock may be issued from authorized but unissued Common Stock or
Treasury Stock.

     During 1991, a restricted share award of 5,000 shares was awarded and
issued from Treasury Stock.  Certain restrictions still apply to 1,250 shares of
this award until June 30, 1996.

     At December 31, 1995,  stock options granted under these plans are 254,500
shares with exercise prices ranging from $13.8125 to $18.875 per share.  These
options expire at various dates through November 15, 2004.  The potential stock
dilution from these stock options is not material.

Transactions involving the plans are as follows:

                                            1995     1994     1993

12.  Preferred Stock

     In addition to Common Stock, the Company is authorized to issue 300,000
shares of Preferred Stock with a par value of $10 per share, none of which has
been issued.

allowance on deferred tax assets of $2,337,000.

Estimated Quantities of Oil and Gas Reserves (Unaudited)

     Following is a reconciliation of the Company's estimated net quantities of
proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by independent petroleum consultants.

     Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids, which upon analysis of geological and engineering data
appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed
reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and under existing operating conditions.

     The estimation of reserves requires substantial judgment on the part of
petroleum engineers and may result in imprecise determinations, particularly
with respect to new discoveries.  Accordingly, it is expected that the estimates
of reserves will change as future production and development information becomes
available and that revisions in these estimates could be significant.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future
Net Cash Flows of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves (Unaudited)

     The Company has estimated the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows and changes therein relating to proved oil and gas reserves in
accordance with the standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board through its Statement No. 69.  The estimates of future cash inflows and
future production and development cost are based on current yearend sales
prices for oil and gas, estimated future production of proved reserves and
estimated future production and development costs of proved reserves based on
current costs and economic conditions.

     This standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is an attempt
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to provide the users of financial
statements with information regarding future net cash flows from proved
reserves.  However, the users of these financial statements should use extreme
caution in evaluating this information.  The assumptions required to be used in
these computations are subjective and arbitrary. Had other equally valid
assumptions been used, significantly different results of discounted future net
cash flows would result.  Therefore, these estimates do not necessarily reflect
the current value of the Company's proved reserves or the current value of
discounted future net cash flows for the proved reserves.

     Report of Independent Public Accountants
     To the Shareholders of The Wiser Oil Company:



     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Wiser
     Oil Company (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
     1995, 1994 and 1993 and the related consolidated statements of income and
     retained earnings and cash flow for the years then ended.  These financial
     statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
     on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
     of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
     evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
     statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
     used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
     the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
     provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
     in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Wiser
     Oil Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 and the
     results of their operations and their cash flow in conformity with
     generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, at
     December 31, 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for the
     impairment of long-lived assets.

                                  Exhibit 10.5
                                  ------------

                             THE WISER OIL COMPANY

                 1991 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN


     The purposes of the 1991 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan (the
"Plan") are to promote the long-term success of The Wiser Oil Company (the
"Company") by creating a long-term mutuality of interests between the non-
employee Directors and stockholders of the company, to provide an additional
inducement for such Directors to remain with the Company and to provide a means
through which the company may attract able persons to serve as Directors of the
company.

                                   SECTION 1

                                 ADMINISTRATION

     The Plan shall be administered by a Committee (the "Committee") appointed
by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and consisting of not
less than two members of the Board.  The Committee shall keep records of action
taken at its meetings.  A majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum at
any meeting, and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at
which a quorum is present, or acts approved in writing by a majority of the
Committee, shall be the acts of the Committee.

     The Committee shall interpret the Plan and prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures in connection with the operations of the Plan as it
shall deem to be necessary and advisable for the administration of the Plan
consistent with the purposes of the Plan.  All questions of interpretation and
application of the Plan, or as to stock options granted under the Plan, shall be
subject to the determination of the Committee, which shall be final and binding.

     Notwithstanding the above, the selection of the Directors to whom stock
options are to be granted, the timing of such grants, the number of shares
subject to any stock option, the exercise price of any stock option, the periods
during which any stock option may be exercised and the term of any stock option
shall be as hereinafter provided, and the Committee shall have no discretion as
to such matters.

                                   SECTION 2

                        SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE PLAN

     The aggregate number of shares which may be issued or delivered and as to
which grants of stock options may be made under the Plan is 30,000 shares of the
Common Stock, $3.00 par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), subject to
adjustment and substitution as set forth in Section 5. If any stock option
granted under the Plan is cancelled by mutual consent or terminates or expires
for any reason without having been exercised in full, the number 
<PAGE>
 
of shares subject thereto shall again be available for purposes of the Plan. The
shares which may be issued or delivered under the Plan may be either authorized
but unissued shares or reacquired shares or partly each, as shall be determined
from time to time by the Board.

                                   SECTION 3

                             GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS

     On the first business day following the day of each annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, each person who is then a member of the Board and
who is not then an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (a "non-
employee Director") shall automatically and without further action by the Board
or the Committee be granted a "nonstatutory stock option" (i.e., a stock option
which does not qualify under Section 422 or 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the "Code")) to purchase 750 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment
and substitution as set forth in Section 5.  If the number of shares then
remaining available for the grant of stock options under the Plan is not
sufficient for each non-employee Director to be granted an option for 750 shares
(or the number of adjusted or substituted shares pursuant to Section 5), then
each non-employee Director shall be granted an option for a number of whole
shares equal to the number of shares then remaining available divided by the
number of non-employee Directors, disregarding any fractions of a share.

                                   SECTION 4

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK OPTIONS

     Stock options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following
terms and conditions:

     (A) The purchase price at which each stock option may be exercised (the
"option price") shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value per
share of the Common Stock covered by the stock option on the date of grant,
determined as provided in Section 4(G).

     (B) The option price for each stock option shall be paid in full upon
exercise and shall be payable in cash in United States dollars (including check,
bank draft or money order), which may include cash forwarded through a broker or
other agent-sponsored exercise or financing program; provided, however, that in
lieu of such cash the person exercising the stock option may pay the option
price in whole or in part by delivering to the Company shares of the Common
Stock having a fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option,
determined as provided in Section 4(G), equal to the option price for the shares
being purchased; except that (i) any portion of the option price representing a
fraction of a share shall in any event be paid in cash and (ii) no shares of the
Common Stock which have been held for less than one year may be delivered in
payment of the option price of a stock option.  If the person exercising a 

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
stock option participates in a broker or other agent-sponsored exercise or
financing program, the Company will cooperate with all reasonable procedures of
the broker or other agent to permit participation by the person exercising the
stock option in the exercise or financing program. Notwithstanding any procedure
of the broker or other agent-sponsored exercise or financing program, if the
option price is paid in cash, the exercise of the stock option shall not be
deemed to occur and no shares of the Common Stock will be issued or delivered
until the Company has received full payment in cash (including check, bank draft
or money order) for the option price from the broker or other agent. The date of
exercise of a stock option shall be determined under procedures established by
the Committee, and as of the date of exercise the person exercising the stock
option shall be considered for all purposes to be the owner of the shares with
respect to which the stock option has been exercised. Payment of the option
price with shares shall not increase the number of shares of the Common Stock
which may be issued or delivered under the Plan as provided in Section 2.

     (C) No stock option shall be exercisable during the first six months of its
term except in case of death as provided in Section 4(E).  Subject to the terms
of Section 4(E) providing for earlier termination of a stock option, no stock
option shall be exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of
grant.  A stock option to the extent exercisable at any time may be exercised in
whole or in part.

     (D) No stock option shall be transferable by the grantee otherwise than by
Will, or if the grantee dies intestate, by the laws of descent and distribution
of the state of domicile of the grantee at the time of death.  All stock options
shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the grantee only by the grantee or
the grantee's guardian or legal representative.

     (E) If a grantee ceases to be a Director of the Company, any outstanding
stock options held by the grantee shall be exercisable and shall terminate,
according to the following provisions:

               (i)   If a grantee ceases to be a Director of the Company for any
          reason other than resignation, removal for cause or death, any then
          outstanding stock option held by such grantee shall be exercisable by
          the grantee (but only to the extent exercisable by the grantee
          immediately prior to ceasing to be a Director) at any time prior to
          the expiration date of such stock option or within one year after the
          date the grantee ceases to be a Director, whichever is the shorter
          period;

               (ii) If during his term of office as a Director a grantee resigns
          from the Board or is removed from office for cause, any outstanding
          stock option held by the grantee which is not exercisable by the
          grantee immediately prior to resignation or 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
          removal shall terminate as of the date of resignation or removal, and
          any outstanding stock option held by the grantee which is exercisable
          by the grantee immediately prior to resignation or removal shall be
          exercisable by the grantee at any time prior to the expiration date of
          such stock option or within 90 days after the date of resignation or
          removal, whichever is the shorter period;

               (iii)     Following the death of a grantee during service as a
          Director of the Company, any outstanding stock option held by the
          grantee at the time of death (whether or not exercisable by the
          grantee immediately prior to death) shall be exercisable by the person
          entitled to do so under the Will of the grantee, or, if the grantee
          shall fail to make testamentary disposition of the stock option or
          shall die intestate, by the legal representative of the grantee at any
          time prior to the expiration date of such stock option or within two
          years after the date of death, whichever is the shorter period;

               (iv)    Following the death of a grantee after ceasing to be a
          Director and during a period when a stock option is exercisable, any
          outstanding stock option held by the grantee at the time of death
          shall be exercisable by such person entitled to do so under the Will
          of the grantee or by such legal representative at any time prior to
          the expiration date of such stock option or within one year after the
          date of death, whichever is the shorter period.

     (F) All stock options shall be confirmed by an agreement, or an amendment
thereto, which shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer (if other than the President), the President or any Vice President and
by the grantee.

     (G) Fair market value of the Common Stock shall be the mean between the
following prices, as applicable, for the date as of which fair market value is
to be determined as quoted in The Wall Street Journal (or in such other reliable
publication as the Committee, in its discretion, may determine to rely upon):
(a) if the Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the highest
and lowest sales prices per share of the Common Stock as quoted in the NYSE-
Composite Transactions listing for such date, (b) if the Common Stock is not
listed on such exchange, the highest and lowest sales prices per share of Common
Stock for such date on (or on any composite index including) the principal
United States securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "1934 Act") on which the Common Stock is listed, or (c) if the
Common Stock is not listed on any such exchange, the highest and lowest sales
prices per share of the Common Stock for such date on the National Association
of Securities Dealer Automated Quotations System or any successor system then in
use ("NASDAQ").  If there are no such sale price quotations for the date as of
which fair market value is to be 

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
determined but there are such sale price quotations within a reasonable period
both before and after such date, then fair market value shall be determined by
taking a weighted average of the means between the highest and lowest sales
prices per share of the Common Stock as so quoted on the nearest date before and
the nearest date after the date as of which fair market value is to be
determined. The average should be weighted inversely by the respective numbers
of trading days between the selling dates and the date as of which fair market
value is to be determined. If there are no such sale price quotations on or
within a reasonable period both before and after the date as of which fair
market value is to be determined, then fair market value of the Common Stock
shall be the mean between the bona fide bid and asked prices per share of Common
Stock as so quoted for such date on NASDAQ, or if none, the weighted average of
the means between such bona fide bid and asked prices on the nearest trading
date before and the nearest trading date after the date as of which fair market
value is to be determined, if both such dates are within a reasonable period.
The average is to be determined in the manner described above in this Section
4(G). If the fair market value of the Common Stock cannot be determined on the
basis previously set forth in this Section 4(G) for the date as of which fair
market value is to be determined, the Committee shall in good faith determine
the fair market value of the Common Stock on such date. Fair market value shall
be determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which,
by its terms, will never lapse.

     (H) The obligation of the Company to issue or deliver shares of the Common
Stock under the Plan shall be subject to (i) the effectiveness of a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to such
shares, if deemed necessary or appropriate by counsel for the Company, (ii) the
condition that the shares shall have been listed (or authorized for listing upon
official notice of issuance) upon each stock exchange, if any, on which the
Common Stock shares may then be listed and (iii) all other applicable laws,
regulations, rules and orders which may then be in effect.

          Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4 and the other
provisions of the Plan, any stock option granted under the Plan may be subject
to such restrictions and other terms and conditions if any, as shall be
determined, in its discretion, by the Committee and set forth in the agreement
referred to in Section 4(F), or an amendment thereto.

                                   SECTION 5

                     ADJUSTMENT AND SUBSTITUTION OF SHARES

          If a dividend or other distribution shall be declared upon the Common
Stock payable in shares of the Common Stock the number of shares of the Common
Stock set forth in Section 3, the number of shares of the Common Stock then
subject to any outstanding stock options and the number of shares of the Common
Stock which may be issued or delivered under the Plan but are not then subject
to outstanding stock options shall be adjusted by adding thereto the number of
shares of the Common Stock which would have been distributable thereon if such

                                       5
<PAGE>
 
shares had been outstanding on the date fixed for determining the stockholders
entitled to receive such stock dividend or distribution.

          If the outstanding shares of the Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchangeable for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other
securities of the Company or another corporation, whether through
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split-up, combination
of shares, merger or consolidation, then there shall be substituted for each
shares of the Common Stock set forth in Section 3, for each share of the Common
Stock subject to any then outstanding stock option, and for each share of the
Common Stock which may be issued or delivered under the Plan but which is not
then subject to any outstanding stock option, the number and kind of shares of
stock or other securities into which each outstanding share of the Common Stock
shall be so changed or for which each such share shall be exchangeable.

          In case of any adjustment or substitution as provided for in this
Section 5, the aggregate option price for all shares subject to each then
outstanding stock option prior to such adjustment or substitution shall be the
aggregate option price for all shares of stock or other securities (including
any fraction) to which such shares shall have been adjusted or which shall have
been substituted for such shares.  Any new option price per share shall be
carried to at least three decimal places with the last decimal place rounded
upwards to the nearest whole number.

          No adjustment or substitution provided for in this Section 5 shall
require the Company to issue or deliver or sell a fraction of a share or other
security.  Accordingly, all fractional shares or other securities which result
from any such adjustment or substitution shall be eliminated and not carried
forward to any subsequent adjustment or substitution.

                                   SECTION 6

          EFFECT OF THE PLAN ON THE RIGHTS OF COMPANY AND STOCKHOLDERS

          Nothing in the Plan, in any stock option granted under the Plan, or in
any stock option agreement shall confer any right to any person to continue as a
Director of the company or interfere in any way with the rights of the
stockholders of the Company or the Board of Directors to elect and remove
Directors.

                                   SECTION 7

                           AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

          The right to amend the Plan at any time and from time to time and the
right to terminate the Plan at any time are hereby specifically reserved to the
Board; provided always that no such termination shall terminate any outstanding
stock options granted under the Plan; and provided further that no amendment of
the Plan shall (a) be made without stockholder approval if stockholder approval
of the amendment is at the time required for stock options under the Plan to
qualify for the exemption from Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act provided by Rule
16b-3 or by 

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
the rules of the NASDAQ National Market System or any stock exchange on which
the Common Stock may then be listed, (b) amend more than once every six months
the provisions of the Plan relating to the selection of the Directors to whom
stock options are to be granted, the timing of such grants, the number of shares
subject to any stock option, the exercise price of any stock option, the periods
during which any stock option may be exercised and the term of any stock option
other than to comport with changes in the Code or the rules and regulations
thereunder or (c) otherwise amend the Plan in any manner that would cause stock
options under the Plan not to qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3.
No amendment or termination of the Plan shall, without the written consent of
the holder of a stock option theretofore awarded under the Plan, adversely
affect the rights of such holder with respect thereto.

          Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph or any
other provision of the Plan or any stock option agreement, the Board shall have
the power to amend the Plan in any manner deemed necessary or advisable for
stock options granted under the Plan to qualify for the exemption provided by
Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule relating to exemption from Section 16(b) of
the 1934 Act), and any such amendment shall, to the extent deemed necessary or
advisable by the Board, be applicable to any outstanding stock options
theretofore granted under the plan notwithstanding any contrary provisions
contained in any stock option agreement.  In the event of any such amendment to
the Plan, the holder of any stock option outstanding under the Plan shall, upon
request of the Committee and as a condition to the exercisability of such
option, execute a conforming amendment in the form prescribed by the Committee
