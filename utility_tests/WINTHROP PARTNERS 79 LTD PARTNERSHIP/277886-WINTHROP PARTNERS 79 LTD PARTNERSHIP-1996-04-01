   I, III       The Prospectus of the Registrant dated April 10, 1979 (the
                                           "Prospectus")




<PAGE>









Item 1.         Business.

        Winthrop  Partners  79  Limited  Partnership  (the  "Partnership"),  was
organized  under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts  on  November  30,  1978,  for the  purpose of owning and  leasing
commercial  and  industrial  real  properties.  The  Partnership  was  initially
capitalized  with  contributions of $1,000 from each of the two General Partners
and  $5,000  from the  Initial  Limited  Partner.  On  December  14,  1978,  the
Partnership filed a Registration  Statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (the  "Commission")  with respect to a public  offering of
10,000 Units of limited  partnership  interest  ("Units") at a purchase price of
$1,000 per Unit. The Registration  Statement was declared effective on April 10,
1979.  The offering  terminated  in April 1980,  at which time all 10,000 Units,
representing  capital  contributions  from Limited Partners of $10,000,000,  had
been subscribed for.

        The General  Partners of the  Partnership  are One Winthrop  Properties,
Inc.,  a  Massachusetts   corporation  (the  "Managing  General  Partner"),  and
Linnaeus-Hampshire    Realty   Limited    Partnership    (formerly    known   as
Linnaeus-Hampshire  Realty Company),  a Massachusetts  limited  partnership (the
"Associate  General  Partner").  The Managing  General Partner is a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  First  Winthrop  Corporation  ("First  Winthrop"),   a  Delaware
corporation,  which is wholly owned by Winthrop Financial Associates,  A Limited
Partnership  ("WFA"),  a Maryland  public  limited  partnership.  See "Change in
Control".

        The  Partnership's  only  business is owning and leasing  improved  real
estate.  The Partnership's  investment  objectives and policies are described on
pages 35-40 of its Prospectus dated April 10, 1979 (the "Prospectus")  under the
caption "Investment  Objectives and Policies," which description is incorporated
herein by this reference.  The Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424(b) on May 8, 1979.

        The  Partnership  invested  all  of the  net  proceeds  of  the  Limited
Partners' capital  contributions,  other than  approximately  $60,000 which were
originally set aside as reserves, in ten real properties. The funds set aside in
reserves were invested in money market  instruments  and applied,  over time, to
repairs,  improvements and other items associated with Partnership's obligations
in respect of the Properties. The reserve balance as





<PAGE>



of December 31, 1995 net of accounts payable, accrued expenses and distributions
payable to Partners was approximately  $73,000.  The  Partnership's  future cash
distributions will include ongoing distributions from rental income and one-time
distributions  of sale proceeds.  Rental income will be affected by the terms of
any new  leases,  any tenant  improvement  and  leasing  costs  associated  with
renewing  leases with existing  tenants or signing leases with new tenants,  the
loss of rent  during any period  when a property is not under lease and the loss
of rent after a property is sold. Distributions of sale proceeds will be made as
a return of  capital  until  investors  have  received  their  original  Capital
Contribution. Pursuant to the Partnership's partnership agreement, sale proceeds
are distributed 100% to investors until they have received their $1,000 per unit
Capital  Contribution.  The general partners' 8% share of sale proceeds would be
paid  subsequently.  See Item 2,  "Properties" for a description of Registrant's
remaining properties.

         Each of the  Partnership's  properties  are  leased to a single  tenant
other than its Hurst, Texas property,  which has two tenants.  The tenants under
all eleven leases have exclusive control over the day-to-day business operations
conducted at the  Properties as well as decisions with respect to the initiation
of any development or renovations at the Properties. The Partnership has limited
approval rights over any such renovation programs proposed by the tenants. Seven
of the  Properties  are  leased on a triple net basis.  The  Partnership  has no
responsibility  for any  maintenance,  repairs or  improvements  associated with
these Properties.  In addition,  the tenants at these properties are responsible
for all insurance  requirements and the payment of real estate taxes directly to
the taxing authorities. The Partnership believes that each of the properties are
adequately  insured.  With  respect to the lease  with J.C.  Penney  Co.,  Inc.,
Batavia,  NY, the  Partnership  is  responsible  for all structural and exterior
repairs,  carrying  insurance,  paying all real  estate  taxes up to a specified
maximum  amount,  repainting,   varnishing  or  otherwise  redecorating  certain
exterior  portions of the building  every three years and paying  certain common
facility  maintenance charges up to a fixed amount. The Partnership spent $7,810
for roof  repairs  at this  property  in 1995.  With  respect  to the lease with
Walgreen Co., St. Louis,  MO, the  Partnership is responsible for maintenance of
the structural  portions of the building,  all repairs required by reason of dry
rot or termites and the first $750 per year of roof repairs. No funds were spent
by the Partnership on these items





<PAGE>



in 1995.  With respect to the leases with  Creative  Paint & Wallpaper  and B&G,
Inc.,  Hurst,  TX, the Partnership is responsible for structural  maintenance of
the premises.  The Partnership  spent $1,125 for these item in 1995.  Under both
leases at this Property,  the  Partnership is required to administer the payment
of real estate taxes and to procure and maintain insurance for the Property. The
Partnership is fully  reimbursed for real estate taxes and for annual  insurance
premiums up to $1,000.

         Each  retail  tenant is subject  to  competition  from other  companies
offering  similar  products  in the  locations  of the  property  leased by such
tenant.  In addition,  the Partnership  anticipates  that it would be subject to
significant competition in attracting tenants upon the expiration or termination
of any of the leases of its properties.  The Partnership has no control over the
tenants' responses to competitive  conditions  impacting the businesses operated
by the tenants at each of the properties.

         Tenants with 1995 rental  payments of 10% or more of the  Partnership's
total annual revenue are as follows: Floors, Inc. and B & G, Inc., Hurst, Texas,
11%; J.W. Burress, Incorporated,  Greenville County, South Carolina, 13.7%; Toys
"R" Us, Inc., San Antonio,  Texas,  16.6%; Toys "R" Us, Inc., Ft. Worth,  Texas,
16.3%; and Wal-Mart Stores,  Mexia,  Texas,  11.7%. The Partnership  expects the
rental  payments  from the same  tenants  to  amount to  approximately  the same
respective percentages of the Partnership's total income in 1996.

Property Matters

         Floors, Inc. and B&G, Inc. (the "Tenants"), Hurst, Texas.
On August 31, 1995, Creative Paint assigned the lease to Floors,
Inc.  In late 1993, the Partnership replaced the roof of the
property at a cost of $83,000.  Approximately $10,000 of
insurance proceeds were used to offset the cost of the new roof.

         J.C. Penney Co., Inc., Batavia, New York.  The maturity date
of the loan encumbering this property was extended from July 1,
1995 to February 1, 1998.

Employees.

         The Partnership does not have any employees.  Services are
performed for the Partnership by the Managing General partner,
and agents retained by it, including an affiliate of the General
Partners, Winthrop Management.

Change in Control

         Until  December  22,  1994,  the  sole  general   partner  of  Linnaeus
Associates Limited  Partnership  ("Linnaeus"),  the sole general partner of WFA,
and the sole  general  partner of the  Associate  General  Partner was Arthur J.
Halleran,  Jr. On December 22, 1994, pursuant to an Investment Agreement entered
into among Nomura Asset Capital Corporation  ("NACC"),  Mr. Halleran and certain
other  individuals  who  comprised  the senior  management  of WFA,  the general
partnership  interest in Linnaeus was  transferred to W.L.  Realty,  L.P. ("W.L.
Realty"). W.L. Realty is a Delaware limited partnership,  the general partner of
which was, until July 18, 1995, A.I. Realty Company, LLC ("Realtyco"), an entity
owned by certain employees of NACC. On July 18, 1995 Londonderry  Acquisition II
Limited  Partnership  (Londonderry  II"), a Delaware  limited  partnership,  and
affiliate of Apollo Real Estate Advisors, L.P. ("Apollo"), acquired, among other
things,  Realtyco's  general  partner  interest in W.L.  Realty and a sixty four
percent (64%) limited partnership  interest in W.L. Realty, and WFA acquired the
sole general partner interest in the Associate General Partner.

     As a  result  of the  foregoing  acquisitions,  Londonderry  II is the sole
general  partner of W.L.  Realty which is the sole general  partner of Linnaeus,
and  which in turn is the  sole  general  partner  of WFA.  As a  result  of the
foregoing,  effective  July 18,  1995,  Londonderry  II, an affiliate of Apollo,
became the controlling  entity of the Managing General Partner and the Associate
General  Partner.  In connection with the transfer of control,  the officers and
directors of the Managing  General Partner resigned and Londonderry II appointed
new officers and directors.  See Item 10,  "Directors and Executive  Officers of
Registrant.

Subsequent Event

         The  Partnership  has  reached  a  tentative  agreement  with  Piedmont
Clarklift,  the tenant at the Greenville,  South Carolina property,  pursuant to
which Piedmont Clarklift will purchase the property for $1,525,000.  The sale of
this property is contingent upon numerous conditions.  It is anticipated that if
the property is sold, net proceeds will be distributed to limited partners.

incurred or assumed by the Partnership in connection with the  acquisition.  All
of the properties are commercial in nature. Each of the Properties is net leased
to a single tenant unaffiliated with the Partnership (with the sole exception of
the Hurst, Texas property which is now leased to two tenants,  Floors,  Inc. and
B&G, Inc.). Each of the tenants, other than J. W. Burress Incorporated,  Gordy's
Food & Liquor,  Inc.,  Creative  Paint and  Wallpaper,  Inc. and B&G, Inc., is a
public company or a subsidiary of a public company.

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related
               Stockholder Matters.

    There is no established public market for the Units. Trading in the Units is
sporadic and occurs solely through private transactions.

    As of March 14, 1996, there were 913 holders of Units.

   The  Partnership  Agreement  (which  is  incorporated  herein  by  reference)
requires  that any Cash  Available  for  Distribution  (as  defined  therein) be
distributed  quarterly to the Partners in specified  proportions and priorities.
There are no restrictions on the Partnership's present or future ability to make
distributions  of Cash  Available  for  Distribution.  During  the  years  ended
December 31, 1995 and 1994, Registrant has made the following cash distributions
with respect to the Units to holders  thereof as of the dates set forth below in
the amounts set forth opposite such dates:

             Distribution with               Amount of Distribution
             Respect to Quarter Ended             Per Unit

See Item 7 below for a discussion  of the facts that may  materially  affect the
comparability between years of the above information.

Item 7.             Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                    Condition and Results of Operations.

       The  Partnership  generates  revenues from rental income paid pursuant to
leases with tenants at the  Partnership's  properties  as its primary  source of
liquidity.  Pursuant to the terms of the leases, the tenants are responsible for
substantially  all of the  operating  expenses  with  respect to the  properties
including,  maintenance, capital improvements,  insurance and taxes. See "Item 2
Properties" for a description of these leases.

       At December 31,  1995,  the  Partnership's  had $244,593 in cash and cash
equivalents,  which  represents  an increase of $51,369 from  December 31, 1994.
This increase was due to an increase of cash from investing activities which was
partially  offset by an increase in cash used in investing  activities  and cash
used in financing activities.

       The  Partnership  requires  cash to pay  principal  and  interest  on its
mortgage indebtedness,  nominal operating expenses (discussed below), management
fees and general  and  administrative  expenses.  The  Partnership's  rental and
interest  income was  sufficient  in 1995,  and is expected to be  sufficient in
future





<PAGE>



years, to pay all of these amounts as well as to provide for cash  distributions
to the Partners from operations.

       In addition to the base rent  payments made by tenants,  the  Partnership
received  two  percentage  rental  payments  in  1995  totaling  $125,095.   The
Partnership  received  percentage rent payments of $117,118 in 1993 and $116,785
in 1994. Base rent payments  increased for the period ended December 31, 1995 as
compared to the periods ended December 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993 due to the
terms of the  leases  with  tenants  providing  for an annual  increase  in rent
payments.  Accordingly,  the Partnership's  operating results for the year ended
1995 improved as compared to the prior to calendar years.

       Due to the net or modified net and long-term nature of all but one of the
leases of the Partnership's  properties and the fixed terms of the Partnership's
permanent  borrowings,  the  Partnership  does not  expect  the  results  of its
operations in 1996 to vary  significantly  from those for prior years.  However,
the if one or more of the following were to occur, the Partnership's  results of
operations could be significantly impacted:

       1.    Increases in annual rental payments required by the terms
of the lease.

       2. The increase or decrease of percentage rent payable, if any, under the
terms of the lease. The amounts,  if any, of percentage rents which will be paid
to the  Partnership  in the future are  dependent on future sales volumes of the
tenants occupying the Partnership's properties.

       3. The Partnership's depreciation expense will decrease over time because
some of the Partnership's  properties are depreciated under the component method
which results in some building  components having shorter estimated useful lives
than others.

       4. The lease of the Partnership's property in Batavia, New York, to J. C.
Penney  Company,  Inc.,  requires the  Partnership  to make all  structural  and
exterior  repairs,  carry  insurance,  pay all real estate taxes up to a maximum
amount,  repaint,  varnish or otherwise  redecorate certain exterior portions of
the  building  every  three years and pay certain  common  facility  maintenance
charges up to a fixed amount.  Both leases at the Hurst,  Texas property require
the Partnership to make all structural and exterior  repairs.  In addition,  the
lease of the Partnership's





<PAGE>



property in University City, Missouri, to Walgreen, Co. requires the Partnership
to pay for all repairs  required by reason of dry rot or termites  and the first
$750  per  year of roof  repairs.  These  expenditures  vary  from  year to year
depending upon the  circumstances of these three  properties.  During the period
ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership  expended  approximately  $13,000 under
the terms of these leases for capital improvements.

       5. Depending upon market conditions and restrictions contained in certain
of the instruments relating to the Partnership's borrowings, it is possible that
the  Partnership  will finance or refinance some or all of its properties in the
future,  although  the  Partnership  has no  present  plans  to do so  with  the
exception  of the J.C.  Penney  property;  see  "Item 2.  Properties."  Any such
financing or refinancing  might affect the  Partnership's  interest  expense and
cash  available  from  operations,   as  well  as  provide  the  possibility  of
distributions of loan proceeds to the partners.

       6. In spite of the  long-term  nature  of the  leases,  general  economic
conditions are difficult for many businesses.  If a lease is terminated due to a
tenant  bankruptcy,  the  Partnership  will  have to seek a new  tenant  in very
competitive rental markets. There can be no assurance that the Partnership could
secure a tenant or obtain the same rental rates.

       7. Upon the sale of a property,  the  Partnership's  cash  available from
future  operations  would  decrease  but  revenues  for the year in which a sale
occurs would increase.

       The Partnership does not anticipate that it will have any
substantial requirements for capital resources until February 1,
1998, at which time a mortgage note secured by the J.C. Penney
property will have a balloon payment due.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To WINTHROP PARTNERS 79 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of WINTHROP PARTNERS 79 LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP (a  Massachusetts  limited  partnership) as of December 31, 1995 and
1994,  and the related  statements of income,  changes in partners'  capital and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 1995.
These  financial   statements  are  the   responsibility  of  the  Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of WINTHROP PARTNERS 79 LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III listed in Item 14(a)(2) is
the responsibility of Winthrop Partners 79 Limited Partnership management and is
presented  for  purposes  of  complying   with  the   Securities   and  Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial  statements
and, in our opinion,  is fairly stated, in all material respects,  the financial
data  required  to be set forth  therein  in  relation  to the  basic  financial
statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1995


1.      ORGANIZATION

        Winthrop  Partners  79 (the  Partnership),  a limited  partnership,  was
        organized under the Uniform Limited  Partnership Act of the Commonwealth
        of  Massachusetts  on  November  30,  1978 for the purpose of owning and
        leasing commercial and industrial real properties.  The Partnership will
        terminate on December 31, 2008, or sooner,  in accordance with the terms
        of the Partnership Agreement.


2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        Financial  Statements - The financial  statements of the Partnership are
        prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally
        accepted accounting principles.

        Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
        with generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management to
        make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported  amounts of
        assets  and  liabilities   and  disclosure  of  contingent   assets  and
        liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements  and the reported
        amounts of revenues and expenses  during the  reporting  period.  Actual
        results could differ from those estimates.

        Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for federal,  state or local
        income taxes in the financial  statements of the  Partnership.  Partners
        are required to report on their  individual  tax return their  allocable
        share  of  income,   gains,  losses,   deductions  and  credits  of  the
        Partnership. The Partnership files its tax returns on the accrual basis.
        On June 15, 1979, the Internal  Revenue Service issued a ruling that the
        Partnership  will be classified as a partnership  for federal income tax
        purposes.

        Distributions  to Partners - The cash  distribution due Partners for the
        three  months ended  December  31, 1995 is recorded in the  accompanying
        financial  statements  as a  liability  and  a  reduction  of  Partners'
        capital.   As  provided   in  the   Partnership   Agreement,   quarterly
        distributions  are payable to  Partners  within 60 days after the end of
        the quarter.

        Cash and Cash  Equivalents  - Cash and  cash  equivalents  consist  of a
        mutual fund that  invests in treasury  bills and  repurchase  agreements
        maturing in three months or less.  Cash  equivalents are valued at cost,
        which approximates market value.

        Percentage  Rent - The  Partnership has entered into several leases that
        provide  for a  minimum  annual  rent  plus  additional  rent  based  on
        percentages  of  sales  at  the  properties   (percentage  rent).  These
        percentage  rents are  recorded  on a cash  basis.  For the years  ended
        December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993, the Partnership  received  percentage
        rent   totaling   approximately   $125,095,   $116,785   and   $117,118,
        respectively.

        Leases - The  Partnership  leases its real  properties  and accounts for
        such leases in accordance  with the provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting  Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," as amended.  This
        statement sets forth specific  criteria for determining  whether a lease
        should be accounted for as a financing lease or an operating lease.


2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

        (a)    Financing Method

               Under this method, minimum lease payments to be received plus the
               estimated  value  of the  property  at the end of the  lease  are
               considered to be the Partnership's gross investment in the lease.
               Unearned  income,   representing  the  difference  between  gross
               investment and actual cost of the leased  property,  is amortized
               over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease
               to provide a level rate of return over the lease term.

        (b)    Operating Method

               Under this method,  revenue is recognized as rentals  become due,
               which does not materially differ from the  straight-line  method.
               Expenses  (including  depreciation)  are charged to operations as
               incurred.

        Depreciation - Component  depreciation  on real estate leased to others,
        accounted  for  under  the  operating  method,  is  computed  using  the
        straight-line  method  over the  estimated  useful life of each class of
        asset,  which  ranges  from 5 to 40  years.  The cost of the  properties
        represents  the purchase price of the properties  plus  acquisition  and
        closing costs,  or, to the extent that the property had previously  been
        accounted for under the financing  method,  the depreciable  base is the
        fair  market  value at the date of  implementation  of  operating  lease
        accounting.

        Certain  amounts  from  prior  years  have been  reclassified  to remain
        consistent with the current year's presentation.


3.      TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

        One Winthrop  Properties,  Inc.  (One  Winthrop),  the Managing  General
        Partner,  Winthrop  Securities  Co.,  Inc.  (Winthrop  Securities),  the
        selling  agent for the public  offering  and  Winthrop  Management,  the
        manager  of the  properties,  are  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of First
        Winthrop  Corporation,  which  in  turn  is  wholly  owned  by  Winthrop
        Financial Associates, A Limited Partnership (WFA).

        Winthrop Management, an affiliate of WFA, is entitled to annual property
        management  fees equal to 1.5% of the excess of cash  receipts over cash
        expenditures  (excluding  debt  service,  property  management  fees and
        capital  expenditures)  from each property  managed by it. For the years
        ended  December  31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  Winthrop  Management  earned
        $23,662,  $23,403  and  $23,180,  respectively,  for  managing  the real
        properties of the Partnership.

        The  General   Partners  are  entitled  to  8%  of  Cash  Available  for
        Distribution,   subordinated   to  a   cumulative   priority   quarterly
        distribution  to the Limited  Partners  as  provided in the  Partnership
        Agreement.  For the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  the
        Partnership  has paid or accrued  distributions  from Cash Available for
        Distributions,   as  defined  in  the  Partnership  Agreement,  totaling
        $69,360, $72,597 and $64,590, respectively, to the General Partners.

        During the liquidation  stage of the  Partnership,  the General Partners
        and  their   affiliates  are  entitled  to  receive   certain  fees  and
        distributions,  subordinated to specified minimum returns to the Limited
        Partners as described in the Partnership Agreement.

        reporting  purposes and the  operating  method for tax return  purposes.

     (f)  Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings.   None.

Item 11.  Executive Compensation.

     Registrant  is not  required  to and did not  pay any  compensation  to the
officers or directors  of the Managing  General  Partner.  The Managing  General
Partner  does not  presently  pay any  compensation  to any of its  officers  or
directors. (See Item 13, "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.")


Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
                Management.

       (a)  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners.

     No person or group is known by the  Partnership to be the beneficial  owner
of more than 5% of the outstanding Units at March 1, 1996. Under the Partnership
Agreement  (incorporated herein by reference),  the voting rights of the Limited
Partners  are  limited  and,  in some  circumstances,  are  subject to the prior
receipt of certain opinions of counsel or judicial decisions.

     Under the  Partnership  Agreement,  the right to manage the business of the
Partnership  is vested in the General  Partners and is generally to be exercised
only by the Managing  General  Partner,  although  the consent of the  Associate
General  Partner is required for all  purchases,  financings,  refinancings  and
sales  or other  dispositions  of the  Partnership's  real  properties  and with
respect to certain  other  matters.  See Item 1 above for a  description  of the
General Partners.

     (b)  Security Ownership of Management.

     At March 1, 1996,  the partners of WFA and the officers,  directors and the
general  partner of the General  Partners owned as a group 5 Units  representing
less than 1% of the total number of Units outstanding.

     (c)  Changes in Control.

     There exists no arrangement known to the Partnership the operation of which
may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Partnership except
as follows.

         In connection with its acquisition of control of Linnaeus,  Londonderry
II issued  NACC a $22  million  non-recourse  purchase  money note due 1998 (the
"Purchase Money Note"), as set forth in a
loan  agreement,  dated as of July 14, 1995, by and between NACC and Londonderry
II. Initial  security for the Purchase Money Note includes,  among other things,
the partnership interests in W.L.
Realty  acquired by Londonderry II and the W.L. Realty  partnership  interest in
Linnaeus.  Accordingly, if Londonderry II does not satisfy its obligations under
the  Purchase  Money  Note,  NACC  would have the right to  foreclose  upon this
security and, as result, would gain control of the Partnership.

Item 13.  Certain Relationship and Related Transactions.

       Under  the  Partnership   Agreement,   the  General  Partners  and  their
affiliates   are   entitled  to  receive   various   fees,   commissions,   cash
distributions,  allocations of taxable income or loss and expense reimbursements
from the Partnership.  Pursuant to Section 4.1 of the Partnership Agreement, the
General  Partners  are  entitled  to  8% of  Cash  Available  for  Distribution,
subordinated  to a cumulative  priority  quarterly  distribution  to the Limited
Partners as provided in the Partnership Agreement.  For the years ended December
31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Partnership has paid or accrued  distributions from
Cash  Available  for  Distributions,  as defined in the  Partnership  Agreement,
totaling $69,360, $72,597 and $64,590, respectively, to the General Partners.

       During the liquidation stage of the Partnership, the General Partners and
their  affiliates  are  entitled  to  receive  certain  fees and  distributions,
subordinated to specified  minimum returns to the Limited  Partners as described
in the Partnership Agreement.

     WFC  Realty  Co.,  Inc.  owns five  $1,000  limited  partnership  units and
receives its proportionate share of Cash Available for Distribution, pursuant to
Section 4.1 of the Partnership Agreement.

       Pursuant to Section  5.3A (iii) of the  Partnership  Agreement,  Winthrop
Management  receives a Property Management fee equal to 1.5% of cash receipts in
excess of cash expenditures other than expenditures for the management fee, debt
service  payments  and capital  improvements.  For the years ended  December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993,  Winthrop  Management earned $23,662,  $23,403 and $23,180,
respectively, for managing the real properties of the Partnership

       For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership  allocated  $25,521
of taxable income to the Managing General Partner,  $42,535 of taxable income to
the Associate  General Partner and $391 of taxable income to the Initial Limited
Partner.
