ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.


(a)  General development of business.

The Company is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1816.

(b)  Financial information about industry segments. 

The Company operates in only one segment, the impounding,
purification and distribution of water.

(c)  Narrative description of business.

The business of the Company is to impound, purify and distribute
water. The Company operates entirely within its franchised
territory located in York County, Pennsylvania.  The Company is
regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PPUC). 
Water service is supplied through the Company's own distribution
system to the City of York, the Boroughs of North York, East
Prospect, West York, Manchester, Mount Wolf, Jacobus, Loganville,
Yorkana, New Salem, Hallam, Seven Valleys, Spring Grove, and
portions of the Townships of Manchester, East Manchester, West
Manchester, Springettsbury, Spring Garden, Springfield, York,
North Codorus, Hellam, Windsor, Lower Windsor and Jackson.  The
Company obtains its water supply from the south branch and east
branch of the Codorus Creek which drains an area of approximately
117 square miles.  The Company's present average daily
consumption is 19,380,000 gallons, and its present safe daily
yield is 29,900,000 gallons.

The Company's service territory has an estimated population of
140,000.  Industry of the area served is diversified,
manufacturing such items as fixtures and furniture, electrical
machinery, food products, paper, ordnance, textile products, air
conditioning, barbells, etc.  In the area served by the Company
under the supervision of the PPUC there are no competitors. 

The Company's business does not require large amounts of working
capital and is not dependent upon any single customer or a very
few customers.  Operating revenue is derived from the following
sources and in the following percentages:  residential, 58%;
commercial and industrial, 34%; other, 8%.  The Company presently
has 90 employees.

During the last five years ended in 1995, the Company has
maintained an increasing growth in number of customers and
distribution facilities as shown by the following chart:

During 1995, the per capita volume of water sold did not
significantly change compared to 1994.  The Company does not
anticipate any change in the level of water usage which would
have a material impact on future results of operations.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

The accounting and executive offices of the Company are located
in a two story brick and masonry building, containing
approximately 14,480 square feet of floor space, at 130 East
Market Street, York, Pennsylvania.

The Company has two impounding dams located in York and
Springfield Townships adjoining the Borough of Jacobus to the
south.  The lower dam is constructed of compacted earth with a
concrete core wall and is 660 feet long and 50 feet high and
creates a reservoir covering approximately 220 acres containing
about 1,150,000,000 gallons of water.  About 800 acres
surrounding the reservoir are planted with more than 1,200,000
evergreen trees to protect the area both from pollution and also
from soil erosion which might otherwise fill the reservoir with
silt.  The upper dam is constructed of compacted earth and is
1,000 feet long and 50 feet high and creates a reservoir covering
approximately 290 acres containing about 1,600,000,000 gallons of
water.  About 600 acres surrounding the reservoir are planted
with grass to protect the area both from pollution and also from
soil erosion which might otherwise fill the reservoir with silt.

The Company's main pumping station is located in Spring Garden
Township on the south branch of the Codorus Creek about 1,500
feet upstream from its confluence with the west branch of the
Codorus Creek and about four miles downstream from the Company's
lower impounding dam.  The pumping station presently houses
pumping equipment consisting of three electrically driven
centrifugal pumps and two diesel-engine driven centrifugal pumps
with a combined pumping capacity of 75,000,000 gallons per day. 
From here, raw water is pumped approximately two miles to the
filtration plant through pipes located on a right-of-way owned by
the Company.

The Company's filtration plant is located in Spring Garden
Township about one-half mile south of the City of York.  Water at
this plant is filtered through 12 dual media filters having a
stated capacity of 31,000,000 gallons per day and being capable
of filtering 46,500,000 gallons per day for short periods if
necessary.  Since the average daily consumption in 1995 was
19,380,000 gallons, it can readily be seen that the present
pumping and filtering facilities are adequate to meet the present
demands.

Clear water reservoirs of the Company which are located in Spring
Garden Township adjacent to the filtration plant are capable of
storing up to 32,000,000 gallons of water, and there are
standpipes located throughout the Company's service area capable
of storing another 15,140,000 gallons of clear water.

The Company's distribution center and material and supplies
warehouse are located at 1801 Mt. Rose Avenue, Springettsbury
Township.  There are two  one-story concrete block buildings
having 26,680 square feet of area.

The distribution system of the Company has approximately 622
miles of main water lines.

All of the Company's properties listed above are held in fee by
the Company.  There are no encumbrances.

In addition, the Company has entered into a "Joint Use and Park
Management Agreement" dated December 29, 1976, and executed by
The York Water Company and the County of York, Pennsylvania,
whereby the Company has licensed to the County of York for fifty
(50) years for county park purposes for the benefit of the
general public in York County the Company's present reservoir
lands and waters referred to in the Agreement as approximately
1,175 acres including two lakes, all in Springfield and York
Townships, York County, Pennsylvania.

York County has in return agreed thereby not to erect a dam
upstream on the east branch of the Codorus Creek and to waive
flood damages to the County's Spring Valley Tract of park lands
if, as planned, the Company builds a third dam around the year
2020.  The Company and its customers are thereby assured of a
future reservoir site at reasonable expense.

There are no material legal proceedings. 


ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

To Our Shareholders:


It was a pleasure to meet so many of you on December 5, 1995 when
we celebrated: the Company's 180th anniversary; the issuance of
the 500th consecutive dividend; and the restoration of our
magnificent main office ceiling. For those who were unable to
attend the celebration, we have bound a copy of the brochure
describing the ceiling into this annual report.

Although we haven't done as well as we would have liked with
respect to our net income and resultant earnings, 1995 was
another active year for your Company.

Operating revenue for 1995 increased 4.7% over those in 1994.
This increase was primarily the result of a 3.7% increase in
rates approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
effective September 23, 1994. Unfortunately, the addition of over
1000 customers was not reflected by a corresponding increase in
the company's total consumption. Industrial-Commercial 1995
consumption was down 4.5% over that recorded in 1994; in fact,
the Company's top 25 customers recorded a 6.9% drop. This drop is
attributable in part to the Company's conservation educational
efforts, more recycling by industry and a cut back in the area's
industrial diversity. 

The flatness in our operating revenues and the increase in all
expenses resulted in the decrease in the Company's net income.
These factors are now being evaluated with respect to the
possibility of applying for a modest rate increase.

The Company's 1995 major activities included: a new 1.0 million
gallon standpipe for the Loganville re-pump system; the
acquisition of the Nashville and East Prospect Borough
distribution systems; the negotiation and approval by the PAPUC
and PADEP of an agreement to sell bulk water to Glen Rock
Borough; the installation of a caustic feed system to improve
water quality; and the restoration of our main office ceiling.
  
To take advantage of the lower interest rates, we issued 5%
$4,300,000 Industrial Revenue Refunding Bonds due 2010. The 5%
bonds were used to redeem the outstanding 6.25% bonds that were
issued in 1991. This action resulted in an annual interest
savings of approximately $54,000.

The Company's dividend reinvestment and employee stock purchase
plans continue to be attractive to the Company's shareholders and
employees. In 1995 a total of 7691 shares were purchased which
raised $484,796 in additional capital.

The Company's 1996 planned activities include: the acquisition of
the Jefferson Borough water distribution system; the finalization
of the Glen Rock bulk water project; a rate increase request
filing; and, the acquisition of funds to retire the company's
short term debt and to finance the Company's 1996-97
construction.

Under the Company's mandatory Director's retirement policy,
Robert E. Skold has retired from the Board of Directors after 20
years of service. Mr. Skold served the Board in various
capacities and was the Company's Secretary-Treasurer at his
retirement.  Mr. Skold was not only an active participant in
Company matters, but was also an excellent source of advice and
counsel to me personally.  Fortunately, we will not lose his
valued counsel since the Board of Directors saw fit to elect him
Director Emeritus. 

As a result of Mr. Skold's retirement, the Board of Directors
reorganized the Company and elevated the previously designated
Managers to Vice Presidents and elected Jeffrey S. Osman to
Secretary-Treasurer as well as Vice-President-Finance.
Additionally, Lois L. Shultz was elected Assistant Secretary-
Treasurer and Horace Keesey III was elected Vice-Chairman.
 
In closing, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to
extend my appreciation to our dedicated, hardworking employees
who consistently go above and beyond the call of duty to bring
"that good York water" into the homes and businesses of our
customers with high levels of quality and service. It is their
efforts that give our Company a well-earned reputation for
excellence throughout the communities we serve.

Respectfully submitted,



William T. Morris, P.E.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
 
Results of Operations

1995 Compared with 1994
     Water operating revenues for 1995 increased $693,589 or 4.7%
over 1994.  The increase resulted primarily from an increase in
rates of 3.7% approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission (PPUC) effective September 23, 1994.
     Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and taxes, for
1995 increased $126,231 or 1.9%.  The expense increase was
generally due to increases in maintenance of utility plant.
     Depreciation expense for 1995 increased $78,575 or 5.5% over
1994 as a result of increased plant investment.
     Federal and state income taxes for 1995 increased $364,459 or
34.5% when compared to 1994 principally as a result of an
increase in taxable income and an increase in deferred income tax
expense resulting from a reduction in deferred tax assets by
recognizing a 2% decline in the state income tax rate.
     Interest on long-term debt for 1995 decreased $43,166 or 1.5%. 
The decrease was related to the issuance of $2,700,000 4.75%
Revenue Refunding Bonds to replace a like amount of bonds with an
interest rate of 7.0% during the first quarter of 1994 and the
issuance of $4,300,000 5% Revenue Refunding Bonds to replace a
like amount of bonds with an interest rate of 6.25% during the
fourth quarter of 1995.
     Interest on short-term debt for 1995 increased $153,498 when
compared to 1994.  The increase is due primarily to an increase
in short-term debt outstanding during 1995.  The average short-
term debt outstanding in 1995 and 1994 was $2,312,964 and
$312,304, respectively.  The increase in short-term debt was used
to fund construction expenditures.
     Allowance for funds used during construction for 1995 increased
$92,021 or 68.5% when compared to 1994.  The increase was due to
an increase in the Company's plant investment under construction
during 1995.

1994 Compared with 1993
     Water operating revenues for 1994 increased $553,951 or 3.9%
over 1993.  The increase resulted primarily from an increase in
rates of 3.7% approved by the PPUC effective September 23, 1994
and an increase in the volume of water sold as a result of adding
986 customers during 1994.
     Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and taxes, for
1994 increased $136,734 or 2.1%.  The expense increase was
generally due to increases in power purchased relating to the
volume of water sold and increased repairs of utility plant.
     Depreciation expense for 1994 increased $156,220 or 12.3% over
1993 as a result of increased plant investment.
     Federal and state income taxes for 1994 decreased $230,351 or
17.9% when compared to 1993 principally as a result of a decrease
in nonoperating income, as discussed below.  The reduction of
nonoperating income increased the relative benefit of permanent
differences and resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate
in 1994 from 33.5% to 30.2%.
     Interest on long-term debt for 1994 decreased $283,854 or 9.1%. 
The decrease was related to the repayment of long-term debt in
December 1993 and the issuance of $2,700,000 4.75% Revenue
Refunding Bonds to replace a like amount of bonds with an
interest rate of 7.0% during the first quarter of 1994.
     Interest on short-term debt for 1994 increased $19,327 when
compared to 1993.  The increase is due primarily to an increase
in short-term debt outstanding during 1994.  The average short-
term debt outstanding in 1994 and 1993 was $312,304 and $46,518,
respectively.
     Allowance for funds used during construction for 1994 increased
$60,810 or 82.8% when compared to 1993.  The increase was due to
an increase in the Company's plant investment under construction
during 1994.
     During 1994, the Company had a gain on sale of one parcel of
land of $215,417 ($125,128 after tax).
     Other income, net for 1994 decreased $299,075 when compared to
1993.  The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in
interest income on a lower average balance of temporary
investments during 1994.  Temporary investments as of December
31, 1993 represented amounts remaining from the Company's
issuance of Senior Notes in December 1992.  During 1994, the
remainder of these proceeds was used to fund capital improvement
projects.  There were no temporary investments as of December 31,
1994.

Rate Developments
     Within the last several years the Company has filed written
applications for rate increases with the PPUC and has been
granted rate relief as a result of such requests.  The most
recent formal rate request was filed by the Company on April 29,
1994, seeking a 6.7% increase in annual revenues.  Effective
September 23, 1994, the PPUC authorized an increase in rates
designed to produce approximately $550,000 in additional annual
operating revenues, an increase of 3.7%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
     During 1995, the per capita volume of water sold did not
significantly change compared to 1994.  The Company does not
anticipate any change in the level of water usage which would
have a material impact on future results of operations.
     During 1995, the Company had $5,256,959 of construction
expenditures.  The Company financed such expenditures through
internally generated funds, customers' advances, short-term
borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under
its dividend reinvestment plan (stock issued in lieu of cash
dividends) and employee stock purchase plan.
     The Company anticipates construction expenditures for 1996 and
1997 of approximately $5,457,000 and $3,662,000, respectively. 
The Company plans to finance such expenditures with a common
stock subscription, internally generated funds, customers'
advances, short-term borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance
of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan (stock
issued in lieu of cash dividends) and employee stock purchase
plan.
     The Company anticipates that it will submit an application in
the future with the PPUC proposing increases in rates to provide
a fair rate of return on the capital expenditures associated with
its 1996 and 1997 construction projects.
     During 1995, net cash used in investing and financing activities
exceeded net cash provided by operating activities.  The Company
anticipates that during 1996 net cash used in investing and
financing activities will again exceed net cash provided by
operating activities.  Borrowings against the Company's lines of
credit, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under its
dividend reinvestment plan (stock issued in lieu of cash
dividends) and employee stock purchase plan, a common stock
subscription and customers' advances are used to satisfy the need
for additional cash.
     As of December 31, 1995, current liabilities exceeded current
assets by $3,986,903.  As of December 31, 1994, current
liabilities exceeded current assets by $2,143,806.  Generally,
the Company finances a portion of its construction expenditures
with borrowings against its lines of credit until such borrowings
reach an amount which would justify issuing long-term debt. 
Accordingly, current liabilities frequently exceed current assets
on the Company's balance sheets.  Short-term borrowings from
lines of credit as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 were $4,164,000
and $1,302,000, respectively.  The Company maintains lines of
credit aggregating $11,000,000.  Loans granted under these lines
of credit bear interest based on the prime or LIBOR rates.  The
Company is not required to maintain compensating balances on its
lines of credit.
    During 1995, the Company's dividend payout ratios relative to
net income and cash provided by operating activities were 98.4%
and 75.9%, respectively.  The Company believes that these payout
ratios are appropriate.
    Shareholders' investment as a percent of total capitalization
was  40.5% as of December 31, 1995 compared with 39.9% as of
December 31, 1994.  This increase was the result of an increase
in the amount of shareholder equity.
    The Company, like all other businesses, is affected by
inflation, most notably by the continually increasing costs
incurred to maintain and expand its service capacity.  The
cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher
facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future
cash flows.  The ability of the Company to recover this increased
investment in facilities is dependent upon future revenue
increases, which are subject to approval by the PPUC.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements
    The adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets
to be Disposed Of," and No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," during fiscal 1996 are not expected to have a
material effect on the Company's financial position.

l. Accounting Policies
   The business of The York Water Company is to impound, purify
and distribute water.  The Company operates entirely within its
franchised territory located in York County, Pennsylvania, and is
subject to regulation by the PPUC.
   The following summarizes the significant accounting policies
employed by The York Water Company.

Depreciation, Amortization, Maintenance and Repairs-
   The straight-line remaining life method is used to  compute
depreciation on utility plant.  The effective rate of
depreciation was 2.42% in 1995, 2.45% in 1994 and 2.26% in 1993
on average utility plant, net of customers' advances and
contributions.  Larger depreciation provisions are deducted for
tax purposes.
   Annual provisions for depreciation of transportation and
mechanical equipment included in utility plant are computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated service lives.  Such
provisions are charged to clearing accounts and apportioned
therefrom to operating expenses and other accounts in accordance
with the Uniform System of Accounts as prescribed by the PPUC.    
   The Company charges to maintenance expense the cost of
repairs and replacements and renewals of less than units of
property.  Maintenance of transportation equipment is charged to
clearing accounts and apportioned therefrom in a manner similar
to depreciation.  The cost of replacements, renewals and
betterments of units of property is capitalized to the utility
plant accounts.
   Upon normal retirement of depreciable property, the estimated
or actual cost of the asset is credited to the utility plant
account, and such amounts, together with the cost of removal less
salvage, is charged to the reserve for depreciation.  Gains or
losses from abnormal retirements are reflected in income
currently.

Deferred Charges-
   Deferred debt expense is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the related debt.
   Deferred rate case expense is amortized over twenty months as
specified by the PPUC for rate-making purposes.

Revenues-
   Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis
and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the latest
meter reading to the end of the accounting period.

Customers' Advances for Construction-
   Advances are received from customers for construction of
utility plant and are refundable as operating revenues are earned
and any notes receivable have been paid after the completion of
construction (see also Note 7).  After all refunds to which the
customer is entitled are made, any remaining balance is
transferred to contributions in aid of construction.

Contributions in Aid of Construction-
   Contributions in aid of construction include direct
contributions and the portion of customers' advances for
construction which become nonrefundable.  Transfers to other
accounts may not be made without approval of the PPUC.

Income Taxes-
   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS  No. 109).  Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
   The adoption of SFAS No. 109 did not result in a cumulative
effect adjustment to the statement of income for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1993.  Certain adjustments to deferred
income taxes are offset by recording regulatory assets and
liabilities.  These regulatory assets and liabilities will be
settled through the regulatory process.  Adjustments recorded as
a result of SFAS No. 109 do not affect cash.  Accordingly, these
adjustments have no impact on the Company's statements of cash
flows.
   Amounts equivalent to investment tax credits claimed for tax
purposes are deferred in the accounts and are being amortized to
income generally over the life of the related property.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction-
   Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC)
represents the cost of funds used for construction purposes
during the period of construction.  These costs are reflected as
non-cash income during the construction period and as an addition
to the cost of plant constructed.

Statements of Cash Flows-
   For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents except
for those instruments earmarked to fund construction expenditures
or repay long-term debt.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements-
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Net deferred tax liability            $(7,692,064)$(7,904,152)

   No valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994.  In assessing the realizability of
deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized.  The ultimate realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible.  Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment.  Based upon the level of historical taxable income
and the current regulatory environment, management believes it is
more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of
these deductible differences.
   As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109
effective January 1, 1993.  In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for regulated industries, the Company has
recorded offsetting deferred regulatory assets and liabilities
for the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 109.  Consequently,
the adoption of SFAS No. 109 did not result in a cumulative
effect adjustment to the statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 1993.
   During 1994, the Company recorded a gain on sale of land of
$215,417.  Federal and state income taxes relative to the gain
amounted to $90,289.
   During 1993, the Company recorded a gain on sale of land of
$842,002.  Federal and state income taxes relative to the gain
amounted to $354,356.

 In October 1995, the Company issued $4,300,000 of 5%
Industrial Development Authority Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
1995, due 2010.  Proceeds of these Bonds were used to redeem the
outstanding amount of 6.25% Industrial Development Authority
Revenue Refunding Bonds.  These Bonds have mandatory tender dates
of June 1, 2000 and June 1, 2005.
 In March 1994, the Company issued $2,700,000 of 4.75%
Industrial Development Authority Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
1994, due 2009.  Proceeds of these Bonds were used to redeem the
outstanding amount of 7% Industrial Development Authority Revenue
Refunding Bonds, Series 1989.  These bonds have mandatory tender
dates of May 15, 1999 and May 15, 2004.
 The Company maintains lines of credit aggregating $11,000,000. 
Loans granted under these lines as of December 31, 1995 bear
interest based on the prime or LIBOR rate.  Short-term borrowings
amounted to $4,164,000 as of December 31, 1995 and $1,302,000 as
of December 31, 1994.  The weighted average interest rate on
short-term borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1995 and
1994 is 7.58% and 7.33%, respectively.  The Company is not
required to maintain compensating balances on its lines of
credit.
 Long-term debt maturing in the next five years is as follows:
                                 1999  $2,700,000
                                 2000   4,300,000
 The terms of the debenture agreements limit in some cases the
Company's ability to prepay its borrowings and include certain
restrictions with respect to declaration and payment of cash
dividends and acquisition of the Company's stock.  Under the
terms of the most restrictive agreements, cumulative payments for
dividends and acquisition of stock since December 31, 1982 may
not exceed $1,500,000 plus net income since that date.  As of
December 31, 1995, none of the earnings retained in the business
are restricted under these provisions.

5.  Common Stock and Earnings Per Share

 Earnings per share are based upon the weighted average number
of shares outstanding of 632,595 in 1995;  624,823 in 1994; and
616,904 in 1993.
 Under the employee stock purchase plan, all full-time
employees who have been employed at least six consecutive months
may purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll
deductions limited to 10% of gross compensation.  The purchase
price is 95% of the fair market value (as defined).  Ten thousand
shares of common stock have been authorized to be offered under
the plan, of which 7,749 shares have been issued as of December
31, 1995.
 Under the optional dividend reinvestment plan, holders of the
Company's stock may purchase additional shares subject to an
annual maximum of $1,500.  The purchase price is 95% of the fair
market value (as defined).  One hundred and twenty thousand
shares of common stock have been authorized to be offered under
the plan, of which 71,180 shares have been issued as of December
31, 1995.  During 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved
an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock
offered under the plan.

6.  Employee Benefit Plans

 The Company maintains two defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all of its employees.  The benefits are
based upon years of service times the sum of $14.50 for the Union
represented employees and $15.50 for the general and
administrative employees plus 1.5% of final average monthly
earnings in excess of $400.  The Company's funding policy is to
contribute annually the maximum amount permitted by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
 The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and
amounts recognized in the Company's balance sheets as of December
31, 1995 and 1994.  The measurement of assets and obligations of
the plans is as of December 31, 1995 and 1994.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was
6.5% in 1995 and 7% in 1994.  The rate of increase in future
compensation levels was 4%.  The expected long-term rate of
return on assets was 7%.
Beginning in 1994, the Company adopted a savings plan pursuant
to the provisions of section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
This savings plan covers general and administrative employees. 
The plan provides for elective employee contributions of up to
15% of compensation and Company matching contributions of 50% of
the participant's contribution, up to a maximum annual Company
contribution of $500.  Contributions to the plan amounted to
$22,125 in 1995 and $14,062 in 1994.

7.  Notes Receivable

The Company has entered into agreements with municipalities to
extend water service into newly-formed water districts.  The
Company loaned funds to the municipalities to cover the costs
related to the projects.  The municipalities concurrently
advanced these funds to the Company in the form of customers'
advances for construction.  The municipalities are required to
charge application fees and water revenue surcharges (fees) to
customers connected to the system which are remitted to the
Company.   The principal and the related customer advance are
reduced periodically as operating revenues are earned by the
Company from customers connected to the system and refunds of
advances are made.  There is no due date for the notes nor
expiration date for the advances.

In 1994, the Company offset notes receivable in the amount of
$1,395,776 against the related advances for construction based on
its determination that the principal recoverable from noteholders
was less than the recorded amount, and the fact that advances are
not fully refundable to the extent that payments are not received
on the notes.
The Company has recorded interest income of $61,322 in 1995,
$32,628 in 1994 and $172,804 in 1993 on these notes.  
Included in the accompanying balance sheets at December 31, 1995
and 1994 were the following amounts related to these projects.

                                        1995          1994

Notes receivable, including
 interest                                  $   823,969          $   942,624
Customers' advances for
 construction                                2,486,522            2,499,099

8.  Capital Commitments 

 The estimated funds needed for the Company's construction
program for 1996 are $5,457,000.  The Company plans to finance
such expenditures with internally generated funds, customers'
advances, short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of
common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan (stock issued
in lieu of cash dividends) and employee stock purchase plan.

9.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 

 The Company purchases meter interface units under a
noncancellable purchase agreement expiring October 31, 1997. 
Payments relating to this purchase amounted to $53,400 in 1995,
$45,187 in 1994 and $19,034 in 1993.  Such payments will amount
to $46,341 in 1996 and $19,053 in 1997.
 The Company is involved in certain legal and administrative
proceedings before various courts and governmental agencies
concerning rates and other matters.  The Company expects that the
ultimate disposition of these proceedings will not have a
material effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

10. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been
determined based on available market information and appropriate
valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is
necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the
Company might realize in a current market exchange.  The use of
different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may
have a material effect on the estimated fair value.

 The carrying amount of current assets and liabilities that are
considered financial instruments approximates their fair value as
of the dates presented.  The Company's long-term debt, with a
carrying value of $32,000,000 at December 31, 1995, had an
estimated fair value of approximately $35,000.00.
 The Company's customers' advances for construction and notes
receivable have carrying values at December 31, 1995 of
$15,913,616 and $1,046,118, respectively.  The relative fair
values of these amounts cannot be accurately estimated since
future payment streams are dependent upon several factors,
including new customer connections, customer consumption levels
and future rate increases.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The York Water
Company:

  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of The York
Water Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related
statements of income, shareholders' investment, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1995.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of The York Water Company at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
  As discussed in notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993
to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes.

                       THE YORK WATER COMPANY

      UNDERTAKINGS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO REGISTRATION
               STATEMENT FORM S-8 DATED DECEMBER, 1988


The undertaking set forth below is filed for purposes of
incorporation by reference into Part II of the registration
statements on Form S-8, File No. 33.

Item 9.  Undertakings.

     (a)  The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
                          
                          

           Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
           rising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
           Securities Act") may be permitted to
           directors, officers or persons controlling the registrant
           pursuant to the provisions described in this registration
           statement, or otherwise, The York Water Company (the "Company")
           has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such
           indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
           Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.  In the event that
           a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, (other than
           the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a
           director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the
           successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
           by such director, officer or controlling person in connection
           with the securities being registered, the Company will, unless in
           the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
           controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
           jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
           against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will
           be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
