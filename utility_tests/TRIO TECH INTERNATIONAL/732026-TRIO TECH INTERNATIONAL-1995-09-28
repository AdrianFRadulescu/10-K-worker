ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
- - -----------------
General
- - -------
Trio-Tech International (the Company or the Registrant) was incorporated in
California in 1958.  The Company is a designer, producer and marketer of
environmental testing equipment used to test the structural integrity of
semiconductor devices that must meet high-reliability specifications and rate of
turn test equipment for aerospace, geographical, laboratory and other
applications.  In addition, the Company owns and operates facilities where a
broad range of structural and electronic tests are performed for manufacturers
and end-users of merchant and high-reliability semiconductor devices. The
Singapore subsidiary also acts as a distributor for certain test equipment made
by other manufacturers.

In 1976, the Company formed Trio-Tech International Pte Ltd (TTIPte), a wholly
owned subsidiary, and it in turn formed Trio-Tech Test Services Pte Ltd
(TTTSPte), its wholly owned subsidiary.  They autonomously operate in the
Republic of Singapore, for the purpose of selling testing equipment and
providing testing services to integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers located in
Singapore and elsewhere in the Pacific basin.  The Singapore facility benefits
from moderate labor costs, the absence of currency and tariff restrictions, and
the rapid growth of the semiconductor manufacturing industry in Asia and the
Pacific basin, including the expansion of manufacturing activities by American
industries in Singapore and the Pacific Rim.

In August 1984, the Company formed a wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiary,
European Electronic Test Centre (EETC).  In July 1985, EETC commenced operating
a semiconductor testing facility in Dublin, Ireland.  The Company obtained a
grant from the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) of the Republic of Ireland
to provide 30% of actual expenditures for building modifications and fixed
assets up to a maximum of $1,279,000.  Grant monies received from the IDA of
$120,000 may have to be repaid if certain events occur within one year from June
30, 1995.

In 1985, the Company's Singapore subsidiary entered into a joint-venture
agreement with a group of Malaysian investors to operate a testing facility in
Penang, Malaysia.  Under this agreement, the Singapore subsidiary provides the
equipment and management for the Penang facility.  The operations of this entity
are included in the consolidated financial statements.  In July of l990, the
joint venture opened another testing facility in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This
facility is primarily involved in the testing business.  In March 1994, this
facility started a new operation in Batang Kali, Malaysia.  This new operation
is set up primarily to handle sub-contract work on optoelectronic assemblies.

On September 1, 1988, the Company acquired the Rotating Test Equipment Product
Line of Genisco Technology Corporation (Genisco).
On November 1, 1990, Trio-Tech acquired Express Test Corporation then of
Mountain View, California.  The Company paid cash, notes and stock for Express
Test.  Express Test is a manufacturer of pressurized vessels (autoclaves)
designed for humidity stress testing of integrated circuits.  Whereas most of
Trio-Tech's integrated circuit testing devices are for hermetically sealed
ceramic devices, Express Test machines are designed to test plastic sealed
devices.

In October 1992, the Company's Singapore subsidiary formed a wholly owned
subsidiary to provide testing services in Bangkok, Thailand.  The Singapore
subsidiary provides the equipment and management for this new operation.
                                     
In October 1993, the Company's Singapore subsidiary entered into a joint-venture
agreement with a Chinese Company to operate a crude oil chemical processing
business in Wuhan, China.  This new business diversification
<PAGE>
involves a value added production process in which crude oil is chemically
processed, repackaged and distributed to industrial users.  Production in the
facility commenced in August, 1994.

In November 1993, the Company's Singapore subsidiary acquired a 73% equity
interest in Prestal Enterprise Sdn Bhd, an investment holding Company which
owned a 6% indirect share holding in Trio-Tech Malaysia (TTM).  The purpose was
to acquire an additional 5% shareholding in TTM.

The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues derived from product
sales and testing services during the last three fiscal years and the breakdown
of revenues derived from customers in the United States, Southeast Asia and
Europe.  The amounts represented in Product Sales and Service include revenues
derived from the test equipment distribution business in Singapore.  See Note
14, Business Segment, for a more detailed description.

Background Technology
- - ---------------------
Semiconductors are fundamental building blocks used in electronic equipment and
systems.  Integrated circuits (IC) consist of silicon "chips" of semiconductor
material that perform electronic functions, encapsulated in packaging material,
usually plastic or ceramic, having lead wires that connect to a printed circuit
board.  Integrated circuits have become increasingly complex, with greater
capacity, versatility and smaller size.  The protective packaging, whether
ceramic, plastic or some other material, is intended to hold the device in place
and protect it against corrosion, oxidization, shock, handling, temperature and
other problems that can result in the failure of the device.  A minute defect in
the packaging can cause a semiconductor device to fail prematurely.  The
Registrant manufactures test equipment for reliability analysis of both ceramic
and plastic encapsulated integrated devices.Hermetically sealed (normally
ceramic) packaging is required by military,aerospace, telecommunications and 
other commercial users for semiconductor devices that must have high reliability
and long life.  It is also used for hybrid circuits and certain other 
specialized devices, and for semiconductor devices that are produced in smaller
quantities. There have been significant advances in the plastics industry, 
thereby making plastic sealed devices as reliable as ceramic ones.  Plastic is 
the material of choice in the commercial integrated circuit markets, because 
polymers are less expensive and easier to process than ceramic materials.

Many manufacturers and purchasers of high-reliability integrated circuits follow
government-defined reliability standards, including rigorous military standard
specifications.  Military specifications, which are detailed and precise, have
brought about considerable standardization of quality assurance programs in the
semiconductor industry.
<PAGE>
Military and commercial specifications include, among other things,
environmental testing, which is aimed at both detecting defective devices and
accelerating failure in potentially defective ones.  An additional objective of
environmental testing is to determine and to evaluate statistically the ultimate
reliability and integrity of integrated circuits and to predict their
performance and durability under ordinary or adverse conditions.  The devices
are tested before incorporating them into the finished product.  The tests vary
according to the use for which the device is intended but usually include visual
inspection, stabilization bake, thermal shock temperature cycling, mechanical
shock, centrifugal force testing, fine and gross leak testing, burn-in testing
and electrical testing.

Products
- - --------
The Registrant designs and manufactures environmental testing equipment for
testing of ceramic and plastic packaged integrated circuits.  The Registrant's
products are sold both as separate products and as part of an integrated system
for environmental testing.

Centrifuges 
- - -----------
The Registrant manufactures a line of centrifuges that tests the
mechanical integrity of hermetic encased electronic parts.  The Registrant's
centrifuges are used to identify mechanical weaknesses of devices by spinning
them at a specified acceleration, creating a pressure of up to 30,000 g's
(900,000 pounds per square inch).  This pressure will crack or break packages
having certain defects in the hermetic packages.  The Registrant also designs
the fixtures that are inserted into the centrifuge to hold the semiconductors
while they are being tested.

Leak Testers 
- - ------------
he Registrant also manufactures systems for leak detection in
hermetically 
packaged semiconductor devices.  Certain defects may appear in some
tests but not in others, so that thorough testing requires three separate leak
procedures using different equipment.  The Registrant manufactures a range of
equipment and systems designed to detect leaks in hermetic packaging by means of
visual scanning for bubble trails emanating from defective devices and
radioactive detection for ultra fine leaks.

Rate of Turn Tables
- - -------------------
This product line includes centrifuges and rate of turn tables that are used in
applications for aerospace, electronics, instrumentation, environmental
laboratory, medical and geographical fields.  Among the commercial applications
of these centrifuges are gravity simulation testing of components, assemblies
and systems for aerospace, military hardware (accelerometers, devices, fuses,
etc.), biomedical research, geophysical testing, automotive components, fluid
removal from sensitive components, gas removal from liquids and other
large-scale separation requirements.  One prominent example of the product line
is the use of the 1100 Centrifuge at the Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital in
rotational testing of the vestibule of the inner-ear system that causes
dizziness and unsteady eye and body movements when diseased.  Typical rate of
turn table application is gyroscope calibration and testing, angular
accelerometers, turn and bank indicators, inertial platforms and direction
sensing equipment.

Burn-in Equipment and Fixtures
- - ------------------------------
Trio-Tech International, Singapore is a leading burn-in system manufacturer in
the Pacific Rim.  Burn-in equipment is used to subject all types of integrated
circuits to sustained heat while testing them electrically in order to identify
early product failures ("infant mortalities") as well as to assure long-term
reliability.  Burn-in testing approximates, in a compressed time frame, the
electrical and thermal conditions to which the device would be subjected during
its normal life.

The Singapore operation also offers test fixtures for its Cobis burn-in systems
and other brands of burn-in systems.  Burn-in boards are used as fixture devices
for the purpose of electrically exercising test devices during high temperature
environmental stressing.
<PAGE>
Pressurized Humidity Testing Equipment
- - --------------------------------------
The Registrant manufactures a range of pressurized humidity test equipment and
specialized test fixtures which the company continues to market under the name
of Express Test Corporation.  Pressurized humidity test equipment utilizes a
pressurized vessel (autoclave) as the main test chamber in order to force
moisture into the plastic encapsulate and thereby determine the moisture
resistance of the test devices much more rapidly than non pressurized
conventional humidity test systems.  Highly accelerated temperature and humidity
stress test systems offer reliability data for high reliability commercial IC
manufacturers and end-users such as computer, automotive and other commercial
customers.


Temperature Test Equipment
- - --------------------------
The Artic Temperature Test Systems are used to control the temperature of
semiconductor wafers and components to allow testing and characterization at hot
and cold temperatures.  During the past year, the Registrant developed and
released two new products in this product range.  The systems utilize
thermoelectric modules to achieve wide temperature ranges without the need for
special refrigerants and cooling fluids.

Product Development
- - -------------------
Development of the Rate of Turn Tables and large Centrifuges is targeted at new
applications in the automotive industry.  The latest centrifuges and rate tables
combine two technologies which facilitates the acceleration test of devices at
hot and cold temperatures. The Registrant has developed and released a new
electrical test system for electronic components.  This product is being
developed into a product range which will include failure analysis testers and
test systems for electronic modules.

Testing Services
- - ----------------
The Registrant owns and operates facilities that provide testing services for
ceramic and plastic encased semiconductor devices and other electronic
components to meet the requirements of military, aerospace, industrial and
commercial applications.  The Registrant uses its own proprietary equipment for
certain burn-in, centrifugal and leak tests, and commercially available
equipment for the various other environmental tests.  The Registrant conducts
its testing operations at its facilities located in San Fernando, California;
the Republic of Singapore; Dublin, Ireland; Penang and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;
and Bangkok, Thailand.

The testing services are used by manufacturers and purchasers of semiconductors
and other components who either do not have any testing capabilities or whose
in-house screening facilities are not sufficient to test devices to military or
certain commercial specifications.  In addition, the Registrant provides
overflow testing and independent verification for companies that have their own
in-house capabilities.  The laboratories perform a variety of tests, including
stabilization bake, thermal shock, temperature cycling, mechanical shock,
constant acceleration, gross and fine leak tests, electrical testing, static and
dynamic burn-in tests, and vibration testing.  The laboratories also perform
qualification testing, consisting of intense tests conducted on small samples of
output from manufacturers who must obtain periodic qualification under the terms
of their contracts.  The Registrant delivers written certification to customers
reporting on the test results.

Distribution Activities
- - -----------------------
The Company's Singapore subsidiary continues to develop its international
distribution division.  This is in addition to its manufacturing and testing
business.  This distribution business purchases products from European and
Pacific Rim manufacturers for resale.  Specifically, Heraeus-Votsch of West
Germany has been utilizing Trio-Tech International Pte. Ltd. in Singapore as a
distributor of its products for nearly seven years.  The Singapore subsidiary
also represents several Japanese and American manufacturers.  This segment of
Singapore's business
<PAGE>
continues to grow.  It affords Trio-Tech additional sales penetration
opportunities in the Pacific Rim for the remainder of the Trio-Tech product
line.

Marketing, Distribution and Service
- - -----------------------------------
The Company markets its products and services worldwide, both directly and
through independent sales representatives.  There are approximately 13 of these
representatives that operate within the United States and 10 in various foreign
countries.  The Company's marketing efforts in the United States and Europe are
coordinated from its headquarters in San Fernando, and its Far East marketing
efforts are assisted by its subsidiary in Singapore.  Its European marketing is
assigned to its subsidiary in Ireland.  The Registrant advertises in trade
journals and participates in trade shows.

The Company's products and services are purchased by independent testing
laboratories and by users and manufacturers of high-reliability semiconductor
devices, including Hyundai, TRW Teledyne, Allied Signal, AMD, Motorola, National
Semiconductor, SGS Thomson and Texas Instruments.  During the year ended June
30, 1995, the Company had sales of $3,000,000 and $2,431,000 to two different
customers.  One customer was responsible for more than 10% of the Company's
consolidated sales for fiscal year 1994.

                                     ==========      ==========

</TABLE>

Based upon past experience, the Company does not anticipate any significant
cancellations. The purchase orders for equipment call for delivery within the
next 12 months. The testing services backlog is scheduled to be performed within
the next year.  The Company does not anticipate any difficulties in meeting the
above delivery schedule.

Manufacturing and Supply
- - ------------------------
The Registrant's products are designed by its engineers and are assembled and
tested at its facilities in San Fernando, California, the Republic of Singapore
and the Republic of Ireland.  All parts and certain components are purchased
from outside sources for assembly by the Company.
The Registrant uses Fluorinert, a special indicator fluid sold by the 3M
Company, in its gross leak equipment, and Krypton 85, sold by Amersham, in its
Tracer-Flo.  The Registrant has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining
Fluorinert or Krypton 85 to date.  There can be no assurance that the Registrant
will not experience difficulties or delays in obtaining Fluorinert or Krypton 85
in the future.

Competition
- - -----------
Management believes that the Registrant is one of the leading manufacturers in
the specific areas of fine leak and gross leak testers for ceramic and plastic
packaged semiconductor devices and constant acceleration centrifuges used for
structural testing of such devices.  Because of the importance of testing as
part of the manufacturing process for high-reliability semiconductor devices,
management believes that the quality, accuracy and reputation of its products
and services, and to a lesser extent price, are the bases of competition in the
product and service areas
<PAGE>
served by the Company.  In order for the Company to remain competitive, it must
have the  ability to adapt to rapid technological change and to develop new and
improved products.

There are numerous testing laboratories in the areas in which the Registrant
operates that perform a range of testing services similar to those offered by
the Registrant.  Since the Registrant has sold and will continue to sell its
leak testing systems and centrifuges to competing laboratories, the Registrant's
competitors can offer the same capabilities in testing.  The Registrant also
sells its products and systems to semiconductor manufacturers and
users who might otherwise have used outside testing laboratories, including the
Registrant, to perform environmental testing.  Reputation for dependable testing
and prompt performance, to a greater extent than price, appear to be the primary
bases of competition among testing laboratories.  The existence of competing
laboratories and the purchase of testing equipment by manufacturers and users
are potential threats to the Company's future revenues and earnings from
testing.


Patents
- - -------
The Registrant holds a U.S. Patent granted in 1987 in relation to its
pressurization humidity testing equipment.  The Registrant also holds a U.S.
Patent granted in 1994 on certain aspects of its Artic Temperature Test Systems.
In addition the Registrant has recently filed a new Patent application for
certain aspects of its new Artic Temperature Test products.

Government Regulation
- - ---------------------
The Tracer-Flo process uses Krypton 85, an inert radioactive gas, the supply and
handling of which are subject to regulation by the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the California Department of Health Physics.
The Company must, therefore, train the Tracer-Flo operators, which are licensed
by the State of California, and must maintain records and control its supplies
of Krypton 85.  The California agency conducts periodic site inspections, and
the NRC monitors interstate shipments and can inspect the Company's shipping
records.  No security clearance is required to handle the gas, which has a low
level of radioactivity.

Employees
- - ---------
As of June 30, 1995, the Company had 33 employees in the United States, 179 in
Singapore, 260 in Malaysia, 73 in Bangkok and 8 in Ireland.  Of the employees in
the United States, 8 were engaged primarily in engineering and services, 17 in
manufacturing or testing, 3 in sales, and 5 in general and administrative
positions.  None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union.
However, in Dublin, Ireland, the Union Agreement is still in place without any
members. Management considers its employee relations to be good.

ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- - -----------------
On August 24, 1995, the Company was served in a civil action brought by HM
Holdings, Inc. against 106 defendants, including the Company.  HM has paid
$3,750,000 to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to settle a proceeding
alleging that HM's predecessor company caused soil and groundwater contamination
of the North Hollywood (California) Superfund Site and may have additional
liabilities.  HM alleges that the 106 defendants caused or contributed to the
contamination.  This suit may arise in part out of a related suit by Lockheed
Martin Corporation against HM and other defendants, possibly including Trio-Tech
(which has not been served in this related suit), involving the nearby Burbank
Superfund Site, which HM is seeking to settle and to assign its claim against
the 106 defendants to Lockheed Martin.  Trio-Tech vacated its Burbank location
in 1987.  Trio-tech and its counsel have not yet had the opportunity to
investigate the allegations.  Management, based on its present information,
believes that the outcome of this litigation will not materially affect the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

There are no material proceedings to which any director, officer or affiliate of
the Registrant, any beneficial owner of more than five percent of the
                                    
Registrant's common stock or any associate of such person is a party that is
adverse to the Registrant or its properties.

The Registrant's common stock is held by approximately 347 shareholders of
record as of August 21, 1995.  174,500 shares are held by Cede and Co., a
clearinghouse that holds stock certificates in "street" name for an unknown
number of shareholders.

The Company has not declared any cash dividends on its common stock.  It is
anticipated that no dividends will be paid to holders of common stock in the
foreseeable future.  Any future determinations as to cash dividends will depend
upon the earnings and financial position of the Company at that time and such
other factors as the Board of Directors may deem appropriate.

Sales increased $4,323,000 or 28.5% to $19,488,000 in 1995 from $15,165,000 in
1994 as a result of improved operations in each of the business segments.  Sales
for the Far East operations increased $3,249,000  (26.1%) due primarily to
improved operations in Malaysia as the volume of testing services in that region
increased.  Additionally, there was an increase in manufacturing revenues in the
Far East as a result of the sale of additional systems during 1995.  The U.S.
operations sales increased $710,000 (34.4%) due to increased sales volume in the
manufacturing segment.  Sales for Ireland improved $364,000 (55.6%) as a result
of increases in the volume of testing services performed in the current year.

Cost of sales increased $2,783,000 or 27.9% from $9,961,000 in 1994 to
$12,744,000 in 1995.  However,  cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained
relatively stable and actually decreased from 65.7% in 1994 to 65.4% in 1995 as
a result of continued cost cutting efforts.
                                    
Operating expenses increased $1,197,000 (29.9%) to $5,197,000 in 1995.  As
percentage of sales, operating expenses were almost the same at 26.7% in 1995 as
compared to 26.4% in 1994.

Interest expense decreased $331,000 in 1995 as compared to 1994 due to the
significant reduction in average outstanding debt balances during the current
year.  During 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with its previous
lender which resulted in reduced bank borrowings.

Other income increased $284,000 primarily due to currency exchange losses
experienced in 1994 which did not reoccur in 1995.

Income taxes increased $207,000 as a direct result of the increase in operations
experienced in the current year.  The effective tax rate in 1995 was 26% which
approximates the foreign income tax rate for the Far East operations.  The U.S.
operations have net operating losses which are used to offset any income taxes
associated with their taxable income.
<PAGE>
Year Ended June 24, 1994 ("1994") Compared to Year Ended June 25, 1993 ("1993")
- - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net sales decreased by approximately $557,000 or 4% in fiscal 1994 compared to
1993.  The decrease was primarily due to a $940,000 reduction in sales from the
U.S. operations due to continued economic problems in the U.S. semiconductor
industry.  This was partially offset by a $392,000 increase in sales from the
Far East operations.  Ireland's sales remained relatively constant during fiscal
year 1994.

Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 65.7% in fiscal 1994
compared to 67.6% in fiscal 1993.  This decrease was due to increased sales in
the distribution segment which experiences higher margins than manufacturing or
testing.  Additionally, the Company continues its efforts to reduce
manufacturing and overhead costs.

Operating expenses decreased approximately $159,000 or 4% and remained
relatively constant as a percentage of sales.

Income before income taxes and extraordinary item as a percentage of sales
increased to 4.1% in fiscal 1994 compared to 3.6% in fiscal 1993.  The increase
resulted from improved gross margins in the current year which were partially
offset by a $109,000 write-off of an investment.

Extraordinary income of $1,751,000 was recognized by the Company in fiscal 1994
as a result of the extinguishment of a significant portion of its bank debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- - -------------------------------
The Company's working capital improved significantly from $511,000 as of June
24, 1994 to $1,689,000 as of June 30, 1995.  The improvement in working capital
is attributable to the significant increase in sales and profitability during
fiscal year 1995.

The Company has a secured credit agreement with Standard Charter Bank which
provides for a total line of credit of approximately $655,000 which can be used
to finance the company's Far East operations.  Borrowings under the line were
$219,000 as of June 30, 1995 and bear interest at the bank's prime rate (7% at
June 30, 1995) plus 3%.  In addition, the Company's subsidiary, TTM, has a line
of credit which provides for borrowings of approximately $234,000.  At June 30,

                                   
1995, there were no borrowings outstanding.  Interest on the line is at the
bank's reference rate plus 2%.  The company currently has no financing
arrangements to fund operations outside of the Far East region.

Most of the capital expenditures incurred during fiscal 1995 were used to update
and expand the variety of testing services required by the customer base in the
Far East.

Management believes that the Company's operations will be able to be funded over
the next twelve months through operations, existing working capital and its
available lines of credit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Board of Directors
Trio-Tech International
San Fernando, California:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trio-Tech
International and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and June 24, 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1995.  Our audits also

                                    
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14.  These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Trio-Tech
International and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and June 24, 1994, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

TRIO-TECH INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 1995, JUNE 24, 1994 AND JUNE 25, 1993
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Principles of Consolidation - Trio-Tech International (the "Company" or
    "TTI") is a designer and manufacturer of equipment used to test the
    structural integrity of semiconductor devices that must meet
    high-reliability specifications.  The Company also owns and operates testing
    facilities that perform structural and electronic testing of semiconductor
    devices and acts as a distributor of electronic testing equipment in
    Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of the Company and its principal
    subsidiaries: Trio-Tech International Pte Ltd (TTI Pte), Trio-Tech Test
    Services Pte Ltd (TTTS Pte), Express Test, European Electronic Test Centre
    (EETC), Trio-Tech Bangkok (TTBkk), Trio-Tech Malaysia (TTM) (a 55%-owned
    joint venture of Trio-Tech International Pte. Ltd) and Prestal Enterprise
    Sdn Bhd (PESB) (a 73% owned subsidiary of Trio-Tech International Pte Ltd).
    In 1994, the Company entered into a joint venture in the Peoples Republic of
    China.  The amount of this investment was minimal at June 30, 1995.  All
    material intercompany transactions, profits and balances have been
    eliminated.

    Accounting Period -  The Company's fiscal reporting period coincides with
    the 52-53 week period ending on the last Friday in June.
                                    
    Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the
    first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or market.

    Property, Equipment and Capitalized Leases - Property, equipment and
    capitalized leases are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization.  Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, whichever is shorter,
    using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range from 3 to 45
    years. Capital grants from the Industrial Development Authority in Ireland
    are accounted for when claimed by reducing the cost of the related assets.
    The grants are amortized over the depreciable lives of those assets.

    Foreign Currency Translation - All assets and liabilities of operations
    outside the United States have been translated at the foreign exchange rates
    in effect at year-end.  Revenues and expenses for the year are translated at
    average exchange rates in effect during the year.  Unrealized translation
    gains and losses are not included in determining net income but are
    accumulated and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
    Net realized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
    are credited or charged to income.

    Other Assets - The excess of cost over net assets acquired is included in
    other assets and is being amortized over 5-10 years.  The Company reviews
    the carrying value of all intangible assets on a regular basis, and if
    future cash flows are believed insufficient to recover the remaining
    carrying value of an intangible asset, the carrying value is written down in
    the period the impairment is identified to its future recoverable value.

    Taxes on Income - The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, " Accounting for
    Income Taxes."  This Statement requires an asset and liability approach to

                                    
    financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.  Deferred taxes and
    liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial
    statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in
    taxable or deductible amounts in the future.  Such deferred income tax asset
    and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates
    applicable to periods in which the differences are
<PAGE>
    expected to affect taxable income.  Valuation allowances are established
    when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
    realized.

    Research and Development Costs -The Company incurred research and
    development costs of $51,000 in 1995, $71,000 in 1994 and $9,000 in 1993,
    which were charged to cost of sales as incurred.

    Income per Share - Income per share is based upon the weighted average
    number of shares outstanding and common stock equivalents (consisting of
    stock options), excluding those common stock equivalents which would be
    anti-dilutive.

    Reclassification - Certain reclassifications have been made to the previous
    year's financial statements to conform to current year presentation.

The Company files income tax returns in several countries. Income in one
country is not offset by losses inanother country. Accordingly, no benefit is
provided for losses in countries except where the loss can be carried back
against income recognized in previous years. Income taxes are provided in
those countries where income is earned. The effect of providing tax against
profits while not providing benefit for losses results in an effective tax
rate which differs from the federal statutory rate.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences in the recognition of
certain revenues and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes.  The
components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

    106 defendants alleging that they may have caused or contributed to soil and
    groundwater contamination that required the plaintiff to pay $3,750,000 to
    the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to settle.  The Company has not
    yet had the opportunity to investigate the allegations.    In the opinion of
    management, based on its present information, this matter should not have a

    of operations.
