                              PART I

1.  BUSINESS.
    ---------

     (a) General Development of Business.  Since its inception in 1955, Twenty
         --------------------------------                                     
Services, Inc. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Registrant" or
"Company"), has been engaged principally in the general finance business,
including the purchase and sale of real estate.  In October 1980, the
stockholders of the Registrant authorized the Board of Directors to redeploy the
Registrant's assets and reinvest the proceeds derived from such redeployment in
a business other than the general finance business.  During 1982 and 1983, the
Company and an affiliate of Twenty Services Holding, Inc. ("Holding"), the owner
of approximately 54% of the Registrant's outstanding common stock, acquired an
interest in the common stock of The Statesman Group, Inc., an insurance holding
company based in Des Moines, Iowa ("Statesman").  The investment in Statesman
was sold in 1994. The Registrant has invested the proceeds in equities and fixed
income securities that offer attractive returns commensurate with the risk
assumed.  In 1995, the Company acquired an interest in the common stock of
American Equity Investment Life Holding Company, an insurance holding company
based in Des Moines, Iowa ("American Equity").  As of the date of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K the Registrant owns 790,000 shares of common stock of
American Equity.

     Depending upon the financial condition of the Registrant, the opportunities
available to the Registrant and other matters, the Registrant may acquire
majority interests in, and thereafter direct the operations of, other
corporations or business entities engaged in one or more active businesses.  The
Registrant will continue to engage in certain aspects of the general finance
business, including extending credit to certain persons and collecting its loan
receivables.  As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Registrant
does not believe that the composition of its investments and the nature of its
business activities render it subject to the Investment Act of 1940, and the
Board of Directors of the Registrant intend that any future acquisitions by
and/or business activities of the Registrant will be structured in a manner so
that the Registrant will not become subject to the Investment Company Act of
1940.

     (b)  Financial Information Regarding Industry Segments.
          --------------------------------------------------

     The Registrant is not required to supply information respecting industry
segments.  However, for certain information respecting the general finance and
other business activities of the Registrant, see the Financial Statements of
Twenty Services, Inc., including the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere
herein.
<PAGE>
 
     (c) Narrative Description of Business.
         ----------------------------------

     General Finance Business.  As stated above, the Registrant historically has
     -------------------------                                                  
engaged in the general finance business which has consisted of (i) extending
credit to finance various real estate projects, including the purchase of
single-family dwellings and commercial real estate, and to finance home
improvements (the "Real Estate Loans"), and (ii) extending credit for business
and miscellaneous purposes (the "Business and Miscellaneous Loans").

     Loan Portfolio.  The following tabulation sets forth the outstanding
     ---------------                                                     
balances of the Registrant's loan portfolio as of December 31 of each year
indicated below (including, if appropriate, unearned interest), classified
according to the types of loans comprising the Registrant's loan portfolio:

Type of Loans       1995       1994    1993      1992        1991
- -------------       ----       ----    ----      ----        ----

Real Estate       $193,429  $198,854 $205,820  $241,045    $3l4,954

Business and
Miscellaneous      213,396   148,640  123,647   133,347     l30,240
                   -------   -------  -------   -------     -------
Total:            $406,825  $347,494 $329,467  $374,292    $445,93l

As of December 3l, 1995, the duration of the Real Estate Loans  ranged from 3 to
251 months, with such loans having an average duration of 166 months, and the
per annum interest rate of such loans ranged from 7.5% to l2.5% and the duration
of the Business and Miscellaneous Loans ranged from 3 to 36 months, with such
loans having an average duration of 3 months, and the per annum interest rate of
such loans ranged from 7% to 12%.

Of the Registrant's aggregate loan portfolio as of December 31, 1995,
approximately 89% was secured by various types of collateral, approximately 48%
was secured by mortgages on real estate and approximately 11% was unsecured.

Allowance For Loan Losses and Delinquent Loans Receivable.
- ----------------------------------------------------------

The Registrant maintains an allowance or reserve for loan losses which is an
amount reflecting, in management's judgment, the maximum amount of outstanding
loans that ultimately may be charged off.  Upon determining that a loan, or a
portion thereof, is uncollectible the Registrant charges its allowance or
reserve for loan losses in the amount deemed uncollectible by the Registrant.

As of December 31, 1995, approximately 17% of the dollar amount of the
Registrant's total loan portfolio, including accrued interest, was delinquent by
thirty (30) days or more with respect to one or more payments as compared to
comparable delinquencies of approximately 8% of the dollar amount of the
Registrant's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 1994.  Of the Registrant's
delinquent loans as of December 31, 1995, loans representing
<PAGE>
 
approximately $68,000 were delinquent by more than ninety (90) days. At December
31, 1995, the largest principal amount owed by a single debt or related
borrower, which was deemed to be delinquent, was $35,000.  However, the
foregoing figures reflect the fact that the entire amount of a loan is
classified as delinquent if any portion of the scheduled payments are past due.
At December 31, 1995, two (2) loans was deemed delinquent.  These loans are
first mortgage loans.  The Registrant believes that each loan deemed delinquent
is adequately secured.

During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Registrant did not charge off a
loan receivable and recovered $156 in cash for loans previously charged off.  At
December 31, 1995, the Registrant's allowance for loan losses with respect to
its loan portfolio was $27,293.

     The following tabulation sets forth for each of the years indicated certain
information regarding charges to the Registrant's allowance or reserve for loan
losses and the salvage value of the collateral or other assets received during
each of such years with respect to loans previously charged off:

            Interest Income.   The following tabulation sets forth certain
            ----------------                                              
information respecting the Registrant's net interest income for each of the
years indicated:

                         1995      1994    1993
                       --------  -------  -------
Interest Income (l)    $l29,953  $59,532  $55,043

Net Interest Income    $129,953  $59,532  $55,043

(l)  Includes income of $105,757, $39,24l, and $28,423, during 1995, 1994 and
1993 respectively, derived from sources other than the Registrant's loans
receivable.

     The Registrant utilizes the interest (actuarial) method in recognizing
income attributable to interest charges.  Accrual of interest income on finance
receivables is suspended when a loan is contractually delinquent for 90 days or
more and resumed when the loan becomes contractually current.
<PAGE>
 
      Other Business Activities.  As described above, the Registrant's
      --------------------------                                      
stockholders have authorized the Registrant to redeploy the Registrant's assets
by conversion of such assets into cash and the reinvestment of the proceeds
thereof in other business entities.  The Registrant intends to invest in
equities and fixed income securities that offer attractive returns commensurate
with the risk assumed. In December 1995, the Company acquired a 19.75% interest
in a newly formed insurance holding company, American Equity Investment Life
Holding Company.  The Des Moines, Iowa based company is majority owned by the
Chairman of the Board of the Registrant. American Equity acquired a block of
individual and group insurance policies in 1995 and 1996.

     Depending upon the financial position of the Registrant, the opportunities
available to the Registrant and other matters, the Registrant may acquire
majority-owned or controlling interests of one (l) or more other corporations or
business entities engaged in one (l) or more active businesses.  In the opinion
of the Registrant, the Registrant's composition of assets and business
activities do not subject the Registrant as of the date of this annual report on
Form 10-K to the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Board of Directors of
the Registrant intends that future acquisitions and/or future business
activities of the Registrant will be structured in such manner so that
Registrant will not be subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940.  As in the
past, the Registrant will continue to engage in certain aspects of general
finance business, including extending credit to certain persons and collecting
its loans receivable.

     Competition.  With respect to the general finance business, the Registrant
     ------------                                                              
is in direct competition with banks and other finance companies located within
and without the State of Alabama.  Many of these firms are substantially larger
than the Registrant, have more capital available for lending activities, pursue
more actively new loan activity and enjoy a distinct competitive advantage over
the Registrant.

     Employees.  During 1995 and 1994, the Registrant employed two (2) persons
     ----------                                                               
to fill two (2) positions; one (l) of such positions was an executive position,
and one (l) of such positions was a clerical/administrative position.

     At March l5, 1996, the Registrant employed two (2) persons to fill two (2)
positions; one (l) of such positions was an executive position and one (l) of
such positions was a clerical/administrative position.

     The Registrant considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
<PAGE>
 
     Certain Government Regulations.  The Registrant is subject to federal and
     -------------------------------                                          
state regulations relating to consumer credit financing and is subject to
periodic examinations by officials of the State of Alabama charged with the
responsibility of enforcing such regulations.  The last examination of the
Registrant by officials of the State of Alabama occurred on October 16, 1995. As
a result of such examination, the Registrant was found to be in compliance with
the regulations described above, and the Board of Directors of the Registrant
believes that the Registrant presently is in compliance with such regulations.
No material monetary claim has been made by any borrower against the Registrant
respecting failure to comply with such regulations.

     The Registrant is not subject in any material way to regulations relating
to the discharge of materials into the environment.

     Other Matters.  The Registrant's business is not seasonal.
     --------------                                            

     No material portion of the contracts or subcontracts of the Registrant is
subject to renegotiation by the United States Government.

     The business of the Registrant is not dependent upon any raw materials, and
as of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Registrant does not own
any material patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession.  During the
last two (2) years, the Registrant has not spent any money on research and
development activities.

     Due to the nature of its business, the Registrant does not have backlogs of
orders believed to be firm.  In addition, except as described in Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the
Registrant does not follow any specified practice with respect to working
capital.

     The Registrant is not dependent upon a single customer or related customers
or a very few customers, the loss of any one (l) or more of which would have a
materially adverse effect upon its business.

     Financial Information Regarding Foreign and Domestic
     ----------------------------------------------------
Operations and Export Sales.  Substantially all of the Registrant's business
- ----------------------------                                                
activities have been conducted within the southeastern portion of the United
States.

2.  PROPERTIES.
    -----------

     The Registrant maintains its principal executive office in an office
facility located in Birmingham, Alabama, which it leases on a month-to-month
basis and for which it pays aggregate annual rentals of $7,200.  The Registrant
believes its office facilities are adequate for its present needs.
<PAGE>
 
     The Registrant also owns approximately one (l) acre of undeveloped real
estate, and one parcel of residential property, obtained in 1989 as a result of
foreclosure.

3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
    ------------------

     As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Registrant is not a
party of any legal proceedings, other than routine collection matters arising in
the ordinary course of the Registrant's business.

4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
    ----------------------------------------------------

     During the quarter ended December 31, 1995, no matter was submitted to a
vote of the security holders of the Registrant.
<PAGE>
 
                              PART II

5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED SECURITY
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     HOLDER MATTERS.
     ---------------

     (a)  Market Information.  No broker or dealer makes an active market in the
          ------------------                                                    
shares of Common Stock or the Series A-Preferred Stock of the Registrant,
although the Common Stock is quoted from time to time in certain interdealer
quotations by brokers.  Except for such transactions and sales in privately
negotiated transactions among stockholders, there is no established trading
market for the Common Stock or the Series A-Preferred Stock of the Registrant.

     (b)  Holder of Records.  As of December 31, 1995 there were 2,003 holders
          ------------------                                                  
of record of the outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant, and 1,109 holders
of record of the outstanding Series A-Preferred Stock of the Registrant.

     (c)  Dividends.  During the past two (2) years, no dividends have been paid
          ---------                                                             
respecting the shares of Common Stock of the Registrant.  Under Alabama law,
cash dividends may be paid only out of earned surplus (or retained earnings) of
the Registrant, except that dividends respecting securities entitled to
preferential treatment in the payment of dividends may be paid out of capital
surplus of the Registrant.  As of December 31, 1995, the Registrant reflected
earned surplus of $l,262,545 and reflected capital surplus of $l,716,074.

     As of December 3l, 1995, the Registrant has issued and outstanding 505,ll0
shares of Series A-Preferred Stock, consisting of four (4) series of such
Preferred Stock issued in 1980, 198l, 1982 and 1985.  The holders of the Series
A-Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends at the rate of $.07 per
share per annum before any dividend may be declared or paid respecting the
shares of Common Stock of the Registrant.  During 1995 and 1994, the Registrant
paid a dividend of $.07 per share respecting the outstanding Series A-Preferred
Stock.

     The Registrant intends, to the extent that future earnings and its capital
surplus permit, to pay dividends respecting the shares of Series A-Preferred
Stock.  The Registrant believes it is unlikely that dividends will be paid in
the future respecting the shares of Common Stock of the Company, although such
payment will depend upon the future earnings and business prospects of the
Registrant.

7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
    -----------------------------------------------------------
     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
     --------------------------

     Liquidity and Capital Resources.  During 1995, the Registrant's liquidity
     --------------------------------                                         
decreased, primarily as a result of the purchase of securities.  The Company has
no notes payable nor long term debt and does not anticipate the need for
borrowing in the near future.  The Registrant has sufficient cash and temporary
cash investments to meet its short term liquidity needs.  Should long term
liquidity needs exceed cash and temporary cash investments, then the Registrant
would dispose of marketable securities as it deems appropriate.  Current trends
and known demands and commitments do not create a need for liquidity in excess
of the Company's current abilities to generate liquidity.

     The Company anticipates that its operating activities will continue to use
net cash flows, that its investing activities will continue to generate positive
net cash flows and that its financing activities will continue to use cash
flows.

     During 1995, the Registrant concentrated upon (i) collecting its loans,
including those considered in determining the allowance for loan losses and (ii)
the selective extension of credit to customers and investment of excess cash at
rates commensurate with risk assumed.  In addition, the Registrant selected
investments based on maximizing its return on those investments commensurate
with the risk assumed.

 
     Results of Operations.  The Registrant reported net income of $70,513 in
     ----------------------                                                  
1995 as compared to net income of $1,777,220 in 1994.  The decrease was
primarily due to a gain on the sale of marketable securities net of taxes of
approximately $1,796,000 in 1994.

     General and administrative expenses increased from $120,315 in 1994 to
$163,900 in 1995 due primarily to increased professional services and cost of
servicing and reporting to stockholders of approximately $36,000. Depreciation
expense declined approximately $17,000 as the result of the termination of
certain equipment leases.

     During 1993, the Registrant reflected a loss of $26,l37, as compared to a
loss of $75,903 during 1992.  The decrease is due primarily to 1993 including a
gain on sale of property of $ll,295 and a reduction in cost of professional
services of approximately $22,000.

     During 1993, the Registrant's general and administrative expenses amounted
to $ll3,979 as compared to $l35,893 during 1992.  The decrease resulted
primarily from decreased costs for professional services.
<PAGE>
 
     Impact of Inflation.  Inflation has an impact upon the Registrant's
     --------------------                                               
financial position.  Inflationary pressures generally increase the cost of
borrowed funds to the Registrant, rendering it less economic for the Registrant
to borrow money for re-lending purposes.

8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
    --------------------------------------------

     The financial statements of the Registrant are set forth at page F-3
through F-13 hereof and are incorporated herein by reference.


9.  DISAGREEMENTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
    -----------------------------------------------------

     There has been no disagreement between the Registrant and its independent
certified public accountants respecting any matter
of disclosure, during the past twenty-four (24) months.

                          Independent Auditors' Report
                          ----------------------------

The Shareholders and
 the Board of Directors
Twenty Services, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Twenty Services, Inc. (the Company) and subsidiary at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, listed in the index on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.  These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Twenty Services,
Inc. and subsidiary at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be
included therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1994, the Company changed its method of accounting for investments in
debt and equity securities.

              For the Years Ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993


Note 1 - Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
- ---------------------------                                                     
include the accounts of Twenty Services, Inc. (the Company) and its wholly-owned
subsidiary TSI Development Corporation.  All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Income Recognition - Interest income from finance receivables is recognized
- ------------------                                                         
using the interest (actuarial) method.  Accrual of interest income on finance
receivables is suspended when a loan is contractually delinquent for 90 days or
more and resumed when the loan becomes contractually current.

Credit Losses - Provisions for credit losses are charged to income in amounts
- -------------                                                                
sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover the
losses of principal and interest in the existing portfolio.  The Company's
charge-off policy is based on a loan-by-loan review for all receivables which
are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible.

Cash Equivalents - Holdings of highly liquid investments with original
- ----------------                                                      
maturities of three months or less and investments in money market funds are
considered to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities - On January 1, 1994, the Company adopted the provisions
- ---------------------                                                         
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".  In accordance with the Statement,
prior period financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change
in accounting principle.  The cumulative effect as of January 1, 1994, of
adopting Statement 115 was an increase in stockholders' equity of $1,326,325
(net of $615,000 in deferred income taxes) to reflect the net unrealized gain on
securities classified as available-for-sale that were previously carried at the
lower of amortized cost or market.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

For the Years Ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1 - Accounting Policies (Continued)

Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt
and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination
at each balance sheet date.  The Company's securities are classified in two
categories and accounted for as follows:

 .  Securities Held-to-Maturity. Bonds, notes, certain preferred stocks and other
   ---------------------------
   debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to
   hold to maturity are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums
   and accretion of discounts which are recognized in interest income using
   methods which approximate level yields over the period to maturity.

 .  Securities Available-for-Sale. Bonds, notes and certain preferred stocks not
   -----------------------------
   classified as held-to-maturity and common stocks are reported at fair value.

Declines in the fair value of individual held-to-maturity and available-for-sale
securities below their cost that are other than temporary, result in write-downs
of the individual securities to their fair value.  The write-downs are included
in earnings as realized losses.

Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, on securities
available-for-sale are reported as a net amount in a separate component of
stockholders' equity until realized.

Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities available-for-sale are
determined using the specific-identification method.

Property Held For Sale - Property held for sale is stated at the lower of its
- ----------------------                                                       
depreciated cost or net realizable value.

Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
- ----------------------                                                          
for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and additions and
improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized.
Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in operations.

Depreciation is provided primarily by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets, which range from 3 to 10
years.

differences between financial statement and tax reporting.

Earnings Per Common Share - Earnings per common share are determined by dividing
- -------------------------                                                       
net income (loss), after giving effect to preferred stock dividends, by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  The
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each of the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was 1,283,068.
