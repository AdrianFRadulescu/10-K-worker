                                        PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

               Union Camp Corporation is a Virginia corporation resulting from a
merger  in 1956 of  Union  Bag and  Paper  Corporation  and  Camp  Manufacturing
Company,  Incorporated.  Predecessor  businesses  were started in 1861 and 1887,
respectively.  As used in this Report,  the terms "Union Camp" and the "Company"
mean Union Camp  Corporation and its subsidiaries  unless the context  otherwise
requires.

               Union Camp's principal  business segments are the manufacture and
sale of paper and  paperboard,  packaging  products  and wood  products  and the
production and sale of chemicals, including flavors and fragrances.  Information
about developments  during 1995 relating to Union Camp's business appears in the
following  portions of the Union Camp 1995 Annual Report and is  incorporated by
reference  in this Item 1: the text under the  captions  "Investing  in Business
Profitability"  and "Acquisitions" on pages 13, 14 and 15 excluding the captions
describing the  photographs on pages 14 and 15; the text under the caption "Fine
Paper" on page 16 other than the caption describing the photograph on that page;
the text  under the  caption  "Packaging  Group" on page 17 other  than the last
paragraph  under the  subheading  "Strategies"  and the caption  describing  the
photograph on that page; the text under the caption  "Chemical Group" on page 18
other than the last paragraph under the subheading  "Strategies" and the caption
describing the  photograph on that page; and the text under the caption  "Forest
Resources Group" on page 19 other than the caption  describing the photograph on
that page.  Information  about the  Company's  research  and  development  costs
appears under the caption "Research and Development Costs" in Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  on page 32 of the Union  Camp  1995  Annual
Report and is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.

               Revenue,  operating  profits  and  other  financial  data for the
principal business segments and for the foreign and domestic  operations and the
dollar  amounts of export  sales of Union Camp for the years ended  December 31,
1995,  1994  and 1993  appear  in Note 15 of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements




                                       1

<PAGE>

on page 38 of the  Union  Camp  1995  Annual  Report  and  are  incorporated  by
reference  in this Item 1. The  international  operations  of Union Camp and its
subsidiaries  are  subject  to the  risks of doing  business  abroad,  including
currency  fluctuations,  foreign government  regulation and changes in political
environments.

               During 1995, Union Camp's consolidated sales and operating profit
were generated primarily by domestic operations.

Paper and Paperboard

               Union  Camp's Fine Paper  Division  produces  bleached  paper and
paperboard and its Kraft Paper and Board Division produces  unbleached paper and
paperboard. Those products are its largest contributors to profits. Union Camp's
total  production of bleached and  unbleached  paper and  paperboard in 1995 was
approximately  3,558,000  tons,  of which about 59% was  unbleached  and 41% was
bleached.

               The Company operates four large paper mills at Savannah, Georgia,
Prattville,  Alabama, Franklin,  Virginia and Eastover, South Carolina. They are
fully  integrated in that all pulp required to support  paper  manufacturing  is
produced at the mill sites.  Combined  operating  capacity  is  estimated  to be
approximately 3.7 million tons in 1996.

               The Savannah,  Georgia mill produces  unbleached kraft linerboard
and paper,  including  saturating  kraft,  a specialized  paper which is used by
others as a backing material for decorative and industrial laminates. Unbleached
kraft  paper  is  used  primarily  in the  manufacture  of  multiwall  bags  and
unbleached  kraft  linerboard is used primarily in the manufacture of corrugated
shipping containers (see the next section entitled "Packaging Products").  There
are six operational machines at the Savannah mill.

               The two paper  machines  at the  Prattville,  Alabama  unbleached
kraft mill produce kraft linerboard.

               In 1995, the Company  converted about 62% of its unbleached kraft
linerboard and paper production into packaging products and sold essentially all
of the rest to others for conversion into similar products.

                                       2

               The Franklin, Virginia mill produces uncoated free sheet which is
sold in roll and sheet form. These sales are to converters who use uncoated free
sheet primarily to make envelopes and forms, to merchant  distributors and major
end users who use it in business and printing papers and to retail distributors.
The mill also produces coated and uncoated  bleached bristols which are sold for
a variety of end uses, such as publishing,  greeting cards, book covers and file
folders.  There are four paper  machines and two board machines at this mill. In
December  1994, a fiber  recycling  facility  began  operating at the  Franklin,
Virginia  mill.  This  facility  was  constructed  as  part  of a  $148  million
modernization  program which also included  enhancements  to the Franklin mill's
paper machines and one board machine.  The fiber recycling  facility removes ink
from office  waste  paper and  produces  recycled  pulp for the  manufacture  of
recycled content white paper and board.  Recycled content paper is sold as Union
Camp branded products such as Collage'tm' and Great White'tm'.  Deinked pulp not
used for recycled products is sold to others.

               The Eastover, South Carolina mill produces bleached uncoated free
sheet which, like the Franklin product, is sold to others in roll and sheet form
for the same end  uses.  The  two-machine  Eastover  mill has an  excess of pulp
capacity  which is used together with an on-site pulp dryer to produce  bleached
pulp for sale to others in domestic and international markets.

               In 1995,  Union  Camp sold  about 26% of its  bleached  paper and
paperboard production in converted or sheet form. This includes approximately 1%
converted by its own plants into folding cartons and bags.

               The four  integrated  mills use sulfate pulping  chemistry,  also
referred to as the kraft process.  Both hardwood and pine timber are used at all
four mills.  Approximately  25% of the Company's wood pulp  production  utilizes
timber  harvested  from lands owned or controlled by the Company.  Timber use at
the  Prattville  and Savannah  mills is  supplemented  with recycled waste paper
acquired from others and the Company's  converting  plants (see the next section
entitled "Packaging Products").

Packaging Products

               From its mill  production  of paper and  paperboard,  Union  Camp
makes bags and sacks and corrugated and solid fibre containers.

               Union Camp  produces  multiwall and consumer bags used to package
cement,  feed,  fertilizer,  clay, pet food,  chemical and mineral  products and
specialty bags used in packaging charcoal,  produce, sugar, flour, seed, coffee,
cookies,  microwaveable  popcorn and other miscellaneous  items. Union Camp also
produces low density plastic products  including film for consumer  applications
and for industrial applications, such as plastic shipping sacks to package salt,
bark, soil, insulation, resins and chemicals.

               Union Camp produces corrugated and solid fibre containers used to
ship and store  canned,  bottled and  packaged  products  for a wide  variety of
customers,  including  food  processors  and  textile,  furniture,  chemical and
automotive  manufacturers.  In the  second  half  of  1995,  the  Company  began
construction of a new corrugated  container plant in Hanford,  California,  that
will produce heavy duty corrugated  products including  laminated bulk packaging
and triplewall to service the general  industrial,  agricultural,  petrochemical
and material  handling  markets.  Startup is scheduled  during the first half of
1996.  In January  1996,  Union Camp  acquired the  operating  assets of O'Grady
Containers,  Inc., a Fort Worth,  Texas based  manufacturer of corrugated boxes,
multicolor direct print graphics  packaging and point of purchase displays which
operates as part of the Container Division.

               Other packaging products include folding cartons,  on which Union
Camp does high quality  gravure and  lithographic  printing,  which are used for
shelf packaging in retail stores.

               In addition,  corrugated containers are produced by wholly-owned,
consolidated  subsidiaries in Spain,  the Republic of Ireland and Puerto Rico. A
corrugated container  manufacturing plant in Chile, which is owned by a majority
owned  consolidated  subsidiary of Union Camp, serves that country's fresh fruit
exporters  and  expanding  industrial  base.  Union Camp holds a 30% interest in
Zucamor S.A.,  Argentina's  leading  independent  corrugated  container company,
which  it  purchased  during  1994.  In  December  1995,  Union  Camp's  Spanish


                                       4

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

subsidiary  acquired a corrugated  container  manufacturing  plant  located near
Madrid.  In March 1996,  the Company  entered a joint venture in Turkey with KAV
Orman  Sanayii  A.S., a subsidiary  of KOC Holding  Company,  one of the world's
largest industrial  companies,  to operate a corrugated  container plant serving
agricultural and industrial markets in Turkey.


Wood Products

               Union  Camp   produces   southern   pine   lumber,   plywood  and
particleboard.  Its wood products mills have the capacity to produce 479,000,000
board feet of  lumber,  234,000,000  square  feet  (3/8"  basis) of plywood  and
117,000,000  square feet (3/4" basis) of  particleboard  annually.  Union Camp's
wood products  mills  produced at 98% of capacity in 1995. Its wood products are
used in home construction and industrial markets such as furniture, cabinets and
fixtures.  The wood products mills also produce  significant  quantities of wood
chips for use in Union Camp's papermaking operations.

Chemical Group

               The  Chemical  Group  consists of two  operating  units: Chemical
Products Division and Bush Boake Allen Inc.

               The Chemical  Products  Division produces a variety of wood-based
and non-wood-based  chemicals.  Wood-based  chemicals,  which are by-products of
pulp mill operations,  include tall oil and turpentine chemicals.  Tall oil is a
mixture of rosin and fatty acids which are  by-products of the pulping  process.
Tall oil rosins  are  converted  into  rosin-based  resins  and fatty  acids are
converted  into dimer acids and  polyamide  resins.  These  products are used in
coatings,  adhesives,  printing  inks,  paper  sizing  and oil field  chemicals.
Non-wood-based  chemicals,  which are complementary to Union Camp's pulp-derived
tall oil fatty acids,  are produced by converting  vegetable oils into a variety
of esters and other derivatives.  These are sold primarily for use in cosmetics,
lubricants, plastics, surfactants and rubber. The Chemical Products Division has
five processing  facilities,  three of which are in the United States and two of
which are in England.

               In May 1994,  Bush Boake Allen Inc.  completed an initial  public
offering of 32% of its outstanding common stock. Union Camp continues to own the
remaining 68% of the stock.

               Bush  Boake  Allen  Inc.  is a  producer  of  flavors  (including
essential  oils,  seasonings  and  spice  extracts)  and  fragrances  and  aroma
chemicals. The flavor products impart a desired taste and smell to a broad range
of consumer products,  including soft drinks, confections,  dietary foods, snack
foods, dairy products,  pharmaceuticals and alcoholic  beverages.  The fragrance
products are used in a wide variety of items, including fine fragrances,  soaps,
detergents,  air fresheners,  cosmetics and toiletries and related products. The
flavor and fragrance  compounds  are sold  primarily to major  consumer  product
companies  which use these  products  in  conjunction  with  other  natural  and
synthetic  ingredients to make their  products more appealing to consumers.  The
majority of the aroma  chemicals  produced by Bush Boake Allen are used by major
multinational  consumer  product  manufacturers  and other  fragrance and flavor
compounders  as fragrance raw materials.  The remainder is sold to  agrichemical
and specialty  chemical  manufacturers or internally used by Bush Boake Allen in
its  production  of  fragrance  compounds.  Bush  Boake  Allen has  developed  a
broad-based  global  presence with operations in 40 countries in North and South
America, Europe, Asia, Australia, The Middle East and Africa.

Capital Expenditures

               Information  about Union Camp's 1995 and  estimated  1996 capital
expenditures appears on page 25 of the Union Camp 1995 Annual Report in the text
under the caption  "Capital  Expenditures"  and is  incorporated by reference in
this Item 1.

Marketing

               Most of Union Camp's sales,  other than its chemical  sales,  are
made in the  United  States  east of the Rocky  Mountains  through a variety  of
distribution methods.  Paper and paperboard are sold both directly to converters
and through merchants.  Packaging  materials are sold directly to the industrial
and agricultural trades primarily by Union Camp sales  representatives and, to a
lesser extent,  through  distributors.  Wood products are sold through  building
supply dealers and directly to industrial users.

               Union Camp  chemicals  are sold  worldwide  with most sales being
made  to  customers  in  the  United  States  and  European  Economic  Community
countries.  Through various overseas  subsidiaries and related companies of Bush
Boake  Allen,  Union  Camp  sells  in the  worldwide  markets  for  flavors  and
fragrances and related products.  Chemical products  generally are sold directly
to industrial  users and to a lesser  extent  through  agents and  distributors.
During 1995,  Union Camp's chemical exports from the United States were about 5%
of the total  chemical  sales of Union Camp and its  subsidiaries.  In addition,
approximately  53% of such total chemical sales  originated  from the production
facilities of subsidiaries located outside the United States.

               In 1995, Union Camp sold in the export market  approximately  16%
of its production of paper and paperboard.

Land Development and Housing

               Union Camp's real estate subsidiary,  The Branigar  Organization,
Inc., is engaged in the sale and development of land in Georgia,  South Carolina
and North Carolina.  Another  subsidiary,  Transtates  Properties  Incorporated,
sells and develops sites for commercial  properties at highway  interchanges  in
Georgia and South Carolina.

Competition

               All of  Union  Camp's  products  are sold in  highly  competitive
markets in which there are many large and well-established  companies,  of which
Union  Camp is one.  Competition  in each of Union  Camp's  markets  is based on
price, quality of product, service and product innovation.

Timber Resources

               The basic raw  material for Union  Camp's  business is timber,  a
renewable  resource.  Union  Camp  controls  approximately  1,543,000  acres  of
timberlands in Georgia,  Alabama,  Virginia,  Florida,  North Carolina and South
Carolina,  of which  approximately  1,500,000 acres are owned by the Company and
the  balance is held  under  long-term  leases.  In 1995,  Union  Camp  obtained
approximately 29% of its total timber 



                                       7

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

requirements from its own timberlands and purchased the balance from others.

               Union Camp operates its  timberlands on a sustained  yield basis.
Union Camp began  reforestation on its timberlands in the mid-1950's and now has
approximately  950,000 acres in plantation growth. It planted about 40,000 acres
under the plantation program in 1995 and expects to plant  approximately  44,000
acres in 1996. These plantation programs result in increased yield per acre. The
current growing cycle for most of Union Camp's  plantations  averages between 20
and 25 years.  Union Camp anticipates that for the foreseeable future there will
be an adequate  supply of timber for its operations from its own lands and other
sources.

Environmental Protection Activities

               Union   Camp  is   committed   to   complying   with   applicable
environmental  protection control laws.  Wastewater  treatment facilities and/or
atmospheric  emission control  equipment at various Union Camp locations,  which
currently comply with applicable restrictions, may have to be upgraded to comply
with new  limitations  that may be imposed  when  federal and state  permits are
renewed and as regulations are promulgated implementing revisions to federal and
state air and water pollution control laws.

               Since 1985,  when new  analytical  capability  revealed  that the
bleaching  of pulps with  chlorine  and chlorine  based  agents  produced  trace
quantities  of dioxin  in mill  effluents,  Union  Camp has  monitored  evolving
research and other  technical  studies  related to the  environmental  and human
health effects of low level dioxin  exposure.  Appraisal of that information has
led the Company to conclude  that human  health  problems do not result from the
minute amounts of dioxin  discharged  with treated  wastewaters at the Company's
fine paper operations. Since the discovery of dioxin in bleached kraft pulp mill
wastewater,  the Company has  modified  operating  practices  and  progressively
applied  innovative  pulp  bleaching  technologies  which  are less  reliant  on
chlorine  and  chlorine  based  compounds.  These  practices  have  lessened the
potential  for the  incidental  generation  of dioxin and have reduced  effluent
concentrations of dioxin to non-detectable  levels at both of the Company's fine
paper mills.

               In 1992,  Union Camp  replaced two bleach lines at the  Franklin,
Virginia mill with a single line employing Union Camp's patented C-Free'tm' pulp
bleaching  technology  which resulted from years of research and  development in
water   conservation   methods  by  the   Company.   This  process  uses  oxygen
delignification  and ozone instead of chlorine as the primary  bleaching  agent.
The most  significant  environmental  achievements  of this process are dramatic
reductions in chlorinated  organics,  including  dioxin and chloroform,  and the
ability to recycle most of the bleach plant's wastewater,  which is not possible
when using  chlorine  because of its  corrosive  nature.  Following is a list of
pollutants  and a typical  amount  that each is  reduced  by the  Company's  new
bleaching process as compared to conventional bleaching processes.

</TABLE>

               These data are based on testing of the commercial ozone bleaching
line installed at the Company's  Franklin mill. The invention of the C-Free pulp
bleaching  technology,  including related bleaching process  improvements in the
use of oxygen and in various  extraction  steps, has resulted in the issuance of
sixteen patents, with twenty patent applications  currently pending. The process
is  available  for  licensing  by  others in the  industry  through  Union  Camp
Technology,  Inc., a subsidiary of the Company.  To date,  three other companies
have obtained a license to use the Company's ozone bleaching technology.

               Union Camp invested  approximately $17.4 million in environmental
control  facilities in 1995 and approximately  $134.7 million over the past five
years.  The five year figure includes the  environmental  control  elements of a
large  modernization  and expansion program completed in 1991. Over the next two
years,  it is estimated that  environmental  control


                                       9

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

expenditures  will  average  approximately  11% of projected  capital  spending.
Environmental control expenditures divert capital and may increase operating and
financing costs. To that extent, they have an adverse impact on earnings.

               During  the  next  several  years,  the cost of  compliance  with
environmental  control laws will depend upon the application of existing and new
regulations  and on revisions to existing  statutes.  Union Camp  believes  such
costs will not adversely  affect its  competitive  position within the paper and
chemical  industries  since most paper and chemical  companies have similar air,
water and solid waste disposal concerns.

               In August  1992,  Union Camp  entered  into a Consent  Order with
Region V of the U.S.  Environmental  Protection Agency (the "EPA") to conduct an
investigation  to ascertain  existing  conditions at the Company's  Dover,  Ohio
facility   under  the  Resource   Conservation   and  Recovery   Act.  The  site
investigation  and risk  assessment  report was submitted to the EPA in December
1994 and concluded that  conditions at the facility pose no significant  risk to
human health or the  environment.  The Company  received  comments  from the EPA
which included requests for a considerable amount of additional information. The
Company  subsequently  negotiated a more focused scope for additional study. The
risk assessment and site  investigation  are not yet complete or approved by the
EPA. However,  the EPA has agreed to accept restrictive  covenants that preclude
the use of the property for residential  purposes.  The ultimate findings of the
site  investigation and risk assessment report may not be known for some months.
Although the final  disposition  of the  foregoing  investigation  cannot now be
predicted  with  any  degree  of  certainty,  on the  basis  of the  information
presently  available  to it,  Union Camp  believes  that it will not result in a
material adverse effect on its financial condition.

Employees

               Union  Camp  and its  subsidiaries  employ  approximately  18,000
people,  approximately 42% of whom are represented by a total of 66 unions under
collective bargaining agreements. Contracts involving approximately 2,200 hourly
employees  were  negotiated  during 1995 and contracts  involving  approximately
3,200 hourly employees are subject to  renegotiation  and renewal in 1996. Union
Camp believes that its  relationship  with its 


                                       10

employees is favorable and it has not experienced a strike at any major facility

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

               In addition to the proceedings  described below, the Company is a
party to other legal  proceedings  incidental to its business  which the Company
does not believe are material to it.

                                       15

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

               Union Camp has been designated a potentially responsible party at
a number of hazardous  waste sites pursuant to the  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response and  Compensation  Liability Act ("CERCLA") and similar state laws. The
Company is unable to estimate  environmental  costs and  liabilities for several
reasons.  In some  cases,  it has not been  established  that the  Company  is a
potentially  responsible  party.  In other cases,  it is  uncertain  whether the
Company will seek,  be offered or accept a settlement  with payment of a premium
over  otherwise  estimated  liability in order to secure full  release.  In many
instances,   the  cost  of   remediation   is   speculative   because   remedial
investigations  and  feasibility  studies have not yet been contracted for, have
not been  completed  or,  alternatively,  have  been  completed  but  acceptable
remediation  has not been chosen.  Some settled cases also have  "reopeners" for
contamination  discovered  after full  implementation  of the  clean-up  remedy.
Finally,  insurance reimbursement is usually uncertain until matters are finally
resolved.

               During  March  1996  the  Company  was  notified  that the EPA is
contemplating  commencing a civil action  against  Union Camp and several  other
potentially  responsible  parties  under  CERCLA for recovery of past and future
remediation  costs incurred by the EPA at the Bayou  Bonfouca  Superfund Site at
Slidell,  Louisiana  which  operated as a wood  treatment  facility from 1882 to
1972. EPA records indicate there have been  expenditures  over a number of years
of approximately $97 million for remediation at the site. The EPA estimates that
future response costs will be  approximately  $35 million.  It is alleged that a
subsidiary  of American  Creosoting  Company had owned and  operated the Slidell
facility  from 1933 to 1958. A subsidiary  of Union Camp  acquired the assets of
American  Creosoting Company in l956. The subsidiary was sold in 1964.  Although
Union Camp never  owned or operated  the Slidell  facility,  the  government  is
seeking to hold it responsible for remediation costs under a theory that ignores
the corporate form of ownership of the facility and  longstanding  principles of
corporate and  shareholders'  liability.  In fact,  prior to receiving the above
notice,  Union  Camp had been  informed  it would not be named as a  potentially
responsible  party  with  respect  to  the  site.  Union  Camp  believes  it has
meritorious  defenses to the action contemplated by the EPA and plans to discuss
its view with the EPA.

                                       16

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        Union Camp is also a party to an action in the U.S.  District  Court for
the District of  Connecticut  in which private  litigants are seeking to recover
the costs of remediating  land used for creosoting  operations from 1921 through
1964.  Such  remediation  costs are  currently  estimated  at  approximately  $6
million.  A subsidiary of Union Camp  conducted  activities at the property from
1956 to 1964. Union Camp had been dismissed on summary judgment from the lawsuit
in June 1995.  The  dismissal  was appealed and in March l996 the U.S.  Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit  vacated the summary  judgment order and remanded
the case to the  District  Court to determine  whether  Union Camp could be held
liable as an operator under federal and state superfund laws.

        Union  Camp is a party to an  action  brought  in state  court in Forest
County,  Mississippi by the Hattiesburg  Public School  District  seeking future
remediation  costs for property  previously  used in creosoting  operations.  No
remediation of the property has begun or been ordered. Like the matter described
in the  second  preceding  paragraph,  this  case and the  case in the  previous
paragraph allege that Union Camp should be responsible for the activities of its
subsidiary  at  the  properties.  Union Camp disputes these allegations  because
Union Camp did not own or operate the facilities.  Although  Union Camp believes
it  has  a  strong  legal  position  with  respect to the above described claims
involving the creosoting activities of its former subsidiary, an estimate of the
likely outcome of these proceedings cannot be made at this time.

               In  April  1994,  the  Company's  facility  in  Savannah  Georgia
received a Notice of Violation  and  Opportunity  to Show Cause ("NOV") from the
EPA alleging  violations of the EPA's rules governing the treatment of hazardous
waste. The allegations  involve the  applicability  of these  regulations to the
removal of granular impurities from the pulping liquor manufacturing  process at
the  Savannah  facility.  The  Company  met with EPA  shortly  after the NOV was
received  to support the  Company's  position  that the removal of the  granular
materials is not covered by the EPA's rules  governing the handling of hazardous
waste. Although the Company has not received a response from the EPA to date, in
May 1995 Region IV of the EPA provided the American Forest and Paper Association
with a written  position  statement  on the issue in which it  expressed  a view
consistent with the Company's position. Based upon this



                                       17

<PAGE>

action,  the  Company  does not expect the EPA to take  enforcement  action with
respect to the NOV.

               In the  second  quarter of 1995 the  Company  was named as one of
approximately 60 defendants in a lawsuit filed in Jefferson County,  Texas state
court on behalf of  approximately  2,400  plaintiffs  who allege  that they were
exposed to asbestos  while  performing  work at various  plant sites in Alabama.
Subsequent  amendments  have brought the number of plaintiffs  to  approximately
4,500.  Approximately  160 of these plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos while
on Union Camp premises.

               During  the  second  quarter  of 1995  Union  Camp was named as a
defendant  in two  lawsuits  brought in Texas state court in Brazoria  County by
approximately  2,700  plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs,  for the most part,  allege  they
sustained personal injury while performing work at various sites in Alabama.  At
this time  approximately  50 of these  plaintiffs  claim to have been exposed to
asbestos  on  the  Company's  premises  in  Alabama.   Approximately  180  other
defendants  were named in these two Brazoria  County suits. In February 1996 the
Company  entered a settlement  agreement  with the attorneys  for  approximately
1,250 of these plaintiffs for an amount which is not material to the Company.

               In the cases described in the two paragraphs  immediately  above,
the many  defendants  named  include  asbestos  manufacturers,  distributors  of
asbestos-containing  products,  insurance  companies,  a manufacturer  of safety
equipment,   parties  who  allegedly  misrepresented  the  dangers  of  asbestos
exposure,  and the owners of the premises where the plaintiffs  allege they were
working  when they were  exposed  to  asbestos.  Union Camp is  included  in the
premises  owner  category  of  defendants  and the amount of  damages  sought is
unspecified.

               In its  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
30, 1991, the Company  previously  reported that a subsidiary of the Company was
added as a defendant in  approximately  7,000  asbestos-related  cases which had
been  pending in  Mississippi  state court for several  years.  During the third
quarter  of 1991,  this  subsidiary  was  named  as a  defendant  in  additional
asbestos-related consolidated actions so that the total number of such cases was
over  7,000.  During the second  quarter of 1992,  the  subsidiary  was named in


                                       18

<PAGE>

additional similar  consolidated actions so that it was a defendant in excess of
10,000 such cases.  The subsidiary was named in these cases because it allegedly
was  part of the  chain  of  distribution  of  asbestos-containing  products  to
facilities where the plaintiffs  worked.  The period of alleged exposure is 1930
through  the  present.   The   subsidiary  did  not   manufacture   asbestos  or
asbestos-containing  products.  Approximately  80 defendants  have been named in
each  of  these  suits,  including  asbestos  manufacturers,   distributors,  an
insurance  company and a manufacturer  of safety  equipment.  In March 1993, the
Company's  subsidiary reached agreement to settle  approximately 10,500 of these
cases, with the settlement being funded by the Company's insurance carrier. This
subsidiary is a defendant in approximately  7,500 cases, of which  approximately
5,500 were filed subsequent to the settlement.

               Although the final outcome of any legal  proceeding is subject to
many variables and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, the Company
presently  believes the pending legal proceedings  alleging liability on account
of exposure to  asbestos to which Union Camp or its  subsidiary  is a party will
not have a  material  adverse  effect on the  financial  position  or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


To The Board of Directors
of Union Camp Corporation

Our audits of the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to in our report
dated  February  7,  1996  appearing  on page 28 of the 1995  Annual  Report  to
Stockholders of Union Camp Corporation (which report and consolidated  financial
statements  are  incorporated  by reference in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K)
also  included  an audit of the  Financial  Statement  Schedule  listed  in Item
14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion,  the Financial  Statement  Schedule
presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

               2. That on November 28, 1995, pursuant to Section 13.1-639 of the
Virginia Stock Corporation Act and to the authority conferred upon the Board of
Directors by the Articles of Incorporation of the said Corporation, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation duly adopted the following resolutions (a) deleting
the references in the Articles of Incorporation to the Corporation's existing
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and (b) creating a new series of
125,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as a Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock:

               RESOLVED, that it is hereby declared to be in the best interests
        of the Corporation that the Articles of Incorporation of the
        Corporation, as amended and restated to date, be further amended by
        deleting the existing Part C to Article III of the Articles of
        Incorporation of the Corporation, in its entirety; and, it is further

               RESOLVED, that it is hereby declared to be in the best interests
        of the Corporation that the Articles of Incorporation of the
        Corporation, as amended and restated to date, be further amended to
        create a new series of Preferred Stock to consist of one hundred
        twenty-five thousand (125,000) shares and to be designated as Series A
        Junior Participating Preferred Stock, and to determine the preferences,
        limitations and relative rights of the Series A Junior Participating
        Preferred Stock by adding a new Part C to Article III of such Articles
        of Incorporation to read as follows:


                                     PART C

               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

               Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series
shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating

Preferred Stock" (the "Series A Preferred Stock") and the number of shares
constituting such series shall be 125,000.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
legally available therefor, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the
thirteenth day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such
date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"),
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance
of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per
share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $200.00 or (b)
subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1000 times the
aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1000 times the aggregate
per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other
distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after February
15, 1996 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b)
of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such
event.

               (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on
the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately
after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no
dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the
period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $200.00 per share on the Series A
Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date.

               (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record
date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on
such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or
unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after
the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to
accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but
unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at
the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of
Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days
prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               (D) Dividends in full shall not be declared or paid or set apart
for payment on the Series A Preferred Stock for a dividend period terminating on
the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date unless dividends in full have been declared
or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of all series (other
than series with respect to which dividends are not cumulative from a date prior
to such dividend date) for the respective dividend periods terminating on such
dividend date. When the dividends are not paid in full on all series of the
Preferred Stock, the shares of all series shall share ratably in the payment of
dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which
would be payable on said shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set
        forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder
        thereof to 1000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the
        stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at
        any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on
        Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the
        outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock
        into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of
        votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
        were 


                                       -3-



<PAGE>
<PAGE>


        entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by
        multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the
        number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
        event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common
        Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Articles of
        Incorporation or by-laws, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
        Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as
        one voting group on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of
        the Corporation.

               (C) (i) If at any time dividends an any Series A Preferred Stock
        shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends
        thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of
        a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until
        such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous
        quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period
        on all shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have
        been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default
        period, at any annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in
        lieu thereof or at a special meeting of the holders of the Preferred
        Stock, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A
        Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an
        amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon), voting together as
        one voting group, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect
        two (2) Directors. At any time while the holders of the Preferred Stock
        voting together as one voting group are entitled to elect two directors
        as herein provided, they shall not be entitled to participate with the
        holders of Common Stock in the election of any other directors.

               (ii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an
        existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect
        Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written
        request of stockholders of record of ten percent (10%) or more of the
        total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding irrespective of
        series addressed to him at the principal office of the Corporation in
        the United States, shall, call a special meeting of the holders of
        Preferred Stock, for the election of the directors to be elected by them
        to be held within 30 days after such call and at a place and upon the
        notice provided by law and in the by-laws for the holding of meetings of
        stockholders; provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be
        required to call such special meeting in the case of any such request
        received less than 90 days before the date fixed for any annual meeting
        of stockholders or 



                                       -4-



<PAGE>
<PAGE>


        special meeting held in lieu thereof. If  any such special meeting
        required to be called as provided shall not be called by the Secretary
        within 30 days after the receipt of any such request, then the holders
        of record of 10% or more of the Preferred Stock outstanding may
        designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting, and the
        person so designated may call such meeting to be held at the place and
        upon the notice above provided and for that purpose shall have access to
        the stock ledger of the Corporation. No such special meeting and no
        adjournment thereof shall be held on a date later than 30 days before
        the annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in lieu
        thereof next succeeding the time when the holders of the Preferred
        Stock become entitled to elect directors as above provided.

              (iii) If any such special meeting shall be called as above
        provided, or if the holders of Preferred Stock shall become entitled to
        elect directors as above provided at any annual meeting of stockholders
        or special meeting held in lieu thereof, then, by vote of the holders of
        at least a majority of the shares of the Preferred Stock which are
        present or represented by proxy at such meeting, the then authorized
        number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and at
        such meeting, and at all subsequent annual meetings of stockholders or
        special meetings held in lieu thereof until the holders of the Preferred
        Stock shall be divested of such voting power, the holders of the
        Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so
        provided for, but any directors so elected shall not hold office beyond
        the next annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in lieu
        thereof next succeeding the meeting at which such directors are elected.

               (iv) In any default period the holders of Common Stock, and other
        classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be
        entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of
        Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2)
        Directors voting together as one voting group, after the exercise of
        which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred
        Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been
        elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period,
        and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may be filled by vote of a
        majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders
        of the voting group of stock which elected the Director whose office
        shall have become vacant. In the event that there are no such Directors
        to vote to fill such vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled by such group
        of stockholders. References in this paragraph (C) to Directors elected
        by the holders of a particular voting group of stock shall include
        Directors elected by such Directors to fill 



                                       -5-

        vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.

                (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the
        right of the holders of Preferred Stock voting together as one voting
        group to elect Directors shall cease, subject always to the same
        provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any
        similar future arrearages in dividends, (y) the term of any Directors
        elected by the holders of Preferred Stock voting together as one voting
        group shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such
        number as may be provided for in the Articles of Incorporation or
        by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of
        this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter
        in any manner provided by law or in the Articles of Incorporation or
        by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the
        provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be
        filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.

               (D) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided in the
        Articles of Incorporation, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall
        have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required
        (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common
        Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

               (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or
distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2
are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not

                (i) declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends (other
        than dividends payable in shares of any class or classes of stock of the
        Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock) or make any
        other distributions on, any class of stock of the Corporation
        ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution
        or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock and will not redeem,
        purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, whether
        voluntarily, for a sinking fund, or otherwise any shares of any class of
        stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock,
        provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may at any
        time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such
        junior 




<PAGE>
<PAGE>


        class in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from, the
        concurrent sale of other shares of stock of any such junior class;

               (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions
        on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or
        upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred
        Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and
        all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in
        proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares
        are then entitled;

              (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
        shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred
        Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or
        otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares
        of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends
        or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A
        Preferred Stock;

               (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares
        of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity
        with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase
        offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of
        Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of
        Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates
        and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and
        classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable
        treatment among the respective series or classes.

               (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of
this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in
such manner.

               Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner
whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition
thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series
of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth
herein.

               Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (A) Upon any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $450 per share, plus
an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon,
whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation
Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A
Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of
shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common
Adjustment") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A
Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in
subparagraph C below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and
recapitalization with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii),
the "Adjustment Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series
A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of
Series A Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive
their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed
in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock
and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

               (B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets
available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and
the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any,
which rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining
assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in
proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however,
that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the
Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to
the holders of Common Stock.

               (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii)
combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in
each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event
shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the 


                                       -8-



<PAGE>
<PAGE>



denominator  of  which is the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  that  were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation
shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in
which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock
or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or
changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth) equal to 1000 times the aggregate amount of stock,
securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may
be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date
(i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set
forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such
event.

               Section 8. Redemption. The outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Board of Directors as a
whole, but not in part, at any time, or from time to time, at a cash price per
share equal to (i) the product of the Adjustment Number times the Average Market
Value (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Common Stock, plus (ii) all
dividends which on the redemption date have accrued on the shares to be redeemed
and have not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
set apart, without interest; provided, however, that if and whenever any
quarterly dividend shall have accrued on the Series A Preferred Stock which has
not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set
apart, the Corporation may not purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock unless all shares of such stock at the time outstanding
are so purchased or otherwise acquired. The "Average Market Value" is the
average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the 30 day period
immediately preceding the date before the redemption date on the Composite Tape
for New York Stock Exchange Listed Stocks, or, if such stock is not quoted on
the Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock is not
listed on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities exchange
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on which such
stock is listed, or, if such stock is not listed on any such exchange, the
average of the closing bid quotations with

                                      -9-

respect to a share of Common Stock during such 30-day period on the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System or any
system then in use, or if no such quotations are available, the fair market
value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

               Section 9. Ranking. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank
junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any
such series shall provide otherwise.

               Section 10. Amendment. The Corporation shall not create any other
class or classes of stock ranking prior to the Series A Preferred Stock either
as to dividends or liquidation, or increase the authorized number of shares of
any such other class of stock, or amend, alter, or repeal any of the provisions
of the Articles of Incorporation or the resolution or resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors authorizing the Series A Preferred Stock so as to adversely
affect the preferences, rights or powers of the Series A Preferred Stock without
the affirmative vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as one voting group.

               Section 11. Fractional Shares. Series A Preferred Stock may be
issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to
such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends,
participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of
holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

               3. That this amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation as amended and supplemented was adopted on November 28, 1995 and, as
permitted by Section 13.1- 606 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, shall
become effective at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 26, 1996.

               4. That this amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation as amended and supplemented was duly adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.


               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed and subscribed this
Certificate and do affirm the foregoing as true under the penalties of perjury
this 19th day of February, 1996.

Delete  Article V of the Articles of Incorporation of Union Camp Corporation and
substitute the following:

                                    ARTICLE V
                                       TO
                            ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
                                       OF
                             UNION CAMP CORPORATION

1.      All  corporate  powers  shall be exercised by or under the authority of,
and  the business and affairs of the Corporation managed under the direction of,
the  Board  of  Directors,  except  as  otherwise  required by statute or by the
Articles of Incorporation as at the time amended.

        The  Board  of  Directors  shall  have  the  power to make and alter the
bylaws.

        The  Board  of  Directors  shall  have the right to prescribe reasonable
rules  and  regulations governing any inspection of the books and records by the
stockholders.

2.      The  number  of directors shall be as fixed in the bylaws, provided that
such  number  shall  not  be  greater than fifteen (15) nor less than three (3).
Commencing  with the 1990 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors
shall be divided into three classes,  Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly
equal  in  number  as  possible.  At  the  1990  annual meeting of stockholders,
directors  of  the  first  class (Class I) shall be elected to hold office for a
term  expiring  at  the  1991  annual  meeting of stockholders; directors of the

the 1992 annual meeting of stockholders; and directors of the third class (Class
III)  shall  be  elected  to  hold office for a term expiring at the 1993 annual
meeting of stockholders.  At each annual meeting of stockholders after 1990, the
successors  to  the  class  of  directors whose terms then shall expire shall be
identified as being  of the same class as the directors they succeed and elected
to  hold  office  for  a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders.  When  the  number  of  directors  is  changed,  any newly-created
directorships  or  any  decrease in directorships shall be apportioned among the
classes  by  the  Board  of  Directors as to make all classes as nearly equal in
number as possible.

3.      Subject to the rights of the holders of any claim or series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding, a director may be removed only with cause.

4.      An  amendment to these Articles that amends or affects this Article V of
these Articles shall be approved by at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent or
the votes entitled to  be  cast by each voting group that is entitled to vote on
the matter.

        all of the Corporation's assets or the dissolution of the Corporation
        shall be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each
        voting group that is entitled to vote on the matter."
                                       III

                        OF THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

                                       OF

                             UNION CAMP CORPORATION


               I, Raymond E. Cartledge, Chairman of the Board of Union Camp
Corporation (the "Corporation"), a corporation organized and existing under the
Virginia Stock Corporation Act, in accordance with the provisions of sections
13.1-604, 13.1-706 and 13.1-639 thereof, do hereby certify:

               1.     That the name of the corporation is Union Camp
Corporation.

               2. That on February 25, 1986, pursuant to Section 13.1-639 of the
Virginia Stock Corporation Act and to the authority conferred upon the Board of
Directors by the Articles of Incorporation of the said Corporation, the Board of
Directors of the Corporation duly adopted the following resolution creating a
series of 550,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as a Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock:

               RESOLVED, that it is hereby declared to be in the best interests
        of the Corporation that the Articles of Incorporation of the
        Corporation, as amended and restated to date, be further amended to
        create a new series of Preferred Stock to consist of five hundred-fifty
        thousand (550,000) shares and to be designated as Series A Junior
        Participating Preferred Stock, and to determine the preferences,
        limitations and relative rights of the Series A Junior Participating
        Preferred Stock by adding a new Part C to Article III of such Articles
        of Incorporation to read as follows:

                                     PART C

               Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

               Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series
shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" (the
"Series A Preferred Stock") and the number of shares constituting such series
shall be 550,000.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

               (A) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
legally available therefor, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the
thirteenth day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such
date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"),



<PAGE>
<PAGE>

commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance
of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per
share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $20.00 or (b)
subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the
aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate
per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other
distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share of the
Corporation (the "Common Stock") since the immediately preceding Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after February
25, 1986 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare any dividend on Common
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b)
of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such
event.

               (B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on
the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately
after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided, that in the event no
dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the
period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $20.00 per share on the Series A
Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date.

               (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record
date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on
such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or
unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after
the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such

                                       2


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends
paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total
amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination
of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of
a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more
than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

               (D) Dividends in full shall not be declared or paid or set apart
for payment on the Series A Preferred Stock for a dividend period terminating on
the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date unless dividends in full have been declared
or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of all series (other
than series with respect to which dividends are not cumulative from a date prior
to such dividend date) for the respective dividend periods terminating on such
dividend date. When the dividends are not paid in full on all series of the
Preferred Stock, the shares of all series shall share ratably in the payment of
dividends, including accumulations, if any, in accordance with the sums which
would be payable on said shares if all dividends were declared and paid in full.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  The holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:

               (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set
forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof
to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the
outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case
the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by
multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Articles of
Incorporation or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one voting group on
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.


                                       3

               (C) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Preferred Stock
        shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends
        thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of
        a period (herein called a "default period") which shall extend until
        such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous
        quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period
        on all shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have
        been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default
        period, at any annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in
        lieu thereof or at a special meeting of the holders of the Preferred
        Stock, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A
        Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an
        amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon), voting together as
        one voting group, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect
        two (2) Directors. At any time while the holders of the Preferred Stock
        voting together as one voting group are entitled to elect two directors
        as herein provided, they shall not be entitled to participate with the
        holders of Common Stock in the election of any other directors.

               (ii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an
        existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect
        Directors, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written
        request of stockholders of record of ten percent (10%) or more of the
        total number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding irrespective of
        series addressed to him at the principal office of the Corporation in
        the United States, shall, call a special meeting of the holders of
        Preferred Stock, for the election of the directors to be elected by them
        to be held within 30 days after such call and at a place and upon the
        notice provided by law and in the by-laws for the holding of meetings of
        stockholders; provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be
        required to call such special meeting in the case of any such request
        received less than 90 days before the date fixed for any annual meeting
        of stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof. If any such
        special meeting required to be called as provided shall not be called by
        the Secretary within 30 days after the receipt of any such request, then
        the holders of record of 10% or more of the Preferred Stock outstanding
        may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting, and
        the person so designated may call such meeting to be held at the place
        and upon the notice above provided and for that purpose shall have
        access to the stock ledger of the Corporation. No such special meeting
        and no adjournment thereof shall be held on a date later than 30 days
        before the annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in
        lieu thereof next succeeding the time when the

                                       4


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        holders of the Preferred Stock become entitled to elect directors 
        as above provided.

               (iii) If any such special meeting shall be called as above
        provided, or if the holders of Preferred Stock shall become entitled to
        elect directors as above provided at any annual meeting of stockholders
        or special meeting held in lieu thereof, then, by vote of the holders of
        at least a majority of the shares of the Preferred Stock which are
        present or represented by proxy at such meeting, the then authorized
        number of directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two, and at
        such meeting, and at all subsequent annual meetings of stockholders or
        special meetings held in lieu thereof until the holders of the Preferred
        Stock shall be divested of such voting power, the holders of the
        Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect the additional directors so
        provided for, but any directors so elected shall not hold office beyond
        the next annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in lieu
        thereof next succeeding the meeting at which such directors are elected.

               (iv) In any default period the holders of Common Stock, and other
        classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be
        entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of
        Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2)
        Directors voting together as one voting group, after the exercise of
        which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of Preferred
        Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been
        elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period,
        and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may be filled by vote of a
        majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders
        of the voting group of stock which elected the Director whose office
        shall have become vacant. References in this paragraph (C) to Directors
        elected by the holders of a particular voting group of stock shall
        include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as
        provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.

               (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the
        right of the holders of Preferred Stock voting together as one voting
        group to elect Directors shall cease, subject always to the same
        provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any
        similar future arrearages in dividends, (y) the term of any Directors
        elected by the holders of Preferred Stock voting together as one voting
        group shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such
        number as may be provided for in the Articles of Incorporation or
        by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of
        this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter
        in 

                                       5

        any manner provided by law or in the Articles of Incorporation or
        by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the
        provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be
        filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.

               (D) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided in the
Articles of Incorporation, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the
extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth
herein) for taking any corporate action.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

               (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or
distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2
are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock
outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not

                      (i) declare or pay or set apart for payment any dividends
        (other than dividends payable in shares of any class or classes of stock
        of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock) or
        make any other distributions on, any class of stock of the Corporation
        ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution
        or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock and will not redeem,
        purchase or otherwise, acquire, directly or indirectly, whether
        voluntarily, for a sinking fund, or otherwise any shares of any class of
        stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
        liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock,
        provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may at any
        time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such
        junior class in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from the
        concurrent sale of other shares of stock or any such junior class;

                      (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other
        distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to
        dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the
        Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A
        Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable
        or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of
        all such shares are then entitled;

                      (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for
        consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity

                                       6

        (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
        with the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at
        any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity
        stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking
        junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or
        winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;

                      (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any
        shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a
        parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a
        purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the
        Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the
        Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual
        dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the
        respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result
        in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.

               (B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of
this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in
such manner.

               Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner
whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition
thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series
of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth
herein.

               Section 6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. (A) Upon any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $300 per share, plus
an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon,
whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the "Series A Liquidation
Preference"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A
Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of
shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "Common
Adjustment") equal to 


                                       7


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by
(ii) 100 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph C below to
reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with
respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the "Adjustment
Number"). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation
Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their
ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the
ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and
Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

               (B) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets
available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and
the liquidation preferences of all other series of Preferred Stock, if any,
which rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining
assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in
proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however,
that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the
Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to
the holders of Common Stock.

               (C) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the
Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii)
combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in
each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event
shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation
shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in
which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock
or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares
of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or
changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock,
securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may
be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date
(i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable 

                                       8


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii)
combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in
each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to
the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted
by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               Section 8. Redemption. The outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Board of Directors as a
whole, but not in part, at any time, or from time to time, at a cash price per
share equal to (i) the product of the Adjustment Number times the Average Market
Value (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Common Stock, plus (ii) all
dividends which on the redemption date have accrued on the shares to be redeemed
and have not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
set apart, without interest; provided, however, that if and whenever any
quarter-yearly dividend shall have accrued on the Series A Preferred Stock which
has not been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set
apart, the Corporation may not purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock unless all shares of such stock at the time outstanding
are so purchased or otherwise acquired. The "Average Market Value" is the
average of the closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the 30 day period
immediately preceding the date before the redemption date on the Composite Tape
for New York Stock Exchange Listed Stocks, or if such stock is not quoted on the
Composite Tape, on the New York Stock Exchange, or, if such stock is not listed
on such Exchange, on the principal United States securities exchange registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on which such stock is
listed, or, if such stock is not listed on any such exchange, the average of the
closing bid quotations with respect to a share of Common Stock during such
30-day period on the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
Quotations System or any system then in use, or if no such quotations are
available, the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Board
of Directors in good faith.

               Section 9. Ranking. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank
junior to all other series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock as to the
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any
such series shall provide otherwise.

               Section 10. Amendment. The Corporation shall not create any other
class or classes of stock ranking prior to the Series A preferred Stock either
as to dividends or liquidation,

                                       9

or increase the authorized number of shares of any such other class of stock, or
amend, alter, or repeal any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation
or the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors authorizing
the Series A Preferred Stock so as to adversely affect the preferences, rights
or powers of the Series A Preferred Stock without the affirmative vote of
the holders of more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock, voting separately as one voting group.

               Section 11. Fractional Shares. Series A Preferred Stock may be
issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to
such holders fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends,
participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of
holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

               3. That this amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation as amended and supplemented was adopted on February 25, 1986.

               4. That this amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation as amended and supplemented was duly adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

               IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed and subscribed this
Certificate and do affirm the foregoing as true under the penalties of perjury
this 25th day of February, 1986.

               Articles of Incorporation be amended to read as follows:

                             "The total number of shares of authorized capital
                      stock of the Corporation is thirty-one million
                      (31,000,000), of which one million (1,000,000) shall be
                      shares of Preferred Stock, having a par value of $1 per
                      share and thirty million (30,000,000) shall be shares of
                      Common Stock, having a par value of $1 per share. At the
                      close of business on the effective date of this amendment
                      each issued share of Common Stock, of the par value of $1
                      per share, shall be changed into two (2) issued shares of
                      Common Stock, of the par value of $1 per share."

               2. On March 27, 1969, being not less than twenty-five (25) days

                                   ARTICLE III


        The  total  number  of  shares  of  authorized   capital  stock  of  the
Corporation is sixteen million  (16,000,000),  of which one million  (1,000,000)
shall be  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  having a par  value of $1 per  share and
fifteen million  (15,000,000) shall be shares of Common Stock having a par value
of $1 per share. Upon the effective date of this amendment each share of Capital
Stock of a par value of $6 2/3 per share formerly issued and  outstanding  shall
be a share of Common Stock of a par value of $1 per share.

                               A. PREFERRED STOCK

        1.  Preferred  Stock  may be  issued  from  time  to time in one or more
series, each of such series to have such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations
or restrictions  thereof, as are stated and expressed in this Article and in the
resolution or resolutions  providing for the issue of such series adopted by the
Board of Directors as hereinafter provided.

        2.  Authority  is hereby  expressly  granted to the Board of  Directors,
subject to the provisions of this Article, to authorize the issue of one or more
series of Preferred  Stock and with respect to each series to fix by  resolution
or resolutions providing for the issue of such series, to the full extent now or
hereafter permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia:

                (a) The  number of  shares to  constitute  such  series  and the
         distinctive designation thereof;

                (b) The dividend  rate or rates on the shares of such series and
         any  restrictions,  limitations or conditions  upon the payment of such
         dividends; whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which
         date or dates, or the basis for determining from which date or dates;

                (c) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be redeemable
         and,  if so, the time or times and the price or prices at which and the
         other terms and conditions on which the shares may be redeemed;

                (d) The  payments  or other  distributions  in  addition  to any
         accrued  dividends  thereon  which the holders of shares of such series
         shall  be  entitled  to  receive  upon  the  voluntary  or  involuntary
         liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;

                (e) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be subject to
         the  operation of a purchase,  retirement,  sinking or




<PAGE>
<PAGE>


         other  analogous fund and, if so, the terms and conditions thereof;

                (f)  Whether  or  not  the  shares  of  such  series   shall  be
         convertible  into or  exchangeable  for  shares of any  other  class or
         classes  of stock or shares  of any other  series of stock or any other
         securities and, if so, the price or prices or rate or rates of exchange
         and any adjustments  thereof and the other terms and conditions of such
         conversion or exchange;

                (g)  Whether  or not the  shares of such  series  shall have any
         voting powers,  which in any case shall be  non-cumulative,  other than
         those  provided in  subparagraphs  A5(b) and A5(c) and  paragraph A6 of
         this Article, and, if so, the extent thereof.

        3. All shares of any one series of  Preferred  Stock shall be  identical
with each other in all respects,  except that shares of any one series issued at
different times may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be
cumulative;  and all  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  shall  rank  equally  and be
identical in all respects, except as permitted by the provisions of paragraph A2
of this Article.

        4. In the event of any  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding up of the
Corporation,   whether   voluntary  or   involuntary,   before  any  payment  or
distribution of the assets of the Corporation  shall be made to or set apart for
the  holders  of  shares  of any class or  classes  of stock of the  Corporation
ranking junior to the Preferred  Stock, the holders of the shares of each series
of the  Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to receive  payment of the amount per
share  fixed  by the  Board  of  Directors  in  the  resolution  or  resolutions
authorizing  the issuance of the shares of such series,  plus an amount equal to
all dividends accrued thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders,
but they shall be entitled  to no further  payment.  If,  upon any  liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation,  the assets of the Corporation, or
proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of the Preferred
Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the  preferential  amount  aforesaid,
then such  assets,  or the proceeds  thereof,  shall be  distributed  among such
holders ratably in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable
on such  shares  if all  amounts  payable  thereon  were  paid in full.  For the
purposes of this paragraph A4, the sale,  conveyance,  exchange or transfer (for
cash,  shares of  stock,  other  securities  or other  consideration)  of all or
substantially   all  of  the  property  or  assets  of  the   Corporation  or  a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more  corporations  shall
not be deemed to be a  dissolution,  liquidation  or winding  up,  voluntary  or
involuntary.

        5.  So  long  as  any  of  the  Preferred  Stock  is  outstanding,   the
Corporation:

                (a) will not  declare  or pay,  or set  apart for  payment,  any
        dividends  (other  than  dividends  payable  in  shares  of any

 


<PAGE>
<PAGE>


        class  or  classes  of  stock  of  the Corporation ranking junior to the
        Preferred  Stock),  or make any distribution, on any class or classes of
        stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, and will
        not  redeem,  purchase  or  otherwise  acquire,  directly or indirectly,
        whether voluntarily, for a sinking fund, or otherwise, any shares of any
        class  or  classes  of  stock  of  the Corporation ranking junior to the
        Preferred  Stock,  if  at  the time of making such declaration, payment,
        setting  apart,  distribution,  redemption,  purchase or acquisition the
        Corporation  shall be in default with respect to any dividend payable on
        or  any  obligation  to retire shares of Preferred Stock, provided that,
        notwithstanding  the  foregoing, the Corporation may at any time redeem,
        purchase  or  otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such junior class
        in  exchange  for,  or  out of the net cash proceeds from the concurrent
        sale of, other shares of stock of any such junior class;

                (b) will not,  without  the  affirmative  vote of the holders of
        more  than  66  2/3%  of the  shares  of  Preferred  Stock  at the  time
        outstanding,  given in person or by proxy,  at a meeting  called for the
        purpose,  at which the holders of the  Preferred  Stock,  regardless  of
        series,  shall vote separately as a class, or the written consent of the
        holders of all the outstanding  shares of Preferred Stock (i) create any
        other class or classes of stock  ranking  prior to the  Preferred  Stock
        either as to dividends or liquidation, or increase the authorized number
        of shares of any such  other  class of stock,  or (ii)  amend,  alter or
        repeal of any of the  provisions  of this  Article  so as  adversely  to
        affect the preferences, rights or powers of the Preferred Stock; and

                (c) will not,  without  the  affirmative  vote of the holders of
        more than 66 2/3% of the shares of any adversely  affected series of the
        Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, at
        a meeting  called for the purpose or the written  consent of the holders
        of all the outstanding shares of such series (the holders of such series
        of the  Preferred  Stock  consenting  or  voting,  as the  case  may be,
        separately  as a class),  amend,  alter or repeal any of the  provisions
        herein  or in the  resolution  or  resolutions  adopted  by the Board of
        Directors  authorizing  the issue of such series as  adversely to affect
        the preferences, rights or powers of the Preferred Stock of such series.

        6. If and whenever  dividends on the Preferred Stock shall be in arrears
and the  arrears  shall  aggregate  an  amount at least  equal to six  quarterly
dividends  upon  such  shares,  the  holders  of  the  Preferred  Stock,  voting
separately  as a class  regardless of series,  shall be entitled,  at any annual
meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof, or at a special
meeting of the holders of the Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided, to
elect two 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>

directors.  At  any  time  while the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a
class,  are  entitled to elect two directors as herein provided,  they shall not
be  entitled to participate with the holders of the Common Stock in the election
of any other  directors.  Whenever  all  arrears in  dividends  on the Preferred
Stock then outstanding  shall  have been paid and dividends thereon for the then
current   dividend   period  shall  have  been  paid,  or  declared  and  a  sum
sufficient  in  payment  thereof  set  apart,  the right of the  holders  of the
Preferred Stock to elect two directors  shall cease,  subject always to the same
provisions  for the  vesting of such  voting  rights in the case of any  similar
future arrearages in dividends.

        At any time after  such  voting  power  shall have been so vested in the
holders of the Preferred Stock the Secretary of the  Corporation  may, and, upon
the  written  request of the  holders of record of 10% or more of the  Preferred
Stock  then  outstanding  addressed  to  him  at  the  principal  office  of the
Corporation in the United States shall, call a special meeting of the holders of
the  Preferred  Stock for the election of the directors to be elected by them to
be held  within 30 days  after  such  call and at the place and upon the  notice
provided by law and in the By-Laws for the holding of meetings of  stockholders;
provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be required to call such special
meeting in the case of any such  request  received  less than 90 days before the
date fixed for any annual  meeting of  stockholders  or special  meeting held in
lieu  thereof.  If any such  special  meeting  required to be called as provided
shall not be called by the  Secretary  within 30 days  after the  receipt of any
such request,  then the holders of record of 10% or more of the Preferred  Stock
then  outstanding  may  designate  in writing  one of their  number to call such
meeting,  and the person so  designated  may call such meeting to be held at the
place and upon the notice above  provided and for that purpose shall have access
to  the  stock  ledger  of the  Corporation.  No  such  special  meeting  and no
adjournment thereof shall be held on a date later than 30 days before the annual
meeting  of the  stockholders  or  special  meeting  held in lieu  thereof  next
succeeding the time when the holders of the Preferred  Stock become  entitled to
elect directors as above  provided.  If any such special meeting shall be called
as above provided, or if the holders of Preferred Stock shall become entitled to
elect  directors  as above  provided at any annual  meeting of  stockholders  or
special meeting held in lieu thereof, then, by vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of the Preferred  Stock which are present or  represented
by proxy at such  meeting,  the  then  authorized  number  of  directors  of the
Corporation  shall  be  increased  by  two,  and  at  such  meeting,  and at all
subsequent  annual  meetings of  stockholders  or special  meetings held in lieu
thereof  until the  holders of the  Preferred  Stock  shall be  divested of such
voting  power as above  provided,  the holders of the  Preferred  Stock shall be
entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for, but any directors so
elected shall not hold office beyond the next annual meeting of  stockholders or
special  meeting held in lieu thereof next  succeeding the meeting at which such
directors  are  elected.  Whenever the holders of the  Preferred  Stock shall be
divested  of the  voting  power as above  provided,  the  terms of office of all
persons  elected as directors by the holders of the




<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Preferred  Stock as a class shall  forthwith  terminate  and the number of the
Board of  Directors  shall be reduced accordingly.

        7. The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and
as  declared  by the  Board of  Directors,  out of any funds  legally  available
therefor,  preferential cash dividends,  at the rate or rates fixed by the Board
of Directors in the resolution or resolutions  authorizing the various series of
Preferred  Stock,  payable in equal  quarterly  installments on the first day of
February,  May, August and November of each year. Dividends in full shall not be
declared  or paid or set apart for  payment  on the  Preferred  Stock of any one
series for a dividend period  terminating on any dividend date unless  dividends
in full have been  declared  or paid or set apart for  payment on the  Preferred
Stock of all series  (other than series with respect to which  dividends are not
cumulative from a date prior to such dividend date) for the respective  dividend
periods  terminating on such dividend  date.  When the dividends are not paid in
full on all series of the Preferred  Stock, the shares of all series shall share
ratably  in the  payment  of  dividends,  including  accumulations,  if any,  in
accordance  with the sums which would be payable on said shares if all dividends
were declared and paid in full. Accruals of dividends shall not bear interest.

                                 B. COMMON STOCK

        1. Except as provided by the laws of the  Commonwealth  of Virginia,  by
these Articles of Incorporation or by the resolution or resolutions of the Board

        THESE ARTICLES OF MERGER, made and entered into this 26th day of
January, 1960, by and between UNION BAG - CAMP PAPER CORPORATION (hereinafter
sometimes called "Union Bag - Camp") and the Directors thereof, parties of the
first part, and RIVER RAISIN PAPER COMPANY (hereinafter sometimes called "River

        Union Bag - Camp is a Virginia corporation, organized under the laws of
Virginia pursuant to an agreement of merger recorded October 30, 1944, between
Camp Manufacturing Company, a Virginia corporation, and Chesapeake - Camp
Corporation, a Virginia corporation, under the name of Chesapeake - Camp
Corporation. Its name was changed to Camp Manufacturing Company, Incorporated,
by an amendment to its charter on July 14, 1945, and its charter was
subsequently amended on the 16th day of December, 1946. Its name was further
changed to Union Bag - Camp Paper Corporation, and its charter was further
amended, pursuant to an agreement of merger with Union Bag & Paper Corporation
recorded July 12, 1956. Its executive offices are at 233 Broadway, New York, New
York, and its principal office is located in the County of Isle of Wight, near

consists of 10,000,000 shares of the par value of $6 2/3 each, of which
7,382,930 shares are outstanding on the date of these Articles.

        River Raisin is a Michigan corporation, organized under the laws of
Michigan pursuant to Articles of Incorporation dated June 24, 1910, and its

        Union Bag - Camp and River Raisin (hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "Constituent Corporations") were organized for such purposes as permit their
merger in accordance with the laws of Virginia and Michigan.

        The respective Boards of Directors of the Constituent Corporations, in
pursuance of the plan of reorganization of both of said Corporations, deem it
desirable, to the end that wider diversification of business and product, more
efficient use of facilities and greater economies in operation may be realized
and otherwise and generally for the advantage and welfare of the said
Corporations and their several and respective stockholders, to merge River
Raisin into Union Bag - Camp, under and pursuant to

                                       1


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the laws of the State of Michigan and of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the
plan of merger hereinafter described, all as hereinafter provided.

        NOW, THEREFORE, THESE ARTICLES WITNESSETH: That in consideration of the
premises and of the mutual agreements, provisions, covenants and promises herein
contained, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto that River
Raisin shall be merged into Union Bag - Camp, and Union Bag Camp shall continue
in existence as the surviving corporation under the laws of Virginia with the
name of Union Bag - Camp Paper Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the
"Corporation"). The parties hereto, by these presents, hereby prescribe the
terms and conditions of the said merger and the mode of carrying the same into
effect, which terms and conditions and mode of carrying the same into effect the
parties hereto do mutually and severally agree and covenant to observe, keep and
perform: that is to say:

                                    ARTICLE I

        The charter of Union Bag - Camp as heretofore amended, and as set forth
in Exhibit A hereto, shall continue in effect as the charter of the Corporation
after the merger becomes effective and until further amended pursuant to the
laws of Virginia.

                                   ARTICLE II

        After the merger becomes effective and until otherwise determined by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, the business of River Raisin shall be
continued as a division of the Corporation under the River Raisin name.

                                   ARTICLE III

        1. Merger Subject to Approval. These Articles of Merger are entered into
subject to the approval of, and shall be submitted to, the stockholders of the
respective Constituent Corporations, as provided by law, at meetings which shall
be held as hereinafter provided, and subject to written approval of The
Prudential Insurance Company of America, as required by outstanding loan
agreements with River Raisin, to be given prior to the filing date, as same is
defined in Section 8 of this Article III. The Constituent Corporations shall do
all such other acts and things as shall be necessary or desirable in order to
effectuate the merger.

        2.     Effect of Merger upon Stock of Constituent
Corporations.  When the merger becomes effective:

               (a) Each share of Capital Stock (par value $6 2/3 per share) of
        Union Bag - Camp, which shall be issued and

                                       2

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        outstanding shall continue to be one share of Capital Stock (par value
        $6 2/3 per share) of the Corporation; and

               (b) Each share of Capital Stock of River Raisin (par value $5 per
        share) which shall be issued and outstanding (excluding any shares then
        held in the treasury of River Raisin, which shares shall cease to exist
        and shall be cancelled) shall be thereby convened into five-sixths (5/6)
        of a share of Capital Stock (par value $6 2/3 per share) of the
        Corporation.

        At any time after the date of issuance of a Certificate of Merger by the
State Corporation Commission of Virginia, each holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates theretofore representing Capital Stock of River
Raisin may surrender the same to the Corporation, and such holder shall be
entitled, upon such surrender, to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or
certificates representing the number of full shares of Capital Stock of the
Corporation into which the shares of stock of River Raisin theretofore
represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall have been
converted as aforesaid. Such exchange shall be at the expense of the
Corporation. Until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate which, prior to
the effective date of the merger, represented shares of stock of River Raisin
shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of the full
shares of stock of the Corporation into which the same shall have been so
converted; provided, however, that no dividend payable to the holders of record
of Capital Stock of the Corporation as of any date after the merger becomes
effective shall be paid to a holder of a River Raisin certificate or
certificates until such certificate or certificates shall be surrendered, but
upon surrender of any such certificate or certificates, the amount of dividends
which have theretofore become payable but have not been paid with respect to the
number of full shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation represented by such
certificate or certificates shall be paid to the holder in whose name the
certificate or certificates for Capital Stock of the Corporation shall be
issued.

        The Corporation shall not be required to issue a certificate for any
fraction of a share of its Capital Stock resulting from conversion of River
Raisin Capital Stock. After the date of issuance of a Certificate of Merger by
the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, and until June 30, 1960, the
Corporation shall make arrangements, at the expense of the Corporation, for the
sale of fractional shares and for the completion of full shares by the purchase
of additional fractional shares. Pursuant to such arrangements, all fractional
shares not sold or completed prior to July 1, 1960 shall be sold on that date
for the account of the holders thereof.

        3.     Restrictions on Action by River Raisin.  Unless these
Articles of Merger shall be terminated and abandoned pursuant to
the provisions hereof, River Raisin shall not without the prior
written consent of Union Bag - Camp:
               (a) Take any action or enter into any transaction out of the
        ordinary course of business other than the construction of a new plant

        and the disposition of the three (3) shares of Florida Gulf Fibre
        Company held by it;

        4. Effect of Merger on Property. When the merger becomes effective, all
the property, rights, privileges, franchises, leases, contracts, patents,
trade-marks, licenses, registrations and other assets of every kind and
description of River Raisin shall be transferred to, vested in and devolved upon
the Corporation, without further act or deed, and all property, rights and every
other interest of River Raisin shall be as effectively the property of the
Corporation as they were of River Raisin. River Raisin hereby agrees, from time
to time as and when requested by Union Bag - Camp or by its successors or
assigns, to execute, or cause to be executed, all such deeds and instruments,
and to take, or cause to be taken, such further or other action as the
Corporation may deem necessary or desirable in order to vest in and confirm to
the Corporation title to, and possession of, any property of River Raisin
acquired or to be acquired by reason of or as a result of the merger, and
otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes hereof, and the proper officers
and directors of River Raisin and the proper officers and directors of the
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of River Raisin or otherwise to
take any and all such action: provided, however, that no such deed or other
instrument need be delivered to Union Bag - Camp prior to the filing date as

Directors of River Raisin Paper Company will amend the by-laws
of River Raisin by adding the following provision:

        date of any meeting of the stockholders, or the date of the payment of
        any dividend, or

<PAGE>

        the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when
        any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect

        determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at
        any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend or
        allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect to any such

        of or to vote at such meeting or to receive payment of such dividend or
        allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be.

        After the merger becomes effective, the by-laws of Union Bag - Camp, as

of Directors of the Corporation, all pension and group insurance arrangements of
the Constituent Corporations shall continue for the benefit of the employees and
retired employees of each of the Constituent Corporations to which they apply
and shall remain separate and exclusively for the benefit of such employees.

        7.  Termination and Abandonment.  Anything herein or
elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, these Articles of
Merger may be terminated and abandoned:

               shall not have ruled that the merger will not result in
               recognized gain or loss or taxable income to either of the
               Constituent Corporations or (except to the extent of the proceeds
               of sale of fractional shares held by River Raisin stockholders)

               course of business entered into by Union Bag - Camp after the

               substantial adverse change in the nature of the business or in

               (d) By the Board of Directors of Union Bag - Camp, at any time
        prior to the filing date if, in the opinion of such Board, the merger is

        of River Raisin shall possess (provided that the merger shall not be
        deemed impracticable unless objection and demand for payment shall have
        been duly filed pursuant to the laws of Michigan by holders of more than

                                   ARTICLE III


        The total number of shares of authorized capital stock of the
Corporation is sixteen million (16,000,000), of which one million (1,000,000)
shall be shares of Preferred Stock having a par value of $1 per share and
fifteen million (15,000,000) shall be shares of Common Stock having a par value
of $1 per share. Upon the effective date of this amendment each share of Capital
Stock of a par value of $6 2/3 per share formerly issued and outstanding shall
be a share of Common Stock of a par value of $1 per share.

                               A. PREFERRED STOCK

        1. Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series, each of such series to have such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof, as are stated and expressed in this Article and in the
resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series adopted by the
Board of Directors as hereinafter provided.

        2. Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors,
subject to the provisions of this Article, to authorize the issue of one or more
series of Preferred Stock and with respect to each series to fix by resolution
or resolutions providing for the issue of such series, to the full extent now or
hereafter permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia:

               (a)    The number of shares to constitute such series and
the distinctive designation thereof;

               (b) The dividend rate or rates on the shares of such series and
any restrictions, limitations or conditions upon the payment of such dividends;
whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date or dates, or
the basis for determining from which date or dates;

               (c) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be redeemable
and, if so, the time or times and the price or prices at which and the other
terms and conditions on which the shares may be redeemed;

               (d) The payments or other distributions in addition to any
accrued dividends thereon which the holders of shares of such series shall be
entitled to receive upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation;

               (e) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be subject to
the operation of a purchase, retirement, sinking or other analogous fund and, if
so, the terms and conditions thereof;

               (f) Whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of any other class or classes of stock or shares
of any other series of stock or any other securities and, if so, the price or
prices or rate or rates 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


of exchange and any adjustments thereof and the other terms and conditions of
such conversion or exchange;

               (g) Whether or not the shares of such series shall have any
voting powers, which in any case shall be noncumulative, other than those
provided for in subparagraphs A5(b) and A5(c) and paragraph A6 of this Article,
and, if so, the extent thereof.

        3. All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall be identical
with each other in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at
different times may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be
cumulative; and all shares of Preferred Stock shall rank equally and be
identical in all respects, except as permitted by the provisions of paragraph A2
of this Article.

        4. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or
distribution of the assets of the Corporation shall be made to or set apart for
the holders of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation
ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, the holders of the shares of each series
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the amount per
share fixed by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions
authorizing the issuance of the shares of such series, plus an amount equal to
all dividends accrued thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders,
but they shall be entitled to no further payment. If, upon any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the assets of the Corporation, or
proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of the shares of the Preferred
Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid,
then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among such
holders ratable in accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable
on such shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the
purposes of this paragraph A4, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for
cash, shares of stock, other securities or other consideration) of all or
substantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation or a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more corporations shall
not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or
involuntary.

        5.     So long as any of the Preferred Stock is outstanding,
the Corporation:

               (a) will not declare or pay, or set apart for payment, any
        dividends (other than dividends payable in shares of any class or
        classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred
        Stock), or make any distribution, on any class or classes of stock of
        the Corporation ranking junion to the Preferred Stock, and will not
        redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, whether
        voluntarily, for a sinking fund, or otherwise, any shares of any class
        or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred
        Stock, if at the time of making such declaration, payment, setting
        apart, distribution, redemption, purchase or acquisition the Corporation
        shall be in default with respect




<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        to any dividend payable on or any  obligation to retire
        shares of Preferred Stock provided that, notwithstanding the
        foregoing, the Corporation may at any time redeem,
        purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such junior class
        in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from the concurrent
        sale of, other shares of stock of any such junior class;

               (b) will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of more
        than 66 2/3% of the shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding,
        given in person or by proxy, at a meeting called for the purpose, at
        which the holders of the Preferred Stock, regardless of series, shall
        vote separately as a class, or the written consent of the holders of all
        the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (i) create any other class or
        classes of stock ranking prior to the Preferred Stock either as to
        dividends or liquidation, or increase the authorized number of shares of
        any such other class of stock, or (ii) amend, alter or repeal any of the
        provisions of this Article so as adversely to affect the preferences,
        rights or powers of the Preferred Stock; and

               (c) will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of more
        than 66 2/3% of the shares of any adversely affected series of the
        Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, at
        a meeting called for the purpose or the written consent of the holders
        of all the outstanding shares of such series (the holders of such series
        of the Preferred Stock consenting or voting, as the case may be,
        separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions
        herein or in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
        Directors authorizing the issue of such series so as adversely to affect
        the preferences, rights or powers of the Preferred Stock of such series.

        6. If and whenever dividends on the Preferred Stock shall be in arrears
and the arrears shall aggregate an amount at least equal to six quarterly
dividends upon such shares, the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class regardless of series, shall be entitled, at any annual
meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof, or at a special
meeting of the holders of the Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided, to
elect two directors. At any time while the holders of the Preferred Stock,
voting as a class, are entitled to elect two directors as herein provided, they
shall not be entitled to participate with the holders of the Common Stock in the
election of any other directors. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for
the then current dividend period shall have been paid, or declared and a sum
sufficient in payment thereof set apart, the right of the holders of the
Preferred Stock to elect two directors shall cease, subject always to the same
provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar
future arrearages in dividends.






<PAGE>
<PAGE>



        At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the
holders of the Preferred Stock the Secretary of the Corporation may, and, upon
the written request of the holders of record of 10% or more of the Preferred
Stock then outstanding addressed to him at the principal office of the
Corporation in the United States shall, call a special meeting of the holders of
the Preferred Stock for the election of the directors to be elected by them to
be held within 30 days after such call and at the place and upon the notice
provided by law and in the By-Laws for the holding of meetings of stockholders;
provided, however, that the Secretary shall not be required to call such special
meeting in the case of any such request received less than 90 days before the
date fixed for any annual meeting of stockholders or special meeting held in
lieu thereof. If any such special meeting required to be called as provided
shall not be called by the Secretary within 30 days after the receipt of any
such request, then the holders of record of 10% or more of the Preferred Stock
then outstanding may designate in writing one of their number to call such
meeting, and the person so designated may call such meeting to be held at the
place and upon the notice above provided and for that purpose shall have access
to the stock ledger of the Corporation. No such special meeting and no
adjournment thereof shall be held on a date later than 30 days before the annual
meeting of the stockholders or special meeting held in lieu thereof next
succeeding the time when the holders of the Preferred Stock become entitled to
elect directors as above provided. If any such special meeting shall be called
as above provided, or if the holders of Preferred Stock shall become entitled to
elect directors as above provided at any annual meeting of stockholders or
special meeting held in lieu thereof, then, by vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the shares of the Preferred Stock which are present or represented
by proxy at such meeting, the then authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall be increased by two, and at such meeting, and at all
subsequent annual meetings of stockholders or special meetings held in lieu
thereof until the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be divested of such
voting power as above provided, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to elect the additional directors so provided for, but any directors so
elected shall not hold office beyond the next annual meeting of stockholders or
special meeting held in lieu thereof next succeeding the meeting at which such
directors are elected. Whenever the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be
divested of the voting power as above provided, the terms of office of all
persons elected as directors by the holders of the Preferred Stock as a class
shall forthwith terminate and the number of the Board of Directors shall be
reduced accordingly.

        7. The holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and
as declared by the Board of Directors, out of any funds legally available
therefor, preferential cash dividends, at the rate or rates fixed by the Board
of Directors in the resolution or resolutions authorizing the various series of
Preferred Stock, payable in equal quarterly installments on the first day of
February, May, August and November of each year. Dividends in full shall not be
declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred Stock of any one
series for a dividend period terminating on any dividend date unless dividends
in full have been declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Preferred
Stock of all series 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


(other than series with respect to which dividends are not
cumulative from a date prior to such dividend date) for the respective dividend
periods terminating on such dividend date. When the dividends are not paid in
full on all series of the Preferred Stock, the shares of all series shall share
ratably in the payment of dividends, including accumulations, if any, in
accordance with the sums which would be payable on said shares if all dividends
were declared and paid in full. Accruals of dividends shall not bear interest.

                                 B. COMMON STOCK

        1. Except as provided by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, by
these Articles of Incorporation or by the resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation authorizing any series of Preferred Stock, the
exclusive voting power for all purposes shall be vested in the holders of Common
Stock. Should the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of
Preferred Stock or any series of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding be
required for any purpose, the vote or consent of the holders of Common Stock
shall not also be required unless the action to be taken would adversely affect
the preferences, rights or powers of the Common Stock or unless such vote or
consent or holders of Common Stock would be required even if there were no
Preferred Stock.

        2. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be entitled, after payment or
provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation and
the amounts to which the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled, to
share ratably in the remaining net assets of the Corporation.

                                PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

        No stockholder shall have any preemptive or preferential right to
subscribe for or purchase any of the authorized shares of stock of the
Corporation, whether unissued or in the treasury, or any obligations or other
securities convertible into or carrying any option or other right to subscribe
for or purchase any of said shares of the stock of the Corporation, or any
optional or other right to subscribe for or purchase any of the foregoing,
whether the same be issued for cash, property, services or otherwise and
whenever the same may be issued or sold.

        NOW, THEREFORE, THESE ARTICLES WITNESSETH: That in consideration of the

Raisin shall be merged into Union Bag - Camp, and Union Bag - Camp shall
continue in existence as the surviving corporation under the laws of Virginia
with the name of Union Bag - Camp Paper Corporation (hereinafter referred to as
the "Corporation"). The parties hereto, by these presents, hereby prescribe the
terms and conditions of the said merger and the mode of carrying the same into
effect, which terms and conditions and mode of carrying the same into effect the
parties hereto do mutually and severally agree and covenant to observe, keep and
perform: that is to say:

                                    ARTICLE I

        The charter of Union Bag - Camp as heretofore amended, and as set forth
in Exhibit A hereto, shall continue in effect as the charter of the Corporation
after the merger becomes effective and until further amended pursuant to the
laws of Virginia.

                                   ARTICLE II

        After the merger becomes effective and until otherwise determined by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, the business of River Raisin shall be
continued as a division of the Corporation under the River Raisin name.

                                   ARTICLE III

        1. Merger Subject to Approval. These Articles of Merger are entered into
subject to the approval of, and shall be submitted to, the stockholders of the
respective Constituent Corporations, as provided by law, at meetings which shall
be held as hereinafter provided, and subject to written approval of The
Prudential Insurance Company of America, as required by outstanding loan
agreements with River Raisin, to be given prior to the filing date, as same is
defined in Section 8 of this Article III. The Constituent Corporations shall do
all such other acts and things as shall be necessary or desirable in order to
effectuate the merger.

        2.     Effect of Merger upon Stock of Constituent Corporations.
 When the merger becomes effective:

               (a) Each share of Capital Stock (par value $6 2/3 per share) of
        Union Bag - Camp, which shall be issued and outstanding shall continue
        to be one share of Capital Stock (par value $6 2/3 per share) of the
        Corporation; and

               (b) Each share of Capital Stock of River Raisin (par value $5 per
        share) which shall be issued and outstanding (excluding any shares then
        held in the treasury of River Raisin, which shares shall cease to exist
        and shall be cancelled) shall be thereby converted into five-sixths
        (5/6) of a share of Capital Stock (par value $6 2/3 per share) of the
        Corporation.






<PAGE>
<PAGE>



        At any time after the date of issuance of a Certificate of Merger by the
State Corporation Commission of Virginia, each holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates theretofore representing Capital Stock of River
Raisin may surrender the same to the Corporation, and such holder shall be
entitled, upon such surrender, to receive in exchange therefore a certificate or
certificates representing the number of full shares of Capital Stock of the
Corporation into which the shares of stock of River Raisin theretofore
represented by the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall have been
converted as aforesaid. Such exchange shall be at the expense of the
Corporation. Until so surrendered, each outstanding certificate which prior to
the effective date of the merger, represented shares of stock of River Raisin
shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of the full
shares of stock of the Corporation into which the same shall have been so
converted; provided, however, that no dividend payable to the holders of record
of Capital Stock of the Corporation as of any date after the merger becomes
effective shall be paid to a holder of a River Raisin certificate or
certificates until such certificate or certificates shall be surrendered, but
upon surrender of any such certificate or certificates, the amount of dividends
which have theretofore become payable but have not been paid with respect to the
number of full shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation represented by such
certificate or certificates shall be paid to the holder in whose name the
certificate or certificates for Capital Stock of the Corporation shall be
issued.

        The Corporation shall not be required to issue a certificate for any
fraction of a share of its Capital Stock resulting from conversion of River
Raisin Capital Stock. After the date of issuance of a Certificate of Merger by
the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, and until June 30, 1960, the
Corporation shall make arrangements, at the expense of the Corporation, for the
sale of fractional shares and for the completion of full shares by the purchase
of additional fractional shares. Pursuant to such arrangements, all fractional
shares not sold or completed prior to July 1, 1960 shall be sold on that date
for the account of the holders thereof.

        3.     Restrictions on Action by River Raisin.  Unless these
Articles of Merger shall be terminated and abandoned pursuant to
the provisions hereof, River Raisin shall not without the prior
written consent of Union Bag - Camp:

               (a) Take any action or enter into any transaction out of the
        ordinary course of business other than the construction of a new plant
        in the Benton Harbor, Michigan area at a cost not in excess of $500,000
        and the disposition of the three (3) shares of Florida Gulf Fibre
        Company held by it;

               (b)    Issue or sell, or grant rights to purchase or
        subscribe to, any equity securities of River Raisin; or

               (c) Pay or declare any dividend, or make any distribution, other
        than a regular quarterly dividend at a 


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        rate not in excess of twenty (20) cents per share of its Capital Stock.

        4. Effect of Merger on Property. When the merger becomes effective, all
the property, rights, privileges, franchises, leases, contracts, patents,
trade-marks, licenses, registrations and other assets of every kind and
description of River Raisin shall be transferred to, vested in and devolved upon
the Corporation, without further act or deed, and all property, rights and every
other interest of River Raisin shall be as effectively the property of the
Corporation as they were of River Raisin. River Raisin hereby agrees, from time
to time as and when requested by Union Bag - Camp or by its successors or
assigns, to execute, or cause to be executed, all such deeds and instruments,
and to take, or cause to be taken, such further or other action as the
Corporation may deem necessary or desirable in order to vest in and confirm to
the Corporation title to, and possession of, any property of River Raisin
acquired or to be acquired by reason of or as a result of the merger, and
otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes hereof, and the proper officers
and directors of River Raisin and the proper officers and directors of the
Corporation are fully authorized in the name of River Raisin or otherwise to
take any and all such action; provided, however, that no such deed or other
instrument need be delivered to Union Bag - Camp prior to the filing date as
defined in Section 8 of this Article III.

        5.     By-laws.  On or before February 15, 1960, the Board of
Directors of River Raisin Paper Company will amend the by-laws of
River Raisin by adding the following provision:

               The close of business of any day which (not counting said day) is
        at least five (5) and not more than forty (40) full days prior to the
        date of any meeting of the stockholders, or the date of the payment of
        any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when
        any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect
        may be fixed by the Board of Directors as the record date for the
        determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at
        any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend or
        allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect to any such
        change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, and only stockholders
        of record on the record date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice
        of or to vote at such meeting or to receive payment of such dividend or
        allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be.

After the merger becomes effective, the by-laws of Union Bag Camp, as they may
be amended from time to time, shall be the by-laws of the Corporation.

        6. Employee Benefit Plans. River Raisin's Profit-Sharing Plan for
Salaried Employees shall be amended prior to the filing date so as to provide
that after the merger becomes effective contributions to the Plan shall be
determined with respect to the profits of the River Raisin Division of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have all the powers
of the 


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Board of Directors of River Raisin under River Raisin's Profit-Sharing Plan for
Salaried Employees, including the power to amend or terminate the Plan for years
subsequent to 1959. Unless and until otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, all pension and group insurance arrangements of
the Constituent Corporations shall continue for the benefit of the employees and
retired employees of each of the Constituent Corporations to which they apply
and shall remain separate and exclusively for the benefit of such employees.

        7.     Termination and Abandonment.  Anything herein or
elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding, these Articles of
Merger may be terminated and abandoned:

               (a) By mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of the
        Constituent Corporations, at any time prior to the filing
        date;

               (b) By the Board of Directors of either Constituent Corporation,
        at any time after April 15, 1960 and prior to the filing date if;

                      (i) The office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
               shall not have ruled that the merger will not result in
               recognized gain or loss or taxable income to either of the
               Constituent Corporations or (except to the extent of the proceeds
               of sale of fractional shares held by River Raisin stockholders)
               to their stockholders, and

                      (ii)   Such Constituent Corporation shall not have
               received an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to its
               Board, to that effect;

               course of business entered into by Union Bag Camp after the date
               hereof there has been, in the opinion of the Board, any
               substantial adverse change in the nature of the business or in
               the financial condition of Union Bag - Camp, or

                      (ii) There has been any change in Union Bag -
               Camp's present dividend rate;

               (d) By the Board of Directors of Union Bag - Camp, at any time
        prior to the filing date if, in the opinion of such Board, the merger is
        impracticable by reason of the possible exercise of such statutory
        rights, if any, of appraisal and payment for stock as the stockholders
        of River Raisin shall possess (provided that the merger shall not be
        deemed impracticable unless objection and demand for payment shall have
        been duly filed pursuant to the laws of Michigan by holders of more than
        20,000 shares of River Raisin Capital Stock); or

               time the merger was submitted to a vote of the stockholders of
               River Raisin, and

                      (ii) Has failed for five (5) days after request therefor,
               delivered to River Raisin by Union Bag - Camp, satisfactory to
               its Board of Directors, representing and warranting that he
               intends to hold for investment the Capital Stock of the
               Corporation in which he acquires a beneficial interest by reason
               of the merger, and indemnifying Union Bag - Camp against any and
               all costs, liabilities and expense the Corporation may incur
               under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with
               the merger in the event he fails to retain such Capital Stock for

following resolutions, declaring that the following amendment to the charter of
the corporation and the reduction of its actually issued and outstanding stock
are advisable:

               RESOLVED that, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of this
        corporation, it is advisable to amend one charter of this corporation,
        for the purpose of changing its name from Chesapeake-Camp Corporation to
        Camp Manufacturing Company, Incorporated, and to reduce its actually
        issued and outstanding stock as hereinafter set forth, and to that end,
        that application be made to the State Corporation Commission of Virginia
        to amend the charter of this corporation granted by the State
        Corporation Commission of Virginia on the 30th day of October, 1944, so
        that paragraph (a), when so amended, shall, in lieu of paragraph (a) of
        the original charter, read as follows:

               "(a) NAME.

               "The name of the corporation shall be CAMP MANUFACTURING
        COMPANY, INCORPORATED." And

               RESOLVED further, that the five hundred twenty (520) shares of
        the five (5) per centum preferred stock of this corporation and the one
        hundred forty-seven thousand (147,000) shares of its common stock,
        heretofore acquired by it and now held by it in its treasury as treasury
        stock, be retired and cancelled.

               And the said Board of Directors thereupon passed a further
resolution, ordering a meeting of the stockholders to be called on the 10th day
of July, 1945, according to law, to take action upon the foregoing resolutions
proposing to amend the

and outstanding stock.

               2. That on the 10th day of July, 1945, there was held at the
office of the corporation, in the County of Isle of Wight, near Franklin,

constituting the only class of the stock of the corporation having voting power;
and that the foregoing resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors, proposing

                                       of
                    CAMP MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INCORPORATED

                                   ----------

               W H E R E A S CAMP MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INCORPORATED, a

hereby certify as follows:

               1. That on the 26th day of November, 1946, after due notice to
all of the directors of the corporation, there was held at the office of the

of the Board of Directors of the aforesaid corporation, at which meeting more
than a majority of the directors were present in person and unanimously passed
the following resolutions, declaring that the following amendment to the charter
of the corporation and the exchange of stock hereinafter provided for are
advisable:

                      RESOLVED, that is the judgment of the Board of Directors
        of this corporation, it is advisable to amend the charter of this
        corporation for the purpose of eliminating from its charter the
        provisions for preferred capital stock (all of its preferred stock
        heretofore outstanding having been redeemed and cancelled), of creating
        an additional claim of stock, to be known as Common Stock B, and of
        providing the method by which additional stock of the corporation may be
        issued, and to that end, that application be made to the State
        Corporation Commission of Virginia to amend the charter of this
        corporation granted by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia on
        the 30th day of October, 1944, and amended by an order of the said State
        Corporation Commission of Virginia entered on the 14th day of July,
        1945, so that the said charter, then so amended, shall, in lieu of the
        charter granted on the 30th day of October, 1944, as amended on the 14th
        day of July 1945, read as follows:

the purpose, cause to be issued any or all of the shares of the stock of the
corporation, of either or both classes, not theretofore issued, to such persons,
firms or corporations and for such consideration as the said Board of Directors
may deem advisable, and none of the holders of the said stock, of either class,
shall have any preemptive right to subscribe for any or the stock to be issued.

               "(e) DURATION.

               "The period for the duration of the corporation is

        Camp is a Virginia corporation, organized under the laws of Virginia
pursuant to an agreement of merger recorded October 30, 1944, between Camp

a Virginia corporation, under the name of Chesapeake-Camp Corporation (which

permit their merger in accordance with the laws of New Jersey and Virginia.

        The respective Boards of Directors of the Constituent Corporations, in

        NOW, THEREFORE, THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH: That in consideration of the
premises and of the mutual agreements, provisions, covenants and promises herein
contained, it is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto that Union
shall be, and it is hereby, merged with Camp, and Camp shall continue in
existence as the surviving corporation under the laws of Virginia with the name

                                   ARTICLE III

                       CERTAIN PROVISIONS AS TO THE MERGER

        1. Submission to Stockholders and Filing. This Agreement of Merger is
entered into subject to the approval of, and shall be 




<PAGE>
<PAGE>


submitted to, the stockholders of the respective Constituent Corporations, as
provided by law, at meetings which shall be held as soon as practicable and in
no event later than August 31, 1956. The Constituent Corporations shall do all
such other acts and things as shall be necessary or desirable in order to
effectuate the merger; provided that neither of the Constituent Corporations may
require the other to file this Agreement of Merger with the proper authorities
of the States of New Jersey and Virginia until the conditions set forth in
Paragraph 7(b) of this Article III are fulfilled or are waived by the Board of
Directors of such other corporation.

        2.     Effect of Merger upon Stock of Constituent Corporations.  
Upon the effective date of the merger:

               (a) Each share of Capital Stock (par value $62/3 per share) of
        Union, which shall be issued and outstanding (excluding any shares then
        held in the treasury of Union, which shares shall cease to exist and
        shall be cancelled) shall be thereby converted into one share of Capital
        Stock (par value $62/3 per share) of the Corporation.

               (b) Each share of Common Stock and Common Stock B of Camp (each
        of the par value of $5 per share) which shall be issued and outstanding
        (excluding any shares then held in the treasury of Camp, which shares
        shall cease to exist and shall be cancelled) shall be thereby converted
        into 1.75 shares of Capital Stock (par value $62/3 per share) of the
        Corporation.

               (c) Upon the consummation of the merger there will be outstanding
        $47,564,520 aggregate par amount of Capital Stock divided into 7,134,678
        shares, having a par value of $62/3 each, and the amount of stated
        capital of the Corporation at that time is hereby fixed at $47,564,520.

        After the effective date of the merger, each holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates theretofore representing Capital Stock of Union or
Common Stock or Common Stock B of Camp may surrender the same to the
Corporation, and such holder shall be entitled, upon such surrender, to receive
in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing the number of
shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation into which the shares of stock of
Union or Camp theretofore represented by the certificate or certificates so
surrendered shall have been converted as aforesaid. Such exchange shall be at
the expense of the Corporation. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
certificate which, prior to the effective date of the merger, represented shares
of stock of Union or Camp, shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to
evidence ownership of the shares of stock of the Corporations into which the
same shall have been so converted; provided, however, that unless and until any
such outstanding Camp certificates shall be so surrendered, no dividend payable
to the holders of record of Capital Stock of the Corporation as of any date
subsequent to the effective date of the merger shall be paid to the holders of
outstanding Camp certificates, but upon such surrender of any such outstanding
certificate or certificates, the amount of such unpaid dividends shall be paid
to the holder in whose name the certificate 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


or certificates for Capital Stock of the Corporation shall be issued.

        The Corporation shall not be required to issue any fraction of a share
of Capital Stock of the Corporation, but may require any stockholder to sell or
complete any fraction of a share, or may provide for scrip or other such
substitute as may be approved by the Corporation.

        3. Restrictions on Action Prior to Effective Date of Merger. Prior to
the effective date of the merger, neither of the Constituent Corporations will
engage in any activity or transaction other than in the ordinary course of
business without first obtaining the approval of the other. The Constituent
Corporations will not declare or pay any dividends prior to the effective date
of the merger, other than regular quarterly dividends at regular rates, or issue
or acquire any of their own stock.

        4. Effect of Merger on Property. Upon the effective date of the merger,
all the property, rights, privileges, franchises, leases, contracts, patents,
trade-marks, licenses, registrations and other assets of every kind and
description of Union shall be transferred to, vested in and devolved upon the
Corporation, without further act or deed, and all property, rights and every
other interest of the Constituent Corporations. Union hereby agrees, from time
to time as and when requested by the Corporation or by its successors or
assigns, to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such
deeds and instruments, and to take, or cause to be taken, such further or other
action as the Corporation may deem necessary or desirable in order to vest in
and confirm to the Corporation title to, and possession of, any property of
Union acquired or to be acquired by reason of or as a result of the merger
herein provided for, and otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes hereof,
and the proper officers and directors of Union and the proper officers and
directors of the Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Union or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

        5.     By-laws. The by-laws of Camp, as they may be amended from time
to time, shall be the by-laws of the Corporation.

        6. Employee Benefit Plans. Until otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, all pension and group insurance arrangements of
the Constituent Corporations shall continue for the benefit of the employees and
retired employees of each of the Constituent Corporations to which they apply
and shall remain separate and exclusively for the benefit of such employees.

        7.     Termination and Abandonment.  Anything herein or elsewhere to
the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement of Merger may be terminated and
abandoned:

               (a)  by mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of the
Constituent Corporations, at any time prior to the effective date of the merger;






<PAGE>
<PAGE>



               (b) by the Board of Directors of either of the Constituent
        Corporations, at any time prior to the effective date of the merger, if
        either the Internal Revenue Service of the United States or the
        Department of Taxation of Virginia has not issued a ruling satisfactory
        to such Board of Directors that such merger will not result in
        recognized gain or loss or taxable income to either of the Constituent
        Corporations or their stockholders.

        In the event of termination and abandonment of this Agreement of Merger
by the Board of Directors of either of the Constituent Corporations as above
provided, written notice shall be given to the other and thereupon this
Agreement of Merger shall become wholly void and of no effect and there shall be
no liability on the part of either of the Constituent Corporations or its Board
of Directors or stockholders.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Union Bag & Paper Corporation and Camp Manufacturing
Company, Incorporated, have caused this Agreement of Merger to be signed in
their respective corporate names by their respective officers, thereunto duly
authorized, and have caused their respective seals to be hereunto affixed and

written.

        stock so guaranteed by each guarantor as it redeems of the total amount
        of the said preferred stock then outstanding. The shares to be redeemed
        of the stock so guaranteed by any guarantor, as well as the shares to be
        redeemed of the stock not so guaranteed, shall be selected by lot. In
        order to make more readily distinguishable the certificates for stock
        which may be guaranteed, as hereinabove provided, by one corporation or
        person from that so guaranteed by another corporation or person the
        corporation may, insofar as may not be otherwise provided by law, print
        or lithograph the certificates for the said preferred stock to be
        guaranteed by one corporation or person on a different colored paper
        from the certificates for that guaranteed by any other corporation or
        person, or otherwise print, stamp or impose thereon such distinguishing
        legends or endorsements as it may deem appropriate. The term "accrued
        dividends", wherever used in this certificate with reference to the
        preferred stock of the corporation, shall be deemed to mean the amount
        which shall be equal 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        to Five per centum per annum on the par value of
        the said stock from the date or dates of its original issue to the date
        of redemption, purchase or distribution, as the case may be, less the
        aggregate amount of all dividends which shall have been paid on the said
        preferred stock to such date. So long as any of the said preferred stock
        is issued and outstanding the corporation shall not, without the consent
        of the holders of at least sixty (60) per centum of the said preferred
        stock then outstanding (a) execute any mortgage or deed of trust upon
        its real estate or tangible personal property or issue any debentures or
        other similar obligations; provided, however, that this restriction
        shall not apply to the deed of trust or first mortgage extended to
        secure an issue of bonds in aggregate principal amount of $1,400,000.00
        constituting a part of the original financing of the corporation, nor to
        any deed of trust or mortgage which may hereafter be desired to be
        executed for the purpose of or in connection with the refunding part,
        nor shall this restriction apply to or prevent the purchase by the
        corporation of property subject to any lien o liens thereon or the
        execution by the corporation of a deed of trust or mortgage on any
        property required by it subsequent to the date of the original issue of
        the said preferred stock, or the making of bank loans or other
        obligations in the usual course of business, or he creation of any other
        indebtedness payable within one year after the same has been incurred;
        or (b) declare any dividends upon its common stock the payment whereof,
        at the time of such payment, will reduce the current assets of the
        corporation, as shown by its books, below two hundred (200) per centum
        of its current liabilities, as likewise shown."

               And the said Board of Directors thereupon passed a further
resolution, ordering a meeting of the stockholders to be called on the 4th day
of February, 1941, according to law, to take action upon the foregoing
resolution proposing to amend the charter of the corporation.

        2. That on the 4th day of February, 1941 there was held at the office of
the corporation, in Isle of Wight County, near Franklin, Virginia, a meeting of
the stockholders, after notice in writing had been given to each of the
stockholders of record by serving the same on them personally or by mailing it

               The capital stock of the merged corporation is to be divided into
two (2) classes: first, preferred stock, having a par value of One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) per share, to which the maximum amount is to be One Million

               The preferred stock shall have in all respects the same
preferences, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications on by the preferred
stock now authorized under the charter of Chesapeake- Camp Corporation, as
amended. The preferred stock is to be so issued as to bear dividends at the rate
of five (5) per centum per annum on the par value from the date of the original
issue, payable quarterly on the last day of January, April, July and October of
each calendar year, the [illegible] dividends to be cumulative and to be paid
before any dividends shall be paid on the common stock, the self preferred
stock, to the extent of its par value and accrued dividends, to have preference
over the common stock in any distribution, voluntary or otherwise, of the
corporate assets, in that action or otherwise; but except to the extent of its
par value and accrued dividends, the preferred stock shall have no share in the
earnings or other assets of the corporation, and the holders thereof shall not
be entitled to any vote thereon, except in the event and to the extent that is
hereinafter provided in [illegible] in the payment of dividends. The holders of
such preferred stock shall, however, be entitled to the same notice of
[illegible] of 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


common stock, and shall have the right to [illegible] of all
stockholders meeting out of the [illegible] stock and to entitled, but only in
and when secured by the Board of Directors, to dividends at the rate of five (5)
percent per annum, payable quarterly, when [illegible] provided. The payment
[illegible] provided, at the rate of five (5) per centum per annum, of dividends
on such preferred stock to be holders thereof, even though not earned by the
corporation or not declared by its Board of Directors, and the liquidation of
the said preferred stock at its par value and accrued dividends to the date of
such liquidation, may be guaranteed by one or more other corporations or by such
other person or persons as may be willing to make such guaranty; and in the
event the corporation shall fail to declare and pay any quarterly dividend as
hereinabove provided, and such dividend be paid or caused to be paid by any such
guarantor or guarantors, such guarantor or guarantors so making any such payment
shall be subrogated to the right of the holder of such preferred stock on which
such payment is so made thereafter to receive such dividend as and when paid by
the corporation, and when such dividend be thereafter declared by the
corporation it shall be by it paid directly to such guarantor or guarantors,
without further authorization from the holder of the said preferred stock; and
likewise in the event, upon liquidation, the corporation shall fail to pay to
the holder of any such preferred stock the par value thereof and accrued
dividends thereon to the time of such payment, and such amount as may not be so
paid by the corporation, or any part thereof, be paid or caused to be paid by
any such guarantor or guarantors, such guarantor or guarantors so making any
such payment shall be subrogated to the right of the holder of said preferred


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

stock on which such payment is so made, but only after said holder shall have
received the full par value of said stock and accrued dividends, to the extent
that such payment, in whole or in part, is so made by such guarantor or
guarantors, thereafter to receive such payments for or on account of the
liquidation value of said stock as and when made by the corporation, and when
any such payments be made by the corporation, after said holder shall have
received the full par value of said stock and accrued dividends, they shall be
made directly to such guarantor or guarantors, without further authorization
from the holder of the said preferred stock. Any such guarantor shall have the
right to purchase from the holder thereof any or all of the preferred stock on
which the dividends and the liquidation of par value and accrued dividends are
so guaranteed by such guarantor, at the price, [illegible line] portion of the
said preferred stock, at the time of such purchase. Should any such guarantor at
any time purchase less than the total amount of said preferred stock so
guaranteed by it or him the shares so purchased shall be selected by lot. Should
at any time there be default in the payment by the corporation and by any
guarantor or guarantors thereof of eight (8) quarterly dividends on the said
preferred stock, whether or not any of such quarterly dividends have been
declared by the Board of Directors of the corporation, then and in such event,
and during the continuance of such dfault, but no longer, the holder of
preferred stock on which there shall be such default shall have the right to one
vote per share, equally with the holders of the common stock, at all
stockholders meetings.
               The said preferred stock shall be subject to redemption, in whole
or in part, by the corporation on any dividend payment 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


date, after not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the holder
or holders thereof, delivered in person or mailed to such holder or holders at
his or their post office address as the same appears on the records of the
corporation, at the price of One Hundred Three Dollars ($103.00) per share,
together with accrued and unpaid dividends until the time of such redemption,
whether such dividends shall previously have been declared by the Board of
Directors of the corporation or not. If, after such notice and call for
redemption the holder or holders of such referred stock as may be so called
shall fail to present the said stock at the time and place designated by such
notice for its redemption, then the holder or holders thereof shall not be
entitled to further dividends thereon, unless the corporation shall fail to
redeem the said stock at the price herein specified and at the place specified
in said notice, at the time fixed for such redemption or thereafter, upon
presentation of certificates for the said stock, properly assigned. All stock
redeemed by the corporation under the provisions hereof shall be cancelled and
shall not again be issued. In the event the payment of dividends on any such
preferred stock and the payment of the par value thereof and accrued dividends
upon liquidation be guaranteed, as hereinabove provided, by one or more
corporations or persons, corporation shall redeem the same proportion of the
said preferred stock so guaranteed by each guarantor as it redeems of the total
amount of the said preferred stock then outstanding. The shares to be redeemed
of the stock so guaranteed by any guarantor, as well as the shares to be
redeemed for the stock not so guaranteed, shall be selected by lot. In order to
make more readily distinguishable the certificates for stock which may be
guaranteed, as hereinabove provided, by one


<PAGE>
<PAGE>

corporation or person from that so guaranteed by another corporation or person
the corporation may, insofar as may not be otherwise provided by law, print or
lithograph the certificates for the said preferred stock to be guaranteed by one
corporation or person on a different colored paper from the certificates for
that guaranteed by any other corporation or person, or otherwise print,s tamp or
impose thereon such distinguishing legends or endorsements as it may deem
appropriate. The term "accrued dividends", wherever used herein with reference
to the preferred stock of the corporation, shall be deemed to mean that amount
which shall be equal to five (5) per centum per annum on the par value of the
said stock from the date or dates of its original issue to the date of
redemption, purchase or distribution, as the case may be, less the aggregate
amount of all dividends which shall have been paid on the said preferred stock
to such date. So long as any of the said preferred stock is issued and
outstanding the corporation shall not, without the consent of the holders of at
least sixty (60) per centum of the said preferred stock then outstanding: (a)
execute any mortgage or deed of trust upon it real estate or tangible personal
property or issue any debentures or other similar obligations; provided,
however, that this restriction shall not apply to the deed of trust or first
mortgage executed to secure an issue of bonds in aggregate principal amount of
One Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,400,000.00) constituting a part of
the original financing of Chesapeake-Camp Corporation, nor to any deed of trust
or mortgage which has heretofore been executed, or which may hereafter be
desired to be executed for the purpose of or in connection with the refunding or
refinancing of the indebtedness thereby secured, in whole or in part, nor shall
this restriction





<PAGE>
<PAGE>

apply to or prevent the purchase by the corporation of property
subject to any lien or liens any property acquired by it subsequent to the date
of the original issue of the said preferred stock, or the making of bank loans
or other obligations in the usual course of business, or the creation of any
other indebtedness payable within one year after the same has been incurred; or
(b) declare any dividends upon its common stock the payment whereof, at the time
of such payment, will reduce the current assets of the corporation, as shown by
its books, below two hundred (200) per centum of its current liabilities, as
likewise shown.

               (e) DURATION.

               The period for the duration of the corporation is unlimited.

               (f) OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

                          CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

                                       of

                           CHESAPEAKE-CAMP CORPORATION

                           ---------------------------


               This is to certify that we do hereby associate ourselves to
establish a corporation under and by virtue of the provisions of the Code of
Virginia and the Acts amendatory thereof, for the purposes and under the
corporate name hereinafter mentioned, and to that end we do by this, our
certificate, set forth as follows:

               (a) NAME.

               The name of the corporation is to be Chesapeake-Camp Corporation.

               (b) PRINCIPAL OFFICE.

               The principal office of the corporation in this state is to be
located in the Town of Franklin, Southampton County, Virginia.

               (c)  PURPOSES.

               The purposes for which the corporation is formed are to
manufacture, prepare, compound, fabricate, buy, sell and generally deal in
paper, wood, pulp, kraft board and all manner of wood, timber and paper products
and articles made therefrom or in connection therewith; to obtain, purchase or
otherwise acquire formulae, patients and secret processes for the manufacture,
preparation and treatment of timber and wood products or other articles of any
kind, and to operate under, sell, assign, grant licenses in respect of or
otherwise turn the same to account; to [illegible] into, carry out or otherwise
turn to account contracts of every kind; to acquire, hold, mortgage, lease,
convey, develop or otherwise use or dispose of real and personal property of
every kind and description; and in general to carry on and conduct such
operations and enterprises, and do any and all such things in connection
therewith as may be permitted or authorized by the laws of the State of
Virginia, which may be incidental to the purposes of the corporation.

               (d)  CAPITAL STOCK.

               The capital stock of the corporation is to be divided into two
classes: First, preferred stock, of which the maximum amount is to be One
Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,250,000.00); and second, common
stock, of which the maximum amount is to be One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00);
the said stock, of both kinds, to have a par value of One Hundred Dollars
($100.00) per share.






<PAGE>
<PAGE>



               The preferred stock is to be so issued us to bear dividends at
the rate of five (5) per centum per annum on its par value from the date of its
original issue, payable quarterly on the 1st days of January, April, July and
October of each calendar year, the said dividends to be cumulative and to be
paid before any dividends shall be paid on the common stock, the said preferred
stock, to the extent of its par value and accrued dividends, to have preference
over the common stock in any distribution, voluntary or otherwise, of the
corporate assets, in liquidation or otherwise; but except to the extent of its
par value and accrued dividends, the preferred stock shall have no share in the
earnings or other assets of the corporation, and the holders thereof shall not
be entitled to any vote thereon, except in the event and to the extent that is
hereinafter provided in case default shall be made in the payment of dividends.
The holders of such preferred stock until, however, be entitled to the same
notice of stockholders' meetings as may be provided for the holders of common
stock, and shall have the right to attend any and all stockholders' meetings.
Out of the net profits or surplus of the corporation, as the same are determined
by the Board of Directors, the holders of record of preferred stock shall be
[illegible], but only as and when declared by the Board of Directors, to
dividends at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable quarterly as
hereinabove provided. The payment quarterly as hereinabove provided, at the rate
of five per centum per annum, of dividends on such referred stock to the holders
thereof, even though not earned by the corporation or not declared by its Board
of Directors, and the liquidation of the said preferred stock of its par value
and accrued dividends to the date of such liquidation, may be guaranteed by one
or more other corporations or by such other person or persons as may be willing
to make such guaranty; and in the event the corporation shall fail to declare
and pay any quarterly dividend as hereinabove provided, and such dividend be
paid or caused to be paid by any such guarantor or guarantors, such guarantor or
guarantors so making any such payment shall be subrogated to the right of the
holder of such preferred stock on which such payment is so made thereafter to
receive such dividend as and then paid by the corporation, and when such
dividend thereafter declared by the corporation it shall be by paid directly to
such guarantor or guarantors, without further authorization from the holder of
the said preferred stock; and likewise in the event, upon liquidation, the
corporation shall fail to pay to the holder of any such preferred stock the par
value thereof and accrued dividends thereon to the time of such payment, and
such amount as may not be so paid by the corporation, or any part thereof, be
paid or caused to be paid by any such guarantor or guarantors, such guarantor or
guarantors so making any such payment shall be subrogated to the right of the
holder of said preferred stock on which such payment is so made, but only after
said holder shall have received the full par value of said stock and accrued
dividends, to the extent that such payment, in whole or in part, is so made by
such guarantor or guarantors, thereafter to receive such payments for or on
account of the liquidation value of said stock as and when made by the
corporation, and when any such payments be made by the corporation, after said
holder shall have received the full par value of said stock and accrued
dividends, they shall be made directly to such guarantor or guarantors, without
further authorization from the holder of the said preferred stock. Any




<PAGE>
<PAGE>



[illegible] guarantor shall have the right to purchase from the holder thereof
any of [illegible] preferred stock on which the dividends and the liquidation of
par value [illegible] accrued dividends are so guaranteed by such guarantor, at
the price, at the time and after the notice herein provided for the redemption
by the corporation of the said preferred stock, at the time of such purchase.
Should any such guarantor at any time purchase less than the total amount of
said preferred stock so guaranteed by it or him the shares so purchased shall be
selected by lot. Should at any time there be default in the payment by the
corporation and by any guarantor or guarantors thereof of eight (8) quarterly
dividends on the said preferred stock, whether or not any of such quarterly
dividends have been declared by the Board of Directors of the corporation, then
and in such event, and during the continuance of such default but no longer, the
holder of preferred stock on which there shall be such default shall have the
right to one vote per share, equally with the holders of the common stock, at
all stockholders' meetings.

        The said preferred stock shall be subject to redemption, in whole or in
part, by the corporation on any dividend payment date, after not less than
thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the holder or holders thereof,
delivered in person or mailed to such holder or holders at his or their post
office address as the same appears on the records of the corporation, at the
price of One Hundred Five Dollars ($105.00) per share if such stock be redeemed
on or before January 1, 1942, and at the price of One Hundred Three Dollars
($103.00) per share if redeemed thereafter, and in each case together with
accrued and unpaid dividends until the time of such redemption, whether such
dividends shall previously have been declared by the Board of Directors of the
corporation or not. If, after such notice and call for redemption, the holder or
holders of such preferred stock as may be so called shall fail to present the
said stock at the time and place designated by such notice for its redemption,
then the holder or holders thereof shall not be entitled to further dividends
thereon, unless the corporation shall fail to redeem the said stock at the price
herein specified and at the place specified in such notice, at the time fixed
for such redemption or thereafter, upon presentation of certificates for the
said stock, properly assigned. All stock redeemed by the corporation under the
provisions hereof shall be cancelled and shall not again be issued. In the event
the payment of dividends on any such preferred stock and the payment of the par
value thereof and accrued dividends upon liquidation be guaranteed, as
hereinabove provided, by one or more corporations or persons, then and in the
event of the partial redemption of the said preferred stock the corporation
shall redeem the same proportion of the stock so guaranteeed by each guarantor
as it redeems of the total amount of the said preferred stock then outstanding.
The shares to be redeemed of the stock so guaranteed by any guarantor, as well
as the share to be redeemed of the stock not so guaranteeed, shall be selected
by lot. In order to make more readily distinguishable the certificates for stock
which may be guaranteed, as hereinabove provided, by one corporation or person
from that so guaranteed by another corporation or person the corporation may,
insofar as may not be otherwise provided by law, print or lithograph the
certificates for the said preferred stock to be guaranteed by one 





<PAGE>
<PAGE>


corporation or person on a different colored paper from the certificates for
that guaranteed by any other corporation or person, or otherwise print, stamp or
impose thereon such distinguishable legends or endorsements as it may deem
appropriate. The term "accrued dividends", wherever used in this certificate
with reference to the preferred stock of the corporation, shall be deemed to
mean that amount which shall be equal to five per centum per annum on the par
value of the said stock from the date or dates of its original issue to the date
of redemption, purchase or distribution, as the case may be, less the aggregate
amount of all dividends which shall have been paid on the said preferred stock
to such date. So long as any of the said preferred stock is issued and
outstanding the corporation shall not, without the consent of the holders of at
least sixty (60) per centum of the said preferred stock then outstanding (a)
execute any mortgage or deed of trust upon its real estate or tangible personal
property or issue any debentures or other similar obligations; provided,
however, that this restriction shall not apply to the deed of trust or first
mortgage executed to secure an issue of bonds in aggregate principal amount of
$1,400,000.00 constituting a part of the original financing of the corporation,
nor to any deed of trust or mortgage which may hereafter be desired to be
executed for the purpose of or in connection with the refunding or refinancing
of the indebtedness thereby secured, in whole or in part, nor shall this
restriction apply to or prevent the purchase by the corporation of property
subject to any lien or liens thereon or the execution by the corporation of a
deed of trust or mortgage on any property acquired by it subsequent to the date
of the original issue of the said preferred stock, or the making of bank loans
or other obligations in the usual course of business, or the creation of any
other indebtedness payable within one year after the same has been incurred; or
(b) declare any dividends upon its common stock the payment whereof, at the time
of such payment, will reduce the current assets of the corporation, as shown by
its books, below two hundred (200) per centum of its current liabilities, as
likewise shown.

               (e) DURATION.

               The period for the duration of the corporation is unlimited.

               (f) OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

               The names and residences of the officers and directors of the
corporation who, unless sooner changed by the stockholders, are for the first
year to manage the affairs of the corporation, are as follows:

of Directors may fix in advance a date, not exceeding 70 days preceding the date

                                   ARTICLE II

                                  Stockholders

        SECTION 1. Annual Meeting.  The annual meeting of the  stockholders  for
the election of directors and for the  transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting shall be held at such time,  and at such place,
either  within or without the State of  Virginia,  as may be  designated  in the
notice  thereof,  on the  last  Tuesday  in  April  of each  year if not a legal
holiday, but if a legal holiday, then on the next succeeding business day.

        At the  annual  meeting of  stockholders,  only such  business  shall be
conducted as shall have been  properly  brought  before the meeting (a) by or at
the  direction  of the  Board  of  Directors  or (b) by any  stockholder  of the
Corporation  who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with
the procedures set forth in this Section 1.

        In  addition  to  any  other  applicable  requirements,   for  business,
including the nomination of one or more persons for election as Directors, to be
properly  brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder,  such  stockholder
must have given timely  advance  written  notice thereof to the Secretary of the
Corporation. The Secretary shall deliver timely received notices to the Board of
Directors or a committee  designated  by the Board for review.  To be timely,  a
stockholder's  notice  must  be  received  by the  Secretary  at  the  principal
executive  offices of the Corporation not less than sixty days in advance of the
day established in accordance with this Section as the day of the annual meeting
of stockholders.  In calculating days in advance of the annual meeting,  the day
of such annual  meeting shall not be included so that  stockholders  shall


                                      -4-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

begin counting with the day immediately  preceding the day of the annual meeting
which,  for  purposes  of such  calculation,  shall be one day in advance of the
annual meeting.

        A  stockholder's  notice  to the  Secretary  shall  set forth as to each
matter of business the stockholder  proposes to bring before the annual meeting:
(a) a  description  of the  business  intended  to be brought  before the annual
meeting,  including the text of any resolution to be presented,  and the reasons
for conducting such business at the annual meeting;  (b) the name and address of
the  stockholder  proposing  such  business;   (c)  a  representation  that  the
stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the  Corporation  entitled to vote
at the annual meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting
to bring the business specified in the notice before the meeting;  (d) the class
and  number of shares of stock of the  Corporation  owned (i) of record and (ii)
beneficially  by  the  stockholder;   and  (e)  any  material  interest  of  the
stockholder in the business to be brought before the meeting.

        A  stockholder's  notice of intent to make a  nomination  of one or more
persons for election as Directors at the annual meeting of  stockholders  shall,
in addition to the information required above, set forth as to each such person:
(a) the name,  age and business and residence  addresses of the person;  (b) the
principal  occupation or  employment of the person;  (c) the class and number of
shares of stock of the Corporation  owned (i) of record and (ii) beneficially by
the person; (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings  between the
stockholder  and the person and any other  person or persons  (naming such other
person or persons)  pursuant to which the  nomination or  nominations  are to be
made by the  stockholder;  (e) such other  information  regarding  the person as
would be  required to be included  in a proxy  statement  filed  pursuant to the
proxy  rules of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  had the person been
nominated by the Board of Directors;  and (f) the written  consent of the person
to serve as a Director of the 


                                      -5-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Corporation if so elected. The Corporation may require any stockholder proposing
to nominate  one or more persons for election as Directors to furnish such other
information  as may  reasonably be required by the  Corporation to determine the
eligibility of each such person to serve as a Director of the Corporation.

        In the event a stockholder  attempts to bring business before the annual
meeting  without  complying with the provisions of this Section 1, the presiding
officer of the meeting  shall  determine  and  declare to the  meeting  that the
business was not properly  brought  before the meeting,  and such business shall
not be transacted.

        SECTION 2. Special Meeting. Special meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be held at any time and at any place,  within or without
the State of Virginia,  designated in the call thereof,  whenever  called by the
Board of Directors,  the Chairman of the Board,  the President,  or as otherwise
provided by law.

        SECTION 3. Notice.  Written notice of every annual or special meeting of
the  stockholders,  stating  the place,  day and hour and  purpose  or  purposes
thereof,  shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat,
either  personally  or by mailing the notice to him at his address as it appears
on the  stock  transfer  books  of  the  Corporation.  Where  such  notice  of a
stockholders'  meeting  includes as a purpose  thereof action with respect to an
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or a reduction of stated capital or a
plan of  merger  or  consolidation,  such  notice  shall be given in the  manner
hereinabove provided,  but at least 25 and not more than 50 days before the date
of any such  meeting and any such notice shall be  accompanied  by a copy of the
proposed amendment or plan of reduction or merger or consolidation.

consist of a majority of the stock of the Corporation  entitled to vote, present
in person or by proxy,  unless  otherwise  required  by law or the  Articles  of
Incorporation.  If at the time and place of the  meeting  there is present  less
than a  quorum,  a  majority  of the  stock  present  in  person or by proxy and
entitled  to vote,  shall have power to adjourn  the  meeting  from time to time
without  notice  until a quorum is secured,  and  thereupon  any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

        SECTION 5.  Organization.  All  meetings  of the  stockholders  shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence, by the President,
or in his absence, by the Chairman of the Executive  Committee.  In case none of
such officers of the Corporation  shall be present,  a chairman shall be elected
by the vote of a majority of the stock present in person or by proxy entitled to
vote. The Secretary of the  Corporation or an Assistant  Secretary  shall act as
secretary of every such meeting when present,  and in the absence of either, the
presiding  officer may appoint any other  officer of the  Corporation  to act as
Secretary.

        SECTION 6. Inspectors. At any annual or special meeting of stockholders,
inspectors of election may be appointed by the presiding  officer of the meeting
for the purpose of opening and closing the polls, receiving and taking charge of
proxies,  and  receiving  and counting the ballots or the votes of  stockholders
otherwise  given and shall in writing  certify to the returns.  No candidate for
election as director shall be appointed or act as inspector.

                                    Directors
        SECTION 1. Number,  Vacancy.  The property,  business and affairs of the
Corporation  shall be managed by a Board of 12  directors.  Except as  otherwise
provided by law or in these  By-laws or in the  Articles of  Incorporation,  the
directors  shall be  elected  by the  stockholders  at each  annual  meeting  of
stockholders and shall serve until the next succeeding  annual meeting and until
their  successors  shall have been  elected.  In the event of any vacancy in the
directors resulting from death,  resignation,  disqualification,  an increase by
thirty  percent  (30%) or less in the number of  directors  last  elected by the
stockholders,  or other cause,  the  remaining  directors,  although less than a
quorum, by an affirmative vote of a majority thereof, may fill such vacancy.

        SECTION 2. Regular  Meeting.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held,  either  within or without the State of  Virginia,  as shall from
time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.  After there has been such
determination  and notice  thereof has been given to each member of the Board of
Directors, no further notice shall be required for any such regular meeting. The
annual  meeting of the Board of Directors may be held,  without  notice,  on the
same day as and after the annual meeting of the stockholders.

        SECTION 3. Special  Meeting.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors
shall be held, either within or without the State of Virginia, upon the order of
the Board,  or the call of the Chairman of the Board,  the  President,  or three
directors.  The Secretary,  or other officer  performing his duties,  shall give
notice to each  director of the time and place of each  meeting,  by mailing the
same at least two days before the meeting or by  telegraphing or telephoning the

        SECTION 4. Quorum.  A majority of the number of directors fixed by these
By-laws  shall  constitute a quorum for the  transaction  of business  except as
otherwise provided by law or the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, but
a majority of those present at the time and place of any meeting,  although less
than a quorum,  may adjourn from time to time without notice,  until a quorum is
secured.

        SECTION 5. Compensation. The Board of Directors shall have the authority
to  fix  the  compensation  of  the  directors  and  of members of the Executive
Committee and of other committees of the Board.

        SECTION 6.    Indemnification of Officers, Directors and Employees.

             (a)  Each  director  and  officer  of  the  Corporation   shall  be
indemnified  by the  Corporation  against  all  costs  and  expenses  reasonably
incurred by or imposed upon him in connection with or resulting from any action,
suit or  proceeding  to which he may be made a party by  reason  of his being or
having  been a  director  or  officer  of  the  Corporation  (whether  or not he
continues  to be a director  or officer  at the time of  incurring  such cost or
expense),  except in  relation  to matters  as to which a recovery  shall be had
against him by reason of his having been finally  adjudged in such action,  suit
or  proceeding  to have been  derelict  in the  performance  of his duty as such
director or officer. The foregoing  qualification shall not, however,  prevent a
settlement by the Corporation  prior to final  adjudication when such settlement
appears to be in the interest of the Corporation.  The right of  indemnification
herein  provided shall not be exclusive of other rights to which any director or
officer may be entitled as a matter of law.  (Adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation March 3, 1942.)

             (b) As used in the following subsections of this Section 6:

                                      -9-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

                      "Applicant"  means  the  person  seeking   indemnification
pursuant to this Section.

                      "Expenses" includes counsel fees.

                      "Liability"  means  the  obligation  to  pay  a  judgment,
settlement,  penalty, fine, including any excise tax assessed with respect to an
employee  benefit  plan,  or  reasonable  expenses  incurred  with  respect to a
proceeding.

                      "Official capacity" means, (i) when used with respect to a
director,  the office of  director  in the  Corporation;  or (ii) when used with
respect to an individual  other than a director,  the office in the  Corporation
held by the officer or the employment or agency  relationship  undertaken by the
employee or agent on behalf of the Corporation.

                      "Official capacity" does not include service for any other
foreign or  domestic  corporation  or any  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust,
employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.

                      "Party"   includes  an  individual  who  was,  is,  or  is
threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.

                      "Proceeding" means any threatened,  pending,  or completed
action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  whether  civil,  criminal,   administrative  or
investigative and whether formal or informal.

             (c) The  Corporation  shall  indemnify  any  person who was or is a
party to any  proceeding  by reason  of the fact  that he is or was a  director,
officer or employee of the  Corporation,  or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director,  trustee, partner, officer or employee of another
corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise,  against  any  liability  incurred  by him in  connection  with such
proceeding 


                                      -10-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

if (i) he believed,  in the case of conduct in his official  capacity,  that his
conduct was in the best  interests  of the  Corporation,  and in all other cases
that his  conduct was at least not  opposed to its best  interests,  and, in the
case of any criminal proceeding,  had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct
was  unlawful,  (ii) in  connection  with a proceeding by or in the right of the
Corporation,  he was not  adjudged  liable  to the  Corporation,  and  (iii)  in
connection with any proceeding  charging improper benefit to him, whether or not
involving  action in his official  capacity,  he was not adjudged  liable on the
basis  that  personal  benefit  was  improperly  received  by him.  A person  is
considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the  corporation's  request
if his duties to the  corporation  also impose  duties on, or otherwise  involve
services by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan.
A person's  conduct  with  respect to an employee  benefit plan for a purpose he
believed to be in the interests of the  participants  and  beneficiaries  of the
plan is conduct that satisfies the requirements of this subsection.

               (d)  The  termination  of  any  proceeding  by  judgment,  order,
settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of nolo  contendere or its  equivalent,
shall not of itself  create a  presumption  that the  applicant did not meet the
standard of conduct described in subsection (c) of this Section.

               (e) To the extent that the applicant  has been  successful on the
merits or otherwise in defense of any  proceeding  referred to in subsection (c)
of this Section,  or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,  he shall
be  indemnified  against  expenses  actually and  reasonably  incurred by him in
connection therewith.

               (f) Any  indemnification  under  subsection  (c) of this  Section
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation  only as authorized
in the specific case upon


                                      -11-

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

a  determination  that  indemnification  of  the  applicant  is  proper  in  the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
subsection (c).

                      The determination shall be made:

proceeding;

               (iii) By special legal counsel:

                      (A) Selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in

               (g) (i) The  Corporation  may pay for or reimburse the reasonable
expenses  incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance of
final disposition of the proceeding if:

               (A) The applicant  furnishes the Corporation a written  statement
of his good faith  belief that he has met the  standard of conduct  described in
subsection (c);

               (B)  The   applicant   furnishes   the   Corporation   a  written
undertaking, executed personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it is
ultimately determined that he did not meet the standard of conduct; and

               (C) A  determination  is made that the facts  then known to those
making the determination would not preclude indemnification under this Section.

        (ii) The undertaking  required by  subparagraph  (B) of paragraph (i) of
this subsection  shall be an unlimited  general  obligation of the applicant but
need not be secured and may be accepted without  reference to financial  ability
to make repayment.

        (iii)   Determinations   and   authorizations  of  payments  under  this
subsection shall be made in the manner specified in subsection (f).

               (h) The Board of Directors is hereby empowered,  by majority vote
of a quorum of disinterested directors, to cause the Corporation to indemnify or
contract in advance to indemnify any person not  specified in subsection  (c) of

he is or was an agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as an agent of another corporation,  partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,  to the same extent as if such
person were  specified as one to whom  indemnification  is granted in subsection
(c). The  provisions  of

indemnification provided hereafter pursuant to this subsection (h).

               (i) The  Corporation  may  purchase  and  maintain  insurance  to
indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability  assumed by it in
accordance with this Section and may also procure insurance,  in such amounts as
the Board of Directors  may  determine,  on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at
the  request of the  Corporation  as a director,  officer,  employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise,  against any liability  asserted against or incurred by him in
any such  capacity  or  arising  from his  status  as such,  whether  or not the
Corporation  would have power to indemnify him against such liability  under the
provisions of this Section.

               (j) The  Board of  Directors  is  hereby  empowered  to cause the
Corporation  to  contract  in  advance to  indemnify  any  person  specified  in
subsection  (c) of this  Section  provided  that such  contract  does not permit
indemnification  if the  proposed  indemnitee  failed  to meet the  standard  of
conduct set forth in subsection (c).

               (k) Every reference herein to directors,  officers,  employees or
agents shall include former directors,  officers, employees and agents and their
respective  heirs,  executors and  administrators.  The  indemnification  hereby
provided and provided  hereafter  pursuant to the power hereby  conferred on the
Board of  Directors  shall not be  exclusive  of any  other  rights to which any
person may be entitled, including any right under policies of insurance that may
be  purchased  and  maintained  by the  Corporation  or others,  with respect to
claims,  issues or matters in relation to which the  Corporation  would not have
the power to indemnify such person under the provisions of this Section.

taken without a meeting if a written consent,  setting forth the action so to be
taken,  shall be signed by all of the  directors  or all of the  members  of the
committee, as the case may be. Action taken under this Section is effective when
the last  director  signs the consent  unless the consent  specifies a different
effective  date,  in which event the action  taken is  effective  as of the date

                             STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN
                                       FOR
                             NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
                                       OF
                             UNION CAMP CORPORATION

1.      The purpose of the Stock  Compensation  Plan for Non-Employee  Directors
        (the "Plan") of Union Camp Corporation (the "Corporation") is to provide
        competitive remuneration to the Corporation's  non-employee directors so
        as to maintain the  Corporation's  ability to attract and retain  highly
        qualified  individuals  to serve on the Board of Directors and to relate
        the compensation of non-employee directors more closely to the interests
        of the shareholders of the Corporation by increasing the amount of stock
        ownership of the Corporation held by non-employee directors.

2.      This Plan shall become effective on April 24, 1990, provided the Plan is
        approved by  shareholders on such date. If this Plan is not so approved,
        the Plan shall not become effective.

3.      If the Plan becomes effective, each member of the Board of Directors who
        is not an  employee  of the  Corporation  immediately  after each annual
        meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation,  beginning with the 1990
        Annual  Meeting,  shall  receive  whole  shares of  Common  Stock of the
        Corporation  having a fair market  value of  approximately  $5,000.  The
        number of shares of Common  Stock each  non-employee  director  shall be
        entitled to receive  following each annual meeting  thereafter  shall be
        the number  specified in an amendment to the Plan adopted as an Appendix
        thereto by the Board of  Directors at any time prior to, and in the same
        calendar year as, such annual meeting; provided, however, if the Plan is
        not so amended, each non-employee director shall receive whole shares of
        Common Stock having a fair market value of approximately  $5,000. If the
        Plan is so amended,  each  non-employee  director shall receive an equal
        number of whole  shares of Common  Stock the fair market  value of which
        shall not exceed  $40,000 per calendar  year. The total number of shares
        that may be awarded under this Plan is 150,000,  provided that if during
        any fiscal year of the Corporation the shares of Common Stock issued and
        outstanding at the beginning of such fiscal year increase or decrease by
        more than 10% by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse split,
        subdivision, merger, recapitalization, consolidation (whether or not the
        corporation  is the surviving  corporation),  combination or 



<PAGE>
<PAGE>

        exchange  of shares,  separation,  reorganization,  liquidation  or like
        action,  the total number of shares which may be granted under this Plan
        shall be  correspondingly  adjusted.  The shares of stock  awarded under
        this Plan shall be  delivered to each  non-employee  director as soon as
        practicable following the applicable annual meeting.

4.      The Plan shall be  administered  by the Chief  Executive  Officer of the
        Corporation  (the "CEO")  whose  interpretation  and  decision as to any
        question arising under the Plan shall be conclusive.  Recommendations as
        to annual  awards  under the Plan may be made by the CEO to the Board of
        Directors. In making any such recommendation, the CEO shall consider (a)
        the  performance of the  Corporation  and (b) the  remuneration  paid to
        non-employee directors by other corporations of similar size.

5.      All shares of Common Stock of the Corporation to be used for purposes of
        this Plan shall either be newly  issued stock or stock  purchased by the
        Corporation for the benefit of each  non-employee  Director or both. The
        fair market value of newly issued or purchased Common Stock shall be the
        mean of the high and low sales  prices for the Common  Stock as reported
        on the Composite Tape for New York Stock Exchange  issues on the trading
        date preceding the  applicable  annual  meeting of  stockholders  of the
        Corporation  or if there is no sale of the  shares on such  Exchange  on
        said date,  the mean of the bid and asked prices on such Exchange at the
        close of the market on such date  shall be deemed to be the fair  market
        value of the shares.

6.      This  Plan  shall  be  construed  in  accordance  with  the  laws of the
        Commonwealth  of  Virginia.  The  Plan  may  be  amended,  suspended  or
        terminated  at any  time by  action  of the  Board of  Directors  of the
        Corporation,  provided no amendment may (a) increase the maximum  number
        of shares  which may be awarded  under this Plan,  (b) increase the fair
        market value of awards to an annual amount greater than $40,000 for each
        non-employee   director,  (c)  change  the  eligibility  for  awards  to
        individuals  other than  non-employee  directors,  or (d) more than once
        every six  months,  change  the  number of shares of Common  Stock  each
        non-employee director shall be entitled to receive following each annual
        meeting.

INVESTING IN BUSINESS PROFITABILITY In the past six years, we invested more than
$2 billion to grow our businesses and strengthen cost-effectiveness across our
business groups. This includes 30% more capacity in our kraft and fine paper
mills, expansion of converting and chemical plants and cost-reduction
investments.

        At our Franklin mill, which produces business, printing and writing 
papers, we completed the first year of operation of our $85 million fiber
recycling facility. The new plant gives us an additional 100 thousand tons of
capacity a year. The plant uses water recycled from the paper mill, resulting in
no net increase in water usage. Our aim is to use this recycled fiber to produce
our own printing and writing paper. This state-of-the art facility allows us to
efficiently expand our leadership in recycled-content product and meet a growing
market opportunity.

        In addition, Fine Paper benefited from a $63 million machine rebuild
program at the Franklin mill. First grade production in the division increased
by 6% over 1994. This increased production enabled us to use the new recycled
fiber without backing down existing pulp capacity.

        Money was also put to effective use in 1995 with the completion of a 
$160 million black liquor recovery boiler system at our Savannah kraft mill.
This state-of-the-art boiler, which replaces two older ones, is approximately 30
percent more energy-efficient than the previous system and provides a 95%
reduction in sulphur emissions.

        In another timely investment, we began construction of a corrugated
container facility in Hanford, California, to serve West coast markets. When
operational in 1996, the plant will produce heavy-duty corrugated containers for
agricultural products, such as frozen produce and fresh fruit, and industrial
goods such as plastic resins. It's another major step in preserving our
leadership in U.S. bulk packaging.

ACQUISITIONS In early January 1996, we acquired the assets of O'Grady
Containers, Inc., in Fort Worth, Texas. This sheet plant will expand our
geographic ability to serve customers in another growing market -- high-quality
graphics and point-of-purchase displays.

        We also acquired a 16-thousand annual ton corrugated container plant
near Madrid, Spain. The plant, located in the heart of Spain's industrial
region, will provide a better balance to our industrial/agricultural mix in a
country where we have operated for more than 28 years.


        In Turkey, we plan to sign an agreement to create a joint venture 
company with KAV Orman Sanayii A. S. The company, Turkey's fourth largest
producer of corrugated containers, serves a fast-growing market. Our planned
joint venture partner is a subsidiary of the $12.8 billion KOC Holding Company.
The joint venture would be competing in a market that is rapidly transforming
from an agricultural base to a diversified economy, a development which is
creating increased demand for containers. Looking ahead, we will continue to
pursue acquisitions that complement our core strengths, both in the U.S. and
overseas.

FINE PAPER



The Fine Paper Division produces uncoated white paper, market pulp and coated
and uncoated bleached paperboard. The core business is uncoated free sheet used
for business communications and direct mail. Another key product is high-quality
coated and uncoated paperboard for greeting cards, book covers and similar
applications. The Division also produces 100,000 tons of market pulp for sale in
U.S. and world markets. We're a major supplier to converters for computer paper
and direct mail, and are among the world's largest producers of envelope paper.
Business and printing papers are sold mainly through distributors, and the
Division is expanding through retail channels to reach the small and home office
market.


CORE STRENGTHS Two mills in Franklin, Virginia and Eastover, South Carolina make
up one of the industry's most efficient manufacturing operations. Eight machines
provide flexibility to position the business in the highest-opportunity markets.
The Eastover mill is one of the most modern and technologically advanced
printing and writing paper mills in the world. The Division is among the
lowest-cost producers of uncoated free sheet, and is building on its established
lines with a growing position in recycled-content business and communications
papers.


In 1995 Fine Paper turned in record earnings performance. Production reached all
time highs and new product sales advanced sharply. A 100 thousand-ton per year
fiber recycling plant was started up at Franklin. The Division launched a
national television advertising campaign to support Great White Recycled Content
Business Paper's push into the small office/home office market.


 



<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Fine Paper not only achieved record production in 1995, but also managed to keep
product quality at superior levels. At least four major customers honored the
group with prestigious awards in 1995, including Communicolor, which granted
Union Camp its Five Star Supplier Award. This performance, achieved while the
division was running at full capacity, reflects our commitment to provide the
best products and service in the industry.


STRATEGIES The Fine Paper Division is expanding its capability to reach two
fast-growing market segments -- the small office/home office and the corporate
information center. Our increased focus on these segments is part of a broader
commitment to strengthen our marketing initiatives across the fine paper
industry. It's leveraging the low-cost advantage of the Eastover mill and
enhancing customer value with new products made in Franklin. The Division
remains a leading supplier to converters of envelopes, forms and specialty
products and also success-fully targets the commercial printing business. In all
these segments, special emphasis is given to direct marketing applications, a
particular strength for the company. The Division is also expanding into
international markets.


PACKAGING GROUP

The Packaging Group, Union Camp's largest operating unit, is among the country's
leading integrated manufacturers of linerboard, kraft paper and packaging, and
is a significant linerboard exporter. It's a major manufacturer of corrugated
containers, folding cartons, heavy duty shipping sacks and other packaging. Its
five divisions are:


  Kraft Paper and Board Produces nearly 2 million tons a year of linerboard,
kraft paper and saturating kraft from two mills; two thirds is converted by
Union Camp, one third is sold in domestic and export markets.

  Container Division The largest Pack-aging Group converting operation is a
producer of corrugated containers and solid fiber shipping containers and
slipsheets used in a wide range of packaging.

  Flexible Packaging Produces industrial and consumer bags made of paper or film
and produces other non-rigid packaging.

  Folding Carton Manufactures high value-added consumer packaging for cosmetics,
toiletries, pharmaceuticals and food products.

  International Packaging Operates or has an interest in corrugated container
plants in Ireland, Spain, Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico.

CORE STRENGTHS The Group's two kraft mills in Savannah, Georgia and Prattville,
Alabama are among the largest in the world and are located in the wood-rich
Southeast. More than 40 converting operations effectively serve selected
high-growth markets. A growing international business serves Europe, the Middle
East and Latin America.

In 1995 The Packaging Group reported record results for the year. The group
completed a realignment that enables the divisions to focus their collective
strengths on the most attractive opportunities. In what may be an industry
first, both Kraft mills and all container operations are now ISO 9000 certified.
Construction began on a heavy-duty corrugated container facility in Hanford,
California. In January 1996, the Group acquired O'Grady Containers, a high
graphics sheet plant in Fort Worth, Texas. Two retail bag operations and one
coating and labeling operation were closed or sold, as Flexible Packaging
reorganized to better serve selected markets. Inter-national expansion included
a new business development office in Hong Kong, a planned joint venture in
Turkey and the acquisition of a container plant in Spain.

CHEMICAL GROUP

The Chemical Products Division converts chemicals from the pulping process into
a variety of products -- tall oil, fatty acids, rosin acid, dimer acid,
rosin-based ink resins and adhesive tackifiers and polyamid adhesives. Key
markets are adhesives, inks, coatings, lubricants, soaps and personal care
products.

CORE STRENGTHS With three plants in the U.S. and two in the United Kingdom, the
Division is well positioned for international growth. The Division has leading
technological strengths in inks, coatings and adhesive resins, and solid
experience in its core markets. A special strength: hot melt and water based
adhesives, which have environmental benefits and are used in a wide range of
applications.

IN 1995 The Division produced record sales and earnings. Offices were opened in
Hong Kong and Mexico City. It was a big year for capacity improvement, with
major investments in the U.S. and U.K. to better serve customers for dimer,
polyamide and rosin resin capacity. The Division increased dimer capacity by
10%, polyamide by 30% and rosin resin 15% on a global basis. It also developed a
range of new products -- improved ink resins; new polyamid adhesives, inks and
coatings and better rosin resins for the adhesive industry.


STRATEGIES The Division is expanding from its U.S. and European base to markets
in South America and Asia. Growth is also coming from continuous new product
development, including new types of raw materials beyond wood by-products, which
help to soften cyclical impacts.

BUSH BOAKE ALLEN, INC. Bush Boake Allen, a subsidiary of Union Camp, operates as
a free standing corporation. BBA is one of the world's leading compounders of
flavors and fragrances and producers of aroma chemicals. Flavors and fragrances
are produced around the world, while aroma chemicals are produced in the U.K.
and U.S.

CORE STRENGTHS BBA has a strong international position and balanced sales across
major geographic and economic markets. The company has expanded to Bulgaria,
China, Ireland, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Russia and the United Arab Emirates
and now has a presence in 40 countries. A key advantage in world markets is
leading technologies in fragrances and flavor compounding and our historic
strength in high-end seasonings that separate us from commodity markets.

IN 1995 It was BBA's fourth consecutive year of record results. BBA began
construction of a compounding plant near Guangzhou, China, and opened offices in
Brazil and Switzerland.

FOREST RESOURCES GROUP

The Forest Resources Group has the responsibility to create long-term maximum
value from the Company's core resource -- more than 1.5 million acres of
woodlands in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Virginia.


  The Group has three Divisions: Woodlands, which is responsible for supplying
our paper and wood products mills with high-quality, low-cost fiber; Wood
Products, which produces southern pine lumber, plywood and particleboard panels
for industrial and home improvement markets; and The Branigar Organization,
which develops land for residential, recreational and commercial use in selected
Southeastern markets.

CORE STRENGTHS Union Camp's advanced forestry techniques have made its woodlands
among the most productive in the nation. We are fully committed to the
industry's Sustainable Forestry Initiative-- a broad statement of management
principles designed to guide the practice of environmental stewardship. Nine
modern facilities in four states can produce approximately 500 million board
feet of lumber, 240 million square feet of plywood and 120 million square feet
of particleboard a year. These operations are among the most modern and
productive in the industry. The Branigar Organization has an 80 year history,
and brings solid land development experience to the Group. Two of Branigar's
leading residential properties are The Landings at Skidaway Island near
Savannah, Georgia and Champion Hills near Hendersonville, North Carolina.


IN 1995 The Woodlands Division completed its realignment, adopting a matrix
organization well-suited to serving customers across the company. Woodlands also
made plans to acquire 100,000 woodland acres close to Eastover to ensure a
secure source of fiber for that mill. The Division also increased its goals for
its forestry program -- targeting twice the growth from its lands in 40% less
time. A major reorganization of the Folkston, Georgia, lumber mill will be
completed in 1996 at a cost of about $20 million. Output will be increased by
31% and yield by 14%. The Branigar Organization took on greater responsibility
for the management and planning of the company's high-value land in Georgia and
South Carolina and is becoming more active in commercial development.


Strategies The Woodlands Division will continue to develop and practice advanced
forestry techniques in improving the yield from Union Camp lands. The Division
will also consider other low cost sources of fiber -- including potential
sources outside the United States. The Wood Products Division will focus on
improving the productivity and efficiency of its manufacturing operations, while
looking outside current businesses for opportunities to develop new markets. The
Branigar Organization will continue to put more focus on gaining maximum value
from a broader portfolio of Union Camp properties through development,
management or sale.

                                FINANCIAL REVIEW



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Record operating results highlighted the year 1995 with
three of the company's four business segments achieving new earnings highs.
Consolidated net income in 1995 was $451 million or $6.45 per share, four times
the $1.62 per share earned in 1994.

  After several years of eroding prices and sluggish demand, paper product
earnings began to recover in late 1994 and accelerated sharply in early 1995.
Strong demand in domestic and export paper products markets raised prices to
record high levels by mid-year 1995. These prices, coupled with production gains
in the company's mill operations, were the primary factors in the 1995 earnings
performance; however, as the year ended demand and prices declined. Total sales
in 1995 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 24% over 1994 and 35% better than
1993.

  Income from operations in 1995 was $830 million, an increase of $556 million
over 1994 and $618 million above 1993. The operating profit margin was 20% in
1995 compared with 8% and 7% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Income From Operations
(millions of dollars)
1993     $212
1994     $275
1995     $830].

  The 1994 earnings included a gain of $.30 per share on the sale of a minority
interest in the company's Bush Boake Allen flavor and fragrance business;
offsetting this gain were non-recurring charges of $.31 per share, most notably
$.26 per share relating to the write down of assets and disposal of a business.
The earnings improvement in 1994 over 1993 reflected the beginning of a strong
cyclical upturn in paper products driven by global economic expansion and tight
supplies. These conditions remained in place through almost all of 1995.

  Earnings in 1993 were $.72 per share reflecting slow growth in U.S. markets
and excess paper industry capacity compounded by economic weakness overseas.
Earnings included a charge of $.23 per share to reflect the increase in the
corporate income tax rate and a $.04 per share loss from the sale of the school
supplies business offset partially by a gain of $.17 per share from the sale of
land.

  Operating results and other financial information for the company's principal
business segments are presented on page 38. A discussion of these segments
follows.

Paper and Paperboard
Operating Profit
(millions of dollars)
1993     $101
1994     $182
1995     $737].

PAPER AND PAPERBOARD The principal operations in this segment are the two kraft
paper and linerboard mills, the two bleached paper and board mills and the
timberlands which support the mills and wood products operations. Strong
increases in selling prices for the company's major paper products and
production gains at the kraft paper and board mills lifted segment earnings to a
record level. Operating profit in 1995 was $737 million, compared with $182
million in 1994 and $101 million in 1993. Segment sales were $2.6 billion, up
40% over 1994 and 55% above 1993.

Kraft Paper & Board: Favorable worldwide market trends in place since early 1994
continued to provide linerboard operations with earnings growth for most of
1995. Operating profit for the Kraft Paper and Board Division in 1995 increased
over three-fold from the prior year. Average prices for domestic and export
linerboard were up 45% and 67%, respectively, and linerboard shipments were 8%
above 1994. During the second half of 1995, demand slowed as customers worked
down inventories built earlier in 1995. In response, the company took 130,000
tons of downtime. Linerboard selling prices weakened as the fourth quarter
progressed.

  Direct manufacturing costs per ton increased 9% in 1995. These increases were
primarily attributable to higher wood and waste fiber costs. Fixed costs
excluding depreciation increased 5% in 1995.

  Operating profit in 1994 increased six-fold over 1993, due almost entirely to
higher linerboard prices. At the end of 1994, domestic linerboard selling prices
were up 40% from the prior year-end. Price gains in export markets were even
higher. Company linerboard shipments in 1994 were 8% below the prior year
primarily as a result of an unplanned paper machine outage at the Savannah,
Georgia mill.


 



<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Bleached Paper and Board: Operating profit in 1995 increased sharply over the
prior year. The extremely favorable conditions which existed in uncoated free
sheet markets during the latter half of 1994, namely, high order backlogs,
leveling off of imports, and declining inventories, continued through much of
1995. Expanded demand supported price increases which raised selling prices $200
per ton, matching a similar increase in the last six months of 1994; however,
prices weakened in the fourth quarter as paper distributors adjusted their
inventory levels downward. In response, the company took 40,000 tons of downtime
in the fourth quarter. Total shipments of white paper products in 1995 were
level with 1994.

  Direct manufacturing costs per ton increased 8% in 1995, largely the result of
higher recycled waste fiber costs which more than doubled from the prior year.
Depreciation expense was up 8% over 1994 and selling expenses were up
year-to-year.

  In 1994, the year began with severe pricing pressure in the white paper
markets; however, demand strengthened rapidly at the end of the second quarter
and prices began a steady rise. Total shipments of white paper products in 1994
increased 4%, mostly the result of uncoated free sheet volume which was up 6%.
These improvements were not enough to keep operating profit from declining 14%
below 1993.

Packaging Operating Profit
(millions of dollars)
1993     $29
1994     $26
1995     $52].

PACKAGING  The Packaging segment includes the corrugated container, flexible
packaging, and folding carton businesses. Packaging products are produced at 41
locations in the U.S. and 6 locations overseas. Demand for these products was
very strong in 1995. Customer sales were $1.5 billion, up 11% over 1994 and 22%
above 1993. Operating profit was a record $52 million in 1995 compared to $26
million in 1994 before the inclusion of special items including a charge of $14
million to write down certain non-strategic assets. Operating profit was $29
million in 1993.

  The Container Division is the largest unit in this segment operating 27 plants
in the domestic market with sales of almost $900 million in 1995. Primary
products are corrugated containers and solid fiber containers. The division
achieved record sales and earnings in 1995. This was almost entirely the result
of selling prices, which averaged $200 per ton above the prior year. These price
increases allowed the division to build its margin and more than offset the
increasing cost of raw material linerboard consumed. Towards the end of the
fourth quarter, demand began to ease; however, volume for the year 1995 was
unchanged from 1994.


  The company's Flexible Packaging Division is the next largest operating unit
in this segment. It produces a broad variety of industrial and consumer bags,
polyethylene film and other non-rigid packaging at 11 plants in the U.S.
Operating profit improved significantly in 1995, primarily the result of overall
cost reductions realized from the closures of the company's retail paper bag
operations in 1994. Customer sales from continuing operations were up 12% over
1994 largely attributable to strong demand in the consumer packaging markets.
Prices for these packaging products rose 6% and volume was up 6%. Manufacturing
material costs increased 11%; however, the effect was mitigated by productivity
gains. Plastic packaging operations experienced an 11% sales gain, entirely the
result of higher selling prices, but earnings declined on lower volume and
higher manufacturing unit costs.

  The International Packaging group's operations continued their strong earnings
growth in 1995. Revenues increased 30% following gains of 11% and 13% in 1994
and 1993, respectively. The company's share of earnings from its 30% investment
in Zucamor S.A., a manufacturer of corrugated containers in Argentina, added
significantly to the favorable year-to-year earnings performance.

  The company's Folding Carton Division operates three plants which produce
consumer products packaging with high quality graphics. A 13% increase in
shipments was more than offset by lower average selling price and less favorable
product mix. Operating profit declined substantially in 1995 after increasing
12% in 1994.

Wood Products
Operating Profit
(millions of dollars)
1993     $70
1994     $79
1995     $33].

WOOD PRODUCTS After four consecutive years of earnings growth, the Wood Products
segment experienced a downturn in 1995. Operating earnings were $33 million in
1995, a decrease of $46 million from record 1994 earnings, largely the result of
lower profits in the lumber business. Although lumber volume increased 3% in
1995, prices declined and customer sales dollars were down 10%. Margins were
squeezed further by wood costs which averaged 12% above the prior year; however,
improvements in wood yields partially offset these increases.


  Plywood and particleboard profit margins were also down in 1995, though not as
much as lumber due to their specialty nature. Gains in selling price were more
than offset by escalating wood costs. The plywood operation also incurred
non-recurring repair costs in 1995.

  In 1994, earnings for all operations increased, almost entirely the result of
higher selling prices, which were up 12% for lumber and plywood operations and
15% for particleboard.

CHEMICAL In 1995, the Chemical segment achieved its third consecutive year of
record operating profit, $76 million, an increase of 13% over 1994 and 55% above
1993. Sales were $667 million in 1995 compared to $576 million and $519 million
in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Operating Profit
(millions of dollars)

  Bush Boake Allen (BBA), which operates world-wide with locations in 40
countries, is the largest operating unit in this segment. Union Camp is a
majority owner of this global business with a 68% holding. BBA supplies flavors
and fragrances for use in foods, beverages, cosmetics and toiletries. Sales in
1995 were $425 million, 13% over the prior year and operating profit reached $50
million, 20% above 1994. Aroma chemical operations recorded a significant
increase in earnings, largely the result of higher selling prices and favorable
product mix which more than offset climbing raw material turpentine costs.
Flavor and fragrance operations in Europe and the Americas also had strong
earnings growth in 1995, in particular, the seasonings business. In 1994, BBA
posted a 24% increase in operating profit. Worldwide flavor and fragrance
operations had strong growth with all regions showing gains. Aroma chemical
operations registered sharp earnings improvement.

  Operating profit for the company's other chemical unit, the Chemical Products
Division, was a record $26 million in 1995, up 29% from 1994. This operation
up-grades papermaking by-products and other raw material into a wide range of
specialized chemicals, primarily for use in inks, coatings and adhesives.
Despite a 20% price increase in a key raw material, crude tall oil, margins
increased in 1995 as pricing initiatives kept ahead of the escalating raw
material costs. Significant upward price movement was achieved in merchant
market sales of fatty acids and rosins. These higher prices were also passed
through to the upgraded products. In 1994, operating results improved
significantly over the prior year due to higher prices and a more favorable
product mix.


INTEREST EXPENSE  Net interest expense was $114 million in 1995, an increase of
$5 million over 1994 but $11 million below 1993. The increase in 1995 was
entirely the result of a lower level of capitalized interest. Gross interest
expense in 1995 decreased $8 million and $11 million from 1994 and 1993,
respectively.


OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE - NET  Other (income) expense in 1995 was $14 million
income compared with $5 million expense in 1994 and $13 million income in 1993.
The year 1994 included charges of $11.7 million from the disposal of the retail
paper bag business. Also in 1994, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $34.7
million from the sale of a minority interest in Bush Boake Allen. This gain is
presented as a separate line item, "Gain on Sale of Minority Interest" on the
income statement.


INCOME TAXES The effective rate for 1995 was 36.8% compared with 36.6% in 1994
and 50% in 1993. The increased rate in 1993 reflects a $16 million charge to
adjust the deferred tax liability to reflect a 1% increase in the federal income
tax rate.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The company further strengthened its balance sheet in 1995. Net working capital
(the excess of current assets over current liabilities) was $460 million at
year-end 1995 compared with $67 million at the end of 1994. The increase was
primarily the result of a $280 million reduction in short-term borrowings. The
company's current ratio was 1.8 at year-end 1995 compared with 1.0 at the end of
1994 and 1993. Stockholders' equity at year-end 1995 was $2.1 billion, or $30.71
per share, an increase of 17% per share over 1994.

  Operations have consistently generated strong cash flow to meet the company's
liquidity needs and fund its growth. Over the last three years, operations have
generated $1.5 billion of cash flow. In 1995, cash flow from operations was a
record $750 million. These funds were used to substantially reduce short-term
borrowings, increase cash dividends paid to $116 million and initiate a stock
repurchase program which expended $59.6 million in 1995. These activities were
in addition to $267 million of capital expenditures.

  From time to time, supplemental financing is necessary and the company's
strong financial condition provides substantial additional debt capacity. The
ratio of long-term debt to total capital employed (the sum of long-term debt,
deferred taxes and stockholders' equity) was 29.7% at year-end 1995 compared to
33.9% at the end of 1994. Total debt to total capital dropped from 41.2% at
year-end 1994 to 32.2% at December 31, 1995.

  Cash provided by investment activities in 1994 includes $89 million received
as a dividend from Bush Boake Allen in connection with the sale to the public of
approximately 6.1 million shares, 32% of BBA stock.

  At year-end 1995, purchase commitments related to capital projects were
approximately $23 million and the approved project spending backlog for plant
and equipment was approximately $370 million. Capital spending in 1996 will
increase to a more normal level of about $325 million exclusive of potential
timberlands acquisitions.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS In December 1995, the company acquired, through a
Spanish subsidiary, a corrugated container plant located near Madrid, Spain. The
acquisition provides added industrial end user business and gives greater
balance to the agricultural/industrial mix for the company's operations in
Spain. The cost of the acquisition was $8.3 million including working capital.

  In early 1995, the company sold its flexible packaging plant in Asheville,
North Carolina and completed its withdrawal from the retail paper bag business
with the sale of the Richmond, Virginia bag plant and shut-down of its Savannah,
Georgia retail bag operations. Sales for these businesses were $110 million in
1994. A pre-tax gain of $6.4 million was recognized from the sale of flexible
packaging assets in 1995.

  At year-end 1994, the company closed the Centerville, Ohio corrugated
container plant and redeployed most of the equipment to a new plant in Hanford,
California, which will start up in early 1996. Centerville had net sales of $20
million in 1994.

  In September 1994, the company acquired a 30% interest in Zucamor S.A.,
Argentina's largest independent corrugated container manufacturer, at a cost of
$22 million and sold its Shelbyville, Kentucky plastic retail bag operation
recognizing a $3.7 million pre-tax loss on this sale.

  In May 1994, the company's flavor and fragrance subsidiary, Bush Boake Allen,
sold a 32% minority interest to the public. The company recorded a $34.7 million
pre-tax gain on the sale.

DIVIDENDS The quarterly dividend rate was raised 15% in 1995. This was done in
two steps: in April, the Board of Directors raised the cash dividend 5% from
$.39 per share to $.41 per share. In September, the Board announced a cash
dividend increase of 10% to $.45 per share effective with the fourth quarter.
Cash dividends paid in 1995 were $116.1 million compared to $109.1 million and
$108.8 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

  In the second quarter of 1995, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to five million shares of the company's common stock. During
1995, 1,151,500 shares of common stock were repurchased at a cost of $59.6
million.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  The company invested approximately $17.4 million in
pollution control facilities in 1995. Over the past five years the company's
investment was approximately $134.7 million or about 8.0% of the $1.6 billion of
capital spending.

  During 1995, the company recorded expenses of $12 million for study, testing
and remediation in compliance with environmental regulations.

  Regulations scheduled to be issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
in the second half of 1996 are currently anticipated to require capital
investments on the order of $200 to $250 million in the late 1990's.
Quantification of this cost is both speculative and subject to variation with
respect to precise timing. Indications are that annual spending will not
materially detract from normal capital spending plans. The company believes that
since its situation, in relative terms, is similar to that of its competitors,
compliance will not adversely affect its competitive position.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS  In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", which will
be effective in 1996. The new standard allows companies to continue applying the
present method of accounting which is based on intrinsic value. The company
expects to continue applying the accounting provisions as previously
established. The pro forma fair value disclosure requirements of the new
standard will be included in the footnotes to the 1996 financial statements.

  In the first quarter of 1994, the company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". At January 1, 1994,
the accumulated obligation associated with these benefits was $6.0 million. This
obligation, included within other long-term liabilities, was recorded in the
first quarter of 1994 on a cumulative basis as a $3.7 million after-tax charge
against income.

  In the third quarter of 1993, the company increased its deferred income tax
liability by $16 million to reflect the 1% rate increase as required under the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".

paper bag business and a first quarter charge of $.05 per share for the
implementation of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits".

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Union Camp Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Union Camp Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

  As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for postemployment benefits in 1994.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       ($ in thousands, except per share)

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Preparation of Financial Statements: The
consolidated financial statements present the operating results and the
financial position of the company and all of its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated.

  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the preparation
of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some
instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.


Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid
investment instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include
the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Finished goods and raw
materials of domestic operations are valued principally at last in, first out
(LIFO) cost. Supplies and all inventories of foreign operations are valued at
first in, first out (FIFO) or average cost.


Property and Depreciation: Plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Upon sale or retirement, the asset cost and related
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss
is included in income.

  Depreciation is principally calculated on a straight-line basis with lives for
buildings from 15 to 33 years and for machinery and equipment from 10 to 20
years. For major expansion projects, the company uses the units-of-production
depreciation method until design level production is reasonably sustained.
Accelerated depreciation methods are used for tax purposes.

  The cost of company timber harvested is charged to income as timber is cut.
The charge to income is the product of the volume of timber cut multiplied by
annually developed unit cost rates which are based on the relationship of timber
cost to estimated volume of recoverable timber.


Goodwill: The excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired
businesses is recorded as goodwill and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over a period not to exceed 20 years. The company reviews the goodwill
recoverability period on a regular basis.


Research and Development Costs: Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. These expenditures totaled $55.4 million in 1995, $49.2 million in
1994, and $45.9 million in 1993.

Capitalized Interest: Interest is capitalized on major capital expenditures
during the period of construction. Total interest costs incurred and amounts
capitalized were:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

</TABLE>

Pre-Start-Up Costs: The company defers pre-start-up costs for major expansion
projects until such projects become operational. Following the completion of
start-up, the deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a five
year period.

Changes in Accounting Standards: Effective January 1, 1994, the company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", which requires companies to
accrue for the cost of certain postemployment benefits including disability
related, health care and life insurance benefits.

  In adopting this standard, the company recorded a one-time cumulative charge
of $3.7 million after-tax in the first quarter of 1994. The net periodic expense
for 1995 and 1994 was $2.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively.


Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes are recorded using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. Federal and state
income taxes are not accrued on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries because the earnings have been reinvested in the businesses of
those companies. As of December 31, 1995, the total of all such undistributed
earnings amounted to $146.4 million. It is not practical to estimate the amount
of tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings. The company has, as
required, provided for tax potentially payable on distribution of its share of
$42.9 million, the undistributed earnings of Bush Boake Allen, Inc. (BBA) and
subsidiaries earned subsequent to 1992. (See also Note 9)


Environmental Liabilities: Environmental expenditures that relate to current
operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Liabilities are recorded
when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
The timing of these accruals generally coincides with the completion of a
feasibility study or the company's commitment to a formal plan of action.


Foreign Currency Translation: The assets and liabilities of the company's
foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end
exchange rates, while income and expense accounts are translated at average
annual rates. The primary factor used to determine the functional currencies of
the company's foreign subsidiaries is the local currency cash flows resulting
from manufacturing, sales and financing activities. Gains and


 



<PAGE>
<PAGE>

losses resulting from foreign currency translation are reflected in a separate
component of Stockholders' Equity entitled Other Equity Adjustments. The effect
of these cumulative adjustments was to reduce equity by $13.2 million at
December 31, 1995 and $14.3 million at December 31, 1994.

Derivatives: The company hedges foreign currency transactions by entering into
forward foreign exchange contracts. Gains and losses associated with the forward
contracts are matched with the offsetting gains and losses recorded for exchange
rate fluctuations on the underlying assets and liabilities. Gains and losses on
interest rate swap agreements are charged or credited to interest expense over
the life of the agreement. (See also Note 7)

Revenue Recognition: The company recognizes revenues upon the passage of title,
which is generally at the time of shipment.

Income Per Share: Net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period.


2. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE Results for 1994 included a $14.0 million
pre-tax charge to write down the carrying value of a flexible packaging
operation. In 1995, the company sold these assets and recorded a net pre-tax
gain of $6.4 million.

3. GAIN ON SALE OF MINORITY INTEREST In 1994 the company's flavor and fragrance
subsidiary, BBA sold to the public approximately 6.1 million shares of BBA stock
(approximately 32% of BBA's outstanding shares) at an offering price of $16.00
per share. The company retains approximately 68% of the 19.215 million shares
outstanding after the offering. As a result of this transaction, the company
recognized a $34.7 million pre-tax gain.

4. OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE-NET Other (income) expense for 1994 includes an $11.7
million charge to withdraw from the retail paper bag business. The year 1993
included an $18.0 million gain attributable to the sale of land.

The current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 1995 amounted to $43.9
million. Amounts payable in the years 1997 through 2000 are $109.6 million,
$55.7 million, $82.1 million and $33.9 million, respectively.

  At December 31, 1995, $46 million of commercial paper borrowings was
classified as long-term debt, since the company has the ability and intent to
renew these obligations through the year 2000. The effective interest rate on
these borrowings was 8.08%, inclusive of the net effect of the interest rate
swap. (See Note 7)

  The company has revolving credit/term loan agreements which provide for
unsecured borrowings up to $275 million in the United States. Any borrowings
under these agreements would incur interest at the prevailing prime rate or
other market rates. Nominal commitment fees are paid on the unused portion. No
borrowings were made in 1995 under these agreements.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of certain financial
instruments: cash, short-term investments, trade receivables and payables
approximate their fair values. The fair value of the company's long-term debt
varies with market conditions and is estimated based on quoted market prices for
similar financial instruments by obtaining quotes from brokers.

  At December 31, 1995, the book value of long-term debt was $1.20 billion and
the fair value was approximately $1.33 billion. The book value of all other
financial instruments approximates their fair value.


Derivative Financial Instruments: The company uses derivative instruments
exclusively to hedge the risk associated with underlying business transactions
such as existing floating rate debt and existing foreign currency commitments.
Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The book value of
these derivatives approximates their fair value.


  At December 31, 1995, the company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts
valued at $46 million. The purpose of these contracts is to neutralize foreign
currency transaction risk generated by the company's firm foreign currency
business commitments. The change in value of the contracts resulting from
changes in the respective foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar is
accrued monthly and credited or charged to foreign exchange gain or loss.
Foreign currency commitment exposures are evaluated on an ongoing basis and
foreign currency contracts are adjusted as required to offset the risk
associated with the underlying transactions. Cash settlements are executed
whenever the contracts are adjusted which occurs at least monthly. Currency
contracts are limited to currencies with established forward markets and to
counterparties, which have Moody's credit ratings of A1 or better.

  At December 31, 1995, the company had an outstanding interest rate swap
agreement the purpose of which is to convert $46 million of floating rate
commercial paper to fixed rate debt. The swap agreement is based on a declining
principal balance schedule which terminates in April, 2000. The differential
between fixed and floating rate obligations is accrued as interest rates change
and is charged or credited to interest expense over the life of the agreement.
Cash settlements are payable semi-annually. The counterparty has a Moody's
credit rating of AA.

</TABLE>


The authorized capital stock of the company at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993
consisted of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value, and 1,000,000
shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock, $1.00 par value. Common stock
repurchased is included in the authorized but unissued shares of the company.


Shareholder Rights Plan: The company has a Shareholders' Rights Plan pursuant to
which preferred stock purchase rights are issued to the common stockholders at
the rate of one right for each share of common stock. Each right entitles
shareholders to purchase, under certain conditions (i) one one-thousandth of a
share of the company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an
exercise price of $175 or (ii) common stock of the company having a market value
of two times the exercise price. Alternatively, the Board of Directors may
permit holders to surrender each right in exchange for one share of common
stock. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or
more of the outstanding common stock or announces a tender offer for 15% or more
of the common stock. The rights expire February 26, 2006 and may be redeemed for
$.001 per right by the Board of Directors prior to the time the rights become
exercisable. In addition, if after any person acquires 15% or more of the
company's common stock, the company is involved in a merger or other business
combination transaction with another person after which its common stock does
not remain outstanding, or the company sells 50% or more of its assets or
earning power, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the then
current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company's common stock having a
market value equal to two times the purchase price.



9. INCOME TAXES  The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:

The company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 109, whereby deferred taxes
represent estimated liabilities to be paid or assets to be received in the
future and tax rate changes would immediately affect those liabilities or
assets. In 1993, the federal corporate income tax rate was increased from 34% to
35%. Consequently, the deferred tax provision and the liability for deferred
taxes were increased by $16.0 million to reflect the full amount of the rate
change.

  The cumulative deferred tax liability at December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $709.9
million and $605.6 million, respectively. The significant components of these
liabilities (assets) are as follows:

10. EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS  Under the stock option plans adopted in 1982 
and 1989 (as amended), a maximum of 2,175,000 shares and 4,295,000 shares,
respectively, of the company's common stock were made available for the granting
of options and stock appreciation rights to officers and other key employees of
the company and its subsidiaries at prices not less than 100% of fair market
value at the dates of grant. Such options and stock appreciation rights
generally become exercisable two years after the date of grant and expire ten
years from that date. No further options may be granted under the 1982 plan. At
the end of 1995, 577,531 shares were available for future grants under the 1989
plan. The number of options exercisable under both plans at year-end 1995 was
2,345,510.

  Under the 1989 plan, as of December 31, 1995, 859,017 shares may be awarded as
restricted stock to selected officers and other key employees of the company and
its subsidiaries. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to receive cash
dividends and to vote their respective shares. Restrictions limit the sale or
transfer of these shares during a specified period. At December 31, 1995,
113,866 common shares have been issued as restricted stock under this plan.
Unearned compensation, equivalent to the market value of the restricted shares
at date of grant, is included within Stockholders' Equity and is amortized to
expense over the restriction period.

  The following table summarizes activity in the company's stock option plans
during 1995, 1994 and 1993. The options outstanding at December 31, 1995 having
related stock appreciation rights attached totaled 1,207,641.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation". The statement, effective in 1996,
allows companies to continue applying the present method of accounting which is
based on intrinsic value. The company expects to continue applying the
accounting provisions as previously established. The pro forma fair value
disclosure requirements of the new standard will be included in the footnotes to
the 1996 financial statements.

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The company has a contributory postretirement health
care plan covering primarily its U.S. salaried employees. Employees become
eligible for these benefits when they meet minimum age and service requirements.
The company funds its plan on a "pay-as-you-go" basis, in an amount equal to the
retirees' medical claims paid.

  The components of the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) as
of December 31, 1995 and 1994 are as follows:

</TABLE>

The discount rates used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 1995 and 1994 were 7.0% and 8.5%, respectively.

  For measurement purposes, a 10% increase in the medical cost trend rate was
assumed for 1995. This rate decreases incrementally to 5.5% by the year 2003 and
will remain at that level thereafter. It is estimated that a 1% increase in the
medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1995 by $15.6 million and the postretirement
benefit expense for 1995 by $1.8 million.

12. PENSION PLANS The company and certain foreign subsidiaries have
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of
their employees. Benefits are based on years of service and, for salaried
employees, final average earnings. The company funds its plans annually based
upon a consistently applied formula which amortizes the unfunded liability
adjusted for actuarial gains or losses. Assets of the plans are primarily fixed
income instruments and publicly traded stocks.

  Pension costs were $20.2 million, $14.5 million and $14.6 million for the
years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The following table sets forth the
funded status of all pension plans for 1995 and 1994:

15. SEGMENT INFORMATION  Union Camp is a leading manufacturer of paper,
packaging, chemicals and wood products serving both U.S. and international
markets. The company derives approximately three fourths of its sales from paper
and packaging products, such as linerboard, kraft paper, uncoated free sheet,
corrugated containers, flexible packaging and folding cartons. The company's
chemical business is involved in the manufacture of chemicals used in inks,
coatings and adhesives, and through its Bush Boake Allen subsidiary, the
manufacture of flavor, fragrance, and aroma chemicals. Chemicals comprise about
a sixth of Union Camp's sales. The company also manages a woodlands base of over
1.5 million acres, supplying raw materials for our linerboard, packaging and
paper making business, as well as for the manufacture of wood products.

  Operating results and other financial data are presented for the principal
business segments of the company for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993. Total revenue and operating profit by business segment include both sales
to customers, as reported in the company's consolidated income statement, and
intersegment sales, which are accounted for at prices charged to customers and
eliminated in consolidation. The amount of the elimination of intersegment
profit on any product that remains in inventory at the end of the period is
determined by changes in quantities of inventory and changes in the margins of
profit.

  Operating profit by business segment is total revenue less operating expenses.
In computing operating profit by business segment, none of the following items
has been added or deducted: other income, portions of administrative expenses,
interest expense, income taxes and unusual items.

  Identifiable assets by business segment are those assets used in company
operations in each segment. Corporate assets are principally cash, intangible
assets, deferred charges and assets held for resale. The company's real estate
operation, Branigar, has been included within corporate items. Capital
expenditures are reported exclusive of acquisitions.

  Total revenue and operating profit from the company's foreign subsidiaries
were $504 million and $61 million in 1995, $417 million and $44 million in 1994,
and $372 million and $31 million in 1993. No geographic area outside the United
States was material relative to consolidated revenues, operating profits or
identifiable assets.

  Export sales from the United States were $418 million in 1995, $247 million in
1994 and $209 million in 1993.
