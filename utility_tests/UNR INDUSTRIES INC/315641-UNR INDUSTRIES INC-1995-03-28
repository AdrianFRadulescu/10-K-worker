ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

    UNR  Industries, Inc.,  a Delaware  Corporation ("Registrant"  or "UNR") was
organized in 1979 as  a holding company with  businesses engaged principally  in
metal fabrication.

    On  July 29,  1982, Registrant and  ten of its  subsidiaries, filed separate
voluntary petitions for  reorganization under  Chapter 11 of  the United  States
Bankruptcy  Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District
of   Illinois,   Eastern   Division.   The   Registrant   was   designated    as
debtor-in-possession  and  its operations  continued in  the ordinary  course of
business.

    On March 15,  1989, Registrant and  the seven subsidiaries  not having  been
previously  discharged, filed a Disclosure Statement  and a Consolidated Plan of
Reorganization ("Plan") with the Bankruptcy  Court. Effective June 2, 1989,  the
Registrant's  Plan  of  Reorganization  was confirmed  by  the  Bankruptcy Court
following acceptance of the Plan by the Registrant's creditors and stockholders.

    Pursuant to the Plan, 42,404,847 shares  of common stock of the  reorganized
Registrant were issued to the unsecured creditors and to the existing and future
asbestos  claimants in full discharge of all claims. The Plan also provided that
all proceeds  from  the litigation  against  certain insurance  companies  would
become  unencumbered assets  of the  Registrant. Existing  shareholders retained
3,687,378 shares of common stock and  received six-year warrants to purchase  an
additional 3,687,378 shares of common stock at $5.15 per share.

    On  December 31, 1992, Unarco Industries, Inc. and UNR, Inc. merged into UNR
Industries, Inc. All  remaining subsidiaries became  subsidiaries of UNR  except
Holco  Corporation  which  remains  a subsidiary  of  Leavitt  Structural Tubing
Company, a subsidiary of UNR.

    In 1994, the Registrant decided to sell the industrial storage rack business
of its Material  Handling Division.  In 1993,  the Registrant  sold its  Midwest
Steel and Midwest CATV Divisions. In 1989, the Registrant sold its Unarco Rubber
Products  Division.  Accordingly,  operating  results  of  these  divisions were
reclassified to discontinued operations.

    On April 27, 1993, Registrant acquired Real Time Solutions, Inc., a producer
of automated inventory management products for $4.2 million of cash and  616,102
shares of stock valued at approximately $4.2 million.

    On June 11, 1993, UNR received a letter from the UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims
Trust  (the  "Trust"),  holder  at that  time  of  62% of  the  common  stock of
Registrant, proposing  that  UNR's  Board  of  Directors  consider  retaining  a
financial  adviser  to  solicit  third-party proposals  for  acquisition  of UNR
through a merger or other business combination in which UNR's shareholders would
receive  cash  for  their  shares  and  to  advise  whether  any  such  proposed
transactions would be fair from a financial point of view to UNR's shareholders.

    On  June, 22, 1993, UNR's Board of Directors established a Special Committee
of independent  directors to  consider and  to implement  appropriate action  in
response  to the Trust's proposal, including  the solicitation and evaluation of
offers for acquisition of  UNR and to  make a report  and recommendation to  the
Board of Directors.

    On August 4, 1993, the Special Committee engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
as  its financial adviser. On February 9, 1994, UNR announced that the proposals
received were subject to conditions and  that none of the proposals indicated  a
per share value greater than $6.50. On February 22, 1994, UNR announced that the
proposals  received  were  either  inadequate  or  too  conditional  to  warrant
recommendations by the  Special Committee to  the Board of  Directors, that  all
discussions  with potential buyers  had been terminated and  all efforts to seek
further offers have ceased.

  (b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

    Information required  under this  section appears  as Note  12 to  the  1994
Consolidated  Financial Statements of  the Registrant included  as Exhibit 13 to
this Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.

  (c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

    Registrant's divisions  are engaged  in the  manufacture and  sale of  steel
products,  primarily welded steel tubing, shopping carts and supermarket storage
and display equipment,  stainless steel  and composite sinks,  steel towers  and
equipment  shelters for communication and  other uses and computerized warehouse
control systems. The  Registrant employs  approximately 2,200  persons, of  whom
1,600   are  factory  personnel.   The  Registrant's  sales   are  made  through
manufacturers' representatives, as well as through its own employees.

    The principal raw material  used by Registrant's  divisions is steel.  These
divisions  purchase  steel  from both  foreign  and domestic  suppliers.  In the
opinion of  the  Registrant's  management,  no  purchase  commitments  presently
outstanding are at prices which will result in a loss.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS

    One  of Registrant's  industrial products  divisions manufactures  and sells
mechanical and structural electric resistance  welded steel tubing in a  variety
of sizes and shapes. Such tubing is a fabricated steel product, the use of which
has increased in a

                                       1
<PAGE>
variety  of  industries in  recent  years. Registrant's  division  currently has
sixteen tube-making machines operating in two locations in the Chicago area,  in
Hammond,  Indiana and in Gluckstadt, Mississippi, which can produce in excess of
500,000 tons of tubing  annually. The size range  of manufactured tubing by  the
Registrant is 3/8" to 12 3/4" outer diameter.

    Substantially  all of  the Registrant's  steel tubing  products are  sold to
steel service centers and industrial  users, with no single customer  accounting
for  more than  10% of  total sales. Sales  are made  throughout the continental
United States.  The tubing  ultimately  is used  by  makers of  farm  equipment,
automotive  equipment, vehicle trailers, bicycles and playground equipment, sign
and lamp posts, grocery  carts, furniture, storage  racks, truck trailer  frames
and axles and in industrial and commercial buildings.

    The  other industrial products division of the Registrant provides automated
inventory management products  to the warehouse  and distribution industry  from
facilities  located in Berkeley  and Napa, California. Its  primary product is a
light directed display  based inventory picking,  sorting, packing and  shipping
system using the trademark "Easypick".-Registered Trademark-

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS

    One of the Registrant's commercial products divisions manufactures and sells
wire  and plastic shopping  carts, self-service luggage  carts, office and other
carts,  wire  baskets  and  continuous  shelving  systems.  These  products  are
manufactured  primarily  from  steel tubing,  wire  and  plastic in  a  plant in
Wagoner, Oklahoma. Sales are  made through direct  solicitation of customers  by
sales  agents.  In addition,  this division  manufactures and  sells supermarket
equipment for the handling, preparation and display of meats and produce.  Sales
are made principally through stocking distributors.

    From plants in Peoria, Illinois and Frankfort, Indiana, a second division of
the  Registrant manufactures and markets  towers, with related accessories, used
principally to  support  communications  equipment for  microwave  and  cellular
transmission,  commercial and  amateur broadcasting  and home  television. Other
towers are produced  to support  high level illumination  for highways,  parking
lots,  stadiums  and  other  commercial  areas.  The  Registrant's  facility  in
Bessemer, Alabama  produces equipment  shelters  from laminated  fiberglass  and
concrete which are primarily used to house broadcast electronics. These products
are marketed nationally and for export markets.

    The  third commercial products division manufactures,  in a plant in Ruston,
Louisiana, stainless steel  sinks which  are sold  to retail  outlets under  the
"Federal" and "American" labels and to plumbing wholesalers under the "Republic"
label.  In addition, this division manufactures  and markets a line of composite
sinks under the trade name "Asterite."-Registered Trademark-

    PATENTS

    Registrant owns or  licenses a  number of  domestic and  foreign patents  on
products  and  processes. Certain  domestic and  foreign patent  applications on
additional products and processes  are pending, but there  is no assurance  that
any  of  such applications  will be  granted. Although  certain patents  were of
considerable value  in  the growth  of  the business  and  will continue  to  be
important  in the future,  the Registrant's success or  growth are not dependent
upon any one patent or group of related patents.

    RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

    The Registrant spent approximately $1,253,000 in 1994, $797,000 in 1993  and
$300,000  in 1992  for research on  new and improved  products. Approximately 37
employees are currently engaged full time in this activity.

    COMPETITION

    All business segments of the Registrant are highly competitive. Although  no
authoritative  statistics are available,  based on its  knowledge of its markets
and information received  from customers and  salesmen, the Registrant  believes
that  its  sales  of  grocery  shopping carts  are  greater  than  those  of any
competitor.

    Although the Registrant believes it is currently one of the nation's leading
producers of  mechanical  and structural  steel  tubing  in the  size  range  it
produces  (3/8" to 12 3/4" outer diameter), there is considerable competition in
all sizes  and  shapes of  steel  tubing. The  Registrant  believes that  it  is
impossible  to state  its rank  in overall  sales of  all sizes  of steel tubing
(including sizes not manufactured by the Registrant). It is known, however, that
several companies have substantially greater sales of particular sizes of  steel
tubing  within the size  range manufactured by  the Registrant and substantially
greater overall sales of all sizes of steel tubing.

    The Registrant  also believes  that  because of  the  wide range  of  towers
produced  by it, there are only a few other companies which manufacture and sell
similarly complete product lines.

    The Registrant  also  believes  that its  sales  of  computerized  warehouse
control systems are greater than those of any competitor.

    Other  products  sold  by  the Registrant  compete  with  products  of other
companies, some  of  which  are  much  larger  than  the  Registrant  and  enjoy
substantially larger shares of their respective markets.

    BACKLOG AND FOREIGN SALES

    The backlog of unfilled orders at the end of any period is not a significant
factor  and  is  not  material  to  an  understanding  of  the  business  of the
Registrant.

    Foreign sales of the  Registrant in 1994, 1993  and 1992 were  approximately
$10.6 million, $10.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively.

                                       2
<PAGE>
OTHER

    The  Registrant  employs  some environmentally  hazardous  materials  in its
manufacturing processes, including  oils and solvents.  The Registrant has  made
expenditures  to  comply  with  environmental  laws  and  regulations, including
investigations and remediation of ground and water contamination, and expects to
make such  expenditures  in  the  future to  comply  with  existing  and  future
requirements.  While such expenditures to date  have not materially affected the
Registrant's capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition  or
results of operations, there can be no assurance that more stringent regulations
or enforcement in the future will not have such effects.

    In some cases, the Registrant has notified state or federal authorities of a
possible need to remediate sites it previously operated. The Registrant has also
been  notified by various  state and federal  governmental authorities that they
believe  it  may  be  a  "potentially  responsible  party"  or  otherwise   have
responsibility  with respect  to clean-up  obligations at  certain hazardous and
other waste disposal sites which were  not owned or operated by the  Registrant.
In  some such cases,  the Registrant has effected  settlements with the relevant
authorities or  other  parties  for  immaterial amounts.  In  other  cases,  the
Registrant  is participating  in negotiations  for settlement  with the relevant
authorities or other  parties or  has notified  the authorities  that it  denies
liability  for  clean-up obligations.  At  all such  sites,  costs which  may be
incurred are difficult to accurately predict until the level of contamination is
determined. The  Registrant,  after consultation  with  legal counsel  and  with
environmental experts, believes that the ultimate outcome with respect to all of
these  sites  will not  have  a material  effect  on the  Registrant's financial
condition or on the results of its operations.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    The following table  sets forth information  concerning location, size,  use
and  nature of  the principal  manufacturing facilities  owned or  leased by the
Registrant. The Registrant believes its plants are suitable for their  purposes,
are  well maintained and are  adequately insured. Not included  in the table are
warehouses,  owned  and  leased,  aggregating   120,000  square  feet  and   the
Registrant's executive and sales offices, all of which are leased.

    The  Registrant  uses a  wide variety  of  standard and  specialized machine
tools,  many  varying  types  of  equipment  and  many  different  manufacturing
processes  in producing its products. The Registrant considers, that in general,
its  plants  are  equipped  with  modern  and  well-maintained  equipment.   The
Registrant's  operations  make virtually  full  use of  all  existing facilities
except as noted above.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    On July  29, 1982  the  Registrant and  certain  of its  subsidiaries  filed
voluntary  petitions for  reorganization under Chapter  11 of  the United States
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern  District
of Illinois, Eastern Division ("Bankruptcy Court").

    On  March 15, 1989, the  Registrant and certain of  its subsidiaries filed a
Disclosure Statement and a Consolidated Plan of Reorganization  ("Reorganization
Plan")  with the Bankruptcy  Court. An order  confirming the Reorganization Plan
was entered  by  the Bankruptcy  Court  effective June  2,  1989  ("Confirmation
Order").   The  Bankruptcy  Court  also  entered  orders  establishing  the  UNR
Asbestos-Disease Claims  Trust ("Trust  Order")  and permanently  enjoining  any
actions  against  the Registrant  by asbestos-disease  claimants ("Injunction").
Certain former  employees  of a  predecessor  to the  Registrant's  Bloomington,
Illinois  plant  ("Bloomington  Workers") filed  appeals  from  the Confirmation
Order, the Injunction and the Trust  Order. Those appeals were dismissed by  the
District  Court, and the Bloomington Workers  sought review by the United States
Court of Appeals  for the  Seventh Circuit ("Court  of Appeals").  The Court  of
Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court on April 5, 1994, and on May
27,  1994, Bloomington Workers'  Petition for Rehearing  was denied. On November
14, 1994, the Supreme Court denied the Bloomington Workers' Petition for Writ of
Certiorari. Therefore,  the Confirmation  Order, the  Injunction and  the  Trust
Order are now final.

    On  July 28, 1992,  the Bankruptcy Court  entered an order  holding that the
asbestos-disease claims of certain  Bloomington Workers to recover  compensation
under  the Illinois Workers'  Occupational Diseases Act  should be classified as
both Class 2 Claims (Workers' Compensation Claims which are to be paid in  full)
and  as Class 5 Claims  (which claims are channeled  to the UNR Asbestos-Disease
Claims Trust) under the  Reorganization Plan. On June  14, 1994, the  Bankruptcy
Court  entered an order  holding that asbestos-disease claims  of the 256 former
employees of  a  predecessor  company's Paterson,  New  Jersey  plant  (Paterson
Workers) should also be classified as both Class 2 Claims and as Class 5 Claims.
The  Registrant filed an appeal to the  District Court in both of those matters,
contending  that  the  former  employees'  asbestos-disease  claims  should   be
classified  only as Class  5 Claims. On  September 22, 1994,  the District Court
reversed the decision of the Bankruptcy  Court in the Bloomington Workers'  case
and  remanded that  matter to the  Bankruptcy Court for  further proceedings. On
December 28, 1994, the  District Court, adopting the  reasoning of the  District
Court in the Bloomington Workers case, also reversed the Bankruptcy Court in the
Paterson  Workers  case and  remanded that  matter to  the Bankruptcy  Court for
further proceedings. Based  upon the Registrant's  view of the  merits of  these
claims  and  upon the  advice  of legal  counsel,  the Registrant  believes that
ultimate resolution of the Paterson Workers' claims and the Bloomington Workers'
claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's operations or
its financial condition.

    The Registrant is also involved in certain other pending lawsuits and claims
arising in the ordinary course  of business. The Registrant, after  consultation
with  legal counsel,  considers that any  liability resulting  from such matters
will not have a  material adverse effect on  the Registrant's operations or  its
financial condition.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    On  November 1, 1994, a special meeting of Security Holders was held for the
purpose of considering and voting upon:

    to provide  Registrant's  executives and  key  employees an  opportunity  to
    become holders of Common Stock of the Registrant over a period of years; and

        (b)  approval of the UNR Industries,  Inc. 1994 Executive Stock Purchase
    Plan designed  to  encourage and  facilitate  the acquisition  of  a  larger
    financial  interest in the Registrant through direct stock purchase by those
    key executives.

    Both plans  had  been adopted  by  the Board  of  Directors subject  to  the
approval of the Security Holders.

    The Security Holders voted as follows:

       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of UNR Industries, Inc.;

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial  statements included in  UNR Industries, Inc.'s  1994
Annual  Report to Stockholders incorporated by  reference in this Form 10-K, and
have issued our report thereon dated March  2, 1995. Our audit was made for  the
purpose  of forming  an opinion on  the basic  consolidated financial statements
taken  as  a  whole.  The  supplemental  schedule  included  in  Part  IV,  Item
14(d)(Allowance  for Doubtful Accounts)  is the responsibility  of the Company's
management and is presented  for purposes of complying  with the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures  applied
in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly  states in all  material respects the  financial data required  to be set
forth therein in relation to  the basic consolidated financial statements  taken
as a whole.

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:

As the cover on this Annual Report suggests, the year 1994 was "Our Best Yet."
Net sales increased 19 percent to $372.4 million and, more importantly,
operating income rose 21 percent to $40.1 million, both record levels of
performance. Four of our five operating divisions posted record sales and two
established record levels of operating income.

Our 1994 reported net income was $31.3 million or $.64 per share compared to
$18.8 million or $.40 per share in 1993. 1994 net income was favorably impacted
by a $10.0 million, or $.20 per share, tax benefit generated by a reduction in a
valuation reserve established in 1992.

A major financial event in 1994 was the receipt of $52.6 million in Federal and
state tax refunds. These refunds were derived from the tax treatment accorded
the Company's 1989 transfer of 29.4 million shares of UNR common stock to the
UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims Trust. The timely receipt of this $52.6 million tax
refund resulted from some truly outstanding work by our corporate tax
department.

On April 1, 1994, the Company paid a regular cash dividend of $.20 per share. On
April 17, 1995, the Company will pay a $.25 per share regular cash dividend and
a $1.30 per share extraordinary cash dividend. The payment of these April
dividends will bring the total dividends paid over the last five years to $6.55
a share.

In June, 1994, we elected to sell our UNARCO Material Handling Division ("UMH"),
a leading supplier of steel rack to the warehousing and distribution industries.
We expect to close on the sale of UMH on March 31, 1995. The sale of UMH will
permit greater focus on the Company's five higher performing core businesses.


DIVISION PERFORMANCE

1994 was a spectacular year for our Rohn Division. Sales grew 45 percent to
$107.0 million, passing the $100 million level for the first time.  Operating
income was 73 percent higher in 1994 than in 1993. Rohn, as a leading supplier
of towers and shelters to the telecommunications industry, has directly
benefitted from the explosive growth of that industry. Our decision last year to
double the capacity of Rohn's Bessemer, Alabama shelter manufacturing facility
allowed them to significantly increase their shelter sales. Tower demand was
exceptionally strong also, and Rohn's Peoria, Illinois plant set new production
and shipment records. Rohn's outlook is very bright as the telecommunications
industry continues to expand.

Leavitt Tube also had record sales in 1994. Shipments of steel tubing increased
7 percent over 1993. Volume and sales dollars reached $175.1 million, an
increase of 17 percent. Steel prices continued to escalate in 1994 and gross
margins at Leavitt were squeezed because of a lag in their ability to pass on
the full amount of steel cost increases. Nevertheless, Leavitt's operating
income rose by 16 percent in 1994 and was the second highest level of operating
earnings in Leavitt's history. The entire Leavitt organization continues to give
an outstanding performance.

UNARCO Commercial Products, our shopping cart division, also set new records in
unit and dollar volume. UNARCO shipped in excess of 675,000 shopping carts and
had sales of $62.0 million. Recent investments in plating capacities have
provided UNARCO with the ability to continue to expand sales of shopping carts
and food handling equipment for supermarkets. Marvin Weiss, long time President
of UNARCO, retired on December 31, 1994, after 42 years with the Company. Marvin
was a strong leader and was instrumental in establishing UNARCO as the industry
leader in shopping carts. Russell Begley assumed the division presidency, and we
look forward to the division's continued growth under his leadership.

Our Home Products Division, which manufactures stainless steel and Asterite*
sinks, also set new records for unit and dollar sales.  Sales dollars increased
to $24.1 million. Operating income fell slightly because of increases in
stainless steel prices which Home Products could not entirely pass on to their
customers. The new Asterite* production facility in Ruston, Louisiana became
fully operational in the third quarter of 1994, and high quality composite sinks
are now being produced in quantity. Initial acceptance of the Asterite* sinks
has been favorable and the division anticipates significant new sales in 1995.

Real Time Solutions ("RTS") had a disappointing year in 1994. Sales were down
because of delays in signing a number of large contracts. However, operations
were profitable for the year, and 1995 is expected to show considerable growth
in bookings, sales and profitability.

This year marked the fifth year of operations of the "new" UNR that emerged from
Chapter 11 in 1989. On the two pages that follow this letter, the Company's five
year performance is briefly reviewed. We believe the results speak for
themselves.

In summary, 1994 was great--and we look forward to the challenges of 1995 and
beyond. We have set demanding performance targets  for each of our operating
divisions and our corporate staff groups and are confident that we will meet
them with the same intensity, commitment and teamwork that was brought to bear
in 1994. While 1994 was "The Best Yet," we remain certain that the best is yet
to come.

                                   Sincerely,

                                   Thomas A. Gildehaus

UNR INDUSTRIES, INC.
- --FIVE YEARS LATER

On July 29, 1982, UNR sought protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Laws
because of an overwhelming and ever growing number of asbestos claims related to
a predecessor company's asbestos manufacturing business.  On June 2, 1989, after
operating for seven years in Chapter 11, UNR emerged as a reorganized company.
Under the Plan of Reorganization, approximately 64 percent of the Company's
common stock was allocated to a newly created UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims Trust
(the Trust) in full discharge of all past, present and future asbestos-related
claims. This reorganization effectively removed the asbestos albatross from
UNR's corporate neck and provided the foundation for renewed growth and
profitability.

The "new" UNR remained a public company with the Trust as its largest
shareholder. The Trust supported the election of an experienced and talented
Board of Directors to lead the Company. Since 1989, UNR's Board of Directors has
pursued three objectives: maximizing cash flow available for distribution to
shareholders; maintaining and improving the Company's fundamental operating
capabilities through adequate reinvestment and excellent financial and operating
management; and generating shareholder returns through a combination of high
dividend payments and enhanced market value. This last objective could be
achieved only through significant growth in sales and profits.

Given this context for UNR's situation in 1989, it is appropriate to examine the
Company's performance "Five Years Later," and to evaluate its progress toward
achieving the Board's objectives.

DIVISION PERFORMANCE

- - UNR now consists of five divisions instead of the seven that existed in 1989.
The Midwest Steel and Midwest CATV Divisions were sold in 1993, and the UNARCO
Material Handling Division in 1995. Real Time Solutions, Inc. (RTS) was
purchased in 1993 and has proven to be an excellent investment with outstanding
growth prospects.
- - In the past five years, UNR Rohn's sales have increased more than 118
percent--from $49.1 million in 1989 to $107.0 million in 1994.  Its operating
earnings rose over 240 percent. In the Company's two major markets--towers and
shelters for the rapidly-expanding telecommunications industry--Rohn's position
has never been stronger and more secure.
- - Since 1989, Leavitt Tube Division sales have increased from $148.1 million to
more than $175.1 million, and operating income rose 25 percent. Leavitt's
management team is experienced, its operations are continually improving and its
market position is solid.
- - Sales at the UNARCO Commercial Products Division have expanded 44 percent
since 1989: from $43.2 million in 1989 to $62.0 million. Operating earnings
increased 83 percent in the same period. The nation's largest manufacturer of
shopping carts, UNARCO Commercial Products shipped a record number of wire and
plastic shopping carts in 1994.
- - Sales at the Home Products Division have increased 30 percent over the past
five years to $24.1 million in 1994. Operating income rose 32 percent over the
same period. With the introduction of the Asterite [REGISTERED TRADEMARK] sink
to supplement the Company's popular stainless steel lines, Home Products is
poised for accelerated growth.

The operating divisions' progress and performance have been extremely
encouraging. By combining their manufacturing and marketing expertise with
strong financial, tax, and legal management, the Company has improved its
overall financial performance.

CORPORATE PERFORMANCE

SALES GROWTH--Sales have grown to $372.4 million from $254.2 million, a
compounded, annual growth rate of eight percent. The principal engines of this
growth have been the Leavitt and Rohn Divisions.
OPERATING EARNINGS GROWTH--Largely due to the performance of Leavitt and Rohn,
operating earnings have grown to $40.1 million from $19.0 million, a compound
growth rate of 16.1 percent.
OPERATING RETURN ON EQUITY--Operating income as a percent of equity has risen to
18 percent in 1994 from eight percent five years ago. The Company has achieved
this increase by reducing its equity base through regular and extraordinary
dividend payments and by substantially increasing its earnings.
DIVIDENDS PAID--Since its reorganization in 1989, the Company has paid a total
of $232.8 million in dividends, or $5.00 per share. These funds have been
generated from earnings, tax refunds, asset sales and insurance recoveries. This
amount does not include the $80.0 million ($1.55 per share) dividend payment to
be made on April 17, 1995.
TOTAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS--Total annual return to shareholders (the
combination of dividends paid and stock price) has averaged 24 percent over the
past five years. In other words, $100.00 invested in UNR stock in 1989 would
have a value of $296.00 on December 31, 1994, a 196 percent increase over the
five-year period.

The performance of the Company during the past five years has been rewarding.
The key factors in the Company's success include:

- - A reorganization plan that removed the asbestos albatross.
- - A majority shareholder who understood our business and supported the election
of outstanding directors.
- - An active and involved Board of Directors that established strategic
objectives and closely monitored management's plans and actions toward
accomplishing those objectives.
- - Management teams at corporate and division levels that provided leadership,
vision, and dedicated hard work.

And most important, the several thousand men and women of the UNR organization
who, individually and collectively, have worked smarter and harder to accomplish
these results.

LEAVITT                                                           [GRAPH: SALES]

Known in the industry as the "Tube People," UNR Leavitt ranks among the nation's
leading manufacturers of structural and mechanical steel tubular products.
Leavitt's unmatched line of steel tubing materials is found in a broad range of
consumer and commercial products, including furniture, housewares, exercise
equipment, lawn care products, toys, shopping carts, business furniture and
fixtures, storage racks, ornamental iron products, and animal confinement
equipment. By producing strong, durable, yet lightweight steel materials,
Leavitt has also expanded its presence in the industrial sector as demand
remains strong for products with high strength-to-weight ratios. In this market,
Leavitt's products are used in manufacturing, construction and farm equipment,
non-residential construction projects, electrical and mechanical equipment, and
various other structural fabrication applications.

With more than 1.1 million square feet of production facilities located in
Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, Leavitt has the capacity to produce more
than 500,000 tons of steel tubing per year, ensuring Leavitt's customers a
continuous supply of steel tubing products--regardless of the size of their
order or how quickly it is needed.

UNR Leavitt celebrated a record year in 1994 both in terms of sales revenues and
tons-of-steel shipped. Operating income was near the Division's historic high.
The economy's expansion fueled much of Leavitt's growth this year, and the
Division's superior service, quality, and inventory capacity contributed
significantly to Leavitt's gains.

As the economy grows, Leavitt's success should continue throughout 1995. By
forging stronger ties to its customers, Leavitt will enhance overall client
service, which it predicts will translate to improved bottomline results. UNR
Leavitt continues to explore new product possibilities and to make further
improvements in productivity and quality.

In 1948, UNR Rohn produced its first tower for home television reception. Today,
UNR Rohn stands as one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and
installation of communication towers and fiberglass and concrete shelters. The
Rohn product line is used in cellular telephone transmission, radio/television
broadcasting, two-way communications, private microwave systems, governmental
communications systems and many other applications. Rohn also manufactures and
distributes galvanized agricultural livestock equipment. With more than 600,000
square feet of production facilities in Illinois, Indiana and Alabama, Rohn
keeps pace with the global market for communication towers and equipment
shelters. In 1994, approximately 100,000 square feet were added to its
state-of-the-art production facility in Alabama to meet industry demand for
concrete and fiberglass equipment shelters.

As Rohn's production capacity grows, so does its workforce of nearly 700 people.
Rohn's experienced professionals help customers respond quickly to new markets
and technologies. With an extensive product inventory, Rohn provides fast
turnaround on orders for towers and equipment shelters, helping its customers
bring new products on-line. Its in-house design and construction staffs can
deliver high-quality towers up to a maximum height of 1,500 feet.


In 1994, Rohn enjoyed its best year with sales exceeding 1993 results by 45
percent. Strong demand in the cellular telephone industry for both towers and
equipment shelters has fueled the Division's excellent performance. UNR Rohn's
future remains bright based on a U.S. telecommunications market that shows few
signs of slowing and an expanding international market. These markets will keep
production of Rohn's towers and equipment shelters running at full throttle.
Looking ahead to 1995 and beyond, emerging technologies, such as personal
communications systems (PCS) and enhanced specialized mobile radio
(ESMR) systems, the continued growth in cellular telephone systems and the new
wireless cable television technologies are all expected to provide revenue
growth opportunities for Rohn.


                                                                               7

PRODUCTS

More than 55 years ago, UNARCO Commercial Products was founded with one goal in
mind--to make the first, and the best, shopping cart. Today, UNARCO is the
nation's largest manufacturer of shopping carts and serves as the primary or
exclusive supplier of steel shopping carts to nine of the ten largest
supermarket chains. UNARCO also manufactures a full line of steel-framed carts
with plastic baskets that clients customize with store logos and colors. After
only three years, the Division has become a leading supplier to the plastic
shopping cart market.

UNARCO is the only manufacturer that also provides supermarkets with a wide
selection of display, handling and stocking equipment, including the "Vendex"
and "VendAll" product lines. In fact, the division's breadth of product
allows it to supply virtually every type of cart required to move merchandise
through a store.

UNARCO's 500,000 square-foot production facility in Oklahoma, which employs more
than 700 people, is the industry's largest and most fully-integrated
manufacturing facility. From this facility, UNARCO distributes its products to
44 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia.

As major retailers continue to benefit from a strong economic climate, the
Division continued to grow through 1994, setting record levels in sales and
volume of carts shipped.

With a well-established position in the U.S. shopping cart market, UNARCO
anticipates 1995 to be a year of continued growth on several fronts, including
its "back room" storage products for grocery stores, its plastic shopping cart
line and its lines of luggage carriers.

[GRAPH: SALES]                                                     HOME PRODUCTS

UNR Home Products is one of the top three manufacturers of residential stainless
steel kitchen sinks in the United States. Marketing its products under three
well-known brand names--"Federal/American, [REGISTERED TRADEMARK]"
"Republic, [REGISTERED TRADEMARK]" and "Luxus [REGISTERED TRADEMARK]"-- Home
Products distributes its stainless steel sinks through retail and plumbing
wholesale outlets to U.S. and international markets.

Home Products also manufactures and distributes the "Ultralux -TM-" sink,
a composite sink made of Asterite [REGISTERED TRADEMARK].  Ultralux is available
in a variety of colors and, unlike porcelain and cast iron sinks, will not chip,
crack, stain or scratch. More than 60 percent lighter than cast iron sinks and
easily installed by one person, Ultralux sinks have quickly become popular among
do-it-yourself customers. The Ultralux line is manufactured at a modern,
10,000-square-foot facility in Louisiana. Completed in mid 1994, the new
facility has tripled Home Products' production capabilities and has made Home
Products the only U.S. sink producer to manufacture composite-based sinks
in-house.

UNR Home Products celebrated its best sales year in 1994. Operating income for
the Division reached near record levels even accounting for the start-up costs
related to bringing the new Ultralux facility on-line.

Although stainless steel costs continue to rise, UNR Home Products is optimistic
about 1995. The Division is strengthening its marketing efforts, and it
continues to reduce manufacturing costs in its stainless steel plant. The
Division also is optimistic about the potential benefits of having a full year
of production capacity at its Ultralux facility.

REAL TIME
SOLUTIONS                                                         [GRAPH: SALES]

As corporations seek new ways to reduce costs and improve productivity, material
handling--the efficient movement and management of inventory--has blossomed into
a multi- billion dollar industry that encompasses a vast array of equipment,
systems and activities. One of the industry's rapidly expanding markets includes
paperless order-picking systems. Real Time Solutions (RTS) is the industry
leader in "pick-to-light" or paperless systems. Marketed under the trade name
EASYpick [REGISTERED TRADEMARK], RTS innovative, computerized system lights up a
control panel to let employees know what product to pick and the quantity.
Customers using EASYpick [REGISTERED TRADEMARK] have reported productivity
increases ranging from 50 to 350 percent, while order fulfillment errors have
dropped by approximately 90 percent.

RTS had a disappointing year in 1994 as both sales and operating income fell
well below 1993 results. Most of the fall-off is attributable to delays in
closing installation contracts. Nevertheless, RTS remains confident that its
technological edge, combined with a more focused sales force, will provide
better results in the future.

A growing U.S. economy will continue to drive interest in warehouse automation.
As a result, RTS anticipates a solid year of growth in 1995. Besides a more
focused sales effort, RTS will introduce two promising products: PUT, a new,
"put-to-light" system designed to accelerate complex cross dock store
distribution; and a receiving and replenishment control system (RCS) which is
fully integrated with the EASYpick [REGISTERED TRADEMARK] system.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of UNR Industries,
Inc. and its subsidiaries ("UNR" or the "Company"). All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less and all treasury bills to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates market value.

INVENTORIES

Inventories valued using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of determining
cost at the end of the years 1994 and 1993, were $18,330,000 and $14,160,000,
respectively. Under the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method of determining cost
(which approximates current or replacement cost), these inventories would have
been approximately $8,720,000 and $7,230,000 higher than those reported at the
end of 1994 and 1993, respectively. There was no significant LIFO liquidation
effect on income in the accompanying financial statements. Inventory costs
include material, labor and factory overhead.

<TABLE>

Total inventories in 1994 and 1993 included the following classifications (In
Thousands):

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

</TABLE>


PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged directly against income; major renewals and betterments
are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
original cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and the profit or loss resulting from the disposal is reflected in
income.

The Company provides for depreciation of plant and equipment over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (buildings--20 to 45 years; machinery and equipment--
3 to 20 years). Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method
for financial reporting purposes and on accelerated methods for tax purposes.

INCOME TAXES

As of January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires a
company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company's financial
statements or tax returns.

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

On December 21, 1992, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations
under Section 468B "Special Rules for Designated Settlement Funds." Prior to the
issuance of these tax regulations, the Company had significant unrecorded net
operating loss carry-forwards resulting from extraordinary reorganization
charges included in the 1989 Statement of Income. Through 1992, these charges
were deducted for income tax purposes only to the extent expenditures were
actually made by the UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims Trust. Approximately $31.8
million of expenditures were made by the Trust in 1992, and the related tax
benefit of $12.1 million was recorded by the Company in that year.

The Section 468B regulations deal with the tax treatment of the Company's 1989
transfer of 29.4 million shares of UNR stock to the UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims
Trust. Based on these regulations, the Company and Trust elected to treat the
Trust as a Qualified Settlement Fund ("QSF") on January 1, 1993, which entitled
the Company to a tax deduction equivalent to the value of the stock held by the
Trust on that date. This deduction substantially reduced the Company's 1993
income tax liability and also generated tax loss carry-backs and carry-forwards.
The Company received Federal and state income tax refunds of $52.6 million as a
result of the carry-backs. Based on these developments, the Company recorded a
tax benefit (net of a valuation allowance of approximately $20.0 million) of
$90.0 million or $1.99 per share in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Total income tax expense/(benefit) for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993,
and 1992, was allocated as follows (In Thousands):

Income tax expense/(benefit) attributable to income from continuing operations
consists of a current provision of $1.5 million, a deferred provision of $14.3
million and a reduction in the valuation allowance of $10.0 million.

Income tax expense/(benefit) attributable to income from continuing operations
was $5,800, $11,700 and $(85,400), for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>


The Company has available approximately $52.0 million of net operating loss
carry-forwards to offset future taxable income through 2008. The Company also
has general business tax credits of $3.0 million which are available to reduce
future Federal income taxes through 2002. A portion of these credits begin to
expire starting in 1997. Alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits of approximately
$5.5 million are available to reduce future Federal taxable income over an
indefinite period. As a result of adopting SFAS 109 in 1992, the Company has
recognized the benefit of approximately $98.0 million of its net operating loss
carry-forwards and tax credits realized or expected to be realized through 1996.
The utilization of the net operating loss and credit carry-forwards depends on
future taxable income during the applicable carry-forward periods. The Company
has therefore provided a valuation allowance as required under SFAS 109 to
reflect the inherent uncertainty of projections as to future events. This
valuation allowance has been reduced to $10.0 million as of December 31, 1994.
The reduction in the valuation allowance to $10.0 million relates to
management's judgment concerning the realizability of benefits arising from net
operating loss and credit carry-forwards. The remaining net operating loss
carry-forwards and the general business and AMT tax credits available to the
Company may be recorded into income and equity at a future date.

NET INCOME PER SHARE

Net income per share of common stock is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average common shares
were 49,318,000 in 1994, 47,369,000 in 1993 and 45,040,000 in 1992. Dilution,
which would result if all outstanding warrants and options were exercised, is
not significant to the net income per share computation.

POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

In December, 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new
standard on accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions,
primarily related to health care and dental benefit coverage. The new standard
requires that the expected cost of these benefits must be charged to expense
during the years that the employees render service. The Company has no material
liability for postretirement benefits other than pensions.

In November, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new
standard on accounting for postemployment benefits. The new standard requires
that the expected cost of benefits provided to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement be recognized on the accrual basis of
accounting. The Company has no material liability for postemployment benefits.

PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans covering
substantially all of their employees. Included in these plans are certain
union-sponsored plans to which the Company makes annual contributions equal to
the amounts accrued. The total pension expense for union-sponsored plans for
1994, 1993, and 1992 was approximately $1,038,000, $839,000 and $806,000,
respectively. The Company has one trustee-administered profit-sharing plan
covering salaried employees. Discretionary contributions of $1,073,000, $998,000
and $975,000 were made and charged to expense in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Total pension expense/(benefit) for Company-sponsored plans for
1994, 1993 and 1992 was $271,000, $224,000 and $(33,000), respectively. Pension
expense includes the following components (In Thousands):

(2) INSURANCE RECOVERIES

The 1992 Statement of Income includes a $13.0 million pre-tax insurance recovery
($8.1 million after-tax), or $.18 per share, as a result of a litigation
settlement reached in June, 1992, with one of the Company's previous insurance
carriers.

On July 15, 1992, the Company received approximately $25.8 million pursuant to a
settlement agreement entered into in 1989 by UNR and another insurance company.
The money had been held by the insurance company until certain conditions in the
settlement agreement were satisfied.

(3) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In June of 1994, the Company decided to divest itself of the industrial storage
rack business of the Material Handling Division. On February 2, 1995, the
Company announced the sale of this business to the Renco Group, Inc. The net
assets of this operation have been reclassified to "Net assets of discontinued
operations" (Other Assets) in the accompanying balance sheets. The after-tax
$2.5 million provision for estimated loss on disposition includes a write-down
of these assets to estimated net realizable values and the estimated costs of
disposing this operation.

On March 4, 1993, the Company decided to divest its Midwest CATV Division (a
distributor of products to the cable television industry) and its Midwest Steel
Division (a distributor of rail and trackwork). In May, 1993, the Company sold
assets of the Midwest Steel Division to L.B. Foster Company and assets of the
Midwest CATV Division to Anixter Bros., Inc. At December 31, 1992, the net
assets of these operations were reclassified to "Net assets of discontinued
operations" (Other Assets) in the accompanying balance sheet. Estimated loss on
dispositions included an after-tax $6.2 million provision for this matter which
included a write-down of these assets to estimated net realizable values and the
estimated costs of disposing these operations.

Net sales from discontinued operations were $57.6 million, $72.1 million and
$108.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(4) LITIGATION

The Company is involved in various pending legal proceedings and claims arising
in the normal course of its business. Although the outcome of such proceedings
and claims cannot be determined with certainty, the Company is of the opinion,
after consultation with counsel, that such proceedings and claims, individually
or in the aggregate, are not material to its business or financial condition.

(5) LEASES

The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under operating
leases or capital leases, as defined by SFAS No. 13. The Company's property
under capital leases, which is included in plant and equipment, consists of
$6,021,000 at December 31, 1994, and $4,194,000 at December 31, 1993 (see
Note 6).

Future minimum payments for operating leases at December 31, 1994, are

</TABLE>

The mortgage notes payable primarily relate to the Company's steel tubing
manufacturing facilities in Chicago and Indiana. The net book value of property
pledged as collateral for the mortgage loans amounted to approximately
$22,914,000 and $25,163,000 as of December 31, 1994 and 1993.

In October 1994, the Company expanded its line of credit for short-term
borrowings with a bank from $20.0 million to $35.0 million. Under the terms of
the agreement, interest rates are determined at the time of borrowing with
interest payable at the prevailing prime rate or LIBOR rate plus 1-1/4%, at the
Company's option. There were no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 1994, and
at December 31, 1993, outstanding borrowings totalled $5.1 million at an average
interest rate of 5.4%. Such credit agreement is secured by certain accounts
receivable of the Company and its subsidiaries. The commitment fee on the unused
portion of the facility is 3/8% per annum.

Aggregate annual payments required on secured debt, including capitalized
leases, are $3,470,000 in 1995, $4,196,000 in 1996, $3,559,000 in 1997,
$3,583,000 in 1998, $3,612,000 in 1999 and $8,328,000 thereafter.

(7) RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN

The UNR Industries, Inc. Restricted Stock Plan was approved by the shareholders
of the Company on July 30, 1992. The Plan provides for the granting of
restricted stock to certain key employees and reserves for issuance of 1,000,000
shares of common stock.

The Company had 197,563 and 133,096 shares of restricted stock outstanding at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Of the current shares outstanding,
110,000 were awarded to the Company's President and CEO in connection with his
employment agreement and 87,563 shares were issued to certain key employees of
the Company. These shares have the same dividend and voting rights as other
common stock, except that extraordinary dividends on restricted stock held by
employees other than the President are paid in the form of additional shares of
restricted stock. Restricted stock is considered to be currently issued and
outstanding. The cost of the restricted stock, determined as the fair market
value of the shares at the date of grant, is expensed ratably over a
three-to-five year vesting period. Such expense amounted to $383,000 in 1994 and
$211,000 in 1993.


                                                                              21

(8) STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Company had two stock option plans at December 31, 1994, the Key Executives'
Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.

The Key Executives' Stock Option Plan was approved by the shareholders of the
Company on July 12, 1990. This Plan provides for granting of non-qualified and
incentive stock options, and reserves for the issuance of up to 2,500,000
authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Outstanding options granted
under this Plan are exercisable at a price equal to the fair market value at the
date of grant and expire in 10 years. At December 31, 1994, 1,153,000 common
shares were available for granting under this Plan. There are no outstanding
options under this Plan at December 31, 1994.

The 1994 Stock Option Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company on
November 1, 1994. This Plan provides for granting of non-qualified options and
reserves for the issuance of up to 500,000 shares. Outstanding options granted
under this Plan are exercisable at a price equal to the fair market value at the
date of grant, reduced by the amount of any "Extraordinary Dividend" made after
the date of grant, and expire in five years. Each option is exercisable upon the
attainment of certain stock price thresholds, adjusted for extraordinary
dividends, or fifty four months, whichever comes earlier. At December 31, 1994,
95,000 common shares were available for granting under this Plan.

Information relating to these Plans are summarized below (In Thousands Except

(9) ACQUISITIONS

On April 27, 1993, the Company purchased all the issued and outstanding stock of
Real Time Solutions, Inc. ("RTS"). RTS provides automated inventory management
products to the warehouse and distribution industry. Their primary product is a
light directed display based inventory picking, sorting, packing and shipping
system called "EASYpick." The purchase price included $4.2 million of cash and
616,102 shares of common stock valued at approximately $4.2 million. The
purchase price exceeded the fair value of RTS's net assets by approximately $7.7
million which is reported as goodwill in the accompanying balance sheets and is
being amortized over a seven-year period. Amortization expense for 1994 was
$1,097,000 and $823,000 in 1993.

(10) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

In connection with the Company's Plan of Reorganization, effective June 2, 1989,
stockholders of record as of that date, retained their common stock and received
one warrant for each share of common stock owned with the right to purchase an
additional share of common stock at $5.15 per share until June 14, 1995.
Additionally, upon exercise, warrantholders are entitled to receive any
extraordinary dividend (as defined) paid or payable by the Company. The amount
related to the Company's potential obligation to pay extraordinary dividends to
such warrantholders upon conversion ($4.20 per warrant) has been reclassified
from Stockholders' Equity and recorded as Warrants in the accompanying balance
sheets. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the number of outstanding convertible
warrants were 1,316,881 and 2,318,750, respectively.

On September 24, 1990, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
authorized the acquisition, through both negotiated transactions involving large
blocks and open-market purchases, of up to 1.5 million shares of its common
stock to be held as treasury shares and be available to meet requirements of its
Key Executives' Stock Option Plan. As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, 1,133,565
shares have been purchased.

On May 6, 1993, the Company's stockholders approved a reduction in the par value
per share of common stock from $2.50 to $.01. This resulted in a $119,482,000
reduction in Common Stock and a corresponding increase to Capital Surplus.

On March 3, 1995, the Company declared a regular dividend of $.25 per share and
an extraordinary dividend of $1.30 per share to be paid on April 17, 1995 to
Stockholders of record on April 3, 1995.

On April 1, 1994, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.20 per share to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 18, 1994.

On December 1, 1993, the Company paid an extraordinary dividend of $1.20 per
share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 16,
1993. This dividend was a non-taxable return of capital distribution.

On February 1, 1993, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.20 and an
extraordinary dividend of $2.00, respectively, on each issued and outstanding
share of the Company's common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of
business on January 15, 1993. Both dividends are non-taxable return of capital
distributions.

On January 15, 1992, a $.20 regular and $1.00 extraordinary dividend was paid to
stockholders of record on December 31, 1991.

(11) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company presently holds three notes receivable for a total of $9,100,000
from executive officers of the Company. These notes are related to the 1994
Executive Stock Purchase Plan approved by shareholders of the Company on
November 1, 1994. Under the Plan, executive officers purchased 1,650,000 shares
of common stock from the Company, at the then fair market value. Shares were
paid for in cash in the amount of the par value of the stock and the balance in
promissory notes due in three years. The notes are interest free (although
interest is imputed for tax purposes), except in the event a participant resigns
from the Company, is terminated for cause or, if the stock is sold within three
years, the notes become due and interest at the applicable Federal rate is
applied retroactively from the date of the notes. Dividends, net of Federal and
state taxes, are applied to the principal of the notes. If the stock is not
sufficient to satisfy the loan balance at maturity, the participant can transfer
the shares in partial payment of the note and is personally liable for that
portion of the note exceeding 25% of the loan balance.


                                                                              23

(12) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates two business segments within the United States.

Net sales include only those to unaffiliated customers, as reported in the
Company's Statements of Income. Intersegment sales are eliminated in the
financial statements and are also eliminated in these tables since they

expenses directly related to the segment involved. Corporate assets consists
principally of cash, prepaid expenses and other assets. (In Thousands):

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of UNR Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UNR INDUSTRIES,
INC. (a Delaware corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
bymanagement, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UNR Industries, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                            ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

YEAR 1994 VERSUS YEAR 1993

NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  Net sales from continuing operations in
1994 were $372.4 million versus $312.9 million in 1993 or an increase of 19.0%.
The sales increase is due primarily to greater volume of steel tubing, greatly
improved sales of communication towers and shelters and higher volume of
shopping cart sales over the prior year. The 1994 sales are the highest in the
Company's history and the third consecutive year of record sales.

GROSS PROFIT.  In 1994, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.7%, just
above the prior year's 22.6%. Although sales volume grew substantially,
increases in the cost of raw materials (primarily steel) and competitive pricing
pressures kept margins flat. In contrast to last year, Real Time Solutions, Inc.
(RTS) experienced weak sales, had a down year and the resulting drop in gross
profit negatively impacted results.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses (SG&A) in 1994 were 11.9% of sales versus 12.1% in 1993.
SG&A in 1993 included a $2.9 million gain relating to a patent infringement
settlement in the shopping cart division. Excluding this gain, 1993 SG&A was
13.0% of sales. The reduction is due to cost control measures and to cost
reduction efforts made during the year.

INTEREST EXPENSE.  Despite generally higher debt levels, interest expense
decreased from the prior year, due to the renegotiation of an outstanding
mortgage at a lower interest rate and to generally lower rates prevailing during
the year versus last year.

INTEREST INCOME.  Interest income increased over the prior year due to generally
greater levels of available cash offset somewhat by lower prevailing interest
rates during 1994 versus 1993.

INCOME TAXES.  See footnote 1 for a complete discussion of UNR taxes.

INTERNATIONAL.  International sales, which represented 2.8% of sales of the
Company, increased slightly from the prior year as increased sales of towers
were offset by decreased sales of shopping carts. The Hong Kong and Australian
shopping cart operations have recently been closed, but the Company will
continue to do business in these areas through sales agents.

SEGMENTS.   The Industrial Segment (principal products of this segment are steel
tubing and computerized warehouse control systems) sales increased 12.0% in 1994
to $179.8 million from $160.5 in 1993. This increase is due entirely to greater
volume of steel tube sales at the Leavitt Tube Division. RTS (computerized
warehouse controls) sales decreased primarily because of delays in finalizing
installation contracts. Operating income for 1994 was $18.2 million versus $17.9
million in the prior year or an increase of 1.9%. A 15.9% increase at Leavitt
Tube was offset by a decrease at RTS. Leavitt Tube achieved this increase in
operating income despite a cost increase of approximately 10.0% in hot and cold
rolled steel coils, its largest single element of cost.

The Commercial Segment (principal products of this segment are shopping carts,
steel towers and concrete shelters for the telecommunications industry and
stainless steel and composite sinks) sales increased 26.4% in 1994 to $192.6
million from $152.4 million in 1993. Although all businesses in this segment
reported higher sales, the increase is due primarily to greater sales volume of
communication towers and shelters. Operating income for this segment was $27.8
million in 1994 versus $21.8 million in 1993, an increase of 27.4%. This
increase, as with the segment's sales increase, was due largely to the strong
performance in the tower and shelter business.

YEAR 1993 VERSUS YEAR 1992

NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  Net sales from continuing operations in
1993 were $312.9 million versus $281.8 million in 1992 or an increase of 11.0%.
Although all of the Company's divisions reported higher sales for the year, the
increase in sales is due largely to the increase in sales volume of steel tubing
and communication towers and shelters sales over the prior period.

GROSS PROFIT.  In 1993, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.6% as
compared with 22.8% in the prior year. This decrease largely related to lower
margins due to rapidly escalating steel costs and competitive pricing pressure
in the tower market. Also contributing to this decrease was a change in sales
product mix of high volume low margin shopping carts at the Commercial Products
Division. The strong gross margins contributed by the Real Time Solutions
Division were a positive offset to the lower margins in the other divisions.


                                                                              27

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and
administrative expenses (SG&A) in 1993 were 12.1% of sales versus 12.0% in 1992.
The 1993 SG&A included a $2.9 million gain relating to a patent infringement
settlement in the shopping cart division. Excluding this gain, SG&A was 13.0% of
sales in 1993, versus 12.0% in 1992 or an increase of 8.3%. This increase was
due mainly to additional expenses of approximately $4.0 million at Real Time
Solutions, Inc., offset by a reduction in expenses at the steel tubing, shopping
cart and sink divisions.

INTEREST EXPENSE.  Interest expense decreased slightly from the prior year due
to lower outstanding debt levels in 1993 versus 1992.

INTEREST INCOME.  Interest income decreased $2.8 million from the prior year's
income of $4.1 million. This decrease was due to lower available cash balances,
lower interest rates in 1993 versus 1992 and the collection and sale of
discounted insurance note receivables.

INCOME TAXES.  See footnote 1 for a complete discussion of UNR's taxes.

INTERNATIONAL.  International sales, although a small part of overall sales
volume, increased 50.8% from the prior year. Sales of shopping carts into Japan
and Hong Kong increased as well as the sales of towers into the Mexican market.
The Company continued to explore international opportunities as they presented
themselves. The overall impact of foreign operations on 1993's results was
minimal.

SEGMENTS.  The Industrial Segment (principal products of this segment are steel
tubing and computerized warehouse control systems) sales increased 13.8% in 1993
to $160.5 million from $141.1 million in 1992. The sales increase was due mainly
to a 6.0% increase in volume of steel tube sales, and the additional sales
achieved through the acquisition of Real Time Solutions, Inc. Sales for RTS
substantially exceeded first year expectations, as its paperless picking system
was widely received in the marketplace, with extremely positive results.
Operating income in 1993 was $17.9 million versus $17.6 million in 1992 or an
increase of 1.5%. As with the sales increase, this increase was the result of
operating income positively affected by the strong margins achieved by RTS.
Leavitt Tube also achieved an 8.8% increase in profitability through increased
sales volume, despite the fact that market prices for hot rolled steel coils,
the largest single cost element rose 20.0%. Negatively affecting profitability
in 1993 was an accounting charge of $2.7 million, due to escalating steel prices
as compared to zero in 1992.

The Commercial Segment (principal products of this segment are shopping carts,
steel towers and shelters for the communications industry and stainless steel
sinks) sales increased 8.3% in 1993 to $152.3 million from $140.7 million in
1992. Although, all businesses in this segment reported higher sales, the
increase in sales was due largely to an increase in communication tower and
shelter sales over the prior period. Operating income for this segment was $21.8
million in 1993 versus $18.1 million in 1992 or an increase of 20.5%. As
previously mentioned the 1993 results included a $2.9 million gain from a patent
infringement settlement for the Commercial Products Division. Excluding the $2.9
million gain, operating income increased 4.5%.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  Cash flow during 1994 was a positive $67.8
million which included a payment of $9.7 million in dividends and the receipt of
$52.6 million of income tax refunds. The Company's financial condition continues
to be strong with working capital of $159.0 million. The Company's working
capital ratio, a measure of short term liquidity, increased from 3.7 to 1 in
1993 to 4.2 to 1 in 1994. Both measures are considered strong indicators of
liquidity.

Capital expenditures were $9.2 million in 1994 versus $4.8 million in 1993.
Capital expenditures in 1994 included the expansion of the Rohn plant in
Bessemer, Alabama, which produces concrete and fiberglass shelters and the
completion of the composite sink facility of the Home Products Division in
Ruston, Louisiana. The Company's current operating plan calls for capital
spending in 1995 to be approximately $10.0 million, which approximates
depreciation.

The Company expects to meet its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure
requirements from operating cash flows, borrowings under a $35.0 million
short-term credit facility and the proceeds from the sale of the Unarco Material
Handling Division. In addition, the Company's strong unleveraged balance sheet
allows it to access funds, if needed, from the capital markets.

INFLATION.  The impact of inflation on UNR's operations is principally related
to steel price volatility which can moderately affect earnings from time to
time.
