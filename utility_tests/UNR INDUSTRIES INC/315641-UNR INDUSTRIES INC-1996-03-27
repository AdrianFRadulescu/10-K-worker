                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
  (a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
 
    UNR  Industries, Inc.  a Delaware  corporation ("Registrant"  or "UNR"), was
organized in 1979 as a holding company.
 
    On July 29,  1982, Registrant and  ten of its  subsidiaries, filed  separate
voluntary  petitions for  reorganization under Chapter  11 of  the United States
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern  District
of    Illinois,   Eastern   Division.   The   Registrant   was   designated   as
debtor-in-possession and  its operations  continued in  the ordinary  course  of
business.
 
    On  March 15,  1989, Registrant and  the seven subsidiaries  not having been
previously discharged, filed a Disclosure  Statement and a Consolidated Plan  of
Reorganization  ("Plan") with the Bankruptcy Court.  Effective June 2, 1989, the
Registrant's Plan  of  Reorganization  was confirmed  by  the  Bankruptcy  Court
following acceptance of the Plan by the Registrant's creditors and stockholders.
 
    Pursuant  to the Plan, 42,404,847 shares  of common stock of the reorganized
Registrant were issued to the  UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims Trust (the  "Trust"),
the  unsecured creditors  and to the  existing and future  asbestos claimants in
full discharge of all claims. The Plan also provided that all proceeds from  the
litigation  against certain insurance companies would become unencumbered assets
of the Registrant.  Existing shareholders  retained 3,687,378  shares of  common
stock  and received six-year warrants to purchase an additional 3,687,378 shares
of common stock at $5.15 per share.
 
    On December 31, 1992, Unarco Industries, Inc. and UNR, Inc. merged into  UNR
Industries,  Inc. All remaining subsidiaries became wholly owned subsidiaries of
UNR Industries,  Inc., except  Holco Corporation  which remains  a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of Leavitt Structural  Tubing Company, a  wholly owned subsidiary of
UNR Industries, Inc.
 
    On June 11, 1993, UNR received a letter from the Trust, holder at that  time
of  62% of  the common stock  of the  Registrant, proposing that  UNR's Board of
Directors  consider  retaining  a  financial  adviser  to  solicit   third-party
proposals  for acquisition of UNR through a merger or other business combination
in which UNR's shareholders  would receive cash for  their shares and to  advise
whether  any such proposed transactions would be  fair from a financial point of
view to UNR's shareholders.
 
    On June 22, 1993, UNR's Board  of Directors established a Special  Committee
of  independent directors  to consider  and to  implement appropriate  action in
response to the Trust's proposal,  including the solicitation and evaluation  of
offers  for acquisition of  UNR and to  make a report  and recommendation to the
Board of Directors.
 
    On August 4, 1993, the Special Committee engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
as its financial adviser. On February 9, 1994, UNR announced that the  proposals
received  were subject to conditions and that  none of the proposals indicated a
per share value greater than $6.50. On February 22, 1994, UNR announced that the
proposals  received  were  either  inadequate  or  too  conditional  to  warrant
recommendations  by the  Special Committee to  the Board of  Directors, that all
discussions with potential buyers  had been terminated and  that all efforts  to
seek further offers had ceased.
 
    In  1994, the  Registrant sold the  industrial storage rack  business of its
Material Handling Division. In 1993, the  Registrant sold its Midwest Steel  and
Midwest  CATV Divisions. Accordingly, operating  results of these divisions were
reclassified to discontinued operations.
 
    On September 7, 1995, the Registrant  announced that its Board of  Directors
authorized  Company management to explore  the sale of all  or a majority of its
common stock.  J.P.  Morgan Securities  Inc.  was  retained to  assist  in  this
process.
 
    On  January  26, 1996,  the Registrant  announced that  efforts to  sell the
entire Company did not result in a  satisfactory offer, and that it would  begin
discussions  with  multiple  parties regarding  the  sale  of four  of  its five
operating divisions and  focus on  the growth  and development  of its  UNR-ROHN
Division  ("ROHN"). ROHN manufactures towers, poles, antenna mounts and shelters
for the telecommunications industry  and provides turnkey installation  services
for these products, custom fabrication and custom hot-dip galvanizing. ROHN also
manufactures livestock equipment for the farm and exposition centers.
 
    The  four divisions to be sold, which are treated as discontinued operations
for financial reporting purposes, are as follows:
 
    - UNR Leavitt Division,  a manufacturer of  structural and mechanical  steel
tubing which are used in a broad range of commercial and consumer products.
 
    -  Unarco Commercial Products Division, a  manufacturer of steel and plastic
shopping carts, supermarket stock handling equipment and luggage carts.
 
    - UNR  Home  Products  Division,  a  manufacturer  of  stainless  steel  and
composite sinks for residential use.
 
    -  Real Time  Solutions, Inc., a  wholly owned subsidiary  of the Registrant
that was  acquired  in 1993,  is  engaged in  providing  computerized  warehouse
management and control systems.
 
  (b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
    Information  required  under this  section appears  as Note  11 to  the 1995
Consolidated Financial Statements of  the Registrant included  as Exhibit 13  to
this Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
  (c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
    Registrant  manufactures and markets towers, poles, masts and mounts used as
support structures  for  antennae  and  concrete  and  fiberglass  shelters  and
cabinets to house electronic telecommunications equipment. The
telecommunications  markets served by these  products include cellular, personal
communications systems,  enhanced  specialized mobile  radio,  paging  services,
radio  and  television  broadcast, wireless  cable,  private  microwave systems,
military  communications  systems,  direct   broadcast  satellite  and   network
switching.
 
    Registrant  also manufactures a line of  livestock handling products sold to
farmers, ranchers,  fairs  and  exposition and  equestrian  facilities,  privacy
fencing sold to the military and other customers and provides custom fabrication
and  hot-dip galvanizing services.  These items represent  in the aggregate less
than ten percent of Registrant's revenues.
 
    Registrant's telecommunications products are sold directly to customers  and
through distributors throughout the United States and to international markets.
 
    All  of  the  raw materials  required  for the  manufacture  of Registrant's
products are readily available from a number of different suppliers.
 
    PATENTS
 
    The Registrant has  a number of  patents and trademarks,  none of which  are
considered material to the consolidated operations.
 
    EMPLOYEES
 
    As  of December 31, 1995, the  Registrant employed approximately 700 people.
Collective bargaining  agreements  cover  approximately  300  employees  at  its
facilities  in  Peoria, Illinois,  and Frankfort,  Indiana.  The unions  are the
United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)
in Peoria  and the  Retail,  Wholesale and  Department  Store Union  (RWDSU)  in
Frankfort. The Registrant considers its relations with its employees to be good.
 
    COMPETITION
 
    The  Registrant  competes with  a  number of  manufacturers  in each  of its
products. Although the available information  does not permit the Registrant  to
provide  accurate data  as to its  precise competitive  position, the Registrant
believes it  has  a  significant  share  in the  product  classes  in  which  it
participates.  The  principal  methods  of competition  are  price,  quality and
product service.
 
    BACKLOG AND FOREIGN SALES
 
    The Registrant's backlog of firm  orders was approximately $26.9 million  at
December  31, 1995, and  $25.8 million at  December 31, 1994.  It is anticipated
that all of  the backlog  orders will  be filled  during the  current year.  The
stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of company sales or profits for any
future period.
 
    Foreign  sales of the  Registrant in 1995, 1994  and 1993 were approximately
$8.5 million, $7.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
 
OTHER
 
    The Registrant  employs  some  environmentally hazardous  materials  in  its
manufacturing  processes, including oils  and solvents. The  Registrant has made
expenditures to  comply  with  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including
investigation  and remediation of ground and water contamination, and expects to
make such  expenditures in  the  future to  comply  with existing  and  probable
requirements.  While such expenditures to date  have not materially affected the
Registrant's capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition  or
results of operations, there can be no assurance that more stringent regulations
or enforcement in the future will not have such effects.
 
    In some cases, the Registrant has notified state or federal authorities of a
possible  need to remedy  sites it previously operated.  The Registrant has also
been notified by various  state and federal  governmental authorities that  they
believe   it  may  be  a  "potentially  responsible  party"  or  otherwise  have
responsibility with respect  to clean-up  obligations at  certain hazardous  and
other  waste disposal sites which were not  owned or operated by the Registrant.
In some such cases,  the Registrant has effected  settlements with the  relevant
authorities  or  other  parties  for immaterial  amounts.  In  other  cases, the
Registrant is participating  in negotiations  for settlement  with the  relevant
authorities  or other  parties or  has notified  the authorities  that it denies
liability for  clean-up obligations.  At  all such  sites,  costs which  may  be
incurred are difficult to accurately predict until the level of contamination is
determined.  The  Registrant, after  consultation  with legal  counsel  and with
environmental experts, believes that the ultimate outcome with respect to all of
these sites  will not  have  a material  effect  on the  Registrant's  financial
condition or on the results of its operations.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.
 
    The  following table sets  forth information concerning  location, size, use
and nature of  the principal  manufacturing facilities  owned or  leased by  the
Registrant  (for continuing operations only). The Registrant believes its plants
are suitable for their purposes, are well maintained and are adequately insured.
Not included in the table are leased warehouses, aggregating 25,800 square  feet
and the Registrant's sales offices, all of which are leased.

</TABLE>
 
    The  Registrant  uses a  wide variety  of  standard and  specialized machine
tools,  many  varying  types  of  equipment  and  many  different  manufacturing
processes  in producing its products. The Registrant considers, that in general,
its  plants  are  equipped  with  modern  and  well-maintained  equipment.   The
Registrant's operations make virtually full use of all existing facilities.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
 
    The  Registrant is involved in various  pending legal proceedings and claims
arising in  the  normal  course  of  business.  Although  the  outcome  of  such
proceedings  and  claims cannot  be determined  with certainty,  the Registrant,
after consultation with legal counsel, considers that such matters, individually
or in  the  aggregate,  will  not  have  a  materially  adverse  effect  on  the
Registrant's operations or its financial condition.
 
ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
 
    There  have been no matters  submitted to a vote  of security holders during
the fourth quarter of 1995.

       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE
 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of UNR Industries, Inc.:
 
    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial  statements included in  UNR Industries, Inc.'s  1995
Annual  Report to Stockholders incorporated by  reference in this Form 10-K, and
have issued our report thereon dated March  7, 1996. Our audit was made for  the
purpose  of forming  an opinion on  the basic  consolidated financial statements
taken as a  whole. The  supplemental schedule included  in Part  IV, Item  14(a)
(Allowance  for  Doubtful  Accounts)  is  the  responsibility  of  the Company's
management and is presented  for purposes of complying  with the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures  applied
in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly  states in all  material respects the  financial data required  to be set
forth therein in relation to  the basic consolidated financial statements  taken
as a whole.

June 22, 1995

The Board of Directors
UNR Industries, Inc.
332 South Michigan Avenue
Chicago, Illinois 60604

Attention:  Mr. Thomas A. Gildehaus
            President and Chief Executive Officer

Members of the Board:

This letter confirms our understanding (the "Agreement") that UNR Industries, 
Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the "Company") has 
engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("J.P. Morgan") to act as the Company's 
exclusive financial advisor with respect to the Company's analysis and review 
of its general corporate and financial strategies and its consideration of 
various potential strategic or financial transactions, including any sale, 
merger, consolidation, or any other business combination, in one or a series 
of transactions, involving all or a portion of the stock, assets, or business 
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions (each, a "Business 
Combination"), any repurchase by the Company of a significant amount of its 
securities, any recapitalization of the Company, or any spin-off, split-off, 
or other extraordinary dividend in excess of $1.00 per share on the Company's 
common stock, in cash, securities, or other assets, to stockholders of the 
Company (each of the foregoing, including any Business Combination, a 
"Transaction").

As discussed, we propose to undertake certain services on your behalf as part 
of our mandate to assist you in analyzing and evaluating various strategic 
and financial alternatives, including to the extent requested by you:
(i) assisting you in preparing an offering memorandum describing the Company, 
its operations, historical performance, and future prospects,
(ii) identifying and contacting selected qualified acquirors acceptable to 
you, (iii) arranging for potential acquirors to conduct business 
investigations, (iv) assisting you in negotiating the financial aspects of 
any proposed Transaction, and (v) delivering an opinion to the Board of 
Directors of the Company, if requested, as to the fairness to the Company's 
stockholders from a financial point of view of the consideration to be 
received by the Company's stockholders in any proposed Transaction (an 
"Opinion").

As compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder by J.P. Morgan, the 
Company agrees to pay J.P. Morgan (i) an engagement fee (the "Engagement 
Fee") of $200,000 payable promptly upon execution of this Agreement,
(ii) a success fee as described below (the "Success Fee"), and (iii) a no-go 
fee (the "No-Go Fee") of $300,000, payable 12 months from the date of this 
Agreement in the event that a bona fide written proposal (or proposals) for a 
Business Combination (or Business Combinations), determined by the Board of 
Directors to be reasonably acceptable, is received from a third party (or 
parties) during the

                                          1


<PAGE>

term of this Agreement, and the Company has rejected such proposal (or 
proposals) and no alternative Transactions are or become available to the 
Company during the term of this Agreement.

The Success Fee (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph) referred to 
in clause (ii) above shall be in an amount equal to (1) 0.70% (70 basis 
points) of the Aggregate Transaction Value (as hereinafter defined) if only 
one Business Combination is consummated by the Company and (2) .80% (80 basis 
points) of the Aggregate Transaction Value if two or more Business 
Combinations are consummated. If the Company consummates any sale or other 
transfer of stock, assets or business of its Home Products division to 
Franke, Inc. (a "Home Products Transaction"), the foregoing Success Fee 
structure shall not apply to such Transaction and J.P. Morgan shall receive 
instead a Success Fee equal to .35% (35 basis points) of the Aggregate 
Transaction value of such Home Products Transaction; PROVIDED, however, that 
the Success Fee structure slated in the first sentence of this paragraph 
shall apply to any Transaction involving the Home Products division other 
than such a sale or other transfer to Franke, Inc. The Engagement Fee paid to 
J.P. Morgan hereunder shall be credited to any Success Fee payable to J.P. 
Morgan hereunder. A Success Fee shall be payable with respect to each 
Transaction in cash upon consummation of such Transaction. In the event that 
the Company enters into a Transaction other than a Business Combination, J.P. 
Morgan and the Company will negotiate, in good faith, a mutually agreeable 
Success Fee, which will take into account, among other things, the results 
obtained and the custom and practice among investment bankers acting in 
similar transactions.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Aggregate Transaction Value" means the 
aggregate amount of consideration received by the Company and/or its 
stockholders (treating any shares issuable upon exercise of options, 
warrants, or other rights of conversion as outstanding) in all Transactions, 
plus the amount of any debt securities or other liabilities assumed, 
redeemed, or remaining outstanding or equity securities redeemed or remaining 
outstanding in connection with all Transactions, plus, without duplication, 
the value of any securities, cash, or other assets (in the case of 
distributions to the Company's common stockholders, including only 
extraordinary dividends in excess of $1.00 per share on the Company's common 
stock) distributed to stockholders of the Company since the date hereof.

For purposes of this Agreement, a Transaction  shall be deemed to have been 
consummated upon the earliest of any of the following events to occur:
(a) the acquisition by another person of at least 80% of the outstanding 
common stock of, or voting power in, the Company; (b) a merger or 
consolidation of the Company with another person; (c) the acquisition by 
another person of assets of the  Company representing at least 5% of the 
Company's book value; (d) acquisition by the Company (including any such 
acquisition by any shareholder of the Company) of at least 20% of its 
outstanding equity securities; (e) consummation of any recapitilization; or 
(f) the receipt by stockholders of the Company of any cash, securities, or 
other assets to be distributed in any spin-off, split-off or other


                                         2

<PAGE>

extraordinary dividend (in the case of distributions to the Company's common 
stockholders, including only such distributions in excess of $1.00 per share 
of the Company's common stock).

If the consideration or other value received in any Business Combination is 
paid in whole or in part in the form of securities, the value of such 
securities, for purposes of calculating the Success Fee, shall be the fair 
market value thereof, as the parties hereto shall mutually agree, on the day 
prior to the consummation of the Business Combination; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, 
that if such securities consist of securities with an existing public trading 
market, the value thereof shall be determined by the last sales price for 
such securities on the last trading day thereof prior to such consummation. 
If all or a portion of the consideration is related to or contingent upon the 
future earnings or operations of the Company, the portion of J.P. Morgan's 
compensation relating thereto shall be calculated and shall be paid at the 
time the Transaction is consummated based upon the estimated net present 
value thereof.

The Company agrees to provide J.P. Morgan all financial and other information 
requested by it for the purpose of its assignment hereunder. In performing 
its services hereunder (including, without limitation, in giving any 
Opinion), J.P. Morgan shall be entitled to rely upon and assume, without 
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information 
that is publicly available and of all information that has been furnished to 
it by the Company or otherwise reviewed by J.P. Morgan , and J.P. Morgan 
shall not assume any responsibility nor have any liability therefor. J.P. 
Morgan shall have no obligation to conduct any valuation or appraisal of any 
assets or liabilities. For the execution of its assignment, J.P. Morgan shall 
establish a team of qualified individuals from appropriate specialty areas 
within J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, including Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Company of New York.

Any financial advice rendered by J.P. Morgan pursuant to this Agreement may 
not be disclosed publicly in any manner without J.P. Morgan's prior written 
approval and will be treated by the Company as confidential. J.P. Morgan 
understands that its Opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or 
information statement mailed to stockholders of the Company and agrees to 
provide its written approval for such use.

In order to coordinate our efforts with respect to possible Transactions, 
during the period of our engagement hereunder neither the Company nor any 
representative thereof (other than J.P. Morgan) will initiate discussions 
regarding a Transaction except through J.P. Morgan. If the Company or its 
management receives an inquiry regarding a Transaction (other than the Home 
Products Transaction), they will promptly advise J.P. Morgan of such inquiry 
in order that J.P. Morgan may evaluate the person making such inquiry and its 
interest and assist the Company in any resulting negotiations.

The Company agrees to reimburse J.P. Morgan promptly upon request from time 
to time for all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, travel, 
communication, and document production expenses, and the fees and 
disbursements of counsel) incurred by J.P. Morgan in


                                         3

performing its engagement hereunder, whether or not a Transaction is 
consummated. The Company also agrees to indemnify J.P. Morgan and certain 
other entities and persons as set forth on Schedule I attached hereto.

This Agreement may be terminated by either the Company or J.P. Morgan at any 
time upon giving written notice to the other party. No such termination will 
affect (i) J.P. Morgan's rights to receive fees accrued prior to such 
termination or to receive reimbursement of its expenses as set forth above, 
(ii) the rights of J.P. Morgan or any other Indemnified Person (as defined in 
Schedule I hereto) to receive indemnification and contribution, or (iii) the 
Company's confidentiality obligations hereunder. In addition, if at any time 
prior to the expiration of 18 months after any such termination by the 
Company or expiration of this Agreement a Transaction is consummated, J.P. 
Morgan will be entitled to payment in full or the Success Fee.

It is understood that if the Company completes a transaction in lieu of any 
Transaction for which J.P. Morgan is entitled to compensation pursuant to 
this Agreement, J.P. Morgan and the Company will negotiate in good faith 
appropriate compensation for J.P. Morgan in an amount to be mutually agreed 
upon, which will take into account, among other things, the results obtained 
and the custom and practice among investment bankers acting in similar 
transactions.

If the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement between the Company and 
J.P. Morgan, please sign and return the enclosed copy of this Agreement, 
whereupon it shall become our binding agreement to be governed by New York 
law.


Very truly yours,

J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC.

The Board of Directors
UNR Industries, Inc.
332 South Michigan Avenue
Chicago, Illinois 60604

Attention:  Mr. Thomas A. Gildehaus
            President and Chief Executive Officer

Members of the Board:

This letter confirms our understanding (the "Agreement") that UNR 
Industries, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the 
"Company") has engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("J.P. Morgan") to act as 
the Company's exclusive financial advisor with respect to the sale, merger, 
consolidation, or any other business combination, in one or a series of 
transactions, involving all or a portion of the stock, assets, or business of 
any of the following divisions of the Company, either separately or in 
combination (each, a "Transaction"): UNR-Leavitt, Unarco Commercial Products, 
UNR-Home Products and Real Time Solutions (each, a "Division" and 
collectively, the "Divisions"). This Agreement replaces the previous 
Agreement between the Company and J.P. Morgan dated June 22, 1995 which is, 
therefore, terminated. J.P. Morgan hereby waives the No-Go Fee under that 
Agreement.

As discussed, we propose to undertake certain services on your behalf, 
including to the extent requested by you: (i) assisting you in preparing an 
offering memorandum describing each Division, its operations, historical 
performance, and future prospects, (ii) identifying and contacting selected 
qualified acquirors acceptable to you, (iii) arranging for potential 
acquirors to conduct business investigations, (iv) assisting you in 
negotiating the financial aspects of any proposed Transaction, and (v) 
delivering an opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company, if requested, 
as to the fairness to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of 
view of the consideration to be received by the Company in any proposed 
Transaction (an "Opinion").

As compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder by J.P. Morgan, the 
Company agrees to pay J.P. Morgan (i) a Success Fee as hereinafter-defined, 
or (ii) a No-Go Fee of $300,000 payable 12 months from the date of this 
Agreement in the event that no definitive agreement to consummate a 
Transaction has been executed. The Success Fee shall be an amount equal to 
(i) 1.25% (125 basis points) of the Aggregate Transaction Value (as 
hereinafter defined) up to $175,000,000 plus 5% (500 basis points) of the 
Aggregate Transaction Value in excess of $175,000,000 if all the Divisions 
are sold, or (ii), in the event that the divestiture of all Divisions is not 
consummated for any reason, the Success Fee shall be the sum of and be 
defined as follows: (a) 1.00% of the Transaction Value for UNR-Leavitt up to 
$100,000,000 and 5% of the Transaction Value over $100,000,000; (b) 1.25% of 
the Transaction Value for Unarco Commercial Products up to $40,000,000 and 3% 
of the

                                           1

<PAGE>

Transaction Value over $40,000,000; (c) 2.00% of the Transaction Value for 
UNR-Home Products up to $15,000,000 and 5% of the Transaction Value over 
$15,000,000; and (d) 2.00% of the Transaction Value for Real Time Solutions 
up to $15,000,000 and 5% of the Transaction Value over $15,000,000. The 
Success Fee shall be payable with respect to each Transaction in cash upon 
consummation of such Transaction subject to a minimum Success Fee of $500,000 
for the first Transaction. To the extent that J.P. Morgan is entitled to 
Success Fees greater than $500,000 as a result of the first Transaction and 
a subsequent Transaction(s), the Success Fee(s) for the subsequent 
Transaction(s) shall be adjusted so that J.P. Morgan does not receive more 
compensation than it would be entitled in clause (ii) of the second sentence 
of this paragraph. The $200,000 engagement fee paid under the previous 
Agreement between the Company and J.P. Morgan dated June 22, 1995 shall be 
credited against the Success Fee(s) payable to J.P. Morgan hereunder.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Transaction Value" means the amount of 
consideration received by the Company in each Transaction, plus the amount of 
any debt securities or other liabilities (excluding accounts payable and 
accrued expenses) assumed by the purchaser as reflected on the Division's 
financial statements immediately prior to closing plus any other liabilities 
assumed by the Purchaser but not reflected on the Division's financial 
statements and not incurred by the Division in the normal course of business 
all as contemplated in the draft Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement provided 
to potential purchasers. "Aggregate Transaction Value" means the sum of the 
Transaction Values for all of the Divisions.

If the consideration or other value received in any Transaction is paid in 
whole or in part in the form of securities, the value of such securities, for 
purposes of calculating the Success Fee, shall be the fair market value 
thereof, as the parties hereto shall mutually agree, on the day prior to the 
consummation of the Transaction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such securities 
consist of securities with an existing public trading market, the value 
thereof shall be determined by the last sales price for such securities on 
the last trading day thereof prior to such consummation. If all or a portion 
of the consideration is related to or contingent upon the future earnings or 
operations of the Company, the portion of J.P. Morgan's compensation relating 
thereto shall be calculated and shall be paid at the time the Transaction is 
consummated based upon the estimated net present value thereof as the parties 
hereto shall mutually agree.

The Company agrees to provide J.P. Morgan all financial and other information 
requested by it for the purpose of its assignment hereunder. In performing 
its services hereunder (including, without limitation, in giving any 
Opinion), J.P. Morgan shall be entitled to rely upon and assume, without 
independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information 
that is publicly available and of all information that has been furnished to 
it by the Company or otherwise reviewed by J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan shall 
not assume any responsibility nor have any liability therefor. J.P. Morgan 
shall have no obligation to conduct any valuation or appraisal of any assets 
or liabilities. For the execution of its assignment, J.P. Morgan shall 
establish a team of qualified individuals from appropriate speciality areas 
within J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated, including Morgan Guaranty Trust 
Company of New York.

recapitalization of the Company, or any spin-off, split-off, or extraordinary 
dividend (aside from those related to the Transactions contemplated in this 
Agreement), J.P. Morgan and the Company will negotiate in good faith 
appropriate compensation for J.P. Morgan is an amount to be mutually agreed

                                        SCHEDULE I


UNR Industries, Inc. (the "Company") referred to in the attached agreement 
(the "Agreement"), agrees to indemnify and hold harmless J.P. Morgan 
Securities Inc. ("J.P. Morgan") and its affiliates, and the respective 
directors, officers, agents, and employees of J.P. Morgan and its affiliates 
and each other entity or person, if any, controlling J.P. Morgan or any of its 
affiliates within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act of 
1933,,as amended, or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, (J.P. Morgan and each such entity or person being referred to as an 
"Indemnified Person") from and against any losses, claims, demands, 
damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) relating to or arising 
out of activities performed pursuant to the Agreement, the transactions 
contemplated thereby or J.P. Morgan's role in connection therewith, and to 
reimburse J.P. Morgan and any other Indemnified Person on a current basis for 
all expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and 
disbursements of counsel) incurred by J.P. Morgan or any such other 
Indemnified Person n connection with pending or threatened litigation to 
which J.P. Morgan (or any other Indemnified Person) is a party, in each case, 
as such expenses are incurred or paid. The Company will not, however, be 
responsible for any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses of 
any Indemnified Person that are determined by final and nonappealable 
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from 
actions taken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Person in bad faith 
or from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The 
Company also agrees that no Indemnified Person shall have any liability 
(whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company 
for or in connection with the Agreement, any transactions contemplated 
thereby or J.P. Morgan's role in connection therewith, except for any such 
liability for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses incurred by 
the Company that are determined by final and nonappealable judgment of a 
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from actions taken 
or omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Person in bad faith or from such 
Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Upon receipt by an Indemnified Person of actual notice of a claim, action or 
proceeding against such Indemnified Person in respect of which indemnity may 
be sought hereunder, such Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the 
Company with respect thereto. In addition, an Indemnified Person shall 
promptly notify the Company after any action is commenced (by way of service 
with a summons or other legal process giving information as to the nature and 
basis of the claim) against such Indemnified Person. In any event, failure so 
to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company from any liability which 
the Company may have on account of this indemnity or otherwise, except to the 
extent the Company shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. The 
Company will, if requested by any Indemnified Person, assume the defense of 
any litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought 
hereunder, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to 
J.P. Morgan and the payment of the fees and expenses of such counsel, in 
which event, except as provided below, the Company shall not be liable for 
the fees and expenses of any other counsel retained by any

                                       1


<PAGE>

Indemnified Person in connection with such litigation or proceeding. In any 
such litigation or proceeding the defense of which the Company shall have so 
assumed, and Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such 
litigation or proceeding and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and 
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person 
unless (i) the Company and such Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed 
in writing to the retention of such counsel, or (ii) the named parties to any 
such litigation or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include the 
Company and such Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the 
same counsel would, in the opinion of counsel to such Indemnified Person, be 
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the 
Company and such Indemnified Person. The Company shall not be liable for any 
settlement of consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the 
Company agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against any loss 
or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. If the Company assume 
the defense of any litigation or proceeding, the Company will not settle such 
litigation or proceeding without J.P. Morgan's written consent, which shall 
not be unreasonably withheld.

The provisions contained in this Schedule I shall remain operative and 
in full force and effect regardless of the expiration or any termination of 
the Agreement.

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:

1995 was a successful, although challenging, year for our Company. The Company
recently announced a decision to sell four of our operating divisions and to
retain the ROHN Division, which continued its rapid growth in 1995. ROHN's 1995
sales expanded to $142.2 million, or 33 percent, over 1994. Operating earnings
grew to $29.9 million, an increase of over 60 percent.  Because of ROHN's
outstanding performance, UNR's restated operating income from continuing
operations reached another record level in 1995, marking the third consecutive
year in which operating earnings established a new record.

During 1995, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.25 per share, a 25 percent
increase over 1994's regular dividend of $.20. In addition, the Company paid a
total of $2.30 in extraordinary dividends.  Despite the payment of approximately
$132.3 million in total dividends, the Company's financial structure remains
strong with a debt-to-equity ratio of 4 percent and a current ratio of 2 to 1.
We are also pleased to note that the return on year-end shareholder equity rose
to 23 percent in 1995, surpassing the objective of 15 percent established in
1992.

On September 7, 1995, we announced our intention to sell the entire Company. We
had previously

2
<PAGE>

offered the Company for sale in 1993, but that effort did not generate
satisfactory bids, primarily because of some unresolved legal and tax related
issues. Those issues were largely resolved in 1994 and 1995. In the course of
offering the Company for sale in 1995, it became apparent that there was
substantial interest in each of the individual operating divisions. However,
there was not a similarly strong interest in the acquisition of the entire
Company, and our Board of Directors concluded that the bids received for the
Company as a whole did not represent the Company's full value.

In January 1996, based upon the interest expressed by potential buyers in our
operating divisions and on the outstanding past performance and future growth
potential of ROHN, our Board of Directors made the strategic decision to sell
four of our operating divisions, Leavitt Tube, Unarco Commercial Products, UNR
Home Products, and Real Time Solutions, Inc. The Board determined that the
Company's energies and resources should be focused on the opportunity that ROHN
provides for future growth and profitability. Accordingly, we have retained J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc. to assist in the sale of the other four divisions. The
sale process is well underway, and strong interest has been expressed by both
strategic and financial buyers in the four divisions offered for sale. We are
confident these divisions will be sold in a reasonable time for fair values.

The four divisions to be sold have been classified as discontinued operations
for financial reporting purposes. Thus, the 1995 Annual Report presents the
financial performance of ROHN on a stand-alone basis, restating prior years
financials to reflect the past performance of the "new" UNR.

ROHN provides tremendous opportunity. As the North American market leader in
communications towers, poles and shelters, ROHN is perfectly positioned to
continue its double digit growth. ROHN also enjoys a premier international
reputation and is prepared to supply the burgeoning telecommunications industry
with towers, poles, shelters, mounts and other products on a global basis. In
the pages that follow, ROHN's products, markets, facilities and growth prospects
are more fully described. We are excited about the continuing opportunity
provided by ROHN, and we are committed to successfully exploiting that
opportunity to continue our record of providing superior total shareholder
returns.



                                        Sincerely,



                                        Thomas A. Gildehaus

                                                                               3

In 1948, Dwight Rohn produced his first tower for home television reception. 
Today, ROHN stands as one of the world's leaders in the design, manufacture 
and installation of communication towers and shelters used in radio, 
television, cellular telephone and other wireless communication systems. 
ROHN's product lines now fill a broad range of telecommunications needs: 
towers, poles, masts and mounts used as support structures for antennae, and 
shelters and cabinets to house electronic equipment necessary for the 
operation of each communications site. The telecommunications markets served 
by ROHN include cellular, personal communications systems (PCS), enhanced 
specialized mobile radio, paging services, radio and television broadcast, 
wireless cable, private microwave systems, military communications systems, 
direct broadcast satellite and networking switching.

With more than 800,000 square feet of production facilities in Illinois, Indiana
and Alabama, ROHN is one of North America's largest manufacturers of towers,
poles and shelters, backed by a 700 person workforce of skilled labor and highly
trained professionals. The Company's innovative products, which enjoy superior
brand name recognition and a premium quality image, are distributed
internationally from locations in the United States and Mexico.

Not since the day Bell called Watson have events prompted such explosive growth
in America's telecommunications industry. Personal communications products, such
as cellular telephones, have sparked that explosion. Today, millions of
Americans would not think of leaving their home or business without one. Demand
is nowhere near its plateau; new products and technologies continue to push
costs down, expand service offerings and fuel industry growth. Demand for
wireless communication products and services is now heating up worldwide,
offering new markets and new opportunities to those companies prepared to
respond.

ROHN is ready. As one of North America's largest manufacturers of towers, poles
and shelters for wireless communications systems, the Company is uniquely
prepared to build the infrastructure for the telecommunications systems of the
future.

Outstanding products and superior customer service have translated into three
consecutive years of solid growth and profitability. Sales for 1995 exceeded
1994 results by 33 percent, and operating income grew over 60 percent.

OPERATING INCOME


Demand in the cellular telephone industry for both towers and shelters has
fueled the Company's strong performance. Indeed, 90 percent of ROHN's revenues
are derived from the telecommunications industry.


The expanding worldwide demand for cellular products has translated into strong
growth among ROHN's largest customers. In 1990, only two of ROHN's top 10
accounts purchased more than $1 million of goods and services. In 1995, all of
ROHN's top 10 accounts exceeded that level--and several made multi-million
dollar purchases. This growth represents more than a ten-fold increase in sales
among ROHN's top customers, attesting to the premium quality of ROHN's products
and services.

PRODUCTS THAT SET ROHN APART
TOWERS AND POLES. With more than 500,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity,
ROHN keeps pace with growing demand for its premier line of guyed and self-
supporting towers and poles. These products span a broad range, varying in price
from less than $10,000 to over $1,000,000. ROHN also produces a line of
consumer, wireless and satellite products, including telescoping masts, tripods,
non-penetrating roof mounts and brackets used in broadcast, two-way radio, home
television and military applications.

To meet the increasing demand for its towers, poles and other mounting
structures, ROHN is adding a new hot-dip galvanizing facility at its Peoria,
Illinois plant. In addition, a $6,000,000 project is underway at the Frankfort,
Indiana facility, which will include 175,000 square feet of manufacturing space
under one roof.

<PAGE>


SHELTERS AND CABINETS. Critical to the successful operation of wireless
communications systems is secure on-site housing of electronic communications
equipment. ROHN's concrete and fiberglass shelters and cabinets are widely used
by telecommunications service providers to safeguard this valuable equipment.
Concrete structures represent the largest part of ROHN's shelter business,
generating approximately 75 percent of shelter revenues.

Shelters are manufactured at a modern 250,000 square foot facility in Bessemer,
Alabama. These products are designed and engineered for customers' specific
needs and applications. In addition to shelter design and construction,
ROHN provides personnel and facilities for the installation of electronic
communications equipment within these units, allowing ROHN's customers to
provide telecommunications service more quickly.

TURNKEY INSTALLATION SERVICES. For clients who need their systems up and
operating quickly and efficiently, ROHN provides turnkey installation services
that are unparalleled in the industry. ROHN not only meets the exacting client
and industry design standards for precision-built shelters and towers, but it
also provides site preparation, foundation installation, tower erection, shelter
installation and antenna and transmission line installation services.


AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS. Approximately 8 percent of ROHN's revenues are
derived from agricultural products, custom hot-dip galvanizing, custom
fabrication and other products. ROHN's agricultural products include livestock
handling products sold to farmers, ranchers, equestrian facilities and fairs and
expositions. ROHN also manufactures privacy fencing products sold to government
facilities and other customers.

CELLULAR PHONES. The most popular personal communications product, the cellular
telephone, is used by more than 20 million subscribers. Usage is expected to
increase dramatically as rates for cellular phone service begin to fall. To
accommodate that growth, the industry will require substantial expansion of the
infrastructure that makes cellular service available nationwide. Currently,
cellular carriers are increasing coverage in rural areas and expanding coverage
in urban and suburban areas to accommodate increased subscriber usage. To
improve and expand the system, more than 14,000 cell sites could be added by the
year 2000. With each site requiring up to $100,000 for shelters and towers,
expenditures of $1.4 billion for such products is a real possibility.

THE ENGINES OF FUTURE GROWTH
PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (PCS). One of the newest forms of wireless
communications is PCS, a digital based technology. During the past year many
telecommunications firms invested nearly $8 billion to purchase rights from the
Federal Communications Commission for broadcast frequencies required for PCS.
These companies have the management skill, financial resources and corporate
vision to make PCS an international reality--and they are highly motivated to
realize a prompt return on their large investments.

PCS will enjoy significant service advantages, including integration of voice,
data, messaging, faxing and paging into one handset and with greater clarity and
transmission quality. PCS will ultimately provide nationwide coverage,
eliminating the potential for interruption of service.

PCS service providers are expected to build their systems as rapidly as
possible. Building the PCS network will require substantial infrastructure
investment. Because the system broadcasts at a higher frequency, but with a
lower powered signal, PCS will require an estimated four times more cell sites
than cellular telephone to cover the same geographic area. As a result, PCS
service providers anticipate activating as many as 100,000 sites by the year
2000. The cost of shelters, towers and other mounting equipment for each site is
expected to range upwards from $20,000, requiring a total potential investment
in excess of $2.8 billion.

Several factors will influence the pace and timing of the PCS infrastructure
build-out. Site acquisition and zoning are hurdles, particularly when 100,000
sites may be required. In addition, certain PCS technologies remain to be
perfected and refined. While these issues may present obstacles to the rapid
development of PCS networks, several systems are under development, and others
are on the drawing boards. Some networks are expected to be operational in 1996.

                                                                               7

GLOBAL MARKETS. While the domestic market looks promising, international 
growth of wireless communications also provides great opportunity. Typically, 
new technologies can languish until consumers build a comfort level with the 
product or service. However, wireless communications already is 
internationally accepted. Wireless communications systems also are 
considerably less expensive to develop and to expand than wireline systems. 
These factors make wireless communications a popular option in many 
developing countries which need telecommunications networks that can keep 
pace with rapid economic growth. ROHN already has a substantial international 
presence, having sold towers and other equipment in more than 54 countries. 
Currently, ROHN is manufacturing a communications tower for Indonesia that 
will be nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower. In addition, many of ROHN's 
domestic and foreign clients, which include the major telecommunications 
providers and carriers, are rapidly expanding their presence in emerging 
markets, and ROHN intends to be a part of that expansion.

Finally, global demand for wireless communications is strong, while market
penetration is negligible. Outside the U.S., fewer than 20 million cellular
telephones are in use. In South America, for example, less than 1 percent of
Argentina's population uses cellular phones. In Asia, less than 2 percent of
Indonesians use cellular phones. Considering the opportunity offered by
international expansion, ROHN anticipates rapid development of global markets.

ROHN has already taken significant steps to be a strong participant in the 
infrastructure build-out. The Company continues to build relationships with 
leading service providers and equipment manufacturers in the industry. ROHN's 
expanding engineering capabilities, skilled workforce, growing manufacturing 
facilities, and enhanced service capabilities and management systems will 
provide it with the ability to supply high quality products in a timely and 
efficient manner.

The Company's international operations are also expanding. ROHN currently 
operates a sales office in Mexico City. During the coming years, ROHN plans 
to continue to develop overseas markets through its U.S. customers and 
through the establishment of partnerships and facilities in key developing 
countries. The facilities will enable the Company to improve service to its 
multinational clients.

Domestic growth--rapid global expansion--cellular or PCS. Whatever the shape 
of the revolution in telecommunications, ROHN stands ready. With well-known, 
high quality product lines, experienced personnel, unmatched production 
facilities and a leading role in the industry, ROHN is prepared to capitalize 
on the global transformation of the telecommunications industry.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS

UNR Industries, Inc. ("UNR" or the "Company") manufactures towers, poles, mounts
and related accessories used principally to support telecommunications antennae
for wireless communications, such as private microwave, cellular telephone,
personal communications systems (PCS), commercial and amateur broadcasting and
home television. The Company also produces shelters and cabinets of concrete and
fiberglass to house electronic telecommunications equipment.

The Company conducts its business principally through its ROHN Division which
has manufacturing facilities in Peoria, Illinois (towers and poles), Frankfort,
Indiana (tower components and mounts), and Bessemer, Alabama (shelters).

The Company's products are sold through distributors and directly to customers
throughout the United States and to international markets. No single customer
accounts for more than 10% of net sales. International sales accounted for
approximately six percent of net sales in 1995.

The Company has a number of patents and trademarks. Management believes the loss
of any one of these patents or trademarks would not have a materially adverse
effect on its operations.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION

The financial statements include the consolidated accounts of UNR and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b) CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less and all treasury bills to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates market value.

(c) INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory costs include material, labor
and factory overhead.

Total inventories in 1995 and 1994 included the following classifications (In
Thousands):

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>


(d) PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Land, buildings and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged directly against income; major renewals and betterments
are capitalized. When properties are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
original cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and the profit or loss resulting from the disposal is reflected in
income.

The Company provides for depreciation of plant and equipment over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (buildings--20 to 40 years; machinery and equipment--
3 to 15 years). Depreciation is generally provided on the straight-line method
for financial reporting purposes and on accelerated methods for tax purposes.

(e) INCOME TAXES

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (SFAS 109), the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
the Company's financial statements or tax returns.


On December 21, 1992, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations
under Section 468B "Special Rules for Designated Settlement Funds." Prior to the
issuance of these tax regulations, the Company had significant unrecorded net
operating loss carry-forwards resulting from extraordinary reorganization
charges included in the 1989 Statement of Income. Through 1992, these charges
were deducted for income tax purposes only to the extent expenditures were
actually made by the UNR Asbestos-Disease Claims Trust (the "Trust").

The Section 468B regulations deal with the tax treatment of the Company's 1989
transfer of 29.4 million shares of UNR stock to the Trust. Based on these
regulations, the Company and Trust elected to treat the Trust as a Qualified
Settlement Fund ("QSF") on January 1, 1993, which entitled the Company to a tax
deduction equivalent to the value of the stock held by the Trust on that date.
This deduction substantially reduced the Company's 1993 income tax liability and
also generated tax loss carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company received
Federal and state income tax refunds of approximately $52.6 million as a result
of the carry-backs. Based on these developments, the Company recorded a tax
benefit (net of a valuation allowance of approximately $20.0 million) of $90.0
million or $1.99 per share in the fourth quarter of 1992.

Total income tax expense/(benefit) for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994,
and 1993, was allocated as follows (In Thousands):

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The Company has available approximately $15.0 million of net operating loss 
carry-forwards for both continuing and discontinued operations, to offset 
future taxable income through 2008. The Company also has general business tax 
credits of $3.4 million which are available to reduce future Federal income 
taxes through 2002. A portion of these credits begin to expire starting in 
1997. Alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits of approximately $6.3 million are 
available to reduce future Federal taxable income over an indefinite period. 
The deferred tax assets related to the general business tax credits and AMT 
are included in Discontinued Operations, net of the valuation allowance 
discussed below. As a result of adopting SFAS 109 in 1992, the Company has 
recognized the benefit of approximately $98.0 million of its net operating 
loss carry-forwards and tax credits realized or expected to be realized 
through 1996. The utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards 
depends on future taxable income during the applicable carry-forward periods. 
The Company has therefore provided a valuation allowance as required under 
SFAS 109 to reflect the inherent uncertainty of projections as to future 
events. In 1994, the Company reversed $10.0 million (or $.20 per share) of 
the valuation allowance recorded in 1992 and included it in Discontinued 
Operations. This reversal in the valuation allowance to $10.0 million was 
made based upon management's judgment regarding the realizability of the net 
operating loss and credit carry-forwards.

(f) NET INCOME PER SHARE

Net income per share of common stock is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average common shares
were 51,813,000 in 1995, 49,318,000 in 1994 and 47,369,000 in 1993. Dilution,
which would result if all outstanding options were exercised, is not significant
to the net income per share computation.

(g) USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(h) PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit or defined contribution
retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees. Included in
these plans are certain union-sponsored plans to which the Company makes annual
contributions equal to the amounts accrued. The total pension expense for union-
sponsored plans for 1995, 1994, and 1993 was approximately $660,000, $460,000
and $360,000, respectively. The Company has one trustee-administered profit
sharing plan covering all eligible employees. Discretionary contributions of
$96,000, $83,000 and $59,000 were made and charged to expense in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively. Total pension expense for Company-sponsored plans for 1995,
1994 and 1993 was $184,000, $148,000 and $118,000, respectively. Pension expense
includes the following components (In Thousands):

accumulated benefit obligations were 8.0% and 4.0%, respectively, in 1995, 1994
and 1993.

(3) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On September 7, 1995, the Company announced that its Board of Directors 
authorized Company management to explore the sale of all or a majority of the 
common stock of the Company. On January 26, 1996, the Company announced that 
efforts to sell the entire Company did not result in a satisfactory offer and 
that it would begin discussions with multiple parties regarding the sale of 
four of its five operating divisions in order to focus fully on the strategic 
growth and development of its ROHN Division, a supplier of goods and services 
to the telecommunications industry. The divisions to be sold are the Leavitt 
Tube division, a producer of mechanical and structural steel tubing, the 
Commercial Products division, a manufacturer of steel and plastic shopping 
carts, the Home Products division, a manufacturer of stainless steel and 
composite sinks and the Real Time Solutions (RTS) subsidiary, a supplier of 
"pick-to-light" inventory picking systems. The sale of these units, expected 
to be concluded in 1996, is anticipated to result in a gain. Total sales of 
these operations were $242 million, $265 million, and $239 million for the 
years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Net assets of 
these divisions are classified as "Net assets of discontinued operations" in 
the accompanying balance sheets and are as follows (In Thousands):

On January 31, 1995, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its
industrial storage rack business to The Renco Group, Inc., a private holding
company. This sale was consummated on March 31, 1995. Net assets of this
operation for the prior year are classified as "Net assets of discontinued
operations" in the accompanying balance sheets. In 1994, the after-tax $2.5
million provision for estimated loss on disposition included a write-down of
these assets to estimated net realizable values and estimated costs of disposing
of this operation.

(4) LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

The Company is involved in various pending legal proceedings and claims arising
in the normal course of its business. Although the outcome of such proceedings
and claims cannot be determined with certainty, the Company is of the opinion,
after consultation with counsel, that such proceedings and claims, individually
or in the aggregate, are not material to its business or financial condition.

The Company is working with environmental authorities concerning testing and
possible remediation at a manufacturing site, the costs of which are difficult
to predict. The Company, after consultation with environmental experts, is of
the opinion that the ultimate outcome will not be material to its business or
financial condition.

(5) LEASES

The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under operating
leases or capital leases, as defined by SFAS No. 13. The Company's property

in 1996, $134,640 in 1997, $68,400 in 1998, and $66,225 in 1999. Rental expense
under operating leases was approximately $1,248,000 in 1995, $1,186,000 in 1994
and $1,137,000 in 1993. Some of the leases contain renewal options for varying

(6) LONG-TERM BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)

In October 1994, the Company expanded its line of credit for short-term
borrowings with a bank from $20.0 million to $35.0 million. Under the terms of
the agreement, interest rates are determined at the time of borrowing with
interest payable at the prevailing prime rate or LIBOR rate plus 1%, at the
Company's option.

At December 31, 1995, outstanding borrowings totaled $6.0 million at an average
interest rate of 6.75%. Such credit agreement is secured by certain accounts
receivable of the Company and its subsidiaries. The commitment fee on the unused
portion of the facility is 1/4% per annum.

Aggregate annual payments required on secured debt, including capitalized
leases, are $6,190,000 in 1996, $178,000 in 1997, $175,000 in 1998, $175,000 in
1999, $175,000 in 2000 and $3,968,000 thereafter.

(7) STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Company had two stock option plans at December 31, 1995, the Key Executives'
Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.

The Key Executives' Stock Option Plan was approved by the shareholders of the
Company on July 12, 1990. This Plan provides for granting of non-qualified and
incentive stock options, and reserves for the issuance of up to 2,500,000
authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Options granted under this Plan
were exercisable at a price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant
and expired in ten years. At December 31, 1995, 1,153,000 common shares were
available for granting under this Plan. There were no outstanding options under
this Plan at December 31, 1995.

The 1994 Stock Option Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company on
November 1, 1994. This Plan provides for granting of non-qualified options and
reserves for the issuance of up to 500,000 shares. Outstanding options granted
under this Plan are exercisable at a price equal to the fair market value at the
date of grant, reduced by the amount of any "Extraordinary Dividend" made after
the date of grant, and expire in five years. Each option is exercisable upon the
attainment of certain stock price thresholds, adjusted for extraordinary
dividends, or fifty-four months, whichever comes earlier. At December 31, 1995,
55,000 common shares were available for granting under this Plan.

(8) RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN

The UNR Industries, Inc. Restricted Stock Plan was approved by the shareholders
of the Company on July 30, 1992. The Plan provides for the granting of
restricted stock to certain key employees and reserves for issuance of 1,000,000
shares of common stock.

The Company had 162,264 and 197,563 shares of restricted stock outstanding at
December 31, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Of the current shares outstanding,
50,000 were awarded to the Company's President and CEO in connection with his
employment agreement and 112,264 shares were issued to certain key employees of
the Company. These shares have the same dividend and voting rights as other
common stock, except that extraordinary dividends on restricted stock held by
employees other than the President are paid in the form of additional shares of
restricted stock. Restricted stock is considered to be currently issued and
outstanding. The cost of the restricted stock, determined as the fair market
value of the shares at the date of grant, is expensed ratably over a three- to
five-year vesting period. Such expense amounted to $183,000 in 1995 and $383,000
in 1994.

(9) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

In connection with the Company's Plan of Reorganization, effective June 2, 1989,
stockholders of record as of that date, retained their common stock and received
one warrant for each share of common stock owned with the right to purchase an
additional share of common stock at $5.15 per share until June 14, 1995.
Additionally, upon exercise, warrantholders were entitled to receive any
extraordinary dividend (as defined) paid or payable by the Company. The amount
related to the Company's potential obligation to pay extraordinary dividends to
such warrantholders upon conversion ($4.20 per warrant) was classified as
Warrants in the accompanying 1994 balance sheet. At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
the number of outstanding convertible warrants were 0 and 1,316,881,
respectively.

On September 24, 1990, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had
authorized the acquisition, through both negotiated transactions involving large
blocks and open-market purchases, of up to 1.5 million shares of its common
stock to be held as treasury shares and be available to meet requirements of its
Key Executives' Stock Option Plan. As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, 1,133,565
shares have been purchased.

On May 6, 1993, the Company's stockholders approved a reduction in the par value
per share of common stock from $2.50 to $.01. This resulted in a $119,482,000
reduction in Common Stock and a corresponding increase to Capital Surplus.

On December 28, 1995, the Company paid an extraordinary dividend of $1.00 per
share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 18,
1995.

On April 17, 1995, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.25 per share and an
extraordinary dividend of $1.30 per share to stockholders of record as of the
close of business on April 3, 1995.

On April 1, 1994, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.20 per share to
stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 18, 1994.

On December 1, 1993, the Company paid an extraordinary dividend of $1.20 per
share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 16,
1993. This dividend was a non-taxable return of distribution.

On February 1, 1993, the Company paid a regular dividend of $.20 and an
extraordinary dividend of $2.00 per share to stockholders of record as of the
close of business on January 15, 1993. Both dividends are non-taxable return of
capital distributions.

(10) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company presently holds three notes receivable for a total of $5,525,000
from executive officers of the Company. These notes are related to the 1994
Executive Stock Purchase Plan approved by shareholders of the Company on
November 1, 1994. Under the Plan, executive officers purchased 1,650,000 shares
of common stock from the Company, at the then fair market value. Shares were
paid for in cash in the amount of the par value of the stock and the balance in
promissory notes due in three years. The notes are interest free (although
interest is imputed for tax purposes), except in the event a participant resigns
from the Company, is terminated for cause or, if the stock is sold within three
years, the notes become due and interest at the applicable Federal rate is
applied retroactively from the date of the notes. Dividends, net of Federal and
state taxes, are applied to the principal of the notes. In 1995, dividends
reduced the outstanding balance from $9,100,000 at December 31, 1994, to
$5,525,000 at December 31, 1995. If the stock is not sufficient to satisfy the
loan balance at maturity, the participant can transfer the shares in partial
payment of the note and is personally liable for that portion of the note
exceeding 25% of the loan balance.

(11) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates predominantly in a single industry as a manufacturer of
towers, poles and shelters for the telecommunications industry. This industry is
strongly influenced by the growth in demand for wireless telecommunications
services.

The Company's export sales are less than 10% of total revenues. Revenues and
identifiable assets are related to its U.S. operations and no one other
geographic area accounts for more than 10% of total revenues or 10% of total
assets.

                                                                              21

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of UNR Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UNR INDUSTRIES,
INC. (a Delaware corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UNR Industries, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                             ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

YEAR 1995 VERSUS YEAR 1994

NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. Net sales from continuing operations in
1995 were $142.2 million versus $107.0 million in 1994 or an increase of 32.9%.
The sales increase is due primarily to the rapid growth of wireless
telecommunications services. In addition, 1995 represented the first full year
of production in the expanded Bessemer, Alabama, shelter facility. The 1995
sales are the highest in the Company's history on a continuing operations basis,
and 1995 is the third consecutive year of record sales.

GROSS PROFIT. In 1995, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 30.4%, just
below the prior year's 31.7%. This decrease is due to competitive pressures in
the tower market and the fact that shelters, which carry a lower gross margin
percentage, now represent a greater portion of sales.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses (SG&A) in 1995 were 9.4% of sales versus 14.4% in 1994.
This reduction reflects cost containment measures taken throughout the Company
and the resulting ability to produce greater sales with less costs.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased due to lower average levels of
borrowings versus the prior year.

INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased over the prior year due to generally
greater levels of available cash offset somewhat by lower prevailing interest
rates during 1995 versus 1994.

INCOME TAXES. See footnote 2(e) for a complete discussion of UNR's taxes.

INTERNATIONAL. International sales, which represented 6.0% of the Company's
sales, increased 14.9% from the prior year. Gains were made primarily in South
America and the Far East, while last year's sales increase driver, Mexico,
suffered this year due to economic problems. The Company feels that foreign
markets will be growth vehicles for the future.

YEAR 1994 VERSUS YEAR 1993

NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. Net sales from continuing operations in
1994 were $107.0 million versus $73.8 million in 1993 or an increase of 45.0%.
The sales increase is due to the growing wireless telecommunications
communications market and the required towers and shelters for
this growth.

GROSS PROFIT. In 1994, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.7% as
compared with 29.8% in 1993. The increase is due primarily with the benefits of
running a facility at higher levels without adding fixed costs.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and
administrative expenses (SG&A) in 1994 were 14.4% of sales versus 16.6% in 1993.
The percentage decrease is due to the Company's ability to produce greater sales
without adding proportional costs.

INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased from the prior year due to lower
outstanding debt levels in 1994 versus 1993.

INTEREST INCOME. Interest income increased over the prior year due to generally
greater levels of available cash in 1994 versus 1993.

INCOME TAXES. See footnote 2(e) for a complete discussion of UNR's taxes.

INTERNATIONAL. International sales, which represented 6.9% of the Company's
sales, increased 45.1% from 1993. The increase is due primarily to sales into
Mexico through the Company's Mexican subsidiary.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. Cash flow during 1995 was a negative $63.1
million which included a payment of $132.3 million in dividends. The Company's
financial condition continues to be strong at the end of 1995, with working
capital of $31.0 million. The Company's working capital ratio, a measure of
short-term liquidity, decreased from 4.5 to 1 in 1994 to 2.1 to 1 in 1995. Both
measures are considered strong indicators of liquidity.

Capital expenditures were $2.3 million in 1995 versus $3.3 million in 1994.
Capital expenditures in 1994 included the expansion of the plant in Bessemer,
Alabama, which produces concrete and fiberglass shelters. The Company's current
operating plan calls for capital spending in 1996 to be approximately $12.0
million, which includes the building of a new facility in Frankfort, Indiana.

The Company expects to meet its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure
requirements from operating cash flows, borrowings through industrial revenue
bonds and under a $35.0 million short-term credit facility and the proceeds from
the sale of its discontinued operations. In addition, the Company's strong
unleveraged balance sheet allows it to access funds, if needed, from the capital
markets.

INFLATION. The impact of inflation on UNR's operations is principally related to
steel price volatility which can moderately affect earnings from time to time.
