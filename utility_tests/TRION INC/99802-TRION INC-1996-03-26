Item 1. Business.

           General

           Trion, Inc. (the "Company" or "Trion") was incorporated in 1946 in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is principally engaged in the design,
manufacture, sale and distribution of equipment to improve indoor air quality
("IAQ").   On August 1, 1995 the Company acquired Envirco Corporation
("Envirco"), a manufacturer and distributor of ultra-clean air systems and
components located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

           Products and Markets

           The Company's industry segments are Engineered Products, Consumer
Products and European Operations.  European Operations consists of sales and
distribution primarily in Europe of both engineered and consumer IAQ products
manufactured at Trion's two U.S. facilities.

           Engineered Products.  The Engineered Products group designs,
manufactures and sells indoor air quality and dust collection equipment and
systems primarily designed for industrial, residential, commercial and
specialty uses.  These products are used in a wide variety of industries
including microelectronics, residential, metal working, pharmaceuticals,
medical, commercial buildings, general manufacturing and ships and submarines. 
Products range from custom-engineered systems that remove large volumes of
airborne contaminants caused by industrial processes to self-contained air
cleaners used to capture tobacco smoke, dust and pollen in environments such
as enclosed work areas, restaurants and homes.  

           Through its recently acquired Envirco subsidiary, the Company
utilizes high efficiency particulate arrestance ("HEPA") and ultra low
particulate arrestance ("ULPA") technologies in applications including
cleanrooms in the semiconductor and microelectronics industries and systems to
provide hospitals with clean environments for surgery rooms, cancer research,
patient isolation and sterile medication preparation.  The Company's products
include the patented MAC-10  used in cleanroom applications and Hospi-Gard , a
portable filtration unit used in medical applications.  

            The Company also manufacturers equipment to electrostatically
distribute microthin films of lubricants, corrosion inhibitors and other
protective coatings to metal strips on high speed lines.

            Consumer Products.  The Company's Consumer Products group
manufactures and markets appliance air cleaners, including both tabletop and 
free standing console units.  Trion's appliance units historically have been
marketed principally to retailers and others on a private label basis.  In
recent years, the Company has begun to market products under Trion brand
names.
                                   -2-
<PAGE>

            Technologies

            In its air cleaning products, the Company utilizes what it
believes to be the industry's broadest range of technologies to collect
airborne contaminants.

             - HEPA filtration utilizes laminar flow filtration which ensures  
              even and constant airflow and has 99.97% efficiency on .3
              micron size particles. ULPA filtration functions similarly
              and has 99.999% efficiency on .12 micron size particles.  These
              processes provide the level of airborne contamination control
              essential for applications requiring ultra-clean air, such as
              cleanrooms and hospital and laboratory settings.  

            - Electrostatic precipitators are high efficiency electronic
              air filters.  In an electrostatic precipitator, air passes 
              through an ionizing section where airborne particles are 
              electrically charged by ions in an electrostatic field.  
              The charged particles then enter a collecting cell where 
              the particles are repelled from charged plates and collected
              on grounded plates within the cell.  This process is highly
              effective at capturing submicron particulate, including 
              particulate found in tobacco smoke, dust, pollen, welding 
              smoke and oil mists from machining operations.

            - In a media filtration system, air passes through media
              filters that trap airborne particles.  Some of these 
              filters, like cartridge collectors, can collect submicron
              particulate, such as welding smoke, as well as larger 
              particulate.  Other filters, like bag collectors, are 
              useful for larger particulate such as that generated in 
              machining and welding processes. In some systems, air
              passes through a prefilter where large particles are 
              collected and then pass through a second or third media
              filter where smaller particles are collected.

            Raw Materials and Purchased Components

            Raw materials and components used by the Company in the
manufacturing process are either readily available from a number of suppliers
or are manufactured by the Company from raw materials that have such
availability.

            Aluminum and steel represent principal raw materials in the
Company's products and prices continued to rise significantly during 1995. 
Prices for aluminum and steel can be subject to wide fluctuation and the
Company's products cannot always be priced to take into account such
fluctuations, especially in the short term.  Other significant materials used
by the Company include motors, blowers, injection molded plastics, filter
paper, media filters, packaging materials and various electrical components. 
In aggregate, the cost of materials in 1995 increased slightly ahead of the
consumer price index.  The Company anticipates similar cost increases during

                                  -3-
<PAGE>

1996.  The Company intends to take actions, including price increases and cost
containment measures, to help mitigate the impact of such increases.

            Sales and Distribution

            Engineered Products are sold in North America to end users,
contractors and distributors directly as well as through manufacturers'
representatives and the Company's own sales force.  Consumer Products are sold
directly to retailers, distributors and other companies for ultimate sale to
consumers through retail outlets.

            Trion sells appliance air cleaners on a recurring basis to Sears,
Roebuck and Co. within Consumer Products.  This customer represented
approximately 14% of consolidated sales in 1995 and the loss of the account
could have an adverse effect on the Company.   

            The Company's indoor air quality products are sold throughout the
world.  Through Trion Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company has a
marketing and distribution office in Andover, England, servicing primarily the
European market directly and through distributors and representatives.  The
Company's products are also sold in other countries outside Europe through
distributors and representatives, principally in the Pacific Rim.  

            Competition

            While the Company is a principal competitor in most of its
markets, the indoor air quality industry is highly competitive.  In Engineered
Products, the Company and its major competitors, Honeywell, Inc., 
White-Rodgers, a division of Emmerson Electric, Research Products, 
United Air Specialists, Inc., American Air Filter Co., Inc., Torit,
a division of Donaldson Co., Inc., Farr Company, and Flanders Filters, Inc.,
account for the predominant share of the market in the lines in which they
compete.  In Consumer Products, while appliance air cleaners are sold by a
large number of companies, Honeywell, Inc., Bionaire, Inc. and Trion together
have the predominant share of the market.  Of the three, Trion is the only
manufacturer of electronic appliance air cleaners.  Principal competitors
outside the United States include some of these companies as well as foreign
competitors.  Competition in the Company's market segment is primarily on the
basis of price, product technology, product quality and customer service; with
a majority of the Company's business obtained through competitive bidding.  
Some of the Company's competitors have assets and/or sales substantially in
excess of the Company.

            Patents and Trademarks

            The Company holds a number of patents that relate to the design
and use of its products, some of which it considers significant to the overall
conduct of the Company's business.  No patents which the Company considers
significant will expire within the next five years.

            The Company owns several trademarks that it considers important in
the marketing of its products and believes that its rights in these trademarks
are adequately protected and of unlimited duration.

                                    -4-
<PAGE>


            Research and Development

            The Company's ongoing research and development program involves
creating new products and redesigning existing products to reduce
manufacturing costs and to increase product efficiencies.  During 1995, 1994
and 1993, the Company spent approximately $771,000, $531,000 and $515,000,
respectively, on research and development activities.

            Employees

            As of December 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 439
persons worldwide.  The Company's employees are not represented by a union. 
The Company believes its employee relations are satisfactory.

            Backlog

            The backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 1995 was $9,301,000
compared to $4,023,000 at the prior year-end.  Substantially all of this
backlog is scheduled for shipment during 1996.

            Risks

            As a cautionary note to investors, statements made in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K which are not historical are forward - looking 
statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  There are several important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated.  Such factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth
below.

            Acquisition Strategy

            The Company has initiated an acquisition program as part of its
strategic plan.  The Company's acquisition strategy entails the potential risk
inherent in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other
liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in
integrating the operations of acquired companies.  There can be no assurance
that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available, that the Company
will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions,
that the Company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business
acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable.

            Potential Fluctuations in Operating Results

            The Company can experience fluctuations in operating results, both
on a quarterly and annual basis, caused by various factors, including general
economic conditions and the factors discussed below under "Cyclicality". 
Fluctuations in the Company's operating results, particularly quarter-to-
quarter, are also affected in certain of its markets by the timing of customer
orders, the pattern of customer purchasing cycles and the resulting changes in
product mix.

            Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs
                                  -5-
<PAGE>


            Aluminum and steel represent principal raw materials in the
Company's air cleaning products.  Prices for both products can be subject to
wide fluctuation and the Company's products cannot always be priced to take
into account such fluctuations, especially in the short term.  See "Business -
Raw Materials and Purchased Components" for a more detailed discussion of raw
materials used in the Company's business.

            Cyclicality

            A significant percentage of the Company's sales of residential
wholehouse air cleaners is dependent upon new residential construction, which
is a cyclical industry.  In addition, the Company has substantial sales of
products for cleanroom applications to the microelectronics industry, which
can be cyclical.  Sales of Engineered Products in general are also tied to
capital spending levels.

           Competition

           While the Company is a principal competitor in most of its markets,
the indoor air quality industry is highly competitive.  Competition is
primarily on the basis of price, product quality, product technology and
customer service, with a majority of the Company's business obtained through
competitive bidding.  See "Business - Competition" for a more detailed
discussion of competition in the Company's markets.

             Intellectual Property

             The Company's success is dependent in part on its ability to
protect proprietary technology contained in certain of its products.  While
Trion's critical technologies are patented, there can be no assurance that
this will prove sufficient to deter misappropriation of those technologies or
independent third-party development of rival technologies, which would have an
adverse effect on the Company's sales.  The defense and prosecution of patent
suits are both costly and time-consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to
the Company.  In foreign countries, the expenses associated with such
proceedings can be prohibitive.  In addition, there is an inherent
unpredictability in obtaining and enforcing patents in foreign countries.

            Reliance on Key Personnel

            The Company's operations are dependent on the continued efforts of
senior management, in particular Steven L. Schneider, its President and Chief
Executive Officer.  Should any of the senior managers be unable to continue in
their present roles, the Company's prospects could be adversely affected.

            Potential Regulatory Risks

            The Company's business and products may be significantly
influenced by the constantly changing body of environmental laws and
regulations, which require that certain environmental standards be met and
impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards.  While the
Company endeavors at both of its facilities to assure compliance with

                                -6-
<PAGE>

environmental laws and regulations, future changes in such standards could
have an adverse effect on the Company.  In addition, to some extent, changes
in the liabilities and risks imposed by the environmental laws on the
Company's customers could impact demand for certain of the Company's products
or impose greater liabilities and risks on the Company, which could also have
an adverse effect on the Company's business.

            International Transactions

            The Company has sold and expects it will continue to sell products
in areas outside the United States.  Such transactions entail the risks
associated with conducting business internationally, including the risk of
currency fluctuations, slower payment of invoices and possible social,
political and economic instability.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company owns a 263,000 square foot modern brick facility on 27 acres in
Sanford, North Carolina which houses the Company's corporate headquarters as
well as manufacturing, engineering, sales and distribution operations.  This
property plus equipment are pledged to secure industrial revenue bonds
totaling $3,200,000 at December 31, 1995.  The bonds mature on November 1,
2011.  The carrying value of assets pledged to secure these bonds was
approximately $3,700,000 at December 31, 1995.  In addition, the Company
leases a 45,000 square foot facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico which houses
Envirco and which expires in 1998.

     Foreign properties consist of a 53,000 square foot facility located in
Andover, England owned by the Company.  

     The Company's facilities in Sanford and Andover, while suitable for
their intended uses, have excess capacity for current needs.  The facility in
Albuquerque is approaching full capacity.  The facility in Andover, England
remains for sale.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

     Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are party to any material
pending legal proceedings nor is any of their property subject to such
proceedings.

Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

     Not applicable.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and       
         Results of Operations.

Results of Operations
On August 1, 1995, the Company acquired the Envirco Corporation in
Albuquerque, New Mexico ("Envirco") and the financial statements include the
activity for Envirco during the five months of August through December, 1995.

                                     -9-
<PAGE>
Net sales for the year 1995 were $43,695,000, a significant improvement over
the prior year's $34,077,000 and the $34,568,000 reported in 1993.  The
substantial increase in the current year was primarily due to Envirco.  North
American base business sales increased 6% in 1995 after remaining stable in
1994 as compared to 1993.  Sales by our consolidated European operations
declined 4% in 1995 from 1994 following an 8% decrease in 1994 from 1993
mainly due to the decline in business posted by our German subsidiary,
subsequently closed at the end of 1994.

In terms of product mix, Engineered Products sales continue to reflect
management's emphasis on growing the Company's share of this market.  Due
primarily to the acquisition of Envirco, Engineered Products revenues climbed
by 54% in 1995 over 1994 after a slight increase in 1994 from 1993.  Consumer
Products showed signs of improvement during 1995 due to the introduction of a
new appliance product and returned to 1993 levels.  Going forward, management
expects the Engineered Products component of the business to continue to grow
faster than Consumer Products which faces mounting pressure from larger,
foreign based manufacturers, although the Company continues to invest
resources to protect and cultivate this important segment. 

Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of sales was 37.1% in 1995 which
compares to 37.8% and 37.0% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During 1995, the
prices for raw materials such as aluminum, steel, plastics and packaging
increased thereby placing pressures on margins.  Partially offsetting these
increases were the Company's Value Analysis and profit improvement programs as
well as advances and changes to our manufacturing processes.

Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 27.9% in 1995 in comparison
to 29.4% and 29.8% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  This reduction is
attributable to the synergies developed by the acquisition of Envirco,
controls on spending and the aforementioned profit improvement programs
implemented by the Company.  The Company continues to invest sales, marketing,
and research and development resources in those areas within the organization
having strategic significance.  1994 operating expenses included a onetime
charge of $125,000 for the closure of the German subsidiary and the
consolidation of European operations.

Interest expense during 1995 was $434,000 as compared to $171,000 in 1994 and
$156,000 in 1993.  This increase is due to the borrowing of $6,800,000 for the
Envirco acquisition.

Income taxes were $1,335,000, $1,012,000, and $838,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The majority of taxable income during these periods was earned
in the United Sates and was subject to taxation.  In 1995 the Company also
redeemed 1.55 million British Pounds Sterling of share capital from the Trion
Limited subsidiary in the United Kingdom causing income for the current year
to be taxable.  Going forward, Trion Limited continues to be eligible for
favorable tax treatment due to losses in prior years.  These operating losses
may be carried forward indefinitely.

Net income for the year ended 1995 increased by $455,000, or 26% over 1994. 
The $2,234,000 of reportable net income in 1995 compares to $1,779,000 in 1994

                                    -10-
<PAGE>


and $1,578,000 in 1993.  Earnings per share continued to rise, with 1995
resulting in $0.35 per share as compared to $0.28 per share in 1994 and $0.25
per share in 1993.  The 1994 figure included the onetime charge for the
consolidation of European operations, reducing earnings by $0.03 per share. 
The overall positive trend is a direct result of the Company's focus on
growth, internally and through acquisitions, as well as continuing efforts to
control production costs and operating expenses.

Liquidity and Sources of Capital

Cash flow from operations was sufficient to fund working capital requirements
and core business capital expenditures during the most recent period.  The
cash balance on hand decreased by 88% in 1995 to $497,000 from $4,149,000 in
1994 due to the purchase of the Envirco operation.  In addition to the
Company's own funds, supplemental bank borrowings of $6,800,000 were required
to settle the Envirco acquisition.  Working capital increased to $15,780,000
in 1995 compared to $14,286,000 in 1994, representing a 10% improvement.  The
ratio of current assets to current liabilities in 1995 was 3.3 to 1 compared
to 5.0 to 1 a year ago.  

Currently, the Company has an unsecured line of credit in the amount of
$18,000,000 with Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A. which is deemed
sufficient to fund future operating requirements.  Anticipated acquisition
financing requirements may require the Company to seek additional sources of
credit.  These funds would be used primarily for financing activities
associated with future growth opportunities through additional acquisitions. 
The Company has no commitments with respect to any additional acquisitions at
this time.  Additionally, in 1995 the Company refinanced the $3,200,000
remaining on the 1984 tax exempt, variable rate industrial revenue bonds
(requiring principal payments to be made annually through 2004) with tax
exempt, adjustable mode industrial development revenue refunding bonds
(requiring no principal payments until the year 2011).  

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In March 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amount.  Statement 121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived
assets that are expected to be disposed of.  The Company will adopt Statement
121 in the first quarter of 1996 and, based on current circumstances, does not
believe the effect of adoption will be material.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation:  The financial statements include the accounts of
the Company's subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.  All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:  Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated using year-end exchange rates and revenues and
expenses are translated using exchange rates prevailing during the year. 
Unrealized currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
shareholders' equity and are not included in income until realized.

Operations:  The Company is principally engaged in the design, manufacture and
sale of equipment to improve the quality of indoor air in the consumer,
residential, commercial and industrial markets, and equipment to
electrostatically distribute micro-thin films of lubricants, corrosion
inhibitors and other protective coatings to metal strips on high speed process
lines.

Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is
determined by the last-in, first-out method for domestic raw materials and by
the first-in, first-out method for all other inventories.  Obsolete or slow
moving inventory is written off or written down when it is determined that the
carrying value of the particular item exceeds realizable value.

Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost.  Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method.

Intangible Assets:  The carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed if
the facts and circumstances indicate impairment of their carrying value.  Any
impairment in the carrying value of such intangibles is recorded when
identified.

Pension and Savings Plans:  The Company has one noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan and two defined contribution profit sharing plans
covering eligible employees. (See Note I)

Net Sales:  The Company recognizes a sale when title passes to the customer -
usually the date of shipment.  New equipment returned by customers is charged
to sales when received by the Company.

Research and Development Expenses:  Included in selling, administration and
engineering expenses is $771,000, $531,000 and $515,000 for research and
development in the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  It is a policy of
the Company to expense research and development costs in the year incurred.

Warranty Expenses:  The Company has a warranty reserve which has been
established at a percentage of cost of sales.  This percentage, which is
subject to regular review, is based on the history of warranty expenses
incurred.

Net Income Per Share:  Net income per share of common stock is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the year (6,429,396 in 1995, 6,381,229 in 1994 and
6,313,799 in 1993).  Outstanding stock options are not considered in computing
earnings per share as the effect would not be material.

Statement of Cash Flows:  For purposes of this statement, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Income Taxes:  Income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109). (See Note F).

Stock Based Compensation:  The Company grants stock options for a fixed number
of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the
shares at the date of grant.  The Company accounts for stock option grants in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for the stock option
grants.

Reclassification:  Certain amounts in 1994 and 1993 have been reclassified to
conform to present classifications.  These reclassifications have no effect on
previously reported shareholders' equity or financial results.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards:  In March 1995, the FASB
issued Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which requires impairment losses
to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of
impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. 
Statement 121 also addresses the accounting for long-lived assets that are
expected to be disposed of.  The Company will adopt Statement 121 in the first
quarter of 1996 and, based on current circumstances, does not believe the
effect of adoption will be material.

NOTE B - ACQUISITION

On August 1, 1995 the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Envirco Corporation, a manufacturer and distributor of ultra-clean air systems
and components located in Albuquerque, New Mexico for cash consideration of
approximately $7,986,000.  The Company incurred costs of approximately
$516,000; consisting principally of a finders fee, accounting and legal
                
                                    -16-
<PAGE>
expenses.  The acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand
and borrowings of $6,800,000.  The details of the credit facility are
discussed in Note D.

In a related transaction, the Company and/or Envirco Corporation entered into
employment agreements and/or non-compete agreements with five key employees of
the Envirco Corporation.  These agreements have terms which vary from two to
five years, maintain salary levels previously in effect, and, in certain
circumstances based upon company performance, provide incentive payments and
options to purchase the Company's common stock at $6.00 per share.

The Envirco acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method, with the
assets and liabilities of the business recorded at their estimated fair value
at the acquisition date.  The excess of total acquisition cost over the fair
value of the net assets acquired was classified as goodwill and is being
amortized on a straight line basis over 20 years.  The results of operations
of Envirco are included in these consolidated statements of income as of the
date of the acquisition.

If Envirco had been acquired at the beginning of 1995 and 1994, the unaudited
pro forma summary of consolidated results of operations would have been
reported as:  net sales of $51,438,000 and $45,620,000; net income of
$2,331,000 and $1,879,000; and net income per share of $0.36 and $0.29,
respectively.  These pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results that would have actually been attained, or that will be attained in
the future.

If the first-in, first-out method of accounting for cost had been used for
domestic raw materials, inventories would have been approximately $355,000 and
$251,000 more at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NOTE D - LINE OF CREDIT

The Company has a master credit facility in the United States which allows the
Company to borrow up to $18,000,000 at the London Interbank Offering Rate of
interest plus 1.3%.  This master credit facility expires in September, 1998. 
This facility replaced the previous $3,000,000 line of credit which was at the
prime rate of interest less 0.25%.

In September 1995, the Company obtained a master credit facility for
$18,000,000.  The structure of the master credit facility includes an
$8,000,000 thirty six (36) month revolving line of credit and a $10,000,000
sixty (60) month declining balance term loan.  

In addition, as part of the purchase and sale agreement associated with the
acquisition of Envirco Corporation, the Company obtained an escrow note for
$458,000; due in October of 1997 and bearing interest at the fixed rate of 6%. 

In November 1995, the Company refunded the entire $3,200,000 balance of the
1984 industrial revenue bonds; bearing interest based upon a percentage of
prime, 68.5% or a 5.99% interest rate at the time, and requiring principal
payments to be made annually through 2004.  The entire amount was refinanced
with industrial development revenue refunding bonds, due in November of 2011;
bearing interest, inclusive of fees for the letter of credit, remarketing, and
other financing charges, of approximately 5.5% and requiring no principal
payments until maturity.  The bonds are secured by the facility, including
real property and equipment.

NOTE F - INCOME TAXES

The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes as prescribed by
SFAS 109.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

Income before income taxes consisted of the following:

other key executives at prices not less than the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant.  Options may be granted for a term of up to ten
years at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  At December 31, 1995,
there were no shares available for future grants under the 1985 Plan and
277,000 shares available under the 1995 Plan.

In addition, a non-qualified stock option for 100,000 common shares was
granted in 1991 at $2.00 per share under terms of an employment agreement. 
The market value on the date of grant was $3.13 and the difference of $1.13
per share was charged to expense during 1991 and 1992.  In 1993, 66,666 of
these shares were exercised with the remaining 33,334 shares exercised in
1994.  During 1993, non-qualified stock options were granted for 100,000
shares at $2.50 per share, 75,000 shares at $3.00 per share and 70,000 at
$3.13 per share.  The market value on the date of grant of 175,000 shares was
$3.75 and the market value on the date of grant of 70,000 shares was $4.38. 
The options for 175,000 shares were granted for a period of five years. 
Vesting of 100,000 of these shares is 25% per year commencing in May 1993, and
75,000 of these shares vest at 33 1/3% per year commencing May 1994.  In 1995,
43,300 of the $2.50 per share options were exercised.  The options for 70,000
shares are for a period of ten years and were vested immediately.  The
difference between grant prices and market prices at the date of grant are
charged to expense over the respective vesting periods.

All incentive stock options and the 1991 non-qualified stock option were
granted for a period of five years and may be exercised for one-third of the
shares in each year following the date of grant.

NOTE I - PENSION AND SAVINGS PLANS

The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan for
substantially all Sanford employees.  Benefits are based on earnings and years
of service.  The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually the amount
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Assets of the Plan
are managed by a trustee and invested in marketable securities, bonds and
money market instruments.  Based on actuarial studies as of January 1 of each
year, the contribution required was $191,000 for 1995, $0 for 1994 and $0 for
1993.

NOTE K - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and
trade accounts receivable.  The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents
with various financial institutions.  Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of
entities comprising the Company's customer base.  However, as of December 31,
1995, the Company's receivable from one customer was $1,927,000.  The carrying
amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt approximate their fair values.

NOTE L - INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company's operations are classified in three general industry segments: 
Engineered Products; Consumer Products and European Operations.

Engineered Products include air cleaning products manufactured for commercial,
industrial and marine applications, air cleaning equipment manufactured for
permanent installation in residential air handling systems, and equipment
designed to electrostatically distribute micro-thin films of lubricants,
corrosion inhibitors and other protective coatings to metal strips on high
speed process lines.

Consumer Products include portable room-size units, small appliance models and
equipment and components sold to other suppliers of air cleaners.

Trion Limited (and Trion GmbH in 1994) functions in Europe as a sales and
distribution operation.  The U.S. manufacturing operation provides products
for resale.  Trion GmbH ceased operations at the end of 1994.

Net sales by segment include only sales to unaffiliated customers as reported
in the Company's consolidated income statement.  Segment income from
operations is net sales less cost of products sold and certain operating
expenses.  In computing income from operations, other income, general
corporate expenses, domestic interest expense and taxes on income have been
excluded.

The Company's manufacturing facilities serve all segments; therefore, specific
identification of all property, plant and equipment and inventory is not
practicable.  These assets and related depreciation were allocated to segments
based on estimates.  General corporate assets were principally cash and cash
equivalents, office equipment and engineering equipment.

Net sales of the Company in 1995 include approximately $1,466,000 of direct
and indirect sales to the United States Government ($1,277,000 in 1994 and 
$1,043,000 in 1993).  These sales are included in the Engineered Products
group.  Sales to a significant customer in the Consumer Products group were
$6,288,000 in 1995; $5,967,000 in 1994 and $7,702,000 in 1993.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Trion, Inc.
Sanford, North Carolina


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trion, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Trion, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

  (i) immediately after each such Revolver Loan is made, the aggregate principal
    amount of Revolver Loans by such Bank shall not exceed the amount of its
    Revolver Loan Commitment, and

  (ii) the aggregate outstanding amount of all Revolver Loans and the aggregate
    amount of Term Loan Advances which have been made shall not exceed the
    aggregate amount of the Commitments.  

Each Revolver Loan Borrowing under this Section shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of (i) $1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000 in the
case of Euro-Dollar Loans, and (ii) $100,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000
in the case of Base Rate Loans (except that any such Revolver Loan Borrowing
may be in the aggregate amount of the Unused Revolver Loan Commitments), and
in each case shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to
their respective Revolver Loan Commitments.  Within the foregoing limits, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay or, to the extent permitted by
Section 2.10, prepay Revolver Loans and reborrow under this Section at any
time before the Termination Date.

  SECTION 2.02. Commitments to Make Term Loan Advances.  Each Bank severally
agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, to make up to 3 Term
Loan Advances to the Borrower in an aggregate amount up to the amount of the
Term Loan Commitment. Each Term Loan Advance and Refunding Loan under this
Section 
P(15)
<PAGE>

shall be in an aggregate principal amount of (i) $1,000,000 or any
larger multiple of $1,000 in the case of Euro-Dollar Loans, and (ii) $150,000
or any larger multiple of $1,000 in the case of Base Rate Loans, and in each
case shall be made from the several Banks ratably in proportion to their
respective Term Loan Commitments outstanding. A Term Loan Advance may be made
on a date specified in a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 (such
date of any Term Loan Advance being the "Drawdown Date" for such Term Loan
Advance), which Drawdown Date must be (A) a Euro-Dollar Business Day (or a
Domestic Business Day, in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing), and (B) (1) on
the Closing Date, with respect to the first Term Loan Advance, and (2) on or
before the Amortization Date, with respect to any subsequent Term Loan
Advance. Thereafter, each Bank severally agrees to make Refunding Loans from
time to time before the Maturity Date.  Subject to the provisions of Section
2.10(b), Term Loans may prepaid at any time without premium or penalty, but
principal amounts prepaid, and principal amounts repaid on Installment Payment
Dates, may not be reborrowed, except as Refunding Loans.  Upon the funding of
3 Term Loan Advances or a lesser number of Term Loan Advances in an aggregate
amount equal to the aggregate Term Loan Commitments, whichever is applicable,
the Term Loan Commitments shall terminate.  The aggregate principal amount of
the Term Loans shall be repaid in 8 consecutive semi-annual installments of
principal, each in an amount equal to 0.125% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Term Loans on the Amortization Date, after giving effect to any Term
Loan Advances made on such date (and if any Term Loan Advances are made on the
Amortization Date, they shall be netted against the principal installment due
on such date, and only the excess remaining shall be funded as a Term Loan
Advance or paid as principal installment, as the case may be), with a final
payment of all outstanding principal and all accrued and unpaid interest on
the Maturity Date. 
 
  SECTION 2.03. Method of Borrowing Loans.  (a) The Borrower shall give the
Agent notice (a "Notice of Borrowing"), which shall be substantially in the
form of Exhibit E, prior to 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the same
Domestic Business Day for each Base Rate Borrowing and at least 3 Euro-Dollar
Business Days before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:

  (i)
  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case
  of a Base Rate Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a
  Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

  (ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, and whether such Borrowing is a
   Revolver Loan Borrowing or a Term Loan Advance,

  (iii) whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or
    Euro-Dollar Loans, and
P(16)
<PAGE>


  (iv) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the Interest
    Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of
    Interest Period.

     (b)
  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each
  Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of such
Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing, once received by the Agent, shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

    (c) Not later than 1:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date of each
Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this
Section) make available its ratable share of such Borrowing, in Federal or
other funds immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia, to the Agent at its
address determined pursuant to Section 9.01.  Unless the Agent determines that
any applicable condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the
Agent will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower
at the Agent's aforesaid address.  Unless the Agent receives notice from a
Bank, at the Agent's address referred to in or specified pursuant to Section
9.01, no later than 1:00 P.M. (local time at such address) on the date of a
Base Rate Borrowing, or 4:00 P.M. (local time at such address) on the Euro-
Dollar Business Day before the date of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, in either case
stating that such Bank will not make a Loan in connection with such Borrowing,
the Agent shall be entitled to assume that such Bank will make a Loan in
connection with such Borrowing and, in reliance on such assumption, the Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to) make available such Bank's ratable share
of such Borrowing to the Borrower for the account of such Bank.  If the Agent
makes such Bank's ratable share available to the Borrower and such Bank does
not in fact make its ratable share of such Borrowing available on such date,
the Agent shall be entitled to recover such Bank's ratable share from such
Bank or the Borrower (and for such purpose shall be entitled to charge such
amount to any account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent), together
with interest thereon for each day during the period from the date of such
Borrowing until such sum shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to
the rate at which the Agent determines that it obtained (or could have
obtained) overnight Federal funds to cover such amount for each such day
during such period, provided that (i) any such payment by the Borrower of such
Bank's ratable share and interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any
rights that the Borrower may have against such Bank and (ii) until such Bank
has paid its ratable share of such Borrowing, together with interest pursuant
to the foregoing, it will have no interest in or rights with respect to such
Borrowing for any purpose hereunder.  If the Agent does not exercise its
option to advance funds for the account of such Bank, it shall promptly notify
the Borrower of such decision.

   (d) If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on which the Borrower is
to repay all or any part of an outstanding 
P(17)
<PAGE>


Loan from such Bank, such Bank
shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment as a Refunding
Loan and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount
being borrowed and the amount of such Refunding Loan shall be made available
by such Bank to the Agent as provided in paragraph (c) of this Section, or
remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as provided in Section 2.12, as the case
may be.

         (e)
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Euro-Dollar Borrowing may be made if there shall have occurred a Default or an
Event of Default, which Default or Event of Default shall not have been cured
or waived, and all Refunding Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans (but shall
bear interest at the Default Rate, if applicable).

  (f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify whether the Loans
comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, such
Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower is otherwise entitled
under this Agreement to repay any Loans maturing at the end of an Interest
Period applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and the
Borrower fails to repay such Loans using its own moneys and fails to give a
Notice of Borrowing in connection with such new Borrowing, a new Borrowing
shall be deemed to be made on the date such Loans mature in an amount equal to
the principal amount of the Loans so maturing, and the Loans comprising such
new Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans.

  (g)
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, there shall not be
more than 11 Euro-Dollar Loans at any given time.

   SECTION 2.04. Notes.  (a)  The Revolver Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced
by a single Revolver Loan Note payable to the order of such Bank, for the
account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the original principal
amount of such Bank's Revolver Loan Commitment.

         (b)
    The Term Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by a single Term Loan Note
payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its Lending Office in an
amount equal to the original principal amount of such Bank's Term Loan
Commitment.

         (c)
    Upon receipt of each Bank's Notes pursuant to Section 3.01, the Agent shall
deliver such Notes to such Bank.  Each Bank shall record, and prior to any
transfer of its Notes shall endorse on the schedules forming a part thereof
appropriate notations to evidence, the date, amount and maturity of, and
effective interest rate for, each Loan made by it, the date and amount of each
payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and such
schedules of each such Bank's Notes shall constitute rebuttable presumptive
evidence of the respective principal amounts owing and unpaid on such Bank's
Notes; provided that the failure of any Bank to make any such 
P(18)
<PAGE>

recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes or the ability of any Bank to assign its Notes.  Each Bank is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to complete its Notes as set forth
above and to attach to and make a part of any Note a continuation of any such
schedule as and when required.

    SECTION 2.05. Maturity of Loans.  (a) Each Loan included in any Borrowing
shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

   (b)
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the outstanding principal amount of the
Revolver Loans, if any, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon,
if any, shall be due and payable on the Termination Date, and (ii) the
outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans, together with all accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, if any, shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date.

   SECTION 2.06. Interest Rates.  (a) "Applicable Margin" means (i) for any Base
Rate Loan, 0%; and (ii) for any Euro-Dollar Loan, 1.30%.

   (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it becomes
due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
the last day thereof.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, overdue interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the
Default Rate.

    (c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period.  Such interest shall
be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such
Interest Period is longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the
first day thereof.  Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by
law, overdue interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

  The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period
means a rate per annum  equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upwards, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100th of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable
London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00 minus the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.
P(19)
<PAGE>


   The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Euro-Dollar Loan means
for the Interest Period of such Euro-Dollar Loan, the rate per annum
determined on the basis of the offered rate for deposits in Dollars of amounts
equal or comparable to the principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan offered
for a term comparable to such Interest Period, which rates appear on the
Reuters Screen LIBO Page effective as of 11:00 A.M., London time, 2
Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest Period,
provided that (i) if more than one such offered rate appears on the Reuters
Screen LIBO Page, the "London Interbank Offered Rate" will be the offered rate
which is used in the majority of such quotations, if there is a majority,
otherwise the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
higher 1/100th of 1%) of such offered rates; (ii) if no such offered rates
appear on such page, the "London Interbank Offered Rate" for such Interest
Period will be the arithmetic average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the
next higher 1/100th of 1%) of rates quoted by not less than 2 major banks in
New York City, selected by the Agent, at approximately 10:00 A.M., New York
City time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest
Period, for deposits in Dollars offered to leading European banks for a period
comparable to such Interest Period in an amount comparable to the principal
amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan.

  "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage (expressed
as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining the
maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in
respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or
other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to
United States residents).  The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate shall be
adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

     (d) The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans
hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks
by telecopier of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination
thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

     (e)  After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, the
principal amount of the Loans (and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
all accrued interest thereon) may, after the election of the Required Banks
and notice thereof has been given to the Borrower, bear interest at the
Default Rate.

   SECTION 2.07. Fees.  (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable
account of each Bank, a commitment fee, 
P(20)
<PAGE>

calculated on the average daily amount
of such Bank's Unused Commitment, at the rate of 0.20% per annum. Such
commitment fees shall accrue from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the Termination Date and shall be payable in arrears on each March
31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and on the Termination Date.  

        (b)
    The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account and sole benefit of the
Agent, such fees and other amounts at such times as may be mutually agreed to
by the Borrower and the Agent from time to time.

   SECTION 2.08. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  The Borrower
may, upon at least 3 Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent, terminate at
any time, or proportionately reduce the Unused Revolver Loan Commitments or
the Unused Term Loan Commitments from time to time by an aggregate amount of
at least $1,000,000 or any larger multiple of $500,000.  If the Commitments
are terminated in their entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under Section
2.07) shall be due and payable on the effective date of such termination.

    SECTION 2.09. Mandatory Reduction and Termination of Commitments.  (a)  The
Revolver Loan Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date and any
Revolver Loans then outstanding (together with accrued interest thereon) shall
be due and payable on such date.  The Term Loan Commitments shall terminate on
the Amortization Date.

    SECTION 2.10. Optional Prepayments.  (a) The Borrower may, upon at least 1
Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating at
least $150,000 or any larger multiple of $50,000, by paying the principal
amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably
the Base Rate Loans of the several Banks included in such Base Rate Borrowing.

         (b)
    Except as provided in Section 8.02, the Borrower may not prepay all or any
portion of the principal amount of any Euro-Dollar Loan prior to the maturity
thereof.

         (c)
    Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10, the
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
Bank's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice, once received by the
Agent, shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

   SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Prepayments.  On each date on which the Revolver Loan
Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 2.08 or Section 2.09, the Borrower
shall repay or prepay such principal amount of the outstanding Revolver Loans,
if any (together with interest accrued thereon), as may be necessary so 
P(21)
<PAGE>


that
after such payment the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolver Loans
does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as then reduced. Each
such payment or prepayment shall be applied ratably to the Loans of the Banks
outstanding on the date of payment or prepayment in the following order of
priority: (i) first, to Base Rate Loans; and (ii) secondly, to Euro-Dollar
Loans.

   SECTION 2.12. General Provisions as to Payments.  (a) The Borrower shall make
each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees
hereunder, not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date when
due, in Federal or other funds  immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia, to
the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01.  The Agent will promptly
distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the
Agent for the account of the Banks.

   (b) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans
or of fees hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business
Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of or interest on,
the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar
Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls
in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be
the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.

  (c)
  All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other amounts to be made
by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Loan or fee
relating thereto shall be paid without deduction for, and free from, any tax,
imposts, levies, duties, deductions, or withholdings of any nature now or at
anytime hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or by any taxing
authority thereof or therein excluding in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed
on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank,
taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction of such Bank's applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, imposts, levies, duties,
deductions or withholdings of any nature being "Taxes").  In the event that
the Borrower is required by applicable law to make any such withholding or
deduction of Taxes with respect to any Loan or fee or other amount, the
Borrower shall pay such deduction or withholding to the applicable taxing
authority, shall promptly furnish to any Bank in respect of which such
deduction or withholding is made all receipts and other documents evidencing
such payment and shall pay to such Bank additional amounts as may be necessary
in order that the amount received by such Bank after the required withholding
or other 
P(22)
<PAGE>

payment shall equal the amount such Bank would have received had no
such withholding or other payment been made.  If no withholding or deduction
of Taxes are payable in respect to any Loan or fee relating thereto, the
Borrower shall furnish any Bank, at such Bank's reasonable request, a
certificate from each applicable taxing authority or an opinion of counsel
acceptable to such Bank, in either case stating that such payments are exempt
from or not subject to withholding or deduction of Taxes.  If the Borrower
fails to provide such original or certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment of Taxes or certificate(s) or opinion of counsel of exemption, the
Borrower hereby agrees to compensate such Bank for, and indemnify them with
respect to, the tax consequences of the Borrower's failure to provide evidence
of tax payments or tax exemption.

    Each Bank which is not organized under the laws of the United States or any
state thereof agrees, as soon as practicable after receipt by it of a request
by the Borrower to do so, to file all appropriate forms and take other
appropriate action to obtain a certificate or other appropriate document from
the appropriate governmental authority in the jurisdiction imposing the
relevant Taxes, establishing that it is entitled to receive payments of
principal and interest under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction
and free from withholding of any Taxes imposed by such jurisdiction; provided
that if it is unable, for any reason, to establish such exemption, or to file
such forms and, in any event, during such period of time as such request for
exemption is pending, the Borrower shall nonetheless remain obligated under
the terms of the immediately preceding paragraph.

      In the event any Bank receives a refund of any Taxes paid by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.12(c), it will pay to the Borrower the amount of
such refund promptly upon receipt thereof; provided that if at any time
thereafter it is required to return such refund, the Borrower shall promptly
repay to it the amount of such refund.

     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower
hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower and the Banks
contained in this Section 2.12(c) shall be applicable with respect to any
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by
such provisions (i) shall be made based upon the circumstances of such
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and (ii) constitute a continuing
agreement and shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment
in full or cancellation of the Notes.

    SECTION 2.13. Computation of Interest and Fees.  Interest on Base Rate Loans
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
Interest 
P(23)
<PAGE>

on Euro-Dollar Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed, calculated as to each
Interest Period from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the
last day thereof.  Commitment fees and any other fees payable hereunder shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number
of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

                                ARTICLE IV

                      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants that:

     SECTION 4.01. Corporate Existence and Power.  The Borrower is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, is duly qualified to transact business in
every jurisdiction where, by the nature of its business, such qualification is

exceed $250,000 at any time outstanding, or (y) another Foreign Significant
Subsidiary is required to comply with clause (ii) of this Section above.

one or all of them at the request of the Required Banks.

                                ARTICLE VII

                                 THE AGENT

         SECTION 7.01. Appointment; Powers and Immunities.  Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as its agent hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Agent: (a) shall have
no duties or responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this 
P(42)
<PAGE>

Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document be a trustee for any Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to
the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate
or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any Bank
under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for
herein or therein or for any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any other
Loan Document except to the extent requested by the Required Banks, and then
only on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Agent, and (d) shall not be
responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred to
or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith,
except for its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Agent may
employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any such agents  or attorneys-in-fact selected by
it with reasonable care.  The provisions of this Article VII are solely for
the benefit of the Agent and the Banks, and the Borrower shall not have any
rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof, except as
expressly set forth herein.  In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as
agent of the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed
any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the
Borrower.  The duties of the Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in
nature, and the Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank.

  SECTION 7.02. Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone, telecopier, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants or other experts selected by the Agent.  As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the
Required Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks in any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks.

    SECTION 7.03. Defaults.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of
the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (other than the nonpayment
of principal of or interest on 
P(43)
<PAGE>

the Loans) unless the Agent has received notice
from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".  In the event that the
Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks.  The Agent
shall give each Bank prompt notice of each nonpayment of principal of or
interest on the Loans whether or not it has received any notice of the
occurrence of such nonpayment.  The Agent shall (subject to Section 9.06) take
such action hereunder with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall be directed by the Required Banks, provided that, unless and until the
Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the
best interests of the Banks.

  SECTION 7.04. Rights of Agent as a Bank.  If Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. at
any time becomes a Bank hereunder, the following provisions shall apply.  With
respect to the Loans made by it, the Agent in its capacity as a Bank hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not acting as the Agent, and the term
"Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include
Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A. in its individual capacity.  The Agent may
(without having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend
money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business
with the Borrower (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting as the
Agent, and the Agent may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower
(in addition to any agency fees and arrangement fees heretofore agreed to
between the Borrower and the Agent) for services in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise without having to account
for the same to the Banks.

    SECTION 7.05. Indemnification.  Each Bank severally agrees to indemnify the
Agent, to the extent the Agent shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower,
ratably in accordance with its Commitment, for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements) or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (excluding, unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the normal administrative costs and expenses
incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement
of any of the terms hereof or thereof or any such other documents; provided
that no Bank shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise
from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent.  If any indemnity
furnished to 
P(44)
<PAGE>

the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agent, be
insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity
and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such
additional indemnity is furnished.  

    SECTION 7.06  Consequential Damages.  THE AGENT SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR
LIABLE TO ANY BANK, THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT
OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

    SECTION 7.07. Payee of Note Treated as Owner.  The Agent may deem and treat
the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Agent and the provisions of Section 9.08(c) have been
satisfied.  Any requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of
any Note shall be  conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee
or assignee of that Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor
or replacement thereof.

   SECTION 7.08. Nonreliance on Agent and Other Banks.  Each Bank agrees that it
has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement
and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.  The Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein
or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any other
Person.  Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the Borrower or any
other Person (or any of their Affiliates) which may come into the possession
of the Agent.

      SECTION 7.09. Failure to Act.  Except for action expressly required of the
Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and
thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction by
the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by the 
P(45)
<PAGE>

Agent by reason of taking, continuing to take, or failing to take any such 
action.

  SECTION 7.10. Resignation or Removal of Agent.  Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may resign at any
time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower and the Agent may
be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks.  Upon any
such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.  If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's
notice of resignation or the Required Banks' removal of the retiring Agent,
then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor 
Agent.  Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has a combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation
or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder.


                               ARTICLE VIII

                   CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION

  SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair.  If on
or prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

         (a)
   the Agent determines that deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are
    not being offered in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or 

    (b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that the London Interbank Offered
    Rate, as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the
   cost to such Banks of funding the Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make
Euro-Dollar Loans specified in such notice shall be suspended.  Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least 2 Domestic Business Days before the date
of any Borrowing of such Euro-Dollar Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow 
P(46)
<PAGE>

on such date, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

      SECTION 8.02. Illegality.  If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof (any such agency being referred to as an "Authority"
and any such event being referred to as a "Change  of Law"), or compliance by
any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible
for any Bank (or its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar
Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give
notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank
notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to
this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such
Bank shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund
any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in
such notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then
outstanding principal amount of each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, together
with accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each such
Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal
principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other
Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

         SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (a) If after the date
hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
Authority: 

     (i) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
 similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement
 imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding
 any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)
 against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
 any Bank (or its Lending Office); or

    (ii) shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office) or on the London
 interbank market any other condition affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its
 Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans;
P(47)
<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank
(or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Loan, or to reduce the
amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending Office)
under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an amount
deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such
Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased
cost or reduction.

   (b) If any Bank shall have determined that after the date hereof the adoption
of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof,
or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law)
of any Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Bank's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a
level below that which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank, the Borrower
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Bank for such reduction.

         (c)
    Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of
which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle
such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of any Bank
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional
amount or  amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Bank may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

         (d)
    The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be applicable with respect to any
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by
such provisions shall be made based upon the circumstances of such
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee.

    (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Borrower is required to
pay any Bank amounts pursuant to Section 2.12(c) or this Section 8.03 and the
designation of a different Lending Office pursuant to Section 2.12(c) or
Section 8.03(c) will not avoid the need for compensation to such Bank (an
"Affected Bank"), the Borrower may give notice to such Affected Bank (with
copies to the Agent) that it wishes to seek one or more assignees (which may
be one or more of the Banks) to assume 
P(48)
<PAGE>

the Commitment of such Affected Bank
and to purchase its outstanding Loans and Notes; provided, that if there is
more than one Affected Bank which has requested substantially and
proportionally equal compensation hereunder, the Borrower shall elect to seek
an assignee to assume the Commitments of all such Affected Banks.  Each
Affected Bank agrees to sell its Commitment, Loans, Notes and interest in this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.08(c) to any such assignee for an
amount equal to the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and accrued
interest on such Loans and Notes, plus all other fees and amounts (including,
without limitation, any compensation due to such Affected Banks under Section
2.12(c) or this Section 8.03) due to such Affected Bank hereunder calculated,
in each case, to the date such Loans, Notes and interest are purchased.  Upon
such sale or prepayment, each such Affected Bank shall have no further
commitment or other obligation to the Borrower hereunder or under any Note.

    SECTION 8.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Euro-Dollar Loans.  If (i) the
obligation of any Bank to make or maintain any Euro-Dollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under Section 8.03, and the Borrower shall, by at least 5 Euro-Dollar Business
Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the
provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until
such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

         (a)
    all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank Euro-Dollar Loans shall
    be made instead as Base Rate Loans (in all cases interest and principal on
    such Loans shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar
    Loans of the other Banks), and

         (b)
  after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of principal
  which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall be
  applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

    SECTION 8.05. Compensation.  Upon the request of any Bank, delivered to the
Borrower and the Agent, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amount or
amounts as shall compensate such Bank for any loss, cost or expense incurred
by such Bank as a result of:

         (a)
    any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11, 6.01, 8.02 or
otherwise) of a Euro-Dollar Loan on a date other than the last day of an
Interest Period for such Loan; or
         (b)
    any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Euro-Dollar Loan on the date for the
Euro-Dollar Borrowing of which such Fixed Rate Loan is a part specified in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section 2.03;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the
amount so paid or prepaid or not prepaid or borrowed for the period from the
date of such payment, prepayment or failure to prepay or borrow to the last
day of the then current Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan (or, in the
case of a failure to prepay or borrow, the Interest Period for such Euro-
Dollar Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to prepay
or borrow) at the applicable rate of interest for such Euro-Dollar Loan
provided for herein over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined
by such Bank) such Bank would have paid on deposits in Dollars of comparable
amounts having terms comparable to such period placed with it by leading banks
in the London interbank market.


                                ARTICLE IX

                               MISCELLANEOUS

   SECTION 9.01. Notices.  All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telecopier or
similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address or telecopier
number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such other address or
telecopier number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by
notice to each other party.  Each such notice, request or other communication
shall be effective (i) if given by telecopier, when such telecopy is
transmitted to the telecopier number specified in this Section and the
appropriate confirmation is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after
such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered at
the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent
under Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until received.

     SECTION 9.02. No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the Agent or any Bank in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note or other
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

    SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Documentary Taxes.  The Borrower shall pay (i) all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including fees and disbursements of
special counsel for the Agent, Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, in connection with
the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered on the Closing Date, (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent,
including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Banks and the
Agent, in 
P(50)
<PAGE>


connection with the preparation of other Loan Documents after the
Closing Date, any waiver or consent hereunder or thereunder or any amendment
hereof or thereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder or thereunder,
and (iii) if a Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Agent and the Banks, including fees and disbursements of counsel, in
connection with such Default and collection and  other enforcement proceedings
resulting therefrom, including out-of-pocket expenses incurred in enforcing
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower shall indemnify the
Agent and each Bank against any transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments
or charges made by any Authority by reason of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

    SECTION 9.04. Indemnification.  The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, the
Banks and each Affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may become
subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of
or result from any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of
any extension of credit by any Bank hereunder or breach by the Borrower of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or from any investigation,
litigation (including, without limitation, any actions taken by the Agent or
any of the Banks to enforce this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents)
or other proceeding (including, without limitation, any threatened
investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, and the Borrower shall
reimburse the Agent and each Bank, and each Affiliate thereof and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any
expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred in connection
with any such investigation or proceeding; but excluding any such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified.

     SECTION 9.05. Setoff; Sharing of Setoffs.  (a) The Borrower agrees that the
Agent and each Bank shall have a lien for all indebtedness and obligations
owing to them from the Borrower upon all deposits or deposit accounts, of any
kind, or any interest in any deposits or deposit accounts thereof, now or
hereafter pledged, mortgaged, transferred or assigned to the Agent or any such
Bank or otherwise in the possession or control of the Agent or any such Bank
for any purpose for the account or benefit of the Borrower and including any
balance of any deposit account or of any credit of the Borrower with the Agent
or any such Bank, whether now existing or hereafter established hereby
authorizing the Agent and each Bank at any time or times with or without prior
notice to apply such balances or any part thereof to such of the indebtedness
and obligations owing by the Borrower to the Banks and/or the Agent then past
due and in such amounts as they may elect, and whether or not the collateral,
if any, or the responsibility of other Persons primarily, secondarily or
P(51)
<PAGE>

otherwise liable may be deemed adequate.  For the purposes of this paragraph,
all remittances and property shall be deemed to be in the possession of the
Agent or any such Bank as soon as the same may be put in transit to it by mail
or carrier or by other bailee.

         (b)
    Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or resort to collateral security or otherwise, receive payment of
a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest owing with
respect to the Note held by it which is greater than the proportion received
by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of all principal and
interest owing with respect to the Note held by such other Bank, the Bank
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks owing to such other Banks,
and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such
payments of principal and interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks
owing to such other Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that
(i) nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any
right of setoff or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to
such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its
indebtedness under the Notes, and (ii) if all or  any portion of such payment
received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered from such purchasing
Bank, such purchase from each other Bank shall be rescinded and such other
Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price of such
participation to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the amount
of such other Bank's required repayment to (y) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law,
that any holder of a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of setoff or counterclaim
and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder
of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation.

    SECTION 9.06. Amendments and Waivers.  (a) Any provision of this Agreement,
the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and
the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected
thereby, by the Agent); provided that, no such amendment or waiver shall,
unless signed by all Banks and the Borrower, (i) change the Commitment of any
Bank or subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) change the
principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any fees (other than fees
payable to the Agent) hereunder, (iii) change the date fixed for any payment
of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees 
P(52)
<PAGE>


hereunder, (iv) change the
amount of principal, interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment
thereof, (v) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the percentage of Banks, which shall
be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section
or any other provision of this Agreement, (vi) change the manner of
application of any payments made under this Agreement or the Notes, (vii)
release or substitute all or any substantial part of the collateral (if any)
held as security for the Loans, or (viii) release any Guarantee given to
support payment of the Loans.

         (b)
 The Borrower will not solicit, request or negotiate for or with respect to any
proposed waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of this Agreement unless
each Bank shall be informed thereof by the Borrower and shall be afforded an
opportunity of considering the same and shall be supplied by the Borrower with
sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision with respect
thereto.  Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver or consent
effected pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be delivered by
the Borrower to each Bank forthwith following the date on which the same shall
have been executed and delivered by the requisite percentage of Banks.  The
Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any
remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or
otherwise, to any Bank (in its capacity as such) as consideration for or as an
inducement to the entering into by such Bank of any waiver or amendment of any
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement unless such remuneration is
concurrently paid, on the same terms, ratably to all such Banks.

  SECTION 9.07. No Margin Stock Collateral.  Each of the Banks represents to the
Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not, directly or
indirectly (by negative pledge or otherwise), relying upon any Margin Stock as
collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this
Agreement.

    SECTION 9.08. Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement.

         (b)
    Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more Persons (each a "Participant")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such
Bank, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest of such Bank hereunder. 
In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating interest to a
Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes
under 
P(53)
<PAGE>


this Agreement, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  In no event shall a Bank that sells a
participation be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking
any action hereunder except that such Bank may agree that it will not (except
as provided below), without  the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) the
change of any date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the
related loan or loans, (ii) the change of the amount of any principal,
interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof with respect to
the related loan or loans, (iii) the change of the principal of the related
loan or loans, (iv) any change in the rate at which either interest is payable
thereon or (if the Participant is entitled to any part thereof) fee is payable
hereunder from the rate at which the Participant is entitled to receive
interest or fee (as the case may be) in respect of such participation, (v) the
release or substitution of all or any substantial part of the collateral (if
any) held as security for the Loans, or (vi) the release of any Guarantee
given to support payment of the Loans.  Each Bank selling a participating
interest in any Loan, Note, Commitment or other interest under this Agreement
shall, within 10 Domestic Business Days of such sale, provide the Borrower and
the Agent with written notification stating that such sale has occurred and
identifying the Participant and the interest purchased by such Participant. 
The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Article VIII with respect to its participation in Loans outstanding from time
to time.

         (c) With the prior written approval of the Borrower, which may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, any Bank may at any time assign to one or
more banks or financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all or a
proportionate part of both of its Revolver Loans and Term Loans and both of
its Revolver Loan Commitment and Term Loan Commitment of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and
such Assignee shall assume all such rights and obligations, pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance, executed by such Assignee, such transferor Bank and
the Agent; provided that (i) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to
this paragraph (c) unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably
equivalent portions of the transferor Bank's Commitment, and (ii) if a Bank is
assigning only a portion of its Commitment, then, the amount of the Commitment
being assigned (determined as of the effective date of the assignment) shall
be in an amount not less than $6,000,000.  Upon (A) execution of the
Assignment and Acceptance by such transferor Bank, such Assignee, the Agent
and the Borrower, (B) delivery of an executed copy of the Assignment and
Acceptance to the Borrower and the Agent, (C) payment by such Assignee to such
transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such
transferor Bank and such Assignee, and (D) payment of a processing and
recordation fee of $2,500 to the Agent, such Assignee shall for all purposes
be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and
P(54)
<PAGE>

obligations of a Bank under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an
original party hereto with a Commitment as set forth in such instrument of
assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its obligations
hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or action by the
Borrower, the Banks or the Agent shall be required.  Upon the consummation of
any transfer to an Assignee pursuant to this paragraph (c), the transferor
Bank, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that,
if required, a new Note is issued to such Assignee.

    (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.09, the Borrower authorizes each
Bank to disclose to any Participant, Assignee or other transferee (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information
in such Bank's possession concerning the Borrower which has been delivered to
such Bank by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been
delivered to such Bank by the Borrower in connection with such Bank's credit
evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement.

     (e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of Section
8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending Office under
certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such
greater payment did not exist.

    (g) Anything in this Section 9.08 to the contrary notwithstanding, any Bank
may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Loans and/or obligations owing
to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral
security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank,
provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loans and/or obligations
made by the Borrower to the assigning and/or pledging Bank in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's obligations hereunder
in respect of such assigned Loans and/or obligations to the extent of such
payment.  No such assignment shall release the assigning and/or pledging Bank
from its obligations hereunder.

    SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to keep any information delivered or made available by the
Borrower to it confidential from anyone other than persons employed or
retained by such Bank who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating,
approving, structuring or administering the Loans; provided that nothing
herein shall prevent any Bank from disclosing such information (i) to any
other Bank, (ii) upon the order of any 
P(55)
<PAGE>

court or administrative agency, (iii)
upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having
jurisdiction over such Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed, (v) to
the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which the
Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the
extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder, (vii) to such Bank's legal counsel and independent auditors and
(viii) to any actual or proposed Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of
all or part of its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by
the provisions of this Section 9.09; provided that should disclosure of any
such confidential information be required by virtue of clause (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, any relevant Bank shall promptly notify the
Borrower of same so as to allow the Borrower to seek a protective order or to
take any other appropriate action; provided, further, that, no Bank shall be
required to delay compliance with any directive to disclose any such
information so as to allow the Borrower to effect any such action.

  SECTION 9.10. Representation by Banks.  Each Bank hereby represents that it is
a commercial lender or financial institution which makes Loans in the ordinary
course of its business and that it will make its Loans hereunder for its own
account in the ordinary course of such business; provided that, subject to
Section 9.08, the disposition of the Note or Notes held by that Bank shall at
all times be within its exclusive control.

  SECTION 9.11. Obligations Several.  The obligations of each Bank hereunder are
several, and no Bank shall be responsible for the obligations or commitment of
any other Bank hereunder.  Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action
taken by the Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Banks to
be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. 
The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and
independent debt, and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its
rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and it shall
not be necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party in any
proceeding for such purpose.

      SECTION 9.12. North Carolina Law.  This Agreement and each Note shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of North
Carolina.

         SECTION 9.13. Severability.  In case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents
should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall be
enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.
P(56)
<PAGE>

     SECTION 9.14. Interest.  In no event shall the amount of interest, and all
charges, amounts or fees contracted for, charged or collected pursuant to this
Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents and deemed to be interest
under applicable law (collectively, "Interest") exceed the highest rate of
interest allowed by applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"), and in the event any
such payment is inadvertently received by any Bank, then the excess sum (the
"Excess") shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower
shall notify such Bank in writing that it elects to have the Excess returned
forthwith.  It is the express intent hereof that the Borrower not pay and the
Banks not receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest
in excess of that which may legally be paid by the Borrower under applicable
law.  The right to accelerate maturity of any of the Loans does not include
the right to accelerate any interest that has not otherwise accrued on the
date of such acceleration, and the Agent and the Banks do not intend to
collect any unearned interest in the event of any such acceleration.  All
monies paid to the Agent or the Banks hereunder or under any of the Notes or
the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by prepayment, shall be
subject to rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by
applicable law.  By the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower covenants
that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by
the Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) the Borrower shall not seek or pursue
any other remedy, legal or equitable , against the Agent or any Bank, based in
whole or in part upon contracting for charging or receiving any Interest in
excess of the Maximum Rate.  For the purpose of determining whether or not any
Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Agent or any Bank,
all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrower
in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of the
Commitments.  The Borrower, the Agent and each Bank shall, to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal
payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof.  The provisions of this Section
shall be deemed to be incorporated into each Note and each of the other Loan
Documents (whether or not any provision of this Section is referred to
therein).  All such Loan Documents and communications relating to any Interest
owed by the Borrower and all figures set forth therein shall, for the sole
purpose of computing the extent of obligations hereunder and under the Notes
and the other Loan Documents be automatically recomputed by the Borrower, and
by any court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments or
credits required by this Section.

     SECTION 9.15. Interpretation.  No provision of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents shall be construed against or interpreted to the
disadvantage of any party hereto  by any court or other governmental or
judicial authority by 
P(57)
<PAGE>


reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured or 
dictated such provision.

  SECTION 9.16. Waiver of Jury Trial; Consent to Jurisdiction.  The Borrower (a)
and each of the Banks and the Agent irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding
arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) submits to the nonexclusive
personal jurisdiction in the State of Georgia, the courts thereof and the
United States District Courts sitting therein, for the enforcement of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, (c) waives any and all
personal rights under the law of any jurisdiction to object on any basis
(including, without limitation, inconvenience of forum) to jurisdiction or
venue within the State of Georgia for the purpose of litigation to enforce
this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents, and (d) agrees that
service of process may be made upon it in the manner prescribed in Section
9.01 for the giving of notice to the Borrower.  Nothing herein contained,
however, shall prevent the Agent from bringing any action or exercising any
rights against any security and against the Borrower personally, and against
any assets of the Borrower, within any other state or jurisdiction.

    SECTION 9.17. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

    SECTION 9.18. Source of Funds -- ERISA.  Each of the Banks hereby severally
(and not jointly) represents to the Borrower that no part of the funds to be
used by such Bank to fund the Loans hereunder from time to time constitutes
(i) assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such Bank in which
any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest nor (ii) any
other assets of any employee benefit plan.  As used in this Section, the terms
"employee benefit plan" and "separate account" shall have the respective
meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3 of ERISA.

                                           [Dated as provided in Section
                                           3.01 of the Credit Agreement]


To the Banks and the Agent
Referred to Below
c/o Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A.,
as Agent
191 Peachtree Street, N.E.
Atlanta, Georgia  30303-1757
Attn:  Syndications Group

Dear Sirs:

             We have acted as counsel for Trion, Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation (the "Borrower") and for [describe Guarantors] (collectively, the
Guarantors) in connection with the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement")
dated as of September 8, 1995, among the Borrower, the banks listed on the
signature pages thereof and Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., as Agent.  Terms
defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

             We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.  We have assumed for purposes of our opinions
set forth below that the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by
each Bank and by the Agent have been duly authorized by each Bank and by the
Agent.

             Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

             1.   The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as
now conducted.

             2.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
the Credit Agreement, the Notes and the Contribution Agreement by the Borrower
and of the Guaranty and the Contribution Agreement by the Guarantors (i) are
within the Borrower's and Guarantors' respective corporate powers, (ii) have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) require no
action by  or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official, (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision
of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Borrower or any Guarantor or of any agreement, judgment,
injunction, order, decree or other instrument which to our knowledge is
binding upon the Borrower or any Guarantor and (v) to our knowledge, except as
provided in the Credit Agreement, do not result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

             3.   Each of the Credit Agreement, the Contribution Agreement and
the Guaranty constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and the
Guarantors, as applicable, enforceable against the Borrower and the
Guarantors, respectively, in accordance with its terms, and the Notes
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of
equity.

             4.   To our knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding
pending, or threatened, against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency
or official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision
which could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial
position or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner
questions the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any Note,
the Contribution Agreement or the Guaranty.

             5.   Each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on its business as now conducted.

             6.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

             7.   Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
"holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended.

         We are qualified to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and do
not purport to be experts on any laws other than the laws of the United States
and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and this opinion is rendered only with
respect to such laws.  We have made no independent investigation of the laws
of any other jurisdiction.


         This opinion is delivered to you in connection with the transaction
referenced above and may only be relied upon by you, any Assignee, Participant
or other Transferee under the Credit Agreement, and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue
without our prior written consent.

             We have participated in the preparation of the Credit Agreement
(the "Credit Agreement") dated as of September 8, 1995, among Trion, Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the signature
pages thereof (the "Banks") and Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., as Agent (the
"Agent"), and have acted as special counsel for the Agent for the purpose of
rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. 
Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

             This opinion letter is limited by, and is in accordance with, the
January 1, 1992 edition of the Interpretive Standards applicable to Legal
Opinions to Third Parties in Corporate Transactions adopted by the Legal
Opinion Committee of the Corporate and Banking Law Section of the State Bar of
Georgia which Interpretive Standards are incorporated herein by this
reference.

             We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

             Upon the basis of the foregoing, and assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement, each of the
Notes and the Contribution Agreement by or on behalf of the Borrower, and the
Guaranty and the Contribution Agreement by each Guarantor, we are of the
opinion that each of the Credit Agreement, the Contribution Agreement and the
Guaranty constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and each
Guarantor, as applicable, and each Note constitutes valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with its
terms except as: (i) the enforceability thereof may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, voidable preference,
moratorium or similar laws applicable to creditors' rights or the collection
of debtors' obligations generally; (ii) rights of acceleration and the
availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of
general applicability; and (iii) the enforceability of certain of the
remedial, waiver and other provisions of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the
Guaranty and the Contribution Agreement may be further limited by the laws of
the State of Georgia; provided that such additional laws do not, in our
opinion, substantially interfere with the practical realization of the
benefits expressed in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, except for the
economic consequences of any procedural delay which may result from such laws.

         In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the effect
(if any) of any law of any jurisdiction except the State of Georgia.  We
express no opinion as to the effect of the compliance or noncompliance of the
Agent or any of the Banks with any state or federal laws or regulations
applicable to the Agent or any of the Banks by reason of the legal or
regulatory status or the nature of the business of the Agent or any of the
Banks.

         This opinion is delivered to you in connection with the transaction
referenced above and may only be relied upon by you and any Assignee,
Participant or other Transferee under the Credit Agreement without our prior
written consent.

                                 Very truly yours,

         Re:  Proposed term loan credit facilities in the amount of $18,000,000
    (the "Proposed Credit Facilities") to be entered into pursuant to Credit
    Agreement dated as of September 8, 1995 among Trion, Inc., a Pennsylvania
    corporation, the Banks listed therein and Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A., as
    Agent, in substantially the form of the draft thereof dated September 8,
    1995 (the "Draft Credit Agreement"; capitalized terms which are used but not
    defined herein have the meanings given them in the Draft Credit Agreement)

Gentlemen:

          It is anticipated that the Proposed Credit Facilities will close on or
about September 8, 1995, and that the only Bank will be  Wachovia Bank of North
Carolina, N.A. (collectively, the "Proposed Bank").  Section 2.02 of the 
Proposed Credit Agreement generally requires that Notices of Borrowing be given
at least 3 Euro-Dollar Business Days before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing.  The 
Borrower would like to have the opportunity to obtain Euro-Dollar Borrowings 
on the Closing Date for the initial [Revolver Loan advance] [Term Loan 
Advance], but could of course not comply with such notice provisions with 
respect thereto.

          The Borrower hereby requests that the Agent and the Proposed Bank, on
a one-time basis only, waive the aforesaid notice provisions, and permit the
Borrower to obtain Euro-Dollar Borrowings on the Closing Date in such amounts, 
and for such Interest Periods, as have been agreed to by the Borrower and the 
Agent and notified to the Proposed Bank (the "Agreed Initial Closing Date 
Euro-Dollar Borrowings") by September 8, 1995 (the "Proposed Closing Date"), and
in consideration thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the 
receipt of which hereby is acknowledged, to pay to and indemnify and hold 
harmless each of the Proposed Bank with respect to such amount or amounts as 
shall compensate the Proposed Bank for any loss, cost or expense incurred by 
the Proposed Bank as a result of any failure of (i) the Proposed Credit 
Facilities to close, or (ii) Borrowers to borrow any of the Agreed Initial 
Closing Date Euro-Dollar Rate Borrowings on the Proposed Closing Date.

          This indemnification letter is executed and delivered to Wachovia Bank
of Georgia, N.A. as proposed Agent under the Proposed Credit Facilities, but for
the benefit of the Proposed Bank, and the Proposed Bank shall be entitled to 
rely on and directly enforce the terms and provisions hereof.  

                              Sincerely, 

                              TRION, INC.

         waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower
         under the Credit Agreement, any Note, or any other Loan Document,
         by operation of law or otherwise or any obligation of any other
         guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

         of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason related to the
         Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other Guaranty,
         or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to
         prohibit the payment by the Borrower, or any other Guarantor or any
         other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of the principal of
         or interest on any Note or any other amount payable by the Borrower
         under the Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other Loan Document;
         or

                  (vii)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any
         kind by the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other guarantor of
         the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent, any Bank or any other Person
         or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the
         provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable
         discharge of the Guarantors' obligations hereunder.

shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such
time.

             SECTION 7.  Waiver of Notice by the Guarantors.  The Guarantors
irrevocably waive acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the

payment of any amount payable by the Principal under the Credit Agreement, any
Note or any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other
Loan Document shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder

                      FORM OF CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

                          CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

             THIS CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as
of September 8, 1995 by and among Trion, Inc. (the "Borrower") and [insert
names of Significant Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date], each a [North
Carolina] corporation (each a "Subsidiary Guarantor", and collectively, the
"Subsidiary Guarantors"), which terms shall include any Significant Subsidiary
of the Borrower which becomes a Guarantor pursuant to the last paragraph
hereof, Section 15 of the Guaranty referred to below and Section 5.23 of the
Credit Agreement referred to below)).  The Borrower and each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors are sometimes hereinafter referred to individually as a
"Contributing Party" and collectively as the "Contributing Parties").

                           W I T N E S S E T H:

             WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of
even date herewith among the Borrower, the Banks party thereto and Wachovia
Bank of Georgia, N.A., as Agent (such agreement, as the same may from time to
time be amended, modified, restated or extended, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Credit Agreement"; capitalized terms used herein shall have the
meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement), the Banks have agreed to
extend financial accommodations to the Borrower;

             WHEREAS, as a condition, among others, to the  willingness of the
Agent and the Banks to enter into the Credit Agreement, they have required
that each Subsidiary Guarantor, along with the Borrower, execute and deliver
that certain Guaranty, dated as of even date herewith (such agreement, as the
same may from time to time be amended, modified, restated or extended, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranty"), pursuant to which, among other
things, the Subsidiary Guarantors have jointly and severally agreed to
guarantee the "Guaranteed Obligations" (as defined in the Guaranty); and 

             WHEREAS, each Subsidiary Guarantor is a direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Borrower and is engaged in businesses related to those of
the Borrower and each other Subsidiary Guarantor, and each of the Subsidiary
Guarantors will derive direct or indirect economic benefit from the
effectiveness and existence of the Credit Agreement;

             NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants
hereinafter contained, and to induce each Subsidiary Guarantor to enter into
the Guaranty, it is agreed as follows:

             To the extent that any Subsidiary Guarantor shall, under the
Guaranty, make a payment (a "Subsidiary Guarantor Payment") of a portion of
the Guaranteed Obligations, then, without limiting its rights of subrogation
against the principal, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to
contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other
Contributing Parties in an amount, for each such Contributing Party, equal to
a fraction of such Subsidiary Guarantor Payment, the numerator of which
fraction is such Contributing Party's Allocable Amount and the denominator of
which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Contributing Parties.

             As of any date of determination, the "Allocable Amount" of each
Contributing Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability which
could be asserted against such Contributing Party hereunder with respect to
the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor Payment without (i) rendering such
Contributing Party "insolvent" within the meaning of Section 101(31) of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") or Section 2 of either the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (the "UFTA") or the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act (the "UFCA"), (ii) leaving such Contributing Party with
unreasonably small capital, within the meaning of Section 548 of the
Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (iii)
leaving such Contributing Party unable to pay its debts as they become due
within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the
UFTA or Section 6 of the UFCA.

             This Agreement is intended only to define the relative rights of
the Contributing Parties, and nothing set forth in this Agreement is intended
to or shall impair the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and
severally, to pay any amounts, as and when the same shall become due and
payable in accordance with the terms of the Guaranty.

             The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and
indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets in favor of each Subsidiary
Guarantor to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.

             This Agreement shall become effective upon its execution by each of
the Contributing Parties and shall continue in full force and effect and may
not be terminated or otherwise revoked by any Contributing Party until all of
the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full (in
lawful money of the United States of America) and discharged and the Credit
Agreement and financing arrangements evidenced and governed by the Credit
Agreement shall have been terminated.  Each Contributing Party agrees that if,
notwithstanding the foregoing, such Contributing Party shall have any right
under applicable law to terminate or revoke this Agreement, and such
Contributing Party shall attempt to exercise such right, then such termination
or revocation shall not be effective until a written notice of such revocation
or termination, specifically referring hereto and signed by such Contributing
Party, is actually received by each of the other Contributing Parties and by
the Agent at its notice address set forth in the Credit Agreement.  Such
notice shall not affect the right or power of any Contributing Party to
enforce rights arising prior to receipt of such written notice by each of the
other Contributing Parties and the Agent.  If any Bank grants additional loans
to the Borrower or takes other action giving rise to additional Guaranteed
Obligations after any Contributing Party has exercised any right to terminate
or revoke this Agreement but before the Agent receives such written notice,
the rights of each other Contributing Party to contribution and
indemnification hereunder in connection with any Subsidiary Guarantor Payments
made with respect to such loans or Guaranteed  Obligations shall be the same
as if such termination or revocation had not occurred.

             Section 5.23 of the Credit Agreement provides that any Subsidiary
which is or becomes a Significant Subsidiaries must become a Guarantor, by,
among other things, executing and delivering to the Agent a counterpart of the
Guaranty and of this Contribution Agreement.  Any Significant Subsidiary which
executes and delivers to the Agent a counterpart of the Guaranty and of this
Contribution Agreement shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes
hereunder.   Under certain circumstances described in paragraph (b) of Section
5.22 of the Credit Agreement, Guarantors which are to be sold may obtain from
the Agent a written release from the Guaranty pursuant to the provisions of
such sentence, and upon obtaining such written release, any such former
Guarantor shall no longer be a Subsidiary Guarantor or Contributing Party
hereunder, and such release shall automatically and without further action
constitute a release by each other Contributing Party of all obligations of
such Subsidiary hereunder.  The Borrower and each other Subsidiary Guarantor
consents and agrees to any such release and agrees that no such release shall
affect its obligations hereunder, except as to the former Guarantor so
released.<PAGE>
     
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Contributing Party has executed and
delivered this Agreement, under seal, as of the date first above written.

                                 EXHIBIT 10.1

                                                         December 15, 1995

     Trion, Inc.
                      1996 Management Incentive Plan



The Management Incentive Plan (MIP) is for Trion officers and other key staff
residing in the United States.  The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors (Committee) will administer the MIP with assistance from the Chief
Executive Officer.

The Committee shall determine annually those persons who will participate in
the MIP.  It is anticipated that only those executives who have a significant
and recurring impact on the Company's annual operating results will be
eligible.  Based on the present organizational structure, only officers and
other members of the management team will be eligible.

The MIP will be awarded if a minimum working capital hurdle rate is achieved
for the year.  This hurdle rate is defined as the twelve-month average of
inventory plus accounts receivable less accounts payable divided by the sales
volume.

The targeted incentive, as a percentage of base salary, will vary by position
and responsibility and may be changed by the Committee from one year to the
next or for organizational changes during the year.  Following are the current
relationships:
                                 Target
                                Incentive           Incentive Basis       
                                     
                                 Percent         Company       Individual
                                 of Base       Performance     Performance

President and CEO                  50%            100%             -
Vice Presidents Sales/Marketing    50%             35%            65%   
Vice Presidents                    35%             85%            15%
Members of management team         20%             80%            20%


Company performance (consolidated) will be measured and weighted as follows:

                           Net sales               40%      
                           Income before Taxes     60%

Each objective will be established annually at the beginning of the year.

Individual performance goals will be established by the officer responsible
and the individual after discussions and analyses of current requirements. 
Individual goals will be set to enhance achievement of Company goals and will
be weighted accordingly.

The incentive related to each element of the Company's performance will be
earned as follows:

                                     Percentage of
               Attainment           Incentive Earned

               Threshold                   0%
               Target                    100%
               Maximum                   150%

The amount of incentive earned will be prorated for actual performance between
the threshold and maximum levels.

Performance targets will be established annually at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer.  

Acquisitions made in 1996 are not included.

Extraordinary or unusual events will be excluded from measurement of the
Company and individual performances.  The Committee will determine the events
considered extraordinary or unusual and will use generally accepted accounting
principles as a guideline in the determination.

It is anticipated that the incentive will be paid to participants annually
after completion of the audit by independent accountants.  If employment is
terminated by reason of death, disability or retirement during the plan year,
the participant will receive a pro rata share of the incentive earned for the
year.  For determining the pro rata share, months employed during the year
will be rounded up to the next highest full month.  If a participant's
employment is terminated during the plan year for any other reason, pro rata
payment of the incentive will be at the sole discretion of the Committee.

     Cause.  Any such Stock Options that are not exercised within three
     months of the Date of Termination shall expire, and in no event may any

     the extent all or any part of the Stock Options were exercisable as of

     representatives to exercise the Stock Options shall expire one year from

Paragraph 12, that the term of this Amended and Restated Agreement shall not
be so extended.

2.  Duties.  During the period of employment as provided in Paragraph 1
hereof, the Executive shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company and perform all duties consistent with such positions at the
direction of the Board.  In addition, the Executive shall serve as a member of
the Board (and of any committees thereof to which the Executive is appointed). 
The Executive shall devote his entire time during reasonable business hours
(reasonable sick leave and vacations excepted) and best efforts to fulfill
faithfully, responsibly and satisfactorily his duties hereunder.

3.  Base Salary.  For services performed by the Executive for the
Company pursuant to this Amended and Restated Agreement during the period of
employment as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, the Company shall pay the
Executive a base salary of at least $190,000 per year (the "Base Salary"),
subject to review and adjustment by the Board or the Committee and payable in
accordance with the Company's regular practices.  Any compensation which may
be paid to the Executive under any additional compensation or incentive plan
of the Company or which may be otherwise authorized from time to time by the
Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall be in addition to the Base
Salary to which the Executive shall be entitled under this Amended and
Restated Agreement.

4.  Other Benefits.  In addition to the Base Salary to be paid to the
Executive pursuant to Paragraph 3 hereof, the Executive shall also be entitled
to the following:

          (a)  Participation in Plans.  The Executive shall be eligible for
participation in any bonus, incentive, stock option or similar plan or program
now in effect or hereafter established by the Company in the same manner and
to the same extent as, and subject to the same criteria pertaining to, other
senior executives of the Company.  To the extent he is otherwise qualified to
do so, the Executive shall also participate in the various retirement, benefit
and other plans maintained in force by the Company from time to time. 

          (b)  Fringe Benefits.  The Executive shall be entitled to

provisions of this Paragraph 5, the Company shall continue to employ the
Executive and the Executive shall remain employed by the Company during the
entire term of this Amended and Restated Agreement as set forth in Paragraph
1.  Paragraph 6 hereof sets forth certain obligations of the Company in the
event that the Executive's employment hereunder is terminated.  Certain
capitalized terms used in this Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 6 hereof are defined
in Paragraph 5(c) below.

          (a)  Death or Disability.  Except to the extent otherwise
expressly stated herein, this Amended and Restated Agreement shall terminate
immediately as of the Date of Termination in the event of the Executive's
death or in the event that the Executive becomes disabled.  The Executive will
be deemed to be disabled upon the earlier of (i) the end of a six (6)
consecutive month period during which, by reason of physical or mental injury
or disease, the Executive has been unable to perform substantially the
Executive's usual and customary duties under this Amended and Restated
Agreement and (ii) the date that the Board determines, on the basis of such
evidence as it may reasonably deem sufficient, that the Executive will, by
reason of physical or mental injury or disease, be unable to perform
substantially the Executive's usual and customary duties under this Amended
and Restated Agreement for a period of at least six (6) consecutive months. 
The Board shall promptly give the Executive written notice of any such
determination of the Executive's disability and of its decision to terminate
the Executive's employment by reason thereof.  In the event of disability,
until the Date of Termination the Base Salary payable to the Executive under
Paragraph 3 hereof shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of
disability benefits, if any, paid to the Executive in accordance with any
disability policy or program of the Company. 

          (b)  Discharge for Cause.  The Board may discharge the Executive
from his employment hereunder for Cause.  Any discharge of the Executive by
the Board for Cause shall be communicated in writing to the Executive in

          (c)  Definitions.  For purposes of this Paragraph 5 and Paragraph
6 hereof, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth
below:

               (i) "Accrued Obligations" shall mean, as of the Date of 
Termination, the sum of (A) the Executive's Base Salary under Paragraph 
3 through the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (B) 
the amount of any bonus, incentive compensation, deferred compensation and 
other cash compensation accrued by the Executive as of the Date of

expense reimbursements and other cash entitlements accrued by the Executive 
as of the Date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid.

               (ii) "Cause" shall mean conviction of the Executive of
(or a plea of no contest with respect to) a felony or a misdemeanor involving
moral turpitude or a determination by the Board or the Committee that the
Executive has engaged in serious misconduct (such as dishonesty,
insubordination, willful failure to perform a material or significant portion
of his duties or other act or omission materially detrimental to the business
or reputation of the Company or materially damaging to the relationships of
the Company with its customers, suppliers or employees).

               (iii) "Date of Termination" shall mean (A) in the event of a 
discharge of the Executive by the Board or a resignation by the Executive, 
the date the Executive (in the case of discharge) or the Company (in the case
of resignation) receives written notice of such termination of employment or any
later date specified therein (which date shall be not more than fifteen (15)
days after the giving of such notice), (B) in the event of the Executive's
death, the date of the Executive's death, and (C) in the event of termination
of the Executive's employment by reason of disability pursuant to Paragraph

Company of the Executive's employment for Cause pursuant to Paragraph 5(b).

               (v)  "Termination Without Cause" shall mean (x) a discharge by 
the Company of the Executive from his employment without Cause or (y) any
voluntary or involuntary termination of the Executive's employment, other than
a Discharge for Cause, within one (1) year after the occurrence of any of the
following:

                     (A)  A substantial reduction in the Base Salary under 
                Paragraph 3, benefits or perquisites provided the Executive;

                     (B)  A substantial reduction in the Executive's 
                responsibilities, authorities or functions; or

                     (C)  Any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy 
                Paragraph 11(c) of this Amended and Restated Agreement.

                     (D)  The giving of notice to the Executive
                by the Company, pursuant to Paragraph 1, that the term of this
                Amended and Restated Agreement shall not be extended in 
                accordance with Paragraph 1.


6.  Obligations of the Company Upon Termination.

              (a)  Death, Disability, Resignation (Other Than a Resignation
Constituting a Termination Without Cause) or Discharge For Cause.  If the
Executive's employment with the Company terminates because of death,
disability, resignation (other than a resignation constituting a Termination
Without Cause) or a Discharge For Cause:

                   (i) the Company shall pay to the Executive all Accrued 
Obligations in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of 
Termination; and 

                   (ii) the Executive shall be entitled to receive all benefits 
accrued by him as of the Date of Termination under the Company's retirement,
incentive, or other benefit plans in which the Executive was participating as
of the Date of Termination, including accrued benefits payable by reason of
the Executive's death or disability, if applicable (but only to the extent not
previously paid or distributed to the Executive) in such manner and at such
time as are provided under the terms of such plans and arrangements; and

                   (iii)  except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 16 hereof, 
all other obligations of the Company hereunder shall cease forthwith.

              (b)  Termination Without Cause.  In the event of a Termination 
Without Cause (other than in the case of disability):

                  (i) the Company shall pay all Accrued Obligations to the 
Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of 
Termination; and 

                  (ii)  the product of two (2) times the highest Base Salary
during the term of this Amended and Restated Agreement, shall be paid to the
Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days after the Date of
Termination; and 

                  (iii)  an incentive bonus equal to the full "Target Award" 
fixed for the Executive for the then current fiscal year multiplied by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the then current 
fiscal year through the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is 365,
shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days 
after the Date of Termination; and 

                  (iv)  for a period of two (2) years, the Company shall arrange
to provide the Executive, at the Company's cost, with life, disability and
health-and-accident insurance coverage providing substantially similar
benefits to those which the Executive was receiving immediately prior to the
Date of Termination, to the extent the Company continues to maintain benefit
plans providing for such benefits for executives generally; provided, however,
that the Company may cease providing such benefits at such time as the
Executive is provided with substantially equivalent benefits by another
employer; and 

                  (v)  the Executive shall be entitled to receive all benefits 
accrued by him as of the Date of Termination under the Company's retirement, 
incentive or other benefit plans in which the Executive was participating as of 
the Date of Termination (but only to the extent not previously paid or 
distributed to the Executive) in such manner and at such time as are provided 
under the terms of such plans; and

                  (vi)  except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 16 hereof, all
other obligations of the Company hereunder shall cease forthwith.

             (d)  Limitation on Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any 
other provision of this Amended and Restated Agreement to the contrary, if tax
counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to the Executive determines
that any portion of any payment under this Amended and Restated Agreement
would constitute an "excess parachute payment," then the payments to be made
to the Executive under this Amended and Restated Agreement shall be reduced
(but not below zero) such that the value of the aggregate payments that the
Executive is entitled to receive under this Amended and Restated Agreement and
any other agreement or plan or program of the Company shall be one dollar ($1)
less than the maximum amount of payments which the Executive may receive
without becoming subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply
in the event that such tax counsel determines that the benefits to the
Executive under this Amended and Restated Agreement on an after-tax basis
(i.e., after federal, state and local income and excise taxes) if such
limitation is not applied would exceed the after-tax benefits to the Executive
if such limitation is applied.

7.  Indemnification.  The Company shall defend and hold the Executive harmless
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with any
claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to
performance by the Executive of services for, or action of the Executive as a
Director, officer or employee of the Company, or of any other person or
enterprise for which the Executive serves or acts in such capacity at the
request of the Company.  Expenses incurred by the Executive in defending a
claim, action, suit or investigation or criminal proceeding shall be paid by
the Company in advance of the final disposition thereof upon the receipt by
the Company of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Executive to repay said
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Executive is not entitled
to be indemnified hereunder.  The foregoing shall be in addition to any
indemnification rights the Executive may have by law, contract, charter, by-
law or otherwise.

8.  Restriction on Competition.  While the Executive is employed by the
Company, and for a period of two years following the termination of the
Executive's employment by reason of (a) his resignation (other than a
resignation constituting a Termination Without Cause) or (b) a Discharge For
Cause, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, whether as an owner of
10% or more of the equity interests, officer, director, employee, consultant,
or agent, work for or participate in the activities of any firm or person
engaged in the sale or manufacture of products competing with those of the
Company.

9.  Confidential Information.  The Executive will not, during or after
the term of this Amended and Restated Agreement, disclose to any firm or
person any information, except as otherwise required by law, including but not
limited to information about the Company, its affiliates and its customers,
that is treated as confidential by the Company or an affiliate, to which the
Executive has gained or gains access by reason of his position as an employee
of the Company or of an affiliate of the Company.  Except as otherwise
required by law, the Company will not, without the Executive's written
consent, disclose to any person any personal or confidential information about
the Executive.

10. Right to Injunctive Relief.  The Executive acknowledges that the
