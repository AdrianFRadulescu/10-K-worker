                           Description of Specific
                           Publishing Businesses
                           -----------------------

Waverly publishes periodicals,  books and electronic media to
the health care market.  Products are sold to students and
schools in medicine and other health care programs,
practitioners, pharmaceutical firms, health care institutions,
medical equipment companies, as well as other firms in the
general information and publishing business.

A.  Periodical Publishing
- -------------------------
The Company publishes periodicals under the trade name of
Williams & Wilkins  (  "W&W"  ) .  The Company considers itself
to be a leading publisher in the fields of medicine, allied
health, and related disciplines.  Although there does not exist
an official source of market statistics to verify market share,
the Company believes that it ranks within the top five medical
publishers in the United States.

Waverly publishes periodicals for major medical and scientific
societies  (" society publishing ") with whom they jointly share
in certain editorial and publishing responsibilities.  Profits
from each periodical are shared by the Company and the society
as dictated by the contract terms.  The majority of these
publications are linked to prestigious international
organizations including the American Urological Association, 
the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and
the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.  The Company typically
works under long-term contracts with these organizations ( three
to five years in duration ) .  Waverly has been successful over
the years in renewing such contracts.  Its average retention
rate over the last ten years is in excess of 75%.  Some of the
societies have contracted with the Company for over twenty-five
years.  The Company currently publishes 48 society periodicals. 
Waverly believes that the relationship with the medical
associations and their members are an important link in its
ability to attract new authors for  its periodical publications
as well as for its book and electronic publishing programs.  The
Company also publishes periodicals which are directly owned by
Waverly ( " proprietary periodicals " ) .  In 1995, Waverly
published 26 such periodicals. 

In 1980 the Company published 36 periodicals compared to the
current roster of 79 publications.  Circulation of subscription
based periodicals ranges from 500 for new or narrowly
specialized publications to over 20,000 for leading publications
in broader based disciplines.  Approximately 20% of the
subscribers are located in foreign countries.

Approximately 65% of the periodicals are published for
subscribers in the fields of medicine, including disciplines
such as obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, nephrology,
urology, anesthesia and neurology.  The remaining 35% of the
publications are directed at the fields of allied health,
including nursing, physical and respiratory therapy, audiology
and chiropractic.

Historically, more than 75% of the subscribers to periodicals
renew their subscriptions.  The Company uses both direct mail
campaigns as well as independent subscription agents throughout
the world  to secure renewals.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994
the Company's paid subscriber base was approximately 385,000 and
377,000 respectively.

Revenues generated from periodical publishing come from three
principal sources.  Subscription fees account for approximately
60% of the total.  Advertising revenues, principally from 


Page 3 of 46
<PAGE>

pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturers, contribute
approximately 20% of the total.  The remaining 20% is derived
from sales of reprint articles, mail lists, annual bound volumes
and special supplement insert issues from pharmaceutical firms. 
The Company publishes four periodicals ( commonly referred to as
"controlled circulation" journals ) which rely entirely on
advertising revenue for its income source.

B.  Book Publishing
- -------------------

1. General Information

The Company publishes and distributes world-wide over 1,300
titles to students, practitioners, institutions and health care
firms.  Although no firm industry statistics are available, the
Company believes that it is one of the top ten  medical book
publishers in the world.

In the United States,  the Company publishes principally under
the name of Williams & Wilkins although certain other trade
names are used where there is a strategic advantage to do so. 
Other tradenames used include Lea & Febiger, National Medical
Series, and Stedman's Word Book Series.  In Munich, Germany the
Company owns a publishing firm which operates under the trade
name Urban & Schwarzenberg. 

The Company publishes approximately 45% of its titles for the
student marketplace while the remaining 55% of titles are
directed to medical practitioners and others engaged in the
health care industry.  Over the years the Company has
successfully built a base of product that continues in updated
revised editions.  It is not uncommon for some titles to
continue for 10-15 years and beyond its initial publication,
particularly for subjects in basic sciences,  atlases  and
dictionary books. In 1995 approximately 40% of the Company's
book products have extended beyond the first edition life cycle. 

The Company publishes approximately 900 English language books
and 400 German language books.  On average,  the Company
introduces annually 150 - 200 new titles or new editions of
existing titles ( commonly referred to as frontlist titles ) .
During the past three years, book publishing revenues consist of
approximately 30% frontlist titles, 55% backlist titles and 15%
from special sales to the pharmaceutical industry.

2.  Marketing & Distribution

In the United States the Company markets and distributes its
publications through several sources including direct mail,
telemarketing, field sales forces and independent distributors.

The Company promotes and distributes its English language
products to international markets through a separate dedicated
division.  The division maintains offices in Baltimore, London,
Paris,  Buenos Aires , Hong Kong and Bangkok.  In addition, the
Company is a partner in two distribution companies located in
Sydney, Australia , Tokyo, Japan. 

The Company promotes and distributes German language
publications through direct mail, bookstores, and commissioned
sales agents.  In addition, the Company owns a  direct mail
order firm in Munich, Germany which sells medical and scientific
books of varied subject matter to professionals and
non-professionals. The Company also operates  a publishing firm
in Wroclaw, Poland to translate both English and German language books
into the local language. 

Page 4 of 46
<PAGE>

The  Company participates in a number of co-publishing ventures
with foreign publishers located in South America,  Europe, Asia
and the Middle East to translate the Company's English language
titles into local language.  Under these arrangements the
Company retains ownership rights to the translated titles. 
Separately,  the Company also sells outright translation rights
to certain book titles.  At this time over 450 titles have been
translated into non-English language versions.

C. Electronic Media Publishing
- ------------------------------
The Professional Learning System Division ( " PLS "  ) 
publishes  non-print products for use in education, training and
productivity improvement for students and practitioners in
nursing, medicine and professionals in health care related
industries.  Products are marketed under various  the trade
names including  Williams & Wilkins ,  Medi-Sim, Stedman Words,
and de'MEDICI.

Approximately 400 non-print products are sold in various types
of formats including software, video, computer assisted
instruction ( CAI ), interactive video disc and CD ROM formats. 
The Company develops original products for electronic format and
in certain cases will convert existing print product into
electronic format for sale. 

The Company also participates in certain development and
distribution projects with other firms to share in technology
and market expertise.  

The Company believes that the non-print product demand will
increase rapidly over the next several years . The Company
believes it is a leader in the medical publishing industry for
providing such non-print products.

D.  Competition in Medical Publishing
- -------------------------------------
Medical publishing is a highly competitive business. While there
is no conclusive marketing data available to rely on, it is
reasonable to ascertain that  approximately 10 -15 medical
publishing firms control over 70% of the global medical
publishing marketplace.  There are well over 100 smaller 
publishing firms that publish for a narrowly targeted audience
of medical professionals. 

Over the past twenty years a number of  large  publishing firms,
not previously engaged in medical publishing, have entered the
marketplace  through the acquisitions of one or more  medical
publishing firms. The principal competitors of the Company are
owned by larger corporations with substantial financial
resources who engage in broad range of  publishing activities.

The Company believes that it can compete effectively in the
current market environment.  Key competitive industry
capabilities continue to be the ability  (1) to correctly
identify educational, training , and other professional learning
needs of the customer,  (2)  to attract quality authors and acquire and
develop valuable publication properties,   (3) to publish 
products faster and cheaper, particularly through evolving
electronic processes, (4)  effectively   market and distribute
products throughout the world.

As is common in the publishing business, substantially all of
the Company's books and periodicals are protected by copyrights.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
         Condition and Results of Operations
- ----------------------------------------------------------

Results of Operations
- ---------------------
In 1995, the Company's earnings improved significantly over
1994. While 1994 was a rebound year from the loss recorded in
1993 following the sale of the Printing Division, 1995 reflects
the full year impact of restructuring initiatives started two
years ago to streamline publishing operations and expand new
product development. In 1995, revenues and earnings were at
record levels. Growth in both domestic and international markets
was spurred by a 15% increase in the number of new publications
while indirect costs of doing business grew at a slower rate. As
a result, operating profit margins nearly doubled from the prior
year.

From late 1994 and in 1995, the Company invested approximately
$8.0 million to acquire three companies and two publications
that will broaden its customer base and expand its international
operations.


Page 9 of  46
<PAGE>

The Company continues to enjoy a strong foothold in the global
health care publishing marketplace. While year-to-year
introductions of new products tend not always to move in even
patterns, the Company expects in 1996 to show continued revenue
and income growth, albeit not at the rate enjoyed in 1995.

1995 COMPARED WITH 1994
- -----------------------
Company revenues for 1995 totaled $156.1 million, an increase of
$24.2 million, or 18%, compared with 1994. The Company's three
major business segments all produced increases over the prior
year. Book Publishing revenues were $98.0 million in 1995
compared with $78.7 million in 1994, an increase of 24%. Growth
in revenues was spurred by a greater number of new products
published, 229 compared with 181 titles published in 1994. In
particular, the Company published the 26th edition of the
classic Stedmans Medical Dictionary, one of its all-time best
sellers, which produced revenues in excess of $2.0 million.
Acquisitions in late 1994 and during 1995 added $4.0 million
dollars to revenues. International sales, which provide nearly
60% of book revenues, rose 29% over the prior year. Export sales
of English language books increased 16% and sales of German
language books climbed 34%. Currency valuations in European
operations inflated year-to-year comparisons by approximately 5%.

Periodical Publishing revenues were $52.1 million in 1995
compared with $48.2 million in 1994, an increase of 8%. The
Company published 77 periodicals in 1995 compared with 72 in
1994. Circulation, a measurement of the health of the portfolio,
increased 6% over the prior year. The increase in revenue came
mainly from the addition of 5 new publications and a 13%
increase in advertising-related business. Professional Learning
Systems Division (PLS) (formerly Electronic Media) revenues  in
1995 increased 19% over 1994. Gains in revenues came from new
software products and new releases of previously successful
products and the partial year inclusion of de'Medici, a
hospital-based interactive training system.

Cost of sales was $94.4 million in 1995 compared with $82.4
million in 1994, an increase of 15%. As a percentage of sales,
costs were 60.5% in 1995 and 62.5% in 1994. Cost margins for
Book Publishing were 58.6% in 1995 compared with 61.4% in 1994.
Improvements were achieved through more stringent and
competitive pricing for manufacturing services and efficiency
gains from greater output. Periodical Publishing cost margins
were 69.9% in 1995 compared with 68.2% in 1994. Paper price
increases during the first half of the year was the principal
factor in the year-to-year change. PLS cost margin was 46.7% in
1995 compared with 49.8% in 1994.

Selling and distribution expenses were $36.7 million in 1995 and
$29.8 million in 1994, an increase of 23%. As a percentage of
sales, expenses were 23.5% in 1995 and 22.5% in 1994. Expenses
increased because of planned expansion in the marketing and
sales forces, new investments in customer service systems, and
higher promotion expenditures for the heavy fourth quarter
publication schedule, which should benefit future periods.

General and administrative expenses were $12.3 million in 1995
and $12.1 million in 1994. As a percentage of sales, expenses
were 7.9% in 1995 and 9.2% in 1994. Expenses grew slower than
the rate of sales increase due to the full-year impact of staff
reductions initiated in 1994, lower health care costs per
employee, and the benefit of economic efficiencies attributed to
the higher volume of business.

Page 10 of  46
<PAGE>

Other income was $1.35 million in 1995 and $1.32 million in
1994. Interest earned on invested cash was down from the prior
year due to use of cash for acquisitions. Miscellaneous income
from various other sources including rental income and
management fees increased over last year. Interest expense was
$1.2 million for both years. Interest on long-term debt
decreased due to principal repayments but additional interest
was paid on completion of prior-year tax audits.

Equity in earnings of affiliated entities was $316,000 in 1995
compared with $2.8 million in 1994. Included in last year's
earnings was a gain of approximately $2.5 from the sale of a 48%
minority-owned investment in Urban & Vogel, a German language,
controlled circulation magazine publisher. 

Income taxes were $2.6 million in 1995 and $1.2 million in 1994.
The effective tax rate was 33.9% in 1995 and 35.0% in 1994.

Income from continuing operations was $5.3 million, or $1.15 per
share, in 1995 compared with $4.9 million, or $1.12 per share,
in 1994. Excluding the effect of Urban & Vogel, discussed
previously, earnings in 1994 were $0.62 per share. The
significant year-to-year increase in the ongoing operations of
the Company is a result of initiatives taken over the past two
years to expand new product introductions, further penetrate
foreign markets, and increase operating efficiencies.

During 1994 the Company recorded an additional charge of
$228,000, or $0.05 per share, to discontinued operations to
reflect the final measurement of the loss on the 1993 sale of
the Printing Division.

Net income was $5.3 million, or $1.15 per share, in 1995
compared with $4.7 million, or $1.07 per share, in 1994.

1994 COMPARED WITH 1993
- -----------------------
Revenues in 1994 were $131.9 million compared with $121.7
million in 1993, an increase of 8.4%, or $10.2 million. Global
Book Publishing sales increased $9.2 million over 1993,
representing 90% of the increase. Approximately $5.0 million, or
54%, of the global Book Publishing increase comes from the
Company's German subsidiary, Urban & Schwarzenberg, due mainly
to more new titles published during 1994 than published during
1993. An additional $1.4 million, or 15%, of the increase came
from the Company's international export markets, particularly
through the Company's European subsidiary, Waverly Europe, which
also benefited from the recorded revenues from the recently acquired French
publisher, Editions Pradel. The remaining $2.8 million, or 31%, of the total
book sales improvement came from domestic operations, owing to a stronger
publication schedule. Electronic media sales increased $0.8
million, or 19.4%, over a year ago due to a greater number of
new software and video products introduced during the year. The
remaining $0.2 million of the overall Company sales increase
came from Periodical Publishing. Subscription-based products
continued to expand but were offset by the continued softness in
pharmaceutical advertising revenue.

Cost of sales were $82.4 million in 1994 compared with $77.6
million in 1993, an increase of 6% compared with the revenue
increase of 8.4%. The cost of sales as a percentage of net sales
was 63% in 1994 compared with 64% in 1993. The profit margins in
both Periodical Publishing and 

Page 11 of  46
<PAGE>

electronic media are unchanged compared with those in 1993. The
profit margins in global book publishing improved across the
board. Production efficiencies are being realized from cost
savings from the restructuring, a higher volume of sales, and
improved margins on European sales.

Selling and distribution costs were $29.8 million in 1994
compared with $29.4 million in 1993, an increase of 1%. As a
percentage of sales, selling and distribution expenses have
reduced to 22.5% in 1994 compared with 24.1% a year ago. The
margin improvement is from savings associated with the
restructuring plan implemented in 1993 and lower direct
promotion expenses.

General and administrative expenses were $12.1 million in 1994
compared with $10.3 million a year ago, an increase of 18%. As a
percentage of sales, general and administrative costs were 9.2%
in 1994 compared with 8.4% in 1993. Incentive compensation
expenses of $1.2 million were awarded in 1994 to corporate and
Book Publishing groups not awarded in 1993. In addition, bad
debt expense and noncapitalizable costs associated with
installing a new customer fulfillment system contributed to the
increase in total expenses.

Depreciation and amortization costs in 1994 were $4.5 million
compared with $4.1 million a year ago, an increase of
approximately 5%. The increase was due mainly to higher
depreciation from computer equipment purchases. Amortization
charges were down slightly from a year ago. Additional
amortization associated with the recent acquisitions has been
offset by the expiration of amortization from earlier
acquisitions.

Total other income and expense netted to $126,000 of income in
1994 compared with $488,000 of expense in 1993, a change of
$614,000. This improvement was due mainly to higher investment
income and debt reduction due to the cash generated from the
sale of the Printing Division. In addition, the Company
benefited during the fourth quarter of 1994 from the cash
generated from the sale of the minority interest in Urban &
Vogel.

Equity in the earnings of affiliated entities was $2.8 million
of income compared with losses of $0.4 million, an improvement
of $3.2 million. $2.5 million of the improvement comes from the
net gain on the sale of the Company's 48% minority interest in
Urban & Vogel, a German language, controlled circulation magazine publisher.
The balance of the$0.7 million improvement was from higher earnings from
minority-owned affiliates in Germany, South America, and the Far
East.

Income (loss) from continuing operations in 1994 was $4.9
million, or $1.12 per share, compared with a loss of $2.6
million, or $0.60 per share, in 1993. As discussed above under
Results of Operations, the $7.5 million improvement in earnings
is due principally to three factors. Core publishing earnings
rose $2.1 million, owing to higher global book publishing sales
with added benefit from manufacturing efficiencies and cost
savings from the restructuring plan. Earnings from minority
interest in foreign affiliates rose $3.2 million, including a
$2.5 million gain from the sale of Urban & Vogel, previously
discussed. Finally, in 1993 the Company took a one-time
after-tax charge of $2.2 million to recognize costs associated
with the publishing group consolidation and facility relocation.

During 1994, the Company recorded to discontinued operations an
additional loss of  $228,000, or $.05 per share, to reflect
final measurement of the sale. 

Page 12 of  46
<PAGE>

Net income was $4.7 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with a
net loss of $2.0 million, or ($0.46) per share, a year ago. 1993
included publishing losses of $2.6 million offset by $0.6
million of discontinued operation earnings.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -------------------------------
Cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 million at December 31, 1995
compared with $9.6 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively. In 1995, net income adjusted for noncash
items was $12.0 million compared with $5.4 million in 1994 and
$3.1 million in 1993. Cash generated in 1995 was used to support
continuing operations. Working capital, excluding cash,
increased $11.5 million, principally to support a higher level
of inventory resulting from a greater number of titles published
in 1995, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. In
addition, receivables increased $3.1 million due to an 18%
increase in year-to-year sales.

The Company's financing and investing activities generated
approximately $11.3 million of cash. Cash was generated from the
liquidation of $9.3 million of short-term marketable securities,
$1.1 million through exercise of stock options, and $1.0 million
from the final installment payment on the Printing Division sale
consummated in 1993. The cash was used to acquire business and
publishing properties amounting to $6.3 million, purchase
property and equipment of $4.9 million including $1.9 million
spent on building and office furnishings for the Company's new
corporate headquarters, pay dividends of $2.1 million, and
reduce bank debt by $3.2 million.

The Company maintains bank lines of $39.0 million worldwide.
There were short-term borrowings of $0.2 million at year end,
leaving a borrowing capacity of $38.8 million at December 31,
1995. The Company expects the bank lines to be sufficient to
finance operating activities in 1996 with a minimal short-term
borrowing balance at December 31, 1996. In addition, the Company
will retire $3.8 million of its long-term debt during 1996. The
Company guarantees various lines of credit, not to exceed $0.4 million
for the jointly owned affiliate, Mosby-Williams & Wilkins Pty., Ltd.

At December 31, 1995, the Company has recorded deferred tax
assets amounting to $6.4 million, due primarily to
postretirement benefit obligations and future inventory-related
deductions. Based on the Company's long-term earnings record and
projected future earnings, the deferred tax asset was recorded
free of any valuation allowance.

In 1996 the Company expects to invest $1.5 million for capital
expenditures, principally computer equipment and related
software, and $2.5 million for electronic product development.
In addition, the Company will likely appropriate $3.0 to $5.0
million for as yet unidentified acquisitions of publishing
properties and businesses during 1996.

In 1996 the Company expects cash flow from operations to be
adequate to fund capital investments, dividend payments, and
scheduled long-term debt retirements.

related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.  The consolidated financial

1994 and for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 were
audited by other auditors, whose report, dated February 22, 1995
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated

consolidated financial statements.
</TABLE>


Note 1  Business Operations
- ---------------------------
Waverly and its subsidiaries (the Company) are worldwide
publishers of print and electronic media in the fields of
medicine, allied health, and related health care disciplines.
Products are distributed worldwide and the Company has operating
offices in the United States and foreign locations.

Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------------------------------------

	Principles of Consolidation
 ---------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Three of the
Company's majority-owned subsidiaries have a November 30 year
end. Investments in companies where Waverly has less than a 50%
interest but can exercise significant influence are accounted
for under the equity method. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All
acquisitions of business and publishing properties have been
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

	Accounting Estimates
 --------------------
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	Reclassifications
 ------------------
Certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current
years presentation, and discontinued operations have been
separately identified for all periods presented.

	Revenue Recognition
	-------------------
Sales include the publication of books and periodicals for which
sales and related cost of sales are recognized when the book or
periodical issue is shipped to the customer. Over-copies of a
periodical issue are carried in inventory at no cost since the
entire manufacturing cost of a periodical issue is charged to
cost of sales when the issue is shipped. Subscription payments
received are deferred and recorded as income in the period in
which the related issue is shipped.

<PAGE>

	Cash Equivalents
	----------------
Cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid instruments with
original maturities of three months or less. The cost of these
investments is equivalent to fair value.



	Investments in Marketable Securities
	------------------------------------
The Company has invested its excess cash generally in
short-term, highly liquid municipal instruments that are highly
rated. The Company's securities are held for an unspecified
period of time and may be sold to meet liquidity needs. The
securities included as cash equivalents and marketable
securities are considered as available-for-sale as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Amortized costs of
marketable securities approximates market, therefore, no adjustment has been
made to shareholders equity as a result of changes in market value to
these securities.

	Inventories
 -----------
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Two
methods of determining costs are used: last-in, first-out (LIFO)
for domestic inventories and first-in, first-out (FIFO) for
foreign inventories. Such costs include raw materials and
subcontract composition and printing.

	Property and Equipment
	----------------------
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The cost and
accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold
are removed from the respective accounts, and gains or losses
are included in the determination of income.

Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method based on
the estimated service lives of the assets. Service lives range
from 10 to 35 years for buildings and improvements and from 2 to
10 years for computers, software, and equipment. Depreciation
charged to operations amounted to $2,296,000, $2,112,000, and
$1,897,000, for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Assets to Be Disposed Of,
effective January 1, 1996. The standard requires the Company to
review long-lived assets for the impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Adoption of this statement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
statements.

	Investment in Affiliated Entities
	---------------------------------
The Company has noncontrolling equity interests in various
affiliated entities. The equity method of accounting is used for
these investments.


Page 21 of  46
<PAGE>

	Electronic Product Development Costs
	------------------------------------
Electronic product development costs are capitalized when
incurred. Capitalization of electronic product development costs
begins upon the establishment of product feasibility. The
establishment of product feasibility and the ongoing assessment
of recoverability of capitalized electronic product development
costs require considerable judgment by management with respect
to certain external factors, including, but not limited to,
anticipated future revenues, estimated useful life and changes
in technology.

Amortization of capitalized electronic product development costs
is provided on a product-by-product basis using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
product. Amortization charged to operations amounted to
$802,000, $761,000, and $558,000, for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
respectively.

	Intangible Assets and Goodwill
	------------------------------
Subscription lists and noncompete agreements arising from
acquisitions are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives, periods ranging from 5 to 10 years.
Amortization charged to operations amounted to $310,000,
$332,000, and $460,000, for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

Publication agreements represent the fair value of the rights to
publish certain valuable publication titles acquired outright
and in business combinations. The agreements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the periods benefitted, ranging from 10
to 40 years. Amortization charged to operations amounted to
$1,456,000, $1,114,000, and $1,020,000, for 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively. 

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets of companies
acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the periods benefitted not exceeding 40
years. Amortization charged to operations amounted to $318,000,
$143,000, and $149,000, for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

The recoverability of publication agreements, goodwill, and
other intangible assets is assessed periodically and whenever
adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate
indicate that previously anticipated cash flows warrant a
reassessment. When such reassessments indicate the potential of
impairment, all business factors are considered and, if such
assets are not likely to be recovered from future operating cash
flows, they are written down to recoverable value for financial
reporting purposes.

	Concentrations of Business Risk
	-------------------------------
Other than accounts receivable from major U.S. medical book
distributors, which amounted to $11,175,000 and $9,369,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, the Company is not
subject to any significant credit risk from concentrations of
receivables or other assets in a particular customer group or
industry segment. The Company's products and services are used
generally by health care professionals and professional
societies throughout the world. In conjunction with the 1993
sale of the Printing Division, the Company entered into a
long-term 


Page 22 of  46
<PAGE>

contract with the purchaser to provide a substantial portion of
all printing services for its periodicals. Such services are
performed at two separate facilities. The Company believes that,
in the event of disruption of services, work in progress could
be transferred to other facilities without lengthy interruption
of production.

	Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share
	--------------------------------
The computation of earnings (loss) per common share in each year
is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. When dilutive, stock options are included as share
equivalents using the treasury stock method. The number of
weighted average shares used in computing the earnings (loss)
per share was 4,622,647, 4,359,653, and 4,337,498, for 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively. Earnings (losses) assuming full
dilution were not significantly different from the primary
amounts.

	Income Taxes
	------------
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year
end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable
to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the
period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

	Foreign Currency
	----------------
The assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries
whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are
translated at current rates of exchange. Income and expense
items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the
year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are
recorded directly into the foreign currency translation
component of shareholders equity. Gains and losses from
transactions denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in
operations.

Note 3  Investments in Affiliated Entities
- ------------------------------------------
The Company has noncontrolling interests in various affiliated
entities. The more significant investments are in Japan,
Australia, and Germany.

Effective October 26, 1994, the Company sold its interest in
Urban & Vogel GmbH (U&V), a 48%-owned publisher of
advertising-supported medical journals. As a result of this
sale, the Company recorded a gain of $2,485,000, net of tax. The
Company's equity in the losses of U&V for the period up to the
effective date of the sale has been recorded in the equity in
the earnings (losses) from the affiliated entities portion of
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Note 5  Restructuring and Facility Relocation Charges
- -----------------------------------------------------
During 1993, management decided to strategically consolidate
certain functions within the publishing and corporate operations
that resulted in a reduced workforce and to relocate its
facilities. Accordingly, the Company incurred a one-time charge
to operations of $3,572,000 primarily related to employee
separation costs and disposition of previously owned facilities.
The unpaid portion of these charges amounted to $534,000 and
$858,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The
balance at December 31, 1995 consists of employee separation
agreements to be paid through the year 2000.

=============================================================================

If the FIFO method of inventory had been used by the Company for
domestic inventory, the carrying value would have been $49,000
higher than reported at December 31, 1995 and $342,000 lower
than reported at December 31, 1994.

The Company regularly reviews its medical book inventories on a
title-by-title basis for salability. The cost of those books
determined to have impaired or no sales value is charged to
income in the period of determination. Charges to income
amounted to $2,422,000, $2,105,000, and $2,037,000, for 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively.

The Company has an uncollateralized senior term loan with a
lending institution that requires quarterly interest payments at
an interest rate of 9.09% per annum. The principal is payable in
ten semiannual payments of $1,200,000, which started in
September 1993. The provisions of the financing agreement
include restrictions, without prior written consent, to incur
additional borrowings, sell assets, pay cash dividends,
repurchase the Company's common stock, and enter into a merger
or consolidation with another company. In addition, the
financing agreement includes prepayment penalties. The Company's
German subsidiary has a loan of $1,390,000 with a 
lending institution at an annual rate of 5.9%. The loan is
collateralized by Company-owned real estate with a fair market
value in excess of the principal. The loan is due to be paid in
one installment on December 31, 1996. Estimated fair values of
debt obligations approximate the carrying value at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

each year reflects movements in temporary differences and
foreign currency translation adjustments. The net deferred tax
asset related to U.S. operations is considered to meet the test
of recoverability under FAS 109.

Set forth below is a reconciliation from the applicable U.S.
federal statutory tax expense (benefit) to the effective tax
rate for the years ended December 31:

No deferred taxes have been provided on the cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and
unconsolidated affiliated entities, as such amounts would not
result in any additional U.S. income taxes because of available
foreign tax credits.

The income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options
reduces taxes currently payable and is credited to additional
paid-in capital. The amount approximated $364,000 for 1995.

Cash outflows from operating activities include income taxes
paid of $603,000, $1,434,000, and $3,027,000, for 1995, 1994,
and 1993, respectively.


Note 9  Employee Benefit Plans
- ------------------------------

	Funded Pension Plan
 -------------------
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all U.S. employees. Plan benefits are determined
using a career average earnings formula. The Company's funding
policy is to contribute the amount necessary to insure that plan
assets meet current plan obligations. The projected benefit
obligations at December 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993 were determined
using assumed weighted average discount rates of 7.0%, 8.9%, and
7.0%, respectively. The assumed long-term rate of compensation
increase is 5.5% for 1995, 5.5% for 1994, and 6.0% for 1993. The
assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is 9% per year
for all periods presented. Mortality rates and turnover rates
were applied based on appropriate statistical tables and
applicable Company experience. A summary of cost components
included in the net periodic pension credit and the funded
status of the plan for the years ended December 31 is presented
as follows:

	Unfunded Pension Obligation
	---------------------------
Urban & Schwarzenberg provides supplementary retirement benefits
to three current and fifteen former employees. Such benefits are
payable monthly upon retirement at specified percentages of the
retirees highest achieved salary level. Upon the retirees death,
his or her spouse or other specified beneficiaries are entitled
to receive additional benefit payments. The actuarial present
value of such unfunded pension obligations is computed using an
interest rate of 7% per annum. The charge to income for 1995,
1994, and 1993 was $393,000, $242,000, and $203,000,
respectively.

	Savings Plan
	------------
The Company offers an employee savings plan qualifying under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan covers
substantially all U.S. employees with more than one year's
service. Employees are encouraged to make contributions to the
Plan. The Company will match 25% of such contributions up to a
maximum employee contribution of 6% of annual salary. In
addition, the Company, from time to time, may at its discretion
provide additional contributions to the Plan. The Company
incurred expenses of $207,000, $203,000, and $332,000, in 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively.


	Postretirement Benefits
	-----------------------
The Company provides certain health care benefits for retired
employees. Substantially all of the Company's U.S. retirees and
full-time employees are or become eligible for these benefits if
they meet minimum age and service requirements. The cost of
providing most of these benefits has been shared with retirees
in differing proportions based on length of service and
retirement date. Currently, this plan is unfunded and the
Company has no immediate plans for funding the liabilities;
however, the Company will continue to pay for retiree medical
claims incurred, which were $409,000, $445,000, and $463,000, in 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively. The effect of curtailment due to the Printing
Division sale in 1993 was to increase the liability by $247,000.

Summary information on the Company's postretirement benefit plan
at December 31, 1995, and 1994, is presented below:

Page 30 of  46
<PAGE>

The assumed weighted average discount rate used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) was
7.6%, 8.9%, and 7.8% in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively. The
assumed health care inflation rate used in measuring the APBO
was 11% in year one, declining gradually to 5% in the sixth year
and thereafter.

If the health care cost trend rate assumption were increased by
1%, the APBO as of December 31, 1995, would be increased by
approximately $591,000. The cost effect of this change on the
sum of the service cost and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1995 would be an
increase of approximately $43,000.


Note 10 Incentive Plans
- -----------------------
The Company has an incentive plan for virtually all employees
under which the amount available for bonuses is based on
achievement of profit targets and individual performance goals.
Compensation earned under the Plan was $1,350,000, $1,250,000,
and $157,000, for 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

The Company has two stock option plans at December 31, 1995: the
1984 Employee Stock Option Plan and the 1995 Employee Stock
Option Plan. Options can no longer be granted under the 1984
plan. 

Stock options granted under the 1984 plan which are outstanding
at December 31, 1995 are 50% exercisable one year after the date
of the grant, 75% exercisable two years after the grant date,
and exercisable in full on the third anniversary of the grant
date. The options expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant
date. 

The 1995 plan provides for the grant of Incentive Stock Options
and nonqualified options for up to 750,000 shares of common

In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS 123, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995, establishes financial
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee
compensation plans and for transactions in which an entity
issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from
nonemployees. SFAS 123 requires, among other things, that
compensation cost be calculated for fixed stock options at the
grant date by determining fair value using an option-pricing
model. The Company has the option of recognizing the
compensation cost over the vesting period as an expense in the
income statement or making pro forma disclosures in the notes to
the financial statements as to the effects on net income as if
the compensation cost had been recognized in the income
statement. The Company will adopt the pro forma disclosure
provisions of SFAS 123 at the beginning of fiscal year 1996.

                              Waverly, Inc.

                          1995 Annual Form 10-K

                              Exhibit 10(B)

           Agreement Between Waverly, Inc. and David J. Callard
           ----------------------------------------------------
Waverly, Inc. ("Waverly") and David J. Callard (DJC") have
discussed ways in which DJC will assist Waverly in 1996.  Such
assistance shall include working with senior management in the
following areas:  monthly review of 1996 results and plans as
well as longer range strategic plan for 1996-1998;  merger,
acquisition, joint venture, financing, recapitalization and
investment opportunities involving Waverly ("Waverly acquisition
and development opportunities" or "Waverly A&D");  and active
involvement in oversight of the Waverly business through
continued service as Chairman of the Executive Committee. 
Waverly and DJC wish to continue the retainer relationship which
has been renewed annually since 1990.

Waverly shall retain DJC as a financial and business advisor at
an annual compensation rate of $90,000 through March 31, 1996
and at an annual compensation rate of $50,000 thereafter; 
retainer payment shall be made quarterly in advance.  Waverly
and DJC will review quarterly the amount of time spent by DJC on
Waverly projects and mutually agree whether adjustment of the
retainer amount is appropriate for that quarter.  Waverly shall
reimburse all reasonable expenses incurred by DJC in carrying
out his duties under the retainer agreement.

Waverly shall, also, pay DJC for assistance with specific
Waverly A&D projects.  Such additional payments (contingent or
otherwise) will be determined by mutual at the outset of each
project and shall reflect the complexity and size of each
project and DJC's role.

Waverly shall have the right to determine whether it wants DJC
to have an active role in any Waverly A&D project.  DJC and
Waverly wish to ensure that Waverly does not become obligated to
pay double fees in any A&D transaction.  The parties shall
designate Waverly A&D projects in which DJC shall participate by
memorandum agreement which shall, also, describe such additional
compensation arrangements as are mutually acceptable.

The retainer arrangement set forth herein shall have a term of
one year from January 1, 1996.  Should DJC's future employment
result in his not being available to carry out his duties
hereunder, either party may terminate the retainer arrangement
with retainer compensation prorated to date of termination and
with additional compensation paid where DJC has substantially
completed work on a Waverly A&D opportunity which is closed
subsequent to termination.

This amended agreement represents the renewal provided for in
the November 1990 agreement with certain modifications which are
acceptable to both parties.
