Wallace Computer Services, Inc.                                 Fiscal 1994 10-K

                                     Part I

ITEM 1    BUSINESS

          As used in this report, the term "Company" is used to refer to the
          Registrant and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Visible Computer Supply
          Corporation.

          (a)  Developments

               The Registrant was organized in June, l963 as "Wallace Business
               Forms, Inc.", a Delaware corporation and is the successor to an
               Illinois corporation known as "Wallace Press, Inc." that was
               merged into the Registrant in August 1963.  To better reflect the
               nature of the Company's business, the Registrant changed its
               corporate name in November 1981 from "Wallace Business Forms,
               Inc." to "Wallace Computer Services, Inc.".

          (b)  Industry Segment

               The Company is engaged predominantly in the computer services and
               supply industry.  Wallace sells a broad line of products and
               services including business forms, commercial and promotional
               graphics printing, computer labels, machine ribbons, computer
               hardware and software, computer accessories, office products, and
               electronic forms.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

               (1)  Principal Products and Services

                    Principal products and services supplied by the Company
                    include the design, manufacture and sale of business forms,
                    industrial and consumer catalogs, directories and price
                    lists, pressure sensitive labels, computer and business
                    machine ribbons, a standard line of office products forms,
                    and direct mail promotional printing.  The Company also
                    markets computer accessory supplies, office supplies, and
                    computer hardware and software.

                    The only class of similar products that contributed 10% or
                    more of total sales for the past three years is printed
                    products.  The contribution of printed products to total
                    sales was 90% for fiscal 1994, 89% for fiscal 1993, and 89%
                    for fiscal 1992.

ITEM 1    Continued

               (2)  The principal raw material used by the Company is paper
                    which is purchased in the open market from numerous
                    suppliers in a variety of weights, widths, color and sizes.

                    The Company believes that it has adequate sources of supply
                    of raw materials to meet the requirements of its business.
                    The Company's current inventory levels are in line with the
                    inventory levels necessary to satisfy customer demand that
                    the Company anticipates for fiscal year 1995.

               (3)  Although certain features of the Company's products and
                    manufacturing processes are covered by owned or licensed
                    patents, the Company does not consider patents to be
                    critical to its business.

                    The Company believes that principal factors in its success
                    include its engineering, manufacturing, and distribution
                    capabilities.

               (4)  The tax forms product lines (which account for approximately
                    2% of consolidated net sales) are sold primarily in the
                    first six months of the Company's fiscal year.

               (5)  The Company continues to maintain a strong working capital
                    position, with a current ratio of 3.8 at July 31, 1994 (3.9
                    at July 31, 1993).  The Company funds its operating needs
                    through internally generated funds.  The Company has not
                    borrowed any money for working capital needs since 1974.
                    Business conditions require the Company to produce and store
                    inventories to meet its customers' requirements.  Custom and
                    stock finished goods inventories are stored throughout the
                    United States in both public and company-owned warehouses.
                    Finished products represent 65.7% of total inventory at
                    July 31, 1994.

                    Substantially all of the Company's sales are made on terms
                    of Net 30 days.  The accounts receivable balance at July 31,
                    1994, increased by 2.6%, in line with the increase in fourth
                    quarter sales.  Further information on liquidity and capital
                    resources is contained in Management's Discussion and
                    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on
                    page 14 of the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for
                    1994, which is incorporated herein by reference.

               (6)  The Company is not dependent upon any one customer or a
                    group of customers under common control.  No single customer
                    or group of customers accounts for more than 10% of
                    consolidated net sales.

ITEM 1    Continued


               (7)  Within the computer services and supply industry, the
                    Company sells its products through three distribution
                    channels:  1) a direct sales force of approximately 700
                    employee sales representatives, 2) direct mail catalogs sent
                    to the customer, and 3) the office products
                    wholesaler/dealer distribution network.

                    The predominant distribution channel is the direct sales
                    force.  The Company hires college graduates who start at a
                    base salary of $20,000 plus commissions.  Sales
                    representatives are placed in one of the Company's 160 sales
                    offices located throughout the United States and are
                    assigned a specific geographic territory.  Within this
                    assigned territory, a sales representative is free to sell
                    all of the Company's products to any customer.  Sales
                    support for the direct sales force is provided by the
                    Corporate Marketing department.  The Company has identified
                    the following specific markets as large users of its product
                    lines:  financial services, telecommunications, retail,
                    transportation/distribution, utilities, and healthcare.

                    The direct mail catalog operation accounts for less than 3%
                    of the Company's sales.  Customers are offered products
                    through a general catalog, plus monthly flyers that offer
                    special pricing on a limited number of products.  The
                    general catalog carries approximately 8,000 items.  Most of
                    the paper-based products in the catalog are produced by the
                    Company.  Products sold through the catalog are either drop-
                    shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer, or
                    shipped from the Company's warehouses in California,
                    Illinois, and Pennsylvania.  Mailing lists are updated on a
                    regular basis through prospecting using purchased lists of
                    potential customers.

                    The office products wholesaler/dealer distribution network
                    accounts for less than 11% of the Company's sales.  The
                    network is accessed through the use of both the Company's
                    direct sales force and a limited number of outside
                    manufacturer's representatives, both of whom are paid
                    commissions.  The direct sales force is also paid an annual
                    salary.  The wholesaler/dealer distribution network is
                    located throughout the United States and Canada.  The
                    product line sold through the network consists mainly of
                    office and paper products and computer supplies.  The
                    Company is also doing an increasing amount of business with
                    the office superstores, which are estimated to control
                    approximately one-fourth of the office products market.

ITEM 1     Continued


               (8)  The Company services several markets, all of which are
                    highly competitive.  None of these markets is dominated by
                    any one company.  The principal markets served are business
                    forms, commercial printing, pressure sensitive labels, and
                    office/computer products.  The largest market share of the
                    Company in any of these markets is in business forms, where
                    the Company is known to be one of the ten largest
                    manufacturers based upon sales.

                    The ten largest manufacturers account for about 70% of
                    business forms sales, which are estimated to be
                    approximately $7.3 billion for calendar 1994 ($7.5 billion
                    in 1993).

                    The commercial printing market served by the Company
                    includes the design and manufacture of industrial and
                    consumer catalogs, directories and price lists that require
                    computer manipulation of data for electronic type
                    composition.  The Company primarily competes with commercial
                    printers.  This market is highly competitive and is very
                    large in comparison to the Company's sales in this area,
                    with most work being done on a job bid basis.

                    The pressure sensitive label market is highly competitive
                    with over 1,600 converters in the United States.  This
                    market is estimated to total approximately $2.5 billion.

                    The Company is both a manufacturer and distributor for the
                    $15.0 billion office products market.  The Company's sales
                    are small in relation to the total market.

               (9)  The Company is continuously involved in research activities
                    relating to development of new products and improvement of
                    existing products (none of which are customer sponsored).

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

                                  ON SCHEDULES


To Wallace Computer Services, Inc.

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
financial statements included in Wallace Computer Services, Inc.'s annual report
to shareholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our
report thereon dated September 7, 1994.  Our audit was made for the purpose of
forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed
in the index on Pages 14 and 15 are the responsibility of the Company's
management and are presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic financial statements.
These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

Our report on the financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph with
respect to the change in the method of accounting for income taxes and post
retirement benefits in 1994 as discussed in Notes 7 and 8 to the financial
statements.

of a majority of the shares of such class or series, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for a
vote on such matter.

     (b)  In all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative

be the act of the stockholders, except that, when any matter is to be voted on
by a class or by a series voting as a class, the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of such class or series, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall be the act of such class or series.

     (c)  Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by
stockholders holding shares of stock of the corporation entitled to vote in the
election of directors, present in person or represented by proxy, except that,
when any directors are to be elected by a class or by a series voting as a
class, the directors to be elected by such class or series shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by holders of the shares of such class or series,

     (e)  The stockholders represented at a duly organized meeting may continue

authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy, but no such proxy

provides for a longer period.

     (b)  Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize
another person or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to subsection (a) of
this Section, the following shall


                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>

constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

          (1)  A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or
     persons to act for him as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the
     stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing
     such writing or causing his signature to be affixed to such writing by any
     reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature.

          (2)  A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or
     persons to act for him as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the
     transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic
     transmission to the person or persons who will be the holder of the proxy
     or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
     agent duly authorized by the person or persons who will be the holder of
     the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such telegram,
     cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth
     or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
     telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the
     stockholder.  If it is determined that such a telegram, cablegram or other
     electronic transmission is valid, the inspectors of election or, if there
     are no inspectors of election, such other persons making such determination
     shall specify the information upon which they relied.

     (c)  Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction
of the writing or transmission created pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or
transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication
or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original
writing or transmission.

     (d)  A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.  A proxy may be made
irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation generally.


     Section 2.9.   INSPECTORS OF ELECTION.

     (a)  The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders,
appoint one or more inspectors of election to act


                                      - 5 -

at the meeting and make a written report thereof.  The corporation may designate
one or more persons as alternate inspectors of election to replace any inspector
of election who fails to act.  If no inspector of election or alternate
inspector of election is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person
presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors of election to act
at the meeting.  Each inspector of election, before entering upon the discharge
of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector of election with strict impartiality and according to the best of his
ability.  The decision of a majority of the inspectors of election as to the
results of any vote of stockholders shall be binding upon the corporation and
its stockholders.  Any competent person over the age of 21 may be appointed as
an inspector of election.

     (b)  Inspectors of election shall have the following responsibilities:

               (i)  to ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the
voting power of each;

              (ii)  to determine the shares represented at a meeting and the
     validity of proxies and ballots;

             (iii)  to count all votes and ballots;

              (iv)  to determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of
     the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
     inspectors;

               (v)  to certify their determination of the number of shares
     represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots;

              (vi)  to determine whether the meeting itself is legally
     constituted for the purpose of the actions to be taken by the stockholders;
     and

             (vii)  to do all other acts and make all other determinations
     necessary or appropriate in connection with conducting the vote of
     stockholders and deciding the results thereof.


     (c)  In carrying out their responsibilities, inspectors of election shall
not have any obligation to do any of the following:

               (i)  to determine the names or addresses of the stockholders
entitled to vote (inspectors of election may


                                      - 6 -
<PAGE>

     rely on a list of stockholders as of the record date for the meeting
     certified by either the transfer agent or the Secretary of the
     corporation), or

              (ii)  to determine the date of mailing of the notice of meeting or
     the persons to whom the notice of meeting was sent (inspectors of election
     may rely on a certificate of either the transfer agent or the Secretary of
     the corporation for such information).

     (d)  In carrying out their responsibilities, inspectors of election shall
have the authority, but not the obligation, to appoint or retain agents,
including, but not limited to, accountants, attorneys and custodians, to assist
the inspectors of election in the performance of their duties as the inspectors
of election.  Any such agent so appointed by any inspector of election shall be
responsible only to the inspectors of election.

     (e)  Inspectors of election shall be entitled to possession of all proxies
and all ballots cast by stockholders or their proxies until they have determined
the results of the vote of stockholders, at which time they shall deliver such
proxies and ballots to the secretary of the meeting.

     (f)  The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each
matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at
the meeting.  No ballot, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or
changes thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors of election after the
closing of the polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon
application by a stockholder shall determine otherwise.

     (g)  In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the
inspectors of election shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any
envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance
with Section 212(c)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
ballots and the regular books and records of the corporation, except that the
inspectors of election may consider other reliable information for the limited
purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks,
brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the
holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than
the stockholder holds of record.  If the inspectors of election consider other
reliable information for the limited purpose permitted in this subsection (g),
the inspectors of election shall, at the time they make their certification
pursuant to subsection (b)(v) of this Section, specify the precise information
considered by them, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the
information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the
information


                                      - 7 -

was obtained and the basis for their belief that such information is accurate
and reliable.

     (h)  Inspectors of election shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
corporation for all expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with the
discharge of their responsibilities, including the fees and expenses of any
agents appointed by them.  In addition, the corporation shall pay inspectors of
election a fee commensurate with the services rendered and the responsibilities
undertaken by them.

                         WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC.
              1994 DEFERRED COMPENSATION/CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN


Wallace Computer Services, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries hereby
establish a non-qualified deferred compensation program for certain of their
employees as described herein.  The following shall constitute the terms and
conditions of the Wallace Computer Services, Inc. 1994 Deferred
Compensation/Capital Accumulation Plan (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 1994
(the "Effective" Date).  The Company and its subsidiaries are referred to below
collectively as the "Employers" and individually as an "Employer".

1.   ADMINISTRATION.  Full power and authority to construe, interpret and
     administer the Plan shall be vested in the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee").  The Committee shall
     have the authority to make determinations provided for or permitted to be
     made under the Plan, to interpret the Plan, and to promulgate such rules
     and regulations, if any, as the Committee considers necessary and
     appropriate for the implementation of the Plan.

2.   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION.  The Committee, in its sole discretion,
     shall establish eligibility qualifications for participation in the Plan.
     Participation shall be limited to key executives and a select group of
     highly compensated employees of the Employers.

3.   DEFERRED COMPENSATION.

     A.   Each Participant may make an irrevocable election in writing to defer
          up to 20% of Compensation, as defined in Subsection 3B, paid during
          the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 (the "Deferral
          Amount").  Such amount shall not be less than $1,000.  Deferred
          compensation at the deferral percentage will be deducted from all
          Compensation payable to the Participant during the deferral period.

     B.   "Compensation" means salary, bonuses, or commissions payable to the
          Participant before reduction pursuant to this or any other employee
          benefit plan.

     C.   The Employer shall establish and maintain a bookkeeping account in the
          name of each Participant, which shall be known as the "Deferral
          Account".  It shall be credited with the Deferral Amount and interest
          at the rate established by the Committee compounded annually from
          January 1, 1994.  As provided in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Plan,
          the interest rate on lump sum payments caused by certain events will
          differ from the rate established by the Committee.  Amounts paid to
          the Participant or his Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, shall be
          deducted from the account balance as of the first day of the month in
          which such payment is made.


                                        1
<PAGE>

     D.   The Participant's Deferral Account shall at all times be reflected on
          the Employer's books in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          practices as a general unsecured and unfunded obligation of the
          Employer and the Plan shall not give any person any right or security
          interest in any asset of the Employer nor shall it imply any trust or
          segregation of assets by the Employer.  Payments from the
          Participant's Deferral Account shall be made from the general assets
          of the Employer.

4.   TIME AND MANNER OF PAYMENT.  The Participant's Deferral Account shall be
     distributed as follows:

     A.   INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.

          (1)  A Participant shall be entitled to fifteen (15) equal annual
               installment payments commencing at age sixty-five (65) if one of
               the following conditions is met:

               a.   the Participant remains in the continuous employ of the
                    Employers during the period from January 1, 1994 until the
                    Participant reaches age sixty-five (65); or

               b.   after a period of continuous employment with the Employers
                    beginning on or before January 1, 1994 the Participant
                    retires as defined in Subsection 4D.

          (2)  A Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1994 may elect, at the time of making the deferral election
               pursuant to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual
               installments commencing at age seventy (70) in lieu of
               installment payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he becomes
               eligible for such payments.

          Installment payments shall be calculated to amortize fully the
          accumulated value of the Deferral Amount over the payment period.  For
          purposes of this Subsection A, the interest rate to be credited in the
          calculation of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount shall be
          the rate(s) established by the Committee at its sole discretion prior
          to the beginning of the deferral period.

     B.   INTERIM PAYMENTS.  A payment equal to the Participant's Deferral
          Amount shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2001 if installment payments under Subsection A have not
          then commenced and will not commence during the 2001 calendar year.
          In addition, a payment equal to the Participant's Deferral Amount
          shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2002 if installment payments under Subsection A have not
          then commenced and will not commence during the 2002 calendar year.
          These


                                        2
<PAGE>

          payments shall be charged to the Participant's Deferral Account as of
          the first day of the month in which the payment is made.  This
          Subsection does not apply to Participants terminated under Subsection
          C or Sections 5, 6, or 7B.

     C.   PAYMENT UPON TERMINATION.  A Participant whose employment with the
          Employers is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated prior to the
          Participant's Retirement for reasons other than those described in
          Sections 5 and 6 below, shall receive, as soon as practicable after
          such termination, a lump sum payment in the amount of the accumulated
          value of the Deferral Amount.  For purposes of this Subsection C, the
          rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated value of the
          Deferral Amount shall be six percent (6%).

     D.   RETIREMENT.  Retirement shall mean leaving the active employ of the
          Employer at or after age sixty (60) or age fifty-five (55) with at
          least twenty (20) years of service.

5.   NON-COMPETITION.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the
     Committee at any time determines that a Participant, without having
     obtained the prior written consent of the Committee or its designee, has
     engaged in Competition with an Employer, as defined below, the sole amount
     payable to Participant hereunder shall be a lump sum payment of the
     accumulated value of the Deferral Amount, payable as soon as practicable
     after such determination.  For purposes of this Section 5, the simple rate
     of interest applied to determine the accumulated value of the Deferral
     Amount shall be two percent (2%) annually, without compounding.  A
     Participant shall be considered to have engaged in "Competition with an
     Employer" if, while employed by an Employer or within twenty-four (24)
     months of Participant's termination of employment with an Employer:  (a) if
     the Participant is or has been employed by an Employer in a sales capacity,
     the Participant sells to, contacts, or deals with customers of an Employer
     that the Participant called upon, or whose account(s) the Participant
     directly or indirectly supervised on behalf of an Employer with respect to
     products or services that are competitive with one or more products or
     services of an Employer; (b) if the Participant is or has been employed by
     an Employer in a nonsales capacity, the Participant renders services for a
     new or existing competitor of an Employer with respect to products or
     services that are competitive with those of an Employer within the
     geographical area in which an Employer does business, except that the
     Participant may accept employment with a competitor of an Employer whose
     business is diversified and which in part of its business is not a
     competitor of an Employer provided that prior to accepting such employment,
     the Participant provides, and obtains for the Employers from such
     competitor, separate written assurances satisfactory to the Employers that
     the Participant will not render services directly or indirectly in
     connection with one or more products or services that are competitive with
     those of an Employer;  and (c) the Participant hires, solicits, induces or
     attempts to induce any employee of an Employer to leave its employ, engage
     in any competing business, or to otherwise aid or assist any person or
     company that is or intends to be in competition with an Employer.


                                        3
<PAGE>

     The foregoing provision shall be deemed in addition to and not in lieu of
     any rights or remedies that an Employer might otherwise have with respect
     to the conduct of a Participant during or after employment that breaches
     any other contractual or common law duty to the Employer;  this Section
     shall not preclude Employer from seeking injunctive relief or actual or
     punitive monetary damages, or both such relief and damages, with respect to
     any wrongful conduct of a Participant, either during or subsequent to his
     employment with an Employer.

6.   Dishonest Conduct.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if
     Participant's employment with an Employer is terminated at any time for
     reason of dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to the Employer, the
     sole amount payable to or on behalf of Participant hereunder shall be a
     lump sum payment of the accumulated value of the Participant's Deferral
     Amount, payable as soon as practicable after such termination of
     employment.  For purposes of this Section 6, the simple rate of interest to
     be credited in the calculation of the accumulated value of the Deferral
     Amount shall be zero percent (0%).

7.   PAYMENT UPON DEATH OF PARTICIPANT.

     A.   If a Participant dies after age sixty-five (65), the Employer shall
          pay any unpaid annual Installment Payments due the Participant under
          Subsection 4A to the Participant's Beneficiary, commencing with the
          next such payment due following the date of Participant's death.

     B.   If a Participant dies prior to age sixty-five (65), Installment
          Payments described in Subsection 4A(1) shall be payable to the
          Participant's Beneficiary, commencing at the time of the Participant's
          death.  Interim Payments described in Subsection 4B will not be made.

8.   BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  A Participant may, from time to time designate
     any legal or natural person or persons (who may be designated contingently
     or successively) as his Beneficiary to whom payments are to be made if the
     Participant dies before receiving payment of all amounts due hereunder, by
     signing a form approved by the Committee.  A beneficiary designation form
     shall be effective only after the signed form is filed with the Committee
     while the Participant is alive.  A properly filed designation shall cancel
     all beneficiary designation forms filed earlier.  If a Participant fails to
     designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated
     Beneficiaries of a Participant die before the Participant, or before
     complete payment of all amounts due hereunder, the Committee, in its
     discretion, may direct the Employers to pay the unpaid amounts to one or
     more of such Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage in any
     manner permitted by law which the Committee considers to be appropriate,
     including but not limited to payment to the legal representative or
     representatives of the estate of the last to die of Participant and
     Participant's designated Beneficiaries.

9.   DISABILITY.  If Participant's employment with the Employers is terminated
     prior to Participant's Retirement by reason of Participant's Disability,
     Participant's employment with the Employers, for purposes of the Plan,
     shall be deemed to continue until the earliest of his death, the date his
     Disability ceases, or the date the Participant would have first been
     eligible for Retirement and the provisions of the Plan shall be applicable
     to such Participant to the same extent as if Participant were, in fact,
     employed by the Employers during that period.  However, if such termination
     of employment occurs prior to January 1, 1995, the Participant's benefit
     will be determined taking into account only the amount actually deferred by
     the Participant during the Deferral Period.

     A Participant shall be deemed to incur a Disability if, in the opinion of a
     physician selected by the Committee, the Participant is no longer capable
     of performing a substantial portion of the duties of his employment because
     of a physical or mental disability which is likely to be permanent and
     continuous during the remainder of the Participant's lifetime.

10.  PAYMENT UPON A MATERIAL CHANGE OF CONTROL.

     A.   For purposes of this paragraph 10, a "Material Change" shall be deemed
          to have occurred if any of the following should occur:

          (1)  the acquisition (in one or more transactions) of beneficial
               ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding
               shares of Common Stock of the Company by any person or entity (or
               by any group of persons or entities acting in concert for the
               purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of shares of
               the Company's Common Stock).  The Board of Directors may reduce
               the ownership threshold to a percentage not less than ten percent
               (10%);

          (2)  the election (in one or more elections) as directors comprising
               one-fourth (1/4) or more of the Board of Directors of the Company
               of persons who were not nominated or recommended by the Company's
               incumbent Board of Directors; or

          (3)  the occurrence of any other event or state of facts that the
               Board of Directors of the Company may determine (by the adoption
               of a resolution) has, does, or would constitute a Material Change
               for the purposes of this paragraph 10.

     B.   At the time of a Material Change, the Company shall remit to an
          independent Trustee, the cumulative book balance in the Participant's
          Deferral Account, representing individual Deferral Amounts plus
          accrued interest.

          At all times after the Material Change occurs, the exercise of
          authority and


                                        5
<PAGE>

          responsibility in the administration of the Plan with respect to each
          individual who was a Participant in the Plan immediately prior to the
          date that the Material Change occurs (a "Protected Participant"), or
          with respect to the Beneficiary of a Protected Participant, shall be
          subject to a de novo standard of review by a court in any action
          brought under Title I or ERISA.  At all times after the Material
          Change occurs, a bank that is organized under the laws of the United
          States of America or one of its States, that has a combined capital
          and surplus in excess of $250,000,000, and that is otherwise
          independent of and has no material business relationships with the
          Company or Related Company (as defined in paragraph 10C) shall be the
          Trustee of the Trust and the authority to manage, acquire, and dispose
          of all assets of the Trust shall be vested in that Trustee to the
          extent not vested in one or more investment managers (as defined in
          Section 3(38) of ERISA) who are selected by that Trustee and otherwise
          independent of, and have no material business relationships with, the
          Company or a Related Company.

     C.   The term "Related Company" means any corporation, trade, or business
          during any period that it is, along with the Company, a member of a
          controlled group of corporations, a controlled group of trades or
          businesses, or an affiliated service group, as described in Section
          414(b), 414(c), or 414(m), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code.

     D.   Any Protected Participant (or a Beneficiary of a Protected
          Participant) who brings any legal action after a Material Change to
          enforce the provisions of this paragraph 10 or any other provisions of
          the Plan or the Trust shall be entitled to recover from the Company
          any and all attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in
          enforcing such provisions for his benefit or for the benefit of any or
          all Protected Participants (or Beneficiaries of Protected
          Participants).

     E.   Notwithstanding any other Section except Section 6, if the
          Participant's employment with the Employer terminates, for any reason
          other than death, within the two-year (2) period beginning on the date
          that a Material Change of Control of the Company (as described above)
          occurs, payment shall be made to the Participant as soon as practical
          after termination in a single lump sum in lieu of any other subsequent
          payment under the Plan.  The lump sum payment shall be equal to the
          sum of the amounts determined  by discounting, at an 8% rate of
          interest, to the lump sum payment date, each payment that the
          Participant would have received under the Plan (determined without
          regard to Sections 5 and 6) after the date of such termination if
          employment had continued without change through the date that the
          Participant would have first been eligible for Retirement.  Such
          amount shall be determined by Clark/Bardes, Inc. or another firm
          serving as insurance advisor for the Plan.  If the Participant dies
          after termination of employment but before payment of any amount under
          this Section, then such amount shall be paid to the Beneficiary as
          soon as practical after the Participant's death.


                                        6
<PAGE>

     F.   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, except as may
          otherwise be provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
          Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, the
          provisions of this paragraph 10 may not be amended and shall continue
          to apply, without amendment, in any successor plan.

11.  FACILITY OF PAYMENT. If, in the Committee's opinion, a Participant or other
     person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal disability or
     is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his financial
     affairs, then the Committee may, until claim is made by a conservator or
     other person legally charged with the care of his person or of his estate,
     direct the Employer to make payment to a relative or friend of such person
     for his benefit.  Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to which such
     Participant or other person is entitled shall be paid to such conservator
     or other person legally charged with the care of his person of his estate.

12.  INSURANCE.  An Employer may, in its sole discretion, purchase a policy or
     policies of insurance on the life of any Participant or disability
     insurance with respect to any Participant, the cash value, if any, and
     proceeds of which may, but need not, be used by the Employer to satisfy
     part or all of its obligations, hereunder.  The Employer will be the owner
     of any such policies and neither the Participant nor any other person or
     entity claiming through the Participant shall have any ownership rights in
     such policies or any proceeds thereof.  The Participant, as a condition of
     receiving any benefits hereunder, on behalf of himself of any person or
     entity claiming through him, shall cooperate with the Employer in obtaining
     any such insurance that the Employer desires to purchase by submitting to
     such physical examinations, completing such forms, and making such records
     available as may be required by the Employer from time to time.

13.  EFFECT ON OTHER BENEFITS.  The Deferral Amount of a Participant shall be
     included in the Participant's 1994 compensation for purposes of calculating
     the Participant's bonuses and awards under any incentive or similar
     compensation plan or program of the Employer, insurance, and other employee
     benefits, except that in accordance with the terms of any plan qualified
     under Section 401 or Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code maintained
     by an Employer, the amount deferred under Section 3 shall not be included
     as 1994 calendar year compensation in calculating the Participant's
     benefits or contributions by or on behalf of the Participant under such
     plan or plans.  Payment under the Plan shall be excluded from compensation
     in years paid for purposes of calculating a Participant's bonuses and
     awards under any incentive or similar compensation plan or program of an
     Employer, insurance, and other employee benefits, except that in accordance
     with the terms of any plan qualified under Section 401 or Section 423(b) of
     the Internal Revenue Code maintained by an Employer, payments made while
     the Participant is an employee of an Employer shall be included as
     compensation in the year paid.

14.  NON-ALIENATION.  Neither a Participant nor anyone claiming through him
     shall have any


                                        7
<PAGE>

     right to commute, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey the right to
     receive any payments hereunder, which payments and the rights thereto
     hereby are expressly declared to be non-assignable and non-transferable,
     nor shall any such right to receive payments hereunder be subject to the
     claims of creditors of a Participant or anyone claiming through him to any
     legal, equitable, or other proceeding or process for the enforcement of
     such claims.

15.  TAX WITHHOLDING.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13, an Employer
     may withhold from any payment made by it under the Plan such amount or
     amounts as may be required for purposes of complying with the tax
     withholding or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the Social
     Security Act or any state or local income tax act or for purposes of paying
     any estate, inheritance or other tax attributable to any amounts payable
     hereunder.

16.  NON-SECURED PROMISE.  The rights under this Plan of a Participant and any
     person or entity claiming through him shall be solely those of an
     unsecured, general creditor of the Employer.  Any insurance policy or other
     asset acquired or held by an Employer shall not be deemed to be held by the
     Employer for or on behalf of a Participant, or any other person, or to be
     security for the performance of any obligations hereunder of the Employer,
     but shall, with respect to this Plan, be and remain a general, unpledged,
     unrestricted asset of the Employer.

17.  INDEPENDENCE OF PLAN.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
     Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other employment
     agreement or employment benefit agreement or plan or rights that may exist
     from time to time between the parties hereto.  This Plan shall not be
     deemed to constitute a contract of employment between an Employer and a
     Participant, nor shall any provision hereof restrict the right of an
     Employer to discharge a Participant, or restrict the right of a Participant
     to terminate his employment with an Employer.

18.  PARAGRAPH HEADINGS.  The Paragraph headings used in this Plan are for
     convenience of reference only and shall not be considered in construing
     this Plan.

19.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL EFFECT.  Neither the Committee nor any Employer
     makes any representations or warranties, express or implied, or assumes any
     responsibility concerning the legal, tax, or other implications or effects
     of this Plan.

20.  COMMITTEE DETERMINATIONS FINAL.  Each determination provided for in the
     Plan shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee.  Any such
     determination shall be binding on all persons.

21.  AMENDMENT.  The Company may in its sole discretion amend the Plan from time
     to time. No such amendment shall reduce a Participant's or Beneficiary's
     benefits under the Plan to an amount less than an amount that he would have
     been entitled to under the Plan on the


                                        8
<PAGE>

     later of the date the amendment is adopted or made effective if the Plan
     had been terminated on that date.

22.  TERMINATION AT THE EMPLOYER'S OPTION.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of this Plan, the Company may terminate this Plan at any time if the
     Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any change
     in federal or state law, or judicial or administrative interpretation
     thereof, has materially affected the Employer's cost of providing the
     benefits otherwise payable under this Plan, or for any other reason
     whatsoever.  Upon such termination, the sole amount payable to Participant
     shall be a lump sum payment, as soon as practicable after such termination,
     of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount.  For purposes of this
     Section, the rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated
     value of the Deferral Amount shall be the rate specified for Installment
     Payments in Subsection 4A.

23.  BINDING ON SUCCESSORS.  The provisions of the Plan shall be binding upon
     and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, any Related Company that
     adopts the Plan, the Participants, and their respective successors in
     interest and assigns, including, without limitation, the surviving
     corporation in any merger or consolidation with the Company or such Related
     Company and, to the extent provided in the Plan, the Beneficiaries of the
     Participants.  After a Material Change, except as may otherwise be
     determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted
     prior to the occurrence of the Material Change, a successor in interest to
     the Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall be deemed to
     have adopted the Plan and shall have all of the liabilities and obligations
     of the Company or that Related Company under the Plan.  Except as may
     otherwise be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
     Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, the Company
     shall require any person or entity that becomes a successor in interest to
     the Company or a Related Company that adopts the plan to expressly assume
     the Plan and agree to perform all of the obligations of the Company or that
     Related Company, as the case may be, under the plan.  For purposes of this
     paragraph 23, following a Material Change, a successor in interest to the
     Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall include, without
     limitation, any person or entity (or group of related or affiliated persons
     or entities) that acquires (in a single transaction or a series of related
     transactions) any businesses or assets of the Company or such Related
     Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company's or
     such Related Company's sales, operating profits, or operating assets.

24.  CONTROLLING LAW.  The Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws
     of the state of Illinois to the extent not pre-empted by laws of the United
     States of America.

     The Disinterested Directors shall have full power to revise and adjust the

SECTION 6.  PERFORMANCE FACTORS

     For any Plan Year the Performance Factor will be determined from a matrix
(provided as Exhibit A) in which the "Y" axis represents the Company/Division
Performance factor and the "X" axis represents the Individual Performance
factor.

     All Participants of the Plan except for Division General Managers (or other
Participants determined by the Committee members and Disinterested Directors)
will have one matrix in which the "Y" axis represents the Company Performance
Factor.  Division General Managers will have two matrices each representing one-
half of the Targeted Incentive Award.  The first matrix will have the "Y" axis
represented by the Company Performance Factor, the second matrix will have the
"Y" axis represented by the Division Performance Factor.

     (a)  COMPANY/DIVISION PERFORMANCE FACTOR.  The "Y" axis will consist of
five boxes.  The middle box will equal the Company/Division's "Targeted Return
on Investment."  The value of each box above the top middle box will equal 105%
and 110% respectively, of the Targeted Return on Investment.  The value of each
box below the middle box will be equal to 95% and 90% respectively, of the
Targeted Return on Investment.

     (b)  INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE FACTOR.  The "X" axis represents the Individual
Performance Factor.  The Individual Performance Factor equals the percentage of
Objective Points attained, to the Maximum  Objective Points available.
Participants will be assigned objectives representing financial, operational
and/or individual goals.  Objectives will be assigned point value that in
aggregate equal the Participant's Targeted Incentive Award.  Whenever possible,
objectives should be supported by quantifiable benchmarks that can be measured
against a quantifiable monitoring system.  When performance cannot be measured
according to a quantifiable monitoring system, the person to whom the
Participant reports will evaluate the Participant's performance.

     Determination of a Participant's objectives and the point values assigned
to each objective will be the responsibility of the individual to whom the
Participant reports.  The objectives and the point values assigned will be
subject to approval by the Committee members and Disinterested Directors.

     The "X" axis will consist of four boxes, each representing a benchmark of a
Participant's Individual Performance Factor.  The first box benchmark will equal
45%. The benchmarks of each box to the right of the first box will be 60%, 75%
and 90% respectively.

SECTION 7.  PAYMENT OF AWARDS

     (a)  Subject to the condition set forth in paragraph (b) below, payment of
awards shall be made no later than December 1 of the following plan year, and
only after the Committee members recommend and Disinterested Directors have
approved the awards.  Awards shall be paid in cash.

     (b)  All awards are contingent upon the Participant remaining in the employ
of the Company during the Plan year and through November 1 of the following
fiscal year.  In the event a Participant terminates or resigns from the Company
prior to the end of the contingent period, the award, at the recommendation of
the Committee and upon approval by the Disinterested Directors, may be forfeited
by the Participant.  In the event of death or permanent disability, the
Participant or designated Beneficiary (as specified in the designation form
indexed as Exhibit B) will receive a prorata portion of the award equal to the
Participant's service period during the plan year.

     (c)  No Participant shall have any right with respect to any award until
such award shall be delivered to him.

     (d)  If the Disinterested Directors determine, in their discretion, that a
Participant at any time has engaged in any activity that the Disinterested
Directors determines was or is harmful to the Company, any unpaid award will be
forfeited by the Participant.

     (e)  There shall be deducted from all award payments any taxes required by
law to be withheld.


SECTION 8.  GENERAL CONDITIONS

     (a)  Amendments.  The Disinterested Directors may from time to time amend,
suspend or terminate in whole or in part, and if terminated, may reinstate any
or all of the provisions of the Plan.

     (b)  Interpretation of the Plan.  Any interpretation of the Plan arising
out of or in connection with the construction, administration, and effect of the
Plan and of its rules and regulations shall lie within the Committee's absolute
discretion and shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and any
person claiming under or through any Participant.

     (c)  Rights to Continued Employment.  The selection of any employee for
participation in the Plan shall not give such Participant any right to be
retained in the employ of the Company and the right and power of the Company to
dismiss or discharge any Participant is specifically reserved.  Nor shall any
such Participant or any person claiming under or through the Participant have
any right or interest in the Plan, or any Award thereunder, unless and until all

     (d)  Adjustments to Performance Factors.  When a performance goal is based
on Quantifiable financial or accounting measure, it may be necessary to exclude
significant non-budgeted or non-controllable amounts, gains or losses from
actual financial results in order to properly measure performance.  The
Disinterested Directors will decide those items that shall be considered in
adjusting actual results.  For example, some types of items that may be
considered for exclusion are:

           (1) Any gains or losses that will be treated as extraordinary in the
               Company's financial statements.

           (2) Amounts, profits or losses of any entities acquired by the
               Company during the Plan Year, assuming they were not included in

           (3) Material amounts not in the budget and/or the goals that are of
               a non-recurring nature and are not considered to be in the
               ordinary course of business.

     (e)  Expenses of the Plan.  The expenses of administering this Plan shall
be borne by the Company.

     (f)  Governing Laws.  The validity, construction, interpretation,

thereunder, shall be governed by, and determined exclusively and solely in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.

     (e)  OTHER PLANS.  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as preventing
the Company from establishing  incentive or other variable compensation plans
applicable to Employees.


SECTION 5.  INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION LEVELS
     (a)  Calculation of Bonus.  The Bonus is a function of the Participant's
bonus percentage (provided in 5b) multiplied by the "Value Added" for the Plan
Year.

     The bonus calculation for the CEO, Sr. V.P. and Corporate V.P.'s will be
based upon "Average Company Investment" and "Company Operating Profit after
Taxes".

     The bonus calculation for Participants with Division responsibilities will
be based upon the "Average Division Investment" and "Division Operating Profit
after Taxes" for their respective Division.

     (b)  Bonus Percentages.  The bonus percentages will be determined according
to the following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

                  Executive Position                  Bonus %
                  ------------------                  -------
          <S>                                         <C>
          CEO                                          2.0%
          Sr. V.P. of Operations                       1.5%
          Corporate V.P.
             Corporate Sales                           1.0%
             Chief Financial Officer                   1.0%
             Management Information Services           1.0%
          Corporate V.P
             Engineering and Research                   .75%
             Marketing                                  .75%
          Division General Manager                     2.0%
</TABLE>




     The Disinterested Directors shall have full power to revise and adjust the
     bonus percentages and to revise the positions eligible to participate in
     the Plan.

     (c)  In the event that a division's "Value Added" is negative at the
inception of the Plan, then the Participant's bonus will be equal to the
Participant's Bonus % multiplied by the "Incremental Value Added".  The
Participant's bonus will be calculated in this manner until the division's
"Value Added" is positive, at which time the bonus will be calculated as set
forth in (a) above.


SECTION 6.  PAYMENT OF AWARDS

     (a) Subject to the condition set forth in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)
below, payment of awards shall be made no later than December 1, following the
end of the Plan Year, and only after the Disinterested Directors have approved
the awards.  Awards shall be paid in cash.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     (b) All awards are contingent upon the Participant remaining in the employ
of the Company until the award is paid.  In the event a Participant terminates
or resigns (other than retirement) from the Company prior to payment,  the
award, at the discretion of the Disinterested Directors, may be forfeited by the
Participant.  In the event of death or permanent disability, the Participant or
the designated beneficiary (as specified in the designation form indexed as
Exhibit A) will receive the Participant's accrued bonus balance, and a prorata
portion of the current year award equal to the Participant's service period
during the Plan Year.

     (c) Bonuses will be deferred for a period of three years.  During the three
year period, subsequent year  bonuses that are negative can reduce, eliminate or
create a negative cumulative deferred amount.  As a result,  bonuses will be
paid out (3 years in arrears) provided that the cumulative deferred balance is
positive at the time of payment.  If the cumulative deferred balance is
positive, but less than the bonus amount three years ago, then only the balance
of the cumulative deferred balance will be paid.  The excess of the bonus amount
three years ago as compared to the cumulative deferred balance will be
forfeited.

     (d)  Upon retirement of a Participant, the unpaid cumulative deferred
balance will remain to be paid in arrears as established in (c) above.  Although
the retired Participant will not accrue any additional bonuses, a phantom bonus
will be calculated during the arrear period as if the Participant was still an
active Participant.  Negative phantom bonuses for the years subsequent to
retirement, will reduce or eliminate future payments as is the case in (c)
above.  All payments to retired Participants will be made in cash.

     (e)  No Participant shall have any right with respect to any award until
such award shall be delivered to him.

     (f)  If the Disinterested Directors determine, in their discretion, that a
Participant at any time has engaged in any activity that the Disinterested
Directors determines was or is harmful to the Company, any unpaid award will be
forfeited by the Participant.

     (g)  There shall be deducted from all award payments, any taxes required by
law to be withheld.

SECTION 7.  GENERAL CONDITIONS

     (a)  Amendments.  The Disinterested Directors may from time to time amend,
suspend or terminate in whole or in part, and if terminated, may reinstate any
or all of the provisions of the Plan.

     (b)  Interpretation of the Plan.  Any interpretation of the Plan arising
out of or in connection with the construction, administration, and effect of the
Plan and of its rules and regulations shall lie within the Committee's absolute
discretion and shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and any
person claiming under or through any Participant.

     (c)  Rights to Continued Employment.  The selection of any employee for
participation in the Plan shall not give such Participant any right to be
retained in the employ of the Company and the right and power of the Company to
dismiss or discharge any Participant is specifically reserved.  Nor shall any
such Participant or any person claiming under or through the Participant have
any right or interest in the Plan, or any Award thereunder, unless and until all
terms, conditions and provisions of the Plan that affect such Participant have
been complied with as specified herein.


                                        5

     (d)  Adjustments to Performance Factors.  When a performance goal is based
on quantifiable financial or accounting measure, it may be necessary to exclude
significant non-budgeted or non-controllable amounts, gains or losses from
actual financial results in order to properly measure performance.  The
Disinterested Directors will decide those items that shall be considered in
adjusting actual results.  For example, some types of items that may be
considered for exclusion are:

          (1)  Any gains or losses that will be treated as extraordinary in the
               Company's financial statements.

          (2)  Amounts, profits or losses of any entities acquired by the
               Company during the Plan Year, assuming they were not included in
               the budget and/or the goal.

          (3)  Material amounts not in the budget and/or the goals that are of a
               non-recurring nature and are not considered to be in the ordinary
               course of business.

     (e)  Expenses of the Plan.  The expenses of administering this Plan shall
be borne by the Company.

     (f)  Governing Laws.  The validity, construction, interpretation,
administration and effect of the Plan, and of its rules and regulations, and the
rights of any and all persons having or claiming to have an interest therein or
thereunder, shall be governed by, and determined exclusively and solely in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.


SECTION 8.  INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND DIRECTORS BY THE
COMPANY.

     (a)  No member of the Board of Directors or of the Committee shall be
liable for any act or action, whether of commission or omission, taken by any
other member, or by any officer, agent or employee.

     (b)  Pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Committee members and
Directors for and to hold each of them harmless against any and all liabilities,
losses, costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses) of whatsoever kind
and nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against them at any
time by reason of their actions under this Plan if they did not act dishonestly
or in willful or grossly negligent violation of the law or regulation under
which such liability, loss, cost or expense is not insured against or exceed any
insurance recovery.


SECTION 9.  EFFECTIVE DATE

     This Plan shall be applicable for the fiscal year beginning August 1, 1994,
and subsequent fiscal years, unless modified by the Disinterested Directors as
prescribed in Section 7.

Company Performance Factor (provided in Section 6.a.) and the Individual
Performance Factor (provided in Section 6.b.) for the Plan Year.  Each
Participant's award will be calculated as follows:

                       Target Award (X) Performance Factor

          The performance factor will be determined from a matrix (provided as
          Exhibit A) that considers both the Company Performance Factor and the
          Individual Performance Factor.


                                        3
<PAGE>

     (b)  Target Awards.  The Target Awards will be determined according to the
following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
             Executive Position                        Target Award
             ------------------                        ------------
      <S>                                              <C>
      CEO                                                  9,500
      Sr. V.P.                                             5,700
      Corporate V.P. (CFO, Sales & MIS)                    4,750
      Corporate V.P. (all others)                          3,800
      Division V.P.                                        2,850
      Division General Manager                             2,850
</TABLE>

The target award of the CEO will be adjusted annually to equal:
          Target award = CEO base salary DIVIDED BY stock price as of the
          preceding Plan year end.

The target awards of the other executive positions will retain the same ratio to
the CEO (i.e., Sr. V.P. 60%, Corporate V.P. 50%, etc.)

The Disinterested Directors, shall have full power to revise and adjust the
Target Awards and to revise the positions eligible to participate in the
Guideline.


SECTION 6.  PERFORMANCE FACTORS

     For any Plan Year the Performance Factor will be determined from a matrix
(provided as Exhibit A) in which the "Y" axis represents the Company Performance
factor and the "X" axis represents the Individual Performance factor.

     (a)  COMPANY PERFORMANCE FACTOR.  The "Y" axis will consist of five boxes.
The middle box will equal the Company's "Targeted Return on Investment."  The
value of each box above the top middle box will equal 105% and 110%
respectively, of the Targeted Return on Investment.  The value of each box below
the middle box will be equal to 95% and 90% respectively, of the Targeted Return
on Investment.

     (b)  INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE FACTOR  The "X" axis represents the Individual
Performance Factor.  The "X" axis will consist of three boxes, each representing
a benchmark of the Participant's Individual Performance Factor.  The first box
benchmark will equal 45%. The benchmarks of each box to the right of the first
box will be 60% and 90% respectively.  Each Participant's actual performance
factor will equal the percentage as computed in the Annual Bonus Plan.


SECTION 7.  GRANTING OF AWARDS

     (a)  Subject to the condition set forth in paragraph (b) below, granting of
awards shall be approved at the Board of Director meeting following the Annual
Shareholder meeting.

     (b)  All awards are contingent upon the Participant remaining in the employ
of the Company.  In the event a Participant terminates or resigns from the
Company prior to the awards being granted, the Participant will forfeit all
rights to the awards.

     (c)  No Participant shall have any right with respect to any award until
such award shall be delivered to him.

SECTION 8.  GENERAL CONDITIONS

     (a)  Amendments.  The Disinterested Directors may from time to time amend,
suspend or terminate in whole or in part, and if terminated, may reinstate any
or all of the provisions of the Guideline.

     (b)  Interpretation of the Guideline.  Any interpretation of the Guideline
arising out of or in connection with the construction, administration, and
effect of the Guideline and of its rules and regulations shall lie within the
Committee's absolute discretion and shall be conclusive and binding upon all
Participants and any person claiming under or through any Participant.

     (c)  Rights to Continued Employment.  The selection of any employee for
participation in the Guideline shall not give such Participant any right to be
retained in the employ of the Company and the right and power of the Company to
dismiss or discharge any Participant is specifically reserved.  Nor shall any
such Participant or any person claiming under or through the Participant have
any right or interest in the Guideline, or any Award thereunder, unless and
until all terms, conditions and provisions of the Guideline that affect such
Participant have been complied with as specified herein.

     (d)  Adjustments to Return on Investment/Performance Factors.  When a goal
is based on Quantifiable financial or accounting measure, it may be necessary to
exclude significant non-budgeted or non-controllable amounts, gains or losses
from actual financial results in order to properly measure performance.  The
Disinterested Directors will decide those items that shall be considered in
adjusting actual results.  For example, some types of items that may be
considered for exclusion are:

          (1)  Any gains or losses that will be treated as extraordinary in the
               Company's financial statements.

          (2)  Amounts, profits or losses of any entities acquired by the
               Company during the Plan Year, assuming they were not included in
               the budget and/or the goal.

          (3)  Material amounts not in the budget and/or the goals that are of a
               non-recurring nature and are not considered to be in the ordinary
               course of business.

     (e)  Expenses of the Guideline.  The expenses of administering this
Guideline shall be borne by the Company.

     (f)  Governing Laws.  The validity, construction, interpretation,
administration and effect of the Guideline, and of its rules and regulations,
and the rights of any and all persons having or claiming to have an interest
therein or thereunder, shall be governed by, and determined exclusively and
solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.


SECTION 9.  INDEMNIFICATION OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND DIRECTORS BY THE
            COMPANY.

     (a)  No member of the Board of Directors or of the Committee shall be
liable for any act or action, whether of commission or omission, taken by any
other member, or by any officer, agent or employee.


                                        5

     (b)  Pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the Committee members and
Directors for and to hold each of them harmless against any and all liabilities,
losses, costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses) of whatsoever kind
and nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against them at any
time by reason of their actions under this Guideline if they did not act
dishonestly or in willful or grossly negligent violation of the law or
regulation under which such liability, loss, cost or expense is not insured
against or exceeds any insurance recovery.


SECTION 10.  EFFECTIVE DATE

This Guideline shall be applicable for the fiscal year beginning August 1,1994,
and subsequent fiscal years, unless modified by the Disinterested Directors as
prescribed in Section 8.

                         WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC.
              1994 DEFERRED COMPENSATION/CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN
                                  FOR DIRECTORS



Wallace Computer Services, Inc. (the "Company") hereby establishes a
non-qualified deferred compensation program for the members of its Board of
Directors who are eligible under, and elect to participate in, the Plan.  The
following shall constitute the terms and conditions of the Wallace Computer
Services, Inc. 1994 Deferred Compensation/Capital Accumulation Plan for
Directors (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 1994 (the "Effective" Date).

1.   ADMINISTRATION.  Full power and authority to construe, interpret and
     administer the Plan shall be vested in the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee").  The Committee shall
     have the authority to make determinations provided for or permitted to be
     made under the Plan, to interpret the Plan, and to promulgate such rules
     and regulations, if any, as the Committee considers necessary and
     appropriate for the implementation of the Plan.

2.   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION.  All members of the Company's Board of
     Directors on November, 1993 shall be eligible for participation in the
     Plan.  Eligible Directors who elect to participate in accordance with
     Section 3 will become "Participants".

3.   DEFERRED COMPENSATION.

     A.   Each Participant may make an irrevocable election in writing to defer
          up to 100% of Compensation, as defined in Subsection 3B, paid for the
          period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 (the "Deferral
          Amount").  Such amount shall not be less than $1,000.  Deferred
          compensation at the deferral percentage will be deducted from all
          Compensation payable to the Participant during the deferral period.

     B.   "Compensation" means director's fees and meeting fees payable by the
          Company to the Participant.

     C.   The Company shall establish and maintain a bookkeeping account in the
          name of each Participant, which shall be known as the "Deferral
          Account".  It shall be credited with the Deferral Amount and interest
          at the rate established by the Committee compounded annually from
          January 1, 1994.  As provided in Section 5 of the Plan, the interest
          rate on lump sum payments caused by certain events will differ from
          the rate established by the Committee.  Amounts paid to the
          Participant or a designated Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, shall
          be deducted from the account balance as of the first


                                        1
<PAGE>

          day of the month in which such payment is made.

     D.   The Participant's Deferral Account shall at all times be reflected on
          the Company's books in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          practices as a general unsecured and unfunded obligation of the
          Company and the Plan shall not give any person any right or security
          interest in any asset of the Company nor shall it imply any trust or
          segregation of assets by the Company.  Payments from the Participant's
          Deferral Account shall be made from the general assets of the Company.

4.   TIME AND MANNER OF PAYMENT.  The Participant's Deferral Account shall be
     distributed as follows:

     A.   INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.

          (1)  A Participant shall be entitled to fifteen (15) equal annual
               installment payments commencing at age sixty-five (65).

          (2)  A Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1994 may elect, at the time of making the deferral election
               pursuant to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual
               installments commencing at age seventy (70) in lieu of
               installment payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he becomes
               eligible for such payments.

          (3)  A Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1994 and who was a Director of the Company on November 7, 1984
               may elect, at the time of making the deferral election pursuant
               to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual installments
               commencing at age seventy-two (72) in lieu of installment
               payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he becomes eligible for such
               payments.

          Installment payments shall be calculated to amortize fully the
          accumulated value of the Deferral Amount over the payment period.  For
          purposes of this Subsection A, the interest rate to be credited in the
          calculation of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount shall be
          the rate(s) established by the Committee at its sole discretion prior
          to the beginning of the deferral period.

     B.   INTERIM PAYMENTS.  A payment equal to the Participant's Deferral
          Amount shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2001 if installment payments under Subsection A have not
          then commenced and will not commence during the 2001 calendar year.
          In addition, a payment equal to the Participant's Deferral Amount
          shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2002 if installment payments under Subsection A have not
          then commenced and will not commence during the 2002 calendar year.
          These


                                        2
<PAGE>

          payments shall be charged to the Participant's Deferral Account as of
          the first day of the month in which the payment(s) is made.  This
          Subsection does not apply to Participants terminated under Section 5.

5.   DISHONEST CONDUCT.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if
     Participant's directorship with the Company is terminated at any time for
     reason of dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to the Company, the
     sole amount payable to or on behalf of Participant hereunder shall be a
     lump sum payment of the accumulated value of the Participant's Deferral
     Amount, payable as soon as practicable after such termination.  For
     purposes of this Section 5, no interest is to be credited to the Deferral
     Amount.

6.   PAYMENT UPON DEATH OF PARTICIPANT.

     A.   If a Participant dies after age sixty-five (65), then the Company
          shall pay any unpaid annual Installment Payments due the Participant
          under Subsection 4A to the Participant's Beneficiary, commencing with
          the next such payment due following the date of Participant's death.

     B.   If a Participant dies prior to age sixty-five (65), Installment
          Payments described in Subsection 4A(1) shall be payable to the
          Participant's Beneficiary, commencing at the time of the Participant's
          death.  Interim Payments described in Subsection 4B will not be made.

7.   BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  A Participant may from time to time designate any
     legal or natural person or persons (who may be designated contingently or
     successively) as the Beneficiary to whom payments are to be made if the
     Participant dies before receiving payment of all amounts due hereunder, by
     signing a form approved by the Committee.  A beneficiary designation form
     shall be effective only after the signed form is filed with the Committee
     while the Participant is alive.  A properly filed designation shall cancel
     all beneficiary designation forms filed earlier.  If a Participant fails to
     designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated
     Beneficiaries of a Participant die before the Participant, or before
     complete payment of all amounts due hereunder, the Committee, in its
     discretion, may direct the Company to pay the unpaid amounts to one or more
     of such Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage in any
     manner permitted by law which the Committee considers to be appropriate,
     including but not limited to payment to the legal representative or
     representatives of the estate of the last to die of Participant and
     Participant's designated Beneficiaries.

8.   FACILITY OF PAYMENT.  If, in the Committee's opinion, a Participant or
     other person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal
     disability or is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his
     financial affairs, then the Committee may, until claim is made by a
     conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his person or
     of his estate, direct the Company to make payment to a relative or friend
     of such person for his benefit.  Thereafter, any benefits under the


                                        3
<PAGE>

     Plan to which such Participant or other person is entitled shall be paid to
     such conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his
     person of his estate.

9.   INSURANCE.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, purchase a policy or
     policies of insurance on the life of any Participant, the cash value, if
     any, and proceeds of which may, but need not, be used by the Employer to
     satisfy part or all of its obligations, hereunder.  The Company will be the
     owner of any such policies and neither the Participant nor any other person
     or entity claiming through the Participant shall have any ownership rights
     in such policies or any proceeds thereof.  The Participant, as a condition
     of receiving any benefits hereunder, on behalf of himself or any person or
     entity claiming through him, shall cooperate with the Company in obtaining
     any such insurance that the Company desires to purchase by submitting to
     such physical examinations, completing such forms, and making such records
     available as may be required by the Company from time to time.

10.  NON-ALIENATION.  Neither a Participant nor anyone claiming through him
     shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey
     the right to receive any payments hereunder, which payments and the rights
     thereto hereby are expressly declared to be non-assignable and
     non-transferable, nor shall any such right to receive payments hereunder be
     subject to the claims of creditors of a Participant or anyone claiming
     through him to any legal, equitable, or other proceeding or process for the
     enforcement of such claims.

11.  TAX WITHHOLDING.  The Company may withhold from any payment made by it
     under the Plan such amount or amounts as may be required for purposes of
     complying with the tax withholding or other provisions of the Internal
     Revenue Code or the Social Security Act or any state or local income tax
     act or for purposes of paying any estate, inheritance or other tax
     attributable to any amounts payable hereunder.

12.  NON-SECURED PROMISE.  The rights under this Plan of a Participant and any
     person or entity claiming through him shall be solely those of an
     unsecured, general creditor of the Company.  Any insurance policy or other
     asset acquired or held by the Company shall not be deemed to be held by the
     Company for or on behalf of a Participant, or any other person, or to be
     security for the performance of any obligations hereunder of the Company,
     but shall, with respect to this Plan, be and remain a general, unpledged,
     unrestricted asset of the Company.

13.  INDEPENDENCE OF PLAN.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
     Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other agreement or
     that may exist from time to time between the parties hereto.  This Plan
     shall not be deemed to constitute a right to be retained as a member of the
     Board of Directors of the Company.

14.  PARAGRAPH HEADINGS.  The Paragraph headings used in this Plan are for
     convenience of


                                        4
<PAGE>

     reference only and shall not be considered in construing this Plan.

15.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL EFFECT.  Neither the Committee nor the Company
     makes any representations or warranties, express or implied, or assumes any
     responsibility concerning the legal, tax, or other implications or effects
     of this Plan.

16.  COMMITTEE DETERMINATIONS FINAL.  Each determination provided for in the
     Plan shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee.  Any such
     determination shall be binding on all persons.

17.  AMENDMENT.  The Company may in its sole discretion amend the Plan from time
     to time.  No such amendment shall reduce a Participant's or Beneficiary's
     benefits under the Plan to an amount less than an amount that he would have
     been entitled to under the Plan on the later of the date the amendment is
     adopted or made effective if the Plan had been terminated on that date.

18.  TERMINATION AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION.  Notwithstanding any other provision
     of this Plan, the Company may terminate this Plan at any time if the
     Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any change
     in federal or state law, or judicial or administrative interpretation
     thereof, has materially affected the Company's cost of providing the
     benefits otherwise payable under this Plan, or for any other reason
     whatsoever.  Upon such termination, the sole amount payable to Participant
     shall be a lump sum payment, as soon as practicable after such termination,
     of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount.  For purposes of this
     Section, the rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated
     value of the Deferral Amount shall be the rate specified for Installment
     Payments in Subsection 4A.

19.  SUCCESSORS, ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS.  The terms and
     conditions of this Plan and each Deferral Election shall inure to the
     benefit of and bind the Company, the Participants, their successors,
     assigns, and personal representatives.

20.  CONTROLLING LAW.  The Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws
     of the state of Illinois to the extent not pre-empted by laws of the United
     States of America.
