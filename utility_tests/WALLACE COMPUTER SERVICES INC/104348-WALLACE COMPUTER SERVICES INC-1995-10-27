 Wallace Computer Services, Inc.                                Fiscal 1995 10-K

                                     Part I

Item 1    Business
- ------    --------
          As used in this report, the term "Company" is used to refer to the
          Registrant and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Visible Computer Supply
          Corporation.

          (a)  Development of Business

               The Registrant was organized in June l963 as "Wallace Business
               Forms, Inc.", a Delaware corporation and is the successor to an
               Illinois corporation known as "Wallace Press, Inc." that was
               merged into the Registrant in August 1963.  To better reflect the
               nature of the Company's business, the Registrant changed its
               corporate name in November 1981 from "Wallace Business Forms,
               Inc." to "Wallace Computer Services, Inc."

          (b)  Industry Segment

               The Company is engaged predominantly in the computer services and
               supply industry.  Wallace sells a broad line of products and
               services including business forms, commercial and promotional
               graphics printing, computer labels, machine ribbons, computer
               hardware and software, computer accessories, office products, and
               electronic forms.

          (c)  Narrative Description of Business

               (1)  Principal Products and Services

                    Principal products and services supplied by the Company
                    include the design, manufacture and sale of both paper based
                    and electronic business forms, industrial and consumer
                    catalogs, directories and price lists, pressure sensitive
                    labels, prime labels, computer and business machine ribbons,
                    a standard line of office products forms, and direct mail
                    promotional printing.  The Company also markets computer
                    accessory supplies, office supplies, and computer hardware
                    and software.


                    The only class of similar products that contributed 10% or
                    more of total sales for the past three years is printed
                    products.  The contribution of printed products to total
                    sales was 90% for fiscal 1995, 90% for fiscal 1994, and 89%
                    for fiscal 1993.

- ------    ----------

               (2)  The principal raw material used by the Company is paper
                    which is purchased in the open market from numerous
                    suppliers in a variety of weights, widths, color and
                    sizes.

                    The Company believes that it has adequate sources of supply
                    of raw materials to meet the requirements of its business.
                    The Company's current inventory levels are in line with the
                    inventory levels necessary to satisfy customer demand that
                    the Company anticipates for fiscal year 1996.

               (3)  Although certain features of the Company's products and
                    manufacturing processes are covered by owned or licensed
                    patents, the Company does not consider patents to be
                    critical to its business.

                    The Company believes that principal factors in its success
                    include its engineering, manufacturing, distribution and
                    information services capabilities, and its salesforce.

               (4)  The tax forms product lines (which account for less than
                    2% of consolidated net sales) are sold primarily in the
                    first six months of the Company's fiscal year.

               (5)  The Company continues to maintain a strong working capital
                    position, with a current ratio of 3.9 at July 31, 1995 (3.8
                    at July 31, 1994).  The Company funds its operating needs
                    through internally generated funds.  The Company has not
                    borrowed any money for working capital since 1974.

                    Business conditions require the Company to produce and
                    store inventories to meet its customers' requirements.
                    Custom and stock finished goods inventories are stored
                    throughout the United States in both public and company-
                    owned warehouses.  Finished products represent 64.7% of
                    total inventory at July 31, 1995.

                    Substantially all of the Company's sales are made on terms
                    of Net 30 days.  The accounts receivable balance at July 31,
                    1995, increased by 33.8%, in line with the increase in
                    fourth quarter sales.  Further information on liquidity and
                    capital resources is contained in Management's Discussion
                    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                    Operations on page 22 of the Company's Annual Report to
                    Stockholders for 1995, which is incorporated herein by
                    reference.

               (6)  The Company is not dependent upon any one customer or a
                    group of customers under common control.  No single
                    customer or group of customers accounts for more than 10% of
                    consolidated net sales.

               (7)  Within the computer services and supply industry, the
                    Company sells its products through three distribution
                    channels:  1) a direct sales force of approximately 700
                    employee sales representatives, 2) direct mail catalogs sent
                    to the customer, and 3) the office products wholesaler/
                    dealer distribution network.

                    The predominant distribution channel is the direct sales
                    force.  The Company hires college graduates who start at a
                    base salary of $20,000 plus commissions.  Sales
                    representatives are placed in one of the Company's 160 sales
                    offices located throughout the United States and are
                    assigned a specific geographic territory.  Within this
                    assigned territory, a sales representative is free to sell
                    all of the Company's products to any customer.  Sales
                    support for the direct sales force is provided by the
                    Corporate Marketing department.  The Company has identified
                    the following specific markets as large users of its product
                    lines:  financial services, telecommunications, retail,
                    transportation/distribution, utilities, and healthcare.

                    The direct mail catalog operation accounts for approximately
                    2% of the Company's sales.  Customers are offered products
                    through a general catalog, plus monthly flyers that offer
                    special pricing on a limited number of products.  The
                    general catalog carries approximately 8,000 items.  Most of
                    the paper-based products in the catalog are produced by the
                    Company.  Products sold through the catalog are either drop-
                    shipped directly from the manufacturer to the customer, or
                    shipped from the Company's warehouses in California,
                    Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

                    The office products wholesaler/dealer distribution network
                    accounts for less than 13% of the Company's sales.  The
                    network is accessed through the use of the Company's direct
                    sales force, who are paid a salary plus commissions.  The
                    wholesaler/dealer distribution network is located throughout
                    the United States and Canada.  The product line sold
                    through the network consists mainly of office and paper
                    products and computer supplies.  The Company is also doing
                    an increasing amount of business with the office
                    superstores, which are estimated to control approximately
                    one-fourth of the office products market.

Item l    Continued

               (8)  The principal markets served by the Company are business
                    forms, commercial printing, pressure sensitive labels, and
                    office/computer products.

                    Within the business form market, the Company is one of the
                    few firms in the United States that is positioned to
                    accommodate the needs of large, forms-intensive customers
                    with multiple locations.  These customers typically require
                    a forms vendor with the following characteristics:

                    a. sufficient forms manufacturing capacity across several
                       regions of the U.S. to satisfy their needs;

                    b. distribution capability across several regions of the
                       U.S. to deliver multiple types of forms to hundreds of
                       locations on short notice (the consequence of a supply
                       disruption often being the cessation of the customer's
                       business); and

                    c. the information services capability to provide
                       centralized billing, reporting, forms management, and
                       control for such shipments.

                    The Company is well positioned to meet customer needs in
                    the above three respects.  For many large, forms-intensive
                    customers with multiple locations, the only acceptable
                    vendors other than the Company are Moore Corporation
                    Limited and The Standard Register Company.

                    The Company also sells business forms to customers that are
                    not large, forms-intensive firms with multiple locations.
                    These customers typically have a choice from among many
                    different acceptable vendors, and the Company accordingly
                    faces more competition than it does in sales to large,
                    forms-intensive customers with multiple locations.

                    The commercial printing market served by the Company
                    includes the design and manufacture of industrial and
                    consumer catalogs, directories and price lists that require
                    computer manipulation of data for electronic type
                    composition.  The Company primarily competes with commercial
                    printers.  This market is highly competitive and is very
                    large in comparison to the Company's sales in this area,
                    with most work being done on a job bid basis.

                    with over 1,800 converters in the United States.  This
                    market is estimated to total approximately $2.75 billion.

                    The Company is both a manufacturer and distributor for the

                    relating to development of new products and improvement of
                    existing products (none of which are customer sponsored).
                    The amounts that the Company spends on research activities
                    are not significant in relation to annual sales volume.

                    governing the discharge of materials into the environment
                    has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect
                    on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or
                    competitive position.

               (11) The total number of persons employed by the Company was
                    3,765 as of July 31, 1995.

          THE MOORE ACTION.  On July 31, 1995, Moore Corporation Limited
          ("Moore") and FRDK, Inc. ("FRDK") commenced an action in the United
          States District Court for the District of Delaware by filing a
          complaint (the "Moore Action") against the Company and each of the
          directors of the Company, entitled MOORE CORPORATION LIMITED AND FRDK,
          INC. V. WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC., ROBERT J. CRONIN, THEODORE
          DIMITRIOU, FRED F. CANNING, WILLIAM N. LANE, III, NEELE E. STEARNS,
          JR., R. DARRELL EWERS, RICHARD F. DOYLE AND WILLIAM E. OLSEN.  The
          Moore Action, as amended by the Amended and Supplemental Complaint
          filed on October 17, 1995, asserts, among other things, that the use
          of certain anti-takeover devices and other defensive measures by the
          Company is not proportionate nor within the range of reasonable
          responses to the tender offer made by FRDK, a wholly owned subsidiary
          of Moore, to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of the
          Company, together with associated preferred stock purchase rights (the
          "Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
          March 14, 1990 (the "Rights Agreement"), at a price of $60.00, net to
          the seller in cash (the "Offer"), and is in breach of the directors'
          fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders.  The Moore Action also
          asserts that the Offer and a merger with FRDK or another wholly owned
          subsidiary of Moore (the "Proposed Merger") and proxy solicitation
          comply or will comply with all applicable laws and other obligations
          and seeks a declaratory judgment that the Offer and the Proposed
          Merger and proxy solicitation comply with all applicable laws and
          other obligations.  The Moore Action seeks: (i) preliminary and
          permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Company, its directors,
          officers and certain other related parties from taking steps to impede
          the ability of the Company's stockholders to consider and make their
          own determination as to whether to accept the terms of the Offer or
          give or withhold consent to the terms of the proxy solicitation, or
          taking any other action to thwart or interfere with the Offer, the
          Proposed Merger or the proxy solicitation; (ii)(a) to compel the
          Company's directors to redeem the Rights or amend the Rights Agreement
          to make the Rights inapplicable to the Offer and the Proposed Merger,
          and (b) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the
          Company, its directors, officers and certain other related parties
          from taking any action to implement and distribute the Rights and from
          taking actions pursuant to the Rights Agreement; (iii)(a) to compel
          the Company's directors to approve the Offer and the Proposed Merger
          for the purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
          Law ("Section 203"), and (b) preliminary and permanent injunctive
          relief enjoining the Company, its directors, officers and certain
          other related parties from taking any actions to enforce or apply
          Section 203 that would interfere with the Offer; and (iv)(a) to compel
          the Company's directors to approve the Offer and the


                                       10

          Proposed Merger for purposes of Article Ninth of the Restated
          Certificate of Incorporation of the Company ("Article Ninth"), and
          (b) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining the Company,
          its directors, officers and certain other related parties from taking
          any actions to enforce or apply Article Ninth that would interfere
          with the Offer.  On August 15, 1995, the Company and each of the
          directors of the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the Moore Action.
          On September 19, 1995, the United States District Court for the
          District of Delaware denied the Motion to dismiss the Moore Action.
          On September 25, 1995, the Company and its directors filed an Answer
          and Counterclaim in the United States District Court for the District
          of Delaware in connection with the Moore Action.  The counterclaim
          brought against Moore, Bidder and Reto Braun, Chairman of the Board
          and Chief Executive Officer of Moore, asserts (i) that the effect of
          the transactions contemplated by the Offer to Purchase may be
          substantially to lessen competition in a relevant market and
          therefore violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 18;
          and (ii) that Moore, the Bidder, and Mr. Braun have made false and
          misleading statements of fact in connection with the Offer and their
          proxy solicitation materials.  The counterclaim seeks declaratory and
          injunctive relief (i) enjoining Moore and the Bidder from acquiring
          any voting securities of the Company and (ii) enjoining Moore, the
          Bidder and Mr. Braun from acquiring any shares of Common Stock of
          the Company until 60 days after they have fully complied with the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

          STOCKHOLDER ACTIONS.  The Company and its directors have been named as
          defendants in three purported class actions filed between July 31,
          1995 and August 3, 1995 on behalf of the public stockholders of the
          Company in the

          SERVICES, INC. (collectively, the "Stockholder Actions").  The
          complaints in the Stockholder Actions contain substantially similar
          allegations, and allege breach of fiduciary duty claims arising out of
          the proposal by FRDK to acquire the Company.  The complaints in the
          Stockholder Actions also seek substantially similar relief, including
          declaratory and injunctive relief barring defendants from breaching
          their fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and the putative class members
          and taking steps to impede any offer to acquire the Company, as well
          as damages in an unspecified amount.  On September 22, 1995, the
          plaintiffs in KOFF V. DIMITRIOU, ET AL. and LAPERRIERE V. WALLACE
          COMPUTER SERVICES, INC. ET AL. filed an Amended Class Action
          Complaint, which, among other things, consolidates the actions such
          plaintiffs filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.
          The Amended Class Action Complaint, among other things, seeks
          injunctive relief with respect to enforcement of certain amendments to
          the Company's Profit Sharing Plan and Profit Sharing Trust.

                         WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC.
                            EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN
                      (Restated to Reflect Amendment No. 3)


SECTION 1.  PURPOSE OF PLAN.  The purpose of this Plan is to provide a means of
providing reward for performance and incentive for future performance, in
addition to salaries and other benefits to employees (including officers) of
WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC. and its subsidiaries ("Company") in managerial
and other important positions who contribute materially to the success of the
Company's business by their ability, ingenuity and industry, and demonstrated by
results shown in the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Reports to
Stockholders.  This Plan is designed to include only a select group of
management or highly compensated employees.

SECTION 2.  GENERAL DEFINITIONS.

(a)    The term "Committee" shall mean the Compensation Committee of the
       Company's Board of Directors, as from time to time constituted.

(b)    The term "Employee" shall mean persons employed by the Company or any
       subsidiary in which the Company owns directly or indirectly all or
       substantially all of the common stock and shall include employees who are
       also directors of the Company or any such subsidiary and may, in the
       discretion of the Committee, include persons who at the request of the
       Company accept employment with any company in which the Company has a
       substantial ownership interest.

(c)    The term "Participant" as used in this Plan shall include the
       beneficiaries designated by a participant as provided in Section 6(b) or
       if no such designation of any beneficiary has been made, the
       Participant's legal representatives or other persons entitled to any
       payment or benefit with respect to the Participant pursuant to this Plan.

SECTION 3.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee in a manner consistent with the
By-Laws of the Company.

SECTION 4.  ELIGIBILITY.

(a)    An Employee shall be eligible for consideration for an Award under this
       Plan based on such criteria as the Committee shall from year to year
       determine.  A person whose
<PAGE>

       employment terminates during the year or who is granted a leave of
       absence during the year, and who at the time of such termination of
       employment or granting of leave is eligible for consideration of bonus,
       may, at the discretion of the Committee and under such rules as the
       Committee may from time to time approve, be awarded a bonus with respect
       to the period of his services during the year.

(b)    No bonus shall be awarded to a member of the Committee. Membership on any
       other committee of the Board of Directors shall not itself render an
       Employee ineligible for a bonus award.

(c)    Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as preventing the Company from
       establishing incentive or other variable compensation plans applicable to
       Employees.

SECTION 5.1  CASH AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS.

(a)    Awards under the Plan shall be made on a deferred payment basis.  The
       Cash Award made by the Committee shall not exceed 66-2/3% (.6666) of any
       current cash bonus paid to a Participant.  The amount of each Cash Award
       shall be credited to the Participant on the books of the Company, but
       will not otherwise be set aside from the Company's other funds.

(b)    No Participant shall have any right with respect to any Cash Award until
       such award shall have been delivered to him.

(c)    There shall be deducted from all payments of Cash Awards under the Plan,
       any taxes required by law to be withheld.

SECTION 5.2  STOCK EQUIVALENT AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS.

(a)    At the sole discretion and consent of the Committee, a Participant may
       convert a Cash Award (either on a current basis from time to time, or
       with respect to Cash Awards previously granted) into hypothetical common
       stock of the Company to be credited to the Participant ("Stock
       Equivalent").

(b)    When a Stock Equivalent is elected by a Participant, the Stock Equivalent
       shall be valued at an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of an actual
       share of the Company's common stock ("Stock") on the date of the award or
       conversion and shall be credited to the Participant on the books of the
       Company.  For the purposes of the Plan, the Fair Market Value of a share
       of Stock at any date will be either:

       (i)   the closing price of the Stock as reported in the New York Stock
             Exchange Composite Transaction Table in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, on
             that date; or
<PAGE>

       (ii)  if such shares are not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange
             or so reported (or determined by the Committee to be improperly
             reported), then as established by the Committee.

(c)    Stock Equivalent Awards shall not entitle a Participant or any other
       person succeeding to the Participant's rights, to any voting or other
       rights as a stockholder of the Company, except to the extent of parallel
       dividend payments set forth in Paragraph 6(e) below.

(d)    Stock Equivalent Awards granted hereunder shall be subject to adjustment,
       in the event of changes in the outstanding Stock by reason of stock
       dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers,
       consolidations, combinations, exchanges or other relevant changes in
       capitalization occurring after the date of the Stock Equivalent Award to
       the same extent as would effect an actual share of Stock issued or
       outstanding on the effective date of such change.  The Committee, in its
       sole discretion, may make such adjustments as it determines to be
       appropriate.

SECTION 6.  PAYMENT OF AWARDS.

(a)    Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 6(c) of the Plan, payment
       of Award balances shall be made in 120 monthly installments commencing on
       the first day of the calendar quarter following the month in which the
       Participant's employment with the Company terminates ("Termination
       Date").  In lieu of installment payments, the Committee, after
       consultation with the Participant, may pay any amount due in a lump sum.
       In the event that a Stock Equivalent Award has been credited to a
       Participant, the Fair Market Value of the Stock recorded on the books of
       the Company as of the Participant's Termination Date shall be converted
       to a cash balance at any time within the twelve (12) month period
       following the Termination Date, subject to the provisions of this
       Section 6.

(b)    Any Award, or remaining unpaid portions thereof, which becomes payable
       after the death of a Participant, shall be paid in installments or in a
       lump sum to his beneficiaries.  Unless otherwise designated in a written
       form given to the Company, where permitted under the laws of the state in
       which the Participant resides, the written designation of a beneficiary
       filed by a Participant in connection with the Group Life Insurance
       Program of the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
       determine who is to receive any Award standing to the Participant's
       credit at any time under the Plan in the event of such Participant's
       death prior to delivery to him of such Award.

(c)    All Awards are contingently payable and shall be subject to the following
       conditions:
<PAGE>

       1.    That the Participant continue to render services as an Employee of
             the Company until his Normal Retirement Date or Early Retirement
             date, as defined in the Company's Profit Sharing and Retirement
             Fund, which condition shall be waived in the event of death or
             disability of a Participant prior to termination of employment.

       2.    If a Participant at any time engages in any activity that the
             Committee determines, in its discretion, was or is harmful to the
             interests of the Company, the Committee may determine whether or
             not and, if so, the extent to which any unpaid contingent deferred
             installment credited to the Participant shall be forfeited.  This
             subparagraph shall apply: (i) to activities that may occur prior to
             and that do not result in termination of service but which do not
             become known to the Committee until after termination of service;
             (ii) to activities that occur prior to but result in termination of
             service; and (iii) to activities that occur following termination
             of service and during the period when the Participant would
             otherwise be entitled to receive payment of the contingent
             allotments credited to him.  The Committee shall have the
             authority, in its discretion, to determine what kinds of activities
             shall be deemed to be harmful for the purposes of this
             subparagraph.  A determination by the Committee under this
             subparagraph, including its determination as to the time at which
             harmful activities commenced, shall be conclusive.

(d)    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
       6, the Committee shall possess absolute discretion to accelerate or to
       defer the payment of all or part of any remaining unpaid installments to
       the extent that it deems equitable or desirable under the circumstances.

(e)    The Participant's Cash Award Account shall be credited with an assumed
       interest rate of 5% on at least an annual basis.  The Participant's Stock
       Equivalent Account shall be credited on any dividend payment date with a
       dividend amount equal to what would have been payable as if such Stock
       Equivalent represented actually issued Stock.

(f)    The Committee shall provide a Participant, former Participant or
       Beneficiary (hereinafter referred to as "Claimant") who has been denied a
       claim for benefits, a written notice within ninety (90) days of such
       denial setting forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial;
       (b) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial
       is based; (c) if applicable, a description of any additional material or
       information necessary to perfect the claim, and (d) appropriate
       information as to the steps required by the Claimant to request a full
       review of the benefit denial.  The Claimant (or his duly authorized
       representative) who has been denied a benefit may within sixty (60) days
       of such denial request a review of the denial upon written application to
       the Committee.  The Claimant must be able to review all pertinent
<PAGE>

       documents and submit in writing any issues and comments upon which such
       request for review is based.  Within sixty (60) days of receiving such
       request, the Committee shall conduct a full and fair review of the claim
       and its denial and shall furnish the decision on review on the Claimant
       in writing.  Should this decision or review not be communicated to the
       Claimant within sixty (60) days the claim shall be deemed denied.

SECTION 7.  GENERAL CONDITIONS.

       in whole or in part, and if terminated, may reinstate any or all of the
       provisions of the Plan.

       or any person claiming under or through him have any right or interest,

       and shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and any person

       connection with this Plan shall, irrespective of the place where action
       may be brought and irrespective of the place of residence of any such

<PAGE>

       authority and responsibility in the administration of the Plan with
       respect to each individual who was a Participant in the Plan immediately
       prior to the date that the Material Change occurs (a "Protected
       Participant") or with respect to the beneficiary of a Protected
       Participant, shall be subject to a DE NOVO standard of review by a court
       in any action brought by a Protected Participant.

10.4   MATERIAL CHANGE DEFINED.  For purposes of this Section 10, a "Material
       Change" shall be deemed to have occurred if any of the following should
       occur:

       (a)   the acquisition (in one or more transactions) of beneficial
             ownership of thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the outstanding
             shares of Common Stock of the Company by any person or entity (or
             by any group of persons or entities acting in concert for the
             purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of shares of the
             Company's Common Stock);

       (b)   the election (in one or more elections) as directors comprising
             one-fourth (1/4) of the Board of Directors of the Company of
             persons who were not nominated or recommended by the Company's
             incumbent Board of Directors; or

       (c)   the occurrence of any other event or state of facts that the Board
             of Directors of the Company may determine (by the adoption of a
             resolution) has, does, or would constitute a Material Change for
             the purposes of this Section 10.

10.5   RELATED COMPANY DEFINED.  The term "Related Company" means any
       corporation, trade, or business during any period that is, along with the
       Company, a member of a controlled group of corporations, a controlled
       group of trades or businesses, or an affiliated service group, as
       described in Sections 414(b), 414(c), or 414(m), respectively, of the
       Code.

10.6   ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES.  Any Protected Participant
       (or a Beneficiary of a Protected Participant) who brings any legal action
       after a Material Change to enforce the provisions of this Section 10 or
       any other provisions of the Plan shall be entitled to recover from the
       Company any and all attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred
       in enforcing such provisions for his benefit or for the benefit of any or
       all Protected Participants (or Beneficiaries of Protected Participants).

10.7   BINDING ON SUCCESSORS.  The provisions of the Plan shall be binding upon
       and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, any Related Company that
       adopts the Plan, the Participants, and their respective successors in
       interest and assigns, including, without limitation, the surviving
       corporation in any merger or consolidation with the Company or such
       Related Company and, to the extent provided in the Plan, the
       Beneficiaries of the Participants.  After a Material Change, except as
       may otherwise be determined by a
<PAGE>

       resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted prior to the
       occurrence of the Material Change, a successor in interest to the Company
       or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall be deemed to have adopted
       the Plan and shall have all of the liabilities and obligations of the
       Company or that Related Company under the Plan.  Except as may otherwise
       be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company
       adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, the Company shall
       require any person or entity that becomes a successor in interest to the
       Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan to expressly assume the
       Plan and agree to perform all of the obligations of the Company or that
       Related Company, as the case may be, under the Plan.  For purposes of
       this Section 10.7, following a Material Change, a "successor in interest"
       to the Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall include,
       without limitation, any person or entity (or group of related or
       affiliated persons or entities) that acquires (in a single transaction or
       a series of related transactions) any businesses or assets of the Company
       or such related Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of
       the Company's or such Related Company's sales, operating profits, or
       operating assets.

10.8   AMENDMENT OF SECTION 10.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
       Plan, except as may otherwise be provided in a resolution of the Board of
       Directors of the Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material
       Change, the provisions of this Section 10 may not be amended and shall
       continue to apply, without amendment, in any successor plan.

     Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"). The Committee shall
     have the authority to make determinations provided for or permitted to be
     made under the Plan, to interpret the Plan, and to promulgate such rules
     and regulations, if any, as the Committee considers necessary and
     appropriate for the implementation of the Plan.

2.   Eligibility and Participation. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall
     establish eligibility qualifications for participation in the Plan.
     Participation shall be limited to key executives and a select group of
     highly compensated employees of the Employers.

3.   Deferred Compensation.

     A.   Each Participant may make an irrevocable election in writing to defer
          up to 20% of Compensation, as defined in Subsection 3B, paid during
          the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 (the "Deferral
          Amount"). Such amount shall not be less than $1,000. Deferred
          compensation at the deferral percentage will be deducted from all
          Compensation payable to the Participant during the deferral period.

     B.   "Compensation" means salary, bonuses, and commission of the
          Participant before reduction pursuant to this or any other employee
          benefit plan.

     C.   The Employer shall establish and maintain a bookkeeping account in the
          name of each Participant, which shall be known as the "Deferral
          Account." It shall be credited with the Deferral Amount and interest
          at the rate established by the Committee compounded annually from
          January 1, 1995. As provided in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Plan,
          the interest rate on lump sum payments caused by certain events will
          differ from the rate established by the Committee. Amounts paid to the
          Participant or his/her Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, shall be
          deducted from the account balance as of the first day of the month in
          which such payment is made.

     D.   The Participant's Deferral Account shall at all times be reflected on
          the Employer's books in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          practices as a general unsecured and unfunded obligation of the
          Employer and the Plan shall not give any person any right or security
          interest in any asset of the Employer nor shall it imply any trust or
          segregation of assets by the Employer. Payments from the Participant's
          Deferral Account shall be made from the general assets of the
          Employer.
<PAGE>

4.   Time and Manner of Payment. The Participant's Deferral Account shall be
     distributed as follows:

     A.   Installment Payments.

          (1)  A Participant shall be entitled to fifteen (15) equal annual
               installment payments commencing at age sixty-five (65) if one of
               the following conditions is met:

               a.   the Participant remains in the continuous employ of the
                    Employers during the period from January 1, 1995 until the
                    Participant reaches age sixty-five (65); or

               b.   after a period of continuous employment with the Employers
                    beginning on or before January 1, 1995 the Participant
                    retires as defined in Subsection 4D.

          (2)  Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1995 may elect, at the time of making the deferral election
               pursuant to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual
               installments commencing at age seventy (70) in lieu of
               installment payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he/she becomes
               eligible for such payments.

               Installment payments shall be calculated to amortize fully the
               accumulated value of the Deferral Amount over the payment period.
               For purposes of this Subsection A, the interest rate to be
               credited in this calculation of the accumulated value of the
               Deferral Amount shall be the rate(s) established by the Committee
               at its sole discretion prior to the beginning of the deferral
               period.

     B.   Interim Payments. A payment equal to the Participant's Deferral Amount
          shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2002 if installment payments under Subsection A have not
          then commenced and will not commence during the 2002 calendar year. In
          addition, a payment equal to the Participant's Deferral Amount shall
          be paid to the Participant within a reasonable time after January 1,
          2003 if installment payments under Subsection A have not then
          commenced and will not commence during the 2003 calendar year. These
          payments shall be charged to the Participant's Deferral Account as of
          the first day of the month in which the payment is made. This
          Subsection does not apply to Participants terminated under Subsection
          C or Sections 5, 6, or 7B.

     C.   Payment Upon Termination. A Participant whose employment with the
          Employers is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated prior to the
          Participant's Retirement for reasons other than those described in
          Sections 5 and 6 below, shall receive, as soon as practicable after
          such termination, a lump sum payment in the amount of the accumulated
          value of the Deferral Amount. For purposes of this Subsection C, the
          rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated value of the
          Deferral Amount shall be six percent (6%).

     D.   Retirement. Retirement shall mean leaving the active employ of the
          Employer at or after age sixty (60) or age fifty-five (55) with at
          least twenty (20) years of service.

5.   Non-Competition. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the
     Committee at any time determines that a Participant, without having
     obtained the prior written consent of the Committee or its designee, has
     engaged in Competition with an Employer, as defined below,
<PAGE>

     the sole amount payable to Participant hereunder shall be a lump sum
     payment of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount, payable as soon as
     practicable after such determination. For purposes of this Section 5, the
     simple rate of interest applied to determine the accumulated value of the
     Deferral Amount shall be two percent (2%) annually, without compounding. A
     Participant shall be considered to have engaged in "Competition with an
     Employer" if, while employed by an Employer or within twenty-four (24)
     months of Participant's termination of employment with an Employer: (a) if
     the Participant is or has been employed by an Employer in a sales capacity,
     the Participant sells to, contacts, or deals with customers of an Employer
     that the Participant called upon, or whose account(s) the Participant
     directly or indirectly supervised on behalf of an Employer with respect to
     products or services of an Employer; (b) if the Participant is or has been
     employed by an Employer in a nonsales capacity, the Participant renders
     services for a new or existing competitor of an Employer with respect to
     products or services that are competitive with those of an Employer within
     the geographical area in which an Employer does business, except that the
     Participant may accept employment with a competitor of an Employer whose
     business is diversified and which part of its business is not a competitor
     of an Employer provided that prior to accepting such employment, the
     Participant provides and obtains for the Employers from such competitor,
     separate written assurances satisfactory to the Employers that the
     Participant will not render services directly or indirectly in connection
     with one or more products or services that are competitive with those of an
     Employer; and (c) the Participant hires, solicits, induces or attempts to
     induce any employee of an Employer to leave its employ, engage in any
     competing business, or to otherwise aid or assist any person or company
     that is or intends to be in competition with an Employer.

     The foregoing provision shall be deemed in addition to and not in lieu of
     any rights or remedies that an Employer might otherwise have with respect
     to the conduct of a Participant during or after employment that breaches
     any other contractual or common law duty to the Employer; this Section
     shall not preclude Employer from seeking injunctive relief or actual or
     punitive monetary damages, or both such relief and damages, with respect to
     any wrongful conduct of a Participant, either during or subsequent to
     his/her employment with an Employer.

6.   Dishonest Conduct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if
     Participant's employment with an Employer is terminated at any time for
     reason of dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to the Employer, the
     sole amount payable to or on behalf of Participant hereunder shall be a
     lump sum payment of the accumulated value of the Participant's Deferral
     Amount, payable as soon as practicable after such termination of
     employment. For purposes of this Section 6, the simple rate of interest to
     be credited in the calculation of the accumulated value of the Deferral
     Amount shall be zero percent (0%).

7.   Payment Upon Death of Participant.

     A.   If a Participant dies after age sixty-five (65), the Employer shall
          pay any unpaid annual Installment Payments due the Participant under
          Subsection 4A to the Participant's Beneficiary, commencing with the
          next such payment due following the date of Participant's death.

     B.   If a Participant dies prior to age sixty-five (65), Installment
          Payments described in Subsection 4A(1) shall be payable to the
          Participant's Beneficiary, commencing at the time of the Participant's
          death. Interim Payments described in Subsection 4B will not be made.
<PAGE>

8.   Beneficiary Designation. A Participant may, from time to time designate any
     legal or natural person or persons (who may be designated contingently or
     successively) as his/her Beneficiary to whom payments are to be made if the
     Participant dies before receiving payment of all amounts due hereunder, by
     signing a form approved by the Committee. A beneficiary designation form
     shall be effective only after the signed form is filed with the Committee
     while the Participant is alive. A properly filed designation shall cancel
     all beneficiary designation forms filed earlier. If a Participant fails to
     designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated
     Beneficiaries of a Participant die before the Participant, or before
     complete payment of all amounts due hereunder, the Committee, in its
     discretion, may direct the Employers to pay the unpaid amounts to one or
     more of such Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage in any
     manner permitted by law which the Committee considers to be appropriate,
     including but not limited to payment to the legal representative or
     representatives of the estate of the last to die of Participant and
     Participant's designated Beneficiaries.

9.   Disability. If Participant's employment with the Employers is terminated
     prior to Participant's Retirement by reason of Participant's Disability,
     Participant's employment with the Employers, for purposes of the Plan,
     shall be deemed to continue until the earliest of his/her death, the date
     his/her Disability ceases, or the date the Participant would have first
     been eligible for Retirement and the provisions of the Plan shall be
     applicable to such Participant to the same extent as if Participant were,
     in fact, employed by the Employers during that period. However, if such
     termination of employment occurs prior to January 1, 1996, the
     Participant's benefit will be determined taking into account only the
     amount actually deferred by the Participant during the Deferral Period.

     A Participant shall be deemed to incur a Disability if, in the opinion of a
     physician selected by the Committee, the Participant is no longer capable
     of performing a substantial portion of the duties of his/her employment
     because of a physical or mental disability which is likely to be permanent
     and continuous during the remainder of the Participant's lifetime.

10.  Payment Upon a Material Change of Control.

     A.   For purposes of this paragraph 10, a "Material Change" shall be deemed
          to have occurred if any of the following should occur:

          (1)  the acquisition (in one or more transactions) of beneficial
               ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding
               shares of Common Stock of the Company by any person or entity (or
               by any group of persons or entities acting in concert for the
               purpose of acquiring, voting, holding or disposing of shares of
               the Company's Common Stock). The Board of Directors may reduce
               the ownership threshold to a percentage not less than ten percent
               (10%);

          (2)  the election (in one or more elections) as directors comprising
               one-fourth (1/4) or more of the Board of Directors of the Company
               of persons who were not nominated or recommended by the Company's
               incumbent Board of Directors; or

          (3)  the occurrence of any other event or state of facts that the
               Board of Directors of the Company may determine (by the adoption
               of a resolution) has, does, or would constitute a Material Change
               for the purposes of this paragraph 10.
<PAGE>

     B.   At the time of a Material Change, the Company shall remit to an
          independent Trustee, the cumulative book balance in the Participant's
          Deferral Account, representing individual Deferral Amounts plus
          accrued interest.

          At all times after the Material Change occurs, the exercise of
          authority and responsibility in the administration of the Plan with
          respect to each individual who was a Participant in the Plan
          immediately prior to the date that the Material Change occurs (a
          "Protected Participant"), or with respect to the Beneficiary of a
          Protected Participant, shall be subject to a de novo standard of
          review by a court in any action brought under Title I of ERISA. At all
          times after the Material Change occurs, a bank that is organized under
          the laws of the United States of America or one of its States, that
          has a combined capital and surplus in excess of $250,000,000, and that
          is otherwise independent of and has no material business relationships
          with the Company or Related Company (as defined in paragraph 10C)
          shall be the Trustee of the Trust and the authority to manage,
          acquire, and dispose of all assets of the Trust shall be vested in
          that Trustee to the extent not vested in one or more investment
          managers (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA) who are selected by
          that Trustee and otherwise independent of, and have no material
          business relationships with, the Company or a Related Company.

     C.   The term "Related Company" means any corporation, trade, or business
          during any period that it is, along with the Company, a member of a
          controlled group of corporations, a controlled group of trades or
          businesses, or an affiliated service group, as described in Section
          414(b), 414(c), or 414(m), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code.

     D.   Any Protected Participant (or a Beneficiary of a Protected
          Participant) who brings any legal action after a Material Change to
          enforce the provisions of this paragraph 10 or any other provisions of
          the Plan or the Trust shall be entitled to recover from the Company
          any and all attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in
          enforcing such provisions for his/her benefit or for the benefit of
          any or all Protected Participants (or Beneficiaries of Protected
          Participants).

     E.   Notwithstanding any other Section except Section 6, if the
          Participant's employment with the Employer terminates, for any reason
          other than death, within the two-year (2) period beginning on the date
          that a Material Change of Control of the Company (as described above)
          occurs, payment shall be made to the Participant as soon as practical
          after termination in a single lump sum in lieu of any other subsequent
          payment under the Plan. The lump sum payment shall be equal to the sum
          of the amounts determined by discounting, at an 8% rate of interest,
          to the lump sum payment date, each payment that the Participant would
          have received under the Plan (determined without regard to Sections 5
          and 6) after the date of such termination if employment had continued
          without change through the date that the Participant would have first
          been eligible for Retirement. Such amount shall be determined by the
          Trustee (described in Section 10B), who in his/her own discretion may
          use an independent third party to calculate such amount. If the
          Participant dies after termination of employment but before payment of
          any amount under this Section, then such amount shall be paid to the
          Beneficiary as soon as practical after the Participant's death.
<PAGE>

     F.   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, except as may
          otherwise be provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
          Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, the
          provisions of this paragraph 10 may not be amended and shall continue
          to apply, without amendment, in any successor plan.

11.  Facility of Payment. If, in the Committee's opinion, a Participant or other
     person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal disability or
     is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his/her financial
     affairs, then the Committee may, until claim is made by a conservator or
     other person legally charged with the care of his/her person or of his/her
     estate, direct the Employer to make payment to a relative or friend of such
     person for his/her benefit. Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to
     which such Participant or other person is entitled shall be paid to such
     conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his/her person
     or his/her estate.

12.  Insurance. An Employer may, in its sole discretion, purchase policy or
     policies of insurance on the life of any Participant or disability
     insurance with respect to any Participant, the cash value, if any, and
     proceeds of which may, but need not, be used by the Employer to satisfy
     part or all of its obligations, hereunder. The Employer will be the owner
     of any such policies and neither the Participant nor any other person or
     entity claiming through the Participant shall have any ownership rights in
     such policies or any proceeds thereof. The Participant, as a condition of
     receiving any benefits hereunder, on behalf of him/herself of any person or
     entity claiming through him/her, shall cooperate with the Employer in
     obtaining any such insurance that the Employer desires to purchase by
     submitting to such physical examinations, completing such forms, and making
     such records available as may be required by the Employer from time to
     time.

13.  Effect on Other Benefits. The Deferral Amount of a Participant shall be
     included in the Participant's 1995 compensation for purposes of calculating
     the Participant's bonuses and awards under any incentive or similar
     compensation plan or program of the Employer, insurance, and other employee
     benefits, except that in accordance with the terms of any plan qualified
     under Section 401 or Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code maintained
     by an Employer, the amount deferred under Section 3 shall not be included
     as 1995 calendar year compensation in calculating the Participant's
     benefits or contributions by or on behalf of the Participant under such
     plan or plans. Payment under the Plan shall be excluded from compensation
     in years paid for purposes of calculating a Participant's bonuses and
     awards under any incentive or similar compensation plan or program of an
     Employer, insurance, and other employee benefits, except that in accordance
     with the terms of any plan qualified under Section 401 or Section 423(b) of
     the Internal Revenue Code maintained by an Employer, payments made while
     the Participant is an employee of an Employer shall be included as
     compensation in the year paid.

14.  Non-Alienation. Neither a Participant nor anyone claiming through him/her
     shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey
     the right to receive any payments hereunder, which payments and the rights
     thereto hereby are expressly declared to be non-assignable and non-
     transferable, nor shall any such right to receive payments hereunder be
     subject to the claims of creditors of a Participant or anyone claiming
     through him/her to any legal, equitable, or other proceeding or process for
     the enforcement of such claims.
<PAGE>

15.  Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13, an Employer
     may withhold from any payment made by it under the Plan such amount or
     amounts as may be required for purposes of complying with the tax
     witholding or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the Social
     Security Act or any state or local income tax act or for purposes of paying
     any estate, inheritance or other tax attributable to any amounts payable
     hereunder.

16.  Non-Secured Promise. The rights under this Plan of a Participant and any
     person or entity claiming through him/her shall be solely those of an
     unsecured, general creditor of the Employer. Any insurance policy or other
     asset acquired or held by an Employer shall not be deemed to be held by the
     Employer for or on behalf of a Participant, or any other person, or to be
     security for the performance of any obligations hereunder of the Employer,
     but shall, with respect to this Plan, be and remain a general, unpledged,
     unrestricted asset of the Employer.

17.  Independence of Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
     Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other employment
     agreement or employment benefit agreement or plan or rights that may exist
     from time to time between the parties hereto. This Plan shall not be deemed
     to constitute a contract of employment between an Employer and a
     Participant, nor shall any provision hereof restrict the right of an
     Employer to discharge a Participant, or restrict the right of a Participant
     to terminate his/her employment with an Employer.

18.  Paragraph Headings. The Paragraph headings used in this Plan are for
     convenience of reference only and shall not be considered in construing
     this Plan.

19.  Responsibility for Legal Effect. Neither the Committee nor any Employer
     makes any representation or warranties, express or implied, or assumes any
     responsibility concerning the legal, tax, or other implications or effects
     of this Plan.

20.  Committee Determinations Final. Each determination provided for in this
     Plan shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee. Any such
     determination shall be binding on all persons.

21.  Amendment. The Company may in its sole discretion amend the Plan from time
     to time. No such amendment shall reduce a Participant's or Beneficiary's
     benefits under the Plan to an amount less than an amount that he/she would
     have been entitled to under the Plan on the later of the date the amendment
     is adopted or made effective if the Plan had been terminated on that date.

22.  Termination at the Employer's Option. Notwithstanding any other provision
     of this Plan, the Company may terminate this Plan at any time if the
     Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any change
     in federal or state law, or judicial or administrative interpretation
     thereof, has materially affected the Employer's cost of providing the
     benefits otherwise payable under this Plan, or for any other reason
     whatsoever. Upon such termination, the sole amount payable to Participant
     shall be a lump sum payment, as soon as practicable after such termination,
     of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount. For purposes of this
     Section, the rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated
     value of the Deferral Amount shall be the rate specified for Installment
     Payments in Subsection 4A.
<PAGE>

23.  Binding on Successors. The provisions of this Plan shall be binding upon
     and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, any Related Company that
     adopts the Plan, the Participants, and their respective successors in
     interest and assigns, including, without limitation, the surviving
     corporation in any merger or consolidation with the Company or such Related
     Company and, to the extent provided in the Plan, the Beneficiaries of the
     Participants. After a Material Change, except as may otherwise be
     determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted
     prior to the occurrence of the Material Change, a successor in interest to
     the Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall be deemed to
     have adopted the Plan and shall have all of the liabilities and obligations
     of the Company or that Related Company under the Plan. Except as may
     otherwise be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
     Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, the Company
     shall require any person or entity that becomes a successor in interest to
     the Company or a Related Company that adopts the plan to expressly assume
     the Plan and agree to perform all of the obligations of the Company or that
     Related Company, as the case may be, under the plan. For purposes of this
     paragraph 23, following a Material Change, a successor in interest to the
     Company or a Related Company that adopts the Plan shall include, without
     limitation, any person or entity (or group of related or affiliated persons
     or entities) that acquires (in a single transaction or a series of related

                           LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN
                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1


WHEREAS, Wallace Computer Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), has heretofore adopted and maintains a bonus plan for the benefit of
certain of its employees designated the "Wallace Computer Services, Inc. Long-
Term Performance Plan" (the "Plan");

WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan in certain respects;

NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the power of amendment contained in Section 7(a) of
the Plan, the Plan is amended to add a new section at the end thereof to read as
follows:

Section 10.  MATERIAL CHANGE PROVISIONS.

     10.1  APPLICATION.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the
     provisions of this Section 10 shall apply on and after the date that a
     Material Change (as hereinafter defined) occurs.

     10.2  VESTING AND PAYMENT OF AWARDS.

          (a) VESTING. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 6 to the
          contrary, a Participant's accrued bonus balance under the Plan shall
          in no event be reduced below the amount of the Participant's
          cumulative deferred balance as calculated after inclusion of the
          Participant's award, if any, for the Plan Year immediately preceding
          the Plan Year during which the Material Change occurs.

          (b)  PAYMENT.  Notwithstanding any provision of Section 6 to the
          contrary, an individual who is a Participant immediately prior to the
          occurrence of a Material Change (a "Protected Participant") shall be
          entitled to receive payment of his accrued bonus balance pursuant to
          this paragraph (b) if, at any time during the two-year period
          beginning on the date that the Material Change occurs, the Protected
          Participant's employment with the Company terminates, whether
          voluntarily or involuntarily, for any reason other than for Cause (as
          defined below) or on account of the Protected Participant's death or
          permanent disability.  Such amount shall be paid to the Protected
          Participant (or beneficiary thereof) within ten (10) days after the
          date of such termination of the Protected Participant's employment, in
          the form of a single lump sum.


<PAGE>


          (c)  INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENT.  If any amount to be paid to a
          Protected Participant (or beneficiary thereof) pursuant to paragraph
          (b) of this Subsection is not paid in full within ten (10) days after
          the date of the termination of his employment, then the Company shall
          also pay to that Participant (or beneficiary) interest on the unpaid
          amount for the period between the date of termination of his
          employment and the date that the amount is paid in full.  The amount
          of interest to be paid to a Protected Participant (or beneficiary
          thereof) pursuant to this paragraph shall be computed using an annual
          rate of four (4) percent over the corporate base rate of The First
          National Bank of Chicago (changing as and when such corporate base
          rate changes), compounded monthly.  Payments received by a Protected
          Participant (or beneficiary thereof) under the Plan shall be credited
          first against accrued interest until all accrued interest is paid in
          full before any such payment is credited against the amount payable
          under paragraph (b) of this Subsection.

     10.3  ADMINISTRATION OF PLAN.  At all times after the Material Change
     occurs, the exercise of authority and responsibility in the administration
     of the Plan with respect to each Protected Participant, or with respect to
     a beneficiary of a Protected Participant, shall be subject to a DE NOVO
     standard of review by a court in any action brought by a Protected
     Participant (or beneficiary thereof).

     10.4  MATERIAL CHANGE DEFINED.  For purposes of this Section 10, a
     "Material Change" shall be deemed to have occurred if any the following
     should occur:

     (a)  the acquisition (in one or more transactions) of beneficial ownership
          of thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the outstanding shares of
          common stock of the Company by any person or entity (or by any group
          of persons or entities acting in concert for the purpose of acquiring,
          voting, holding or disposition of the Company's common stock);

     (b)  individuals who, as of September 6, 1995, constitute the Board of
          Directors of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason
          to constitute at least a majority of such Board; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
          that any individual who becomes a member of the Board of Directors of
          the Company subsequent to such date whose election, or nomination for
          election by the stockholders of the Company, was approved by a vote of
          at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent
          Board shall be deemed to be a member of the Incumbent Board; and
          PROVIDED FURTHER, that no individual whose election or initial
          assumption of office as a director of the Company occurs as a result

<PAGE>


          of an actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in
          Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to the election or
          removal of directors, or any other actual or threatened solicitation
          of proxies or consents by or on behalf of any person other than the
          Board of Directors of the Company, shall be deemed to be a member of
          the Incumbent Board; or

     (c)  the occurrence of any other event or state of facts that the Board of
          Directors of the Company may determine (by the adoption of a
          resolution) has, does, or would constitute a "Material Change" for the
          purposes of this Section 10.

     10.5  CAUSE DEFINED.  For the purposes of the Plan, the employment of a
     Protected Participant shall be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause"
     after a Material Change only if:

     (a)  there has been any misappropriation or misapplication by such
          Participant of any properties or assets of the Company on the basis of
          which the employment of such Participant would have been terminated
          under the Company's employment policies and practices as in effect
          immediately prior to such Material Change; or

     (b)  there has been any willful misconduct, gross negligence or criminal
          conduct by such Participant in connection with the operations,
          business or affairs of the Company on the basis of which the
          employment of such Participant would have been terminated under the
          Company's employment policies and practices as in effect immediately
          prior to such Material Change.

     10.6  RELATED COMPANY DEFINED.  The term "Related Company" means any
     corporation, trade or business during any period that is, along with the
     Company, a member of a controlled group of corporations, a controlled group
     of trades or businesses, or an affiliated service group, as described in
     subsections (b), (c) and (m), respectively, of section 414 of the Internal
     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

     10.7  ATTORNEYS' FEES AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES.  Any Protected
     Participant (or beneficiary of a Protected Participant) who brings any
     legal action after a Material Change to enforce the provisions of this
     Section 10 or any other provision of the Plan shall be entitled to recover
     from the Company any and all attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses
     incurred in enforcing such provisions for his or her benefit or for the
     benefit of any or all Protected Participants (or beneficiaries of Protected
     Participants).


<PAGE>


     10.8  BINDING ON SUCCESSORS.  The provisions of the Plan shall be binding
     upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, any Related Company
     that adopts the Plan, the Participants, and their respective successors in
     interest and assigns, including, without limitation, the surviving
     corporation in any merger or consolidation with the Company or such Related
     Company and, to the extent provided in the Plan, the beneficiaries of the
     Participants.  After the occurrence of a Material Change, except as may
     otherwise be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
     Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material Change, a successor
     in interest to the Company, or a Related Company that adopts the Plan,
     shall be deemed to have adopted the Plan and shall have all of the
     liabilities and obligations of the Company or such Related Company under
     the Plan.  Except as may otherwise be determined by a resolution of the
     Board of Directors of the Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a
     Material Change, the Company shall require any person or entity that
     becomes a successor in interest to the Company, or a Related Company that
     adopts the Plan, to expressly assume the Plan and agree to perform all of
     the obligations of the Company or that Related Company, as the case may be,
     under the Plan.  For purposes of this Subsection 10.7, following the
     occurrence of a Material Change, a "successor in interest" to the Company,
     or a Related Company that adopts the Plan, shall include, without
     limitation, any person or entity (or group of related or affiliated persons
     or entities) that acquires (in a single transaction or a series of related
     transactions) any businesses or assets of the Company or such Related
     Company representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company's or
     such Related Company's sales, operating profits, or operating assets.

     10.9  AMENDMENT OF SECTION 10.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
     Plan, except as may otherwise be provided in a resolution of the Board of
     Directors of the Company adopted prior to the occurrence of a Material
     Change, the provisions of this Section 10 may not be amended and shall
     continue to apply, without amendment, in any successor plan.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its
duly authorized officers this 6th day of September, 1995.

       1995 DEFERRED COMPENSATION/CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PLAN FOR DIRECTORS
                                  PLAN DOCUMENT

Wallace Computer Services, Inc. (the "Company") hereby establishes a non-
qualified deferred compensation program for the members of its Board of
Directors, who are eligible under, and elect to participate in the Plan. The
following shall constitute the terms and conditions of the Wallace Computer
Services, Inc. 1995 Deferred Compensation/Capital Accumulation Plan for
Directors (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 1995 (the "Effective" Date)."

1.   Administration. Full power and authority to construe, interpret and
     administer the Plan shall be vested in the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee"). The Committee shall
     have the authority to make determinations provided for or permitted to be
     made under the Plan, to interpret the Plan, and to promulgate such rules
     and regulations, if any, as the Committee considers necessary and
     appropriate for the implementation of the Plan.

2.   Eligibility and Participation. All members of the Company's Board of
     Directors on November, 1994 shall be eligible for participation in the
     Plan. Eligible Directors who elect to participate, in accordance with
     Section 3, will become "Participants.".

3.   Deferred Compensation.

     A.   Each Participant may make an irrevocable election in writing to defer
          up to 100% of Compensation, as defined in Subsection 3B, paid during
          the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 (the "Deferral
          Amount"). Such amount shall not be less than $1,000. Deferred
          compensation at the deferral percentage will be deducted from all
          Compensation payable to the Participant during the deferral period.

     B.   "Compensation" means director's fees and meeting fees payable by the
          Company to the participant.

     C.   The Company shall establish and maintain a bookkeeping account in the
          name of each Participant, which shall be known as the "Deferral
          Account." It shall be credited with the Deferral Amount and interest
          at the rate established by the Committee compounded annually from
          January 1, 1995. As provided in Sections 5 of the Plan, the interest
          rate on lump sum payments caused by certain events will differ from
          the rate established by the Committee. Amounts paid to the Participant
          or his/her Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan, shall be deducted from
          the account balance as of the first day of the month in which such
          payment is made.

     D.   The Participant's Deferral Account shall at all times be reflected on
          the Employer's books in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          practices as a general unsecured and unfunded obligation of the
          Employer and the Plan shall not give any person any right or security
          interest in any asset of the Employer nor shall it imply any trust or
          segregation of assets by the Employer. Payments from the Participant's
          Deferral Account shall be made from the general assets of the
          Employer.
<PAGE>

4.   Time and Manner of Payment. The Participant's Deferral Account shall be
     distributed as follows:

     A.   Installment Payments.

          (1)  A Participant shall be entitled to fifteen (15) equal annual
               installment payments commencing at age sixty-five (65)

          (2)  A Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1995 may elect, at the time of making the deferral election
               pursuant to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual
               installments commencing at age seventy (70) in lieu of
               installment payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he/she becomes
               eligible for such payments.

          (3)  A Participant who attained age fifty-five (55) as of January 1,
               1995 and who was a director of the Company on November 7, 1984
               may elect, at the time of making the deferral election pursuant
               to Subsection 3A, to receive ten (10) equal annual installments
               commencing at age seventy-two (72) in lieu of installment
               payments under Subsection 4A(1) if he/she becomes eligible for
               such payments.

               Installment payments shall be calculated to amortize fully the
               accumulated value of the Deferral Amount over the payment period.
               For purposes of this Subsection A, the interest rate to be
               credited in this calculation of the accumulated value of the
               Deferral Amount shall be the rate(s) established by the Committee
               at its sole discretion prior to the beginning of the deferral
               period.

     B.   Interim Payments. A Participant who is not yet eligible to receive
          installment payments under Subsection A shall receive a payment equal
          to the Participant's Deferral Amount within a reasonable time after
          January 1, 2002. In addition, a payment equal to the Participant's
          Deferral Amount shall be paid to the Participant within a reasonable
          time after January 1, 2003. These payments shall be charged to the
          Participant's Deferral Account as of the first day of the month in
          which payment(s) is made. This Subsection does not apply to
          Participants terminated under Section 5.

5.   Dishonest Conduct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if
     Participant's directorship with the Company is terminated at any time for
     reason of dishonest or fraudulent conduct injurious to the Company, the
     sole amount payable to or on behalf of Participant hereunder shall be a
     lump sum payment of the accumulated value of the Participant's Deferral
     Amount, payable as soon as practicable after such termination. For purposes
     of this Section 5, the simple rate of interest to be credited in the
     calculation of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount shall be zero
     percent (0%).

6.   Payment Upon Death of Participant.

     A.   If a Participant dies after age sixty-five (65), the Employer shall
          pay any unpaid annual Installment Payments due the Participant under
          Subsection 4A to the Participant's Beneficiary, commencing with the
          next such payment due following the date of Participant's death.
<PAGE>

     B.   If a Participant dies prior to age sixty-five (65), Installment
          Payments described in Subsection 4A(1) shall be payable to the
          Participant's Beneficiary, commencing at the time of the Participant's
          death. Interim Payments described in Subsection 4B will not be made.

7.   Beneficiary Designation. A Participant may, from time to time designate any
     legal or natural person or persons (who may be designated contingently or
     successively) as his/her Beneficiary to whom payments are to be made if the
     Participant dies before receiving payment of all amounts due hereunder, by
     signing a form approved by the Committee. A beneficiary designation form
     shall be effective only after the signed form is filed with the Committee
     while the Participant is alive. A properly filed designation shall cancel
     all beneficiary designation forms filed earlier. If a Participant fails to
     designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated
     Beneficiaries of a Participant die before the Participant, or before
     complete payment of all amounts due hereunder, the Committee, in its
     discretion, may direct the Company to pay the unpaid amounts to one or more
     of such Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage in any
     manner permitted by law which the Committee considers to be appropriate,
     including but not limited to payment to the legal representative or
     representatives of the estate of the last to die of Participant and
     Participant's designated Beneficiaries.

8.   Facility of Payment. If, in the Committee's opinion, a Participant or other
     person entitled to benefits under the Plan is under a legal disability or
     is in any way incapacitated so as to be unable to manage his/her financial
     affairs, then the Committee may, until claim is made by a conservator or
     other person legally charged with the care of his/her person or of his/her
     estate, direct the Employer to make payment to a relative or friend of such
     person for his/her benefit. Thereafter, any benefits under the Plan to
     which such Participant or other person is entitled shall be paid to such
     conservator or other person legally charged with the care of his/her person
     or his/her estate.

9.   Insurance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, purchase policy or
     policies of insurance on the life of any Participant the cash value, if
     any, and proceeds of which may, but need not, be used by the Company to
     satisfy part or all of its obligations, hereunder. The Company will be the
     owner of any such policies and neither the Participant nor any other person
     or entity claiming through the Participant shall have any ownership rights
     in such policies or any proceeds thereof. The Participant, as a condition
     of receiving any benefits hereunder, on behalf of him/herself of any person
     or entity claiming through him/her, shall cooperate with the Company in
     obtaining any such insurance that the Company desires to purchase by
     submitting to such physical examinations, completing such forms, and making
     such records available as may be required by the Company from time to time.

10.  Non-Alienation. Neither a Participant nor anyone claiming through him/her
     shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey
     the right to receive any payments hereunder, which payments and the rights
     thereto hereby are expressly declared to be non-assignable and non-
     transferable, nor shall any such right to receive payments hereunder be
     subject to the claims of creditors of a Participant or anyone claiming
     through him/her to any legal, equitable, or other proceeding or process for
     the enforcement of such claims.

11.  Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold from any payment made by it under
     the Plan such amount or amounts as may be required for purposes of
     complying with the tax witholding or other provisions of the Internal
     Revenue Code or the Social Security Act or any state or
<PAGE>

     local income tax act or for purposes of paying any estate, inheritance or
     other tax attributable to any amounts payable hereunder.

12.  Non-Secured Promise. The rights under this Plan of a Participant and any
     person or entity claiming through him/her shall be solely those of an
     unsecured, general creditor of the Company. Any insurance policy or other
     asset acquired or held by the Company shall not be deemed to be held by the
     Company for or on behalf of a Participant, or any other person, or to be
     security for the performance of any obligations hereunder of the Company,
     but shall, with respect to this Plan, be and remain a general, unpledged,
     unrestricted asset of the Company.

13.  Independence of Plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
     Plan shall be independent of, and in addition to, any other agreement that
     may exist from time to time between the parties hereto. This Plan shall not
     be deemed to constitute a right to be retained as a member of the Board of
     Directors of the Company.

14.  Paragraph Headings. The Paragraph headings used in this Plan are for
     convenience of reference only and shall not be considered in construing
     this Plan.

15.  Responsibility for Legal Effect. Neither the Committee nor the Company
     makes any representation or warranties, express or implied, or assumes any
     responsibility concerning the legal, tax, or other implications or effects
     of this Plan.

16.  Committee Determinations Final. Each determination provided for in this
     Plan shall be made in the absolute discretion of the Committee. Any such
     determination shall be binding on all persons.

17.  Amendment. The Company may in its sole discretion amend the Plan from time
     to time. No such amendment shall reduce a Participant's or Beneficiary's
     benefits under the Plan to an amount less than an amount that he/she would
     have been entitled to under the Plan on the later of the date the amendment
     is adopted or made effective if the Plan had been terminated on that date.

18.  Termination at the Company's Option. Notwithstanding any other provision of
     this Plan, the Company may terminate this Plan at any time if the
     Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that any change
     in federal or state law, or judicial or administrative interpretation
     thereof, has materially affected the Company's cost of providing the
     benefits otherwise payable under this Plan, or for any other reason
     whatsoever. Upon such termination, the sole amount payable to Participant
     shall be a lump sum payment, as soon as practicable after such termination,
     of the accumulated value of the Deferral Amount. For purposes of this
     Section, the rate to be credited in the calculation of the accumulated
     value of the Deferral Amount shall be the rate specified for Installment
     Payments in Subsection 4A.

19.  Successors, Acquisitions, Mergers, Consolidations. The terms and conditions
     of this Plan and each Deferral Election shall insure to the benefit of and
     bind the Company, the Participants, their successors, assigns, and personal
     representatives.

20.  Controlling Law. The Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
     the state of Illinois to the extent not pre-empted by laws of the United
     States of America.

                         WALLACE COMPUTER SERVICES, INC.
                           EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE PAY PLAN
                                 AMENDMENT NO. 1


WHEREAS, Wallace Computer Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), has heretofore adopted and maintains a severance pay plan for the
benefit of certain of its employees designated the "Wallace Computer Services,
Inc. Employee Severance Pay Plan" (the "Plan");

WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan in certain respects;

WHEREAS, Subsection 8.1 of the Plan permits the Company to amend the Plan,
subject to a limitation set forth in Subsection 8.2 of the Plan which prohibits
the amendment of the Plan on or after the occurrence of a "Material Change" (as
defined in the Plan) if such amendment is adverse to the interests of Plan
participants and their beneficiaries; and

WHEREAS, a Material Change has not occurred as of the date of the adoption of
this amendment;

NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the power of amendment contained in Subsection 8.1
of the Plan, the Plan is hereby amended in the following respects:

1.   Subsection 4.2 of the Plan is amended to add a new paragraph at the end
thereof to read as follows:

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each Protected Participant
     who is listed on Appendix A hereto (such list to be compiled and modified
     from time to time by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors),
     the amount determined in Paragraph (a) above shall in no event be less than
     the Protected Participant's Annual Compensation (as defined below)
     multiplied by one (1).  For purposes of the Plan, the "ANNUAL COMPENSATION"
     of a Protected Participant shall be the sum of:  (i) the amount of the
     annual rate of base salary being paid to the Protected Participant by
     Wallace and the Subsidiaries (as defined below) immediately prior to the
     date that the Material Change occurs, determined before the reduction or
     deduction for his tax obligations and his contributions with respect to
     employee benefit plans, including, without limitation, reductions in salary
     under any salary reduction agreement relating to the Wallace Computer
     Services, Inc. Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan or Wallace's Deferred
     Compensation/Capital Accumulation Plans; plus (ii) the aggregate amount of
     the bonuses and other incentive compensation (other than stock, stock
     options and stock
<PAGE>

     appreciation rights) awarded (whether payable currently or deferred) to the
     Protected Participant by Wallace or any Subsidiary for the most recently
     completed fiscal year for which bonuses have been awarded before the
     Material Change occurs.  For purposes of the Plan, the term "SUBSIDIARY"
     means any corporation in which Wallace owns directly or indirectly, through
     an unbroken chain of subsidiary corporations, stock possessing voting power
     sufficient to elect a majority of the directors of that corporation.

2.   Clause (b) of Subsection 4.6 of the Plan is amended to read as follows:

     (b)  individuals who, as of September 6, 1995, constitute the Board of
     Directors of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to
     constitute at least a majority of such Board; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any
     individual who becomes a member of the Board of Directors of the Company
     subsequent to such date whose election, or nomination for election by the
     stockholders of the Company, was approved by a vote of at least a majority
     of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be deemed to be
     a member of the Incumbent Board; and PROVIDED FURTHER, that no individual
     whose election or initial assumption of office as a director of the Company
     occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as such
     terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to the election
     or removal of directors, or any other actual or threatened solicitation of
     proxies or consents by or on behalf of any person other than the Board of
     Directors of the Company, shall be deemed to be a member of the Incumbent
     Board; or


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed by its
duly authorized officers this 6th day of September, 1995.

                     INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH OFFICER

                      (MEMBER OF PROFIT SHARING COMMITTEE)

ADDENDUM made and entered into as of _______________________ between WALLACE
COMPUTER SERVICES, INC., a Delaware Corporation (the "Company"), and
_____________________________ (the "Officer").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

WHEREAS, the officer is a valued officer of the Company;  and

WHEREAS, under the provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as
in effect on the date hereof, the Company is obligated, to the fullest extent
permitted from time to time by applicable law, to hold harmless and indemnify
each person who is or was at any time an officer of the Company from and against
any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, amounts paid
in settlement, and other liabilities and claims of any kind, that any such
person may at any time suffer or incur or become subject to as a result of or in
connection with his or her serving or having served at any time as an officer of
the Company (collectively, the "Primary Officer Liabilities"), except that the
Company does not have any affirmative obligation under its Certificate of
Incorporation as in effect on the date hereof to indemnify any person who is or
was an officer with respect to expenses, judgments, fines, amounts paid in
settlement, or other liabilities or claims of any kind based upon or
attributable to (i) any breach of the officer's duty of loyalty to the Company
or its stockholders, (ii) any acts or omissions by the officer which are not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or deliberate dishonesty,
(iii) any improper personal profit or benefit by the officer, or (iv) any income
taxes in respect of compensation received for services as an officer; and

WHEREAS, under the provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as
in effect on the date hereof, the Company may, to the extent permitted from time
to time by applicable law, hold harmless and indemnify such persons (including
officers) as the Board of Officers may from time to time determine, from and
against such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, amounts
paid in settlement, and other liabilities and claims of any kind as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine, that any such person may at any time
suffer or incur or become subject to as a result of or in connection with his or
her serving or having served at any time as an employee or agent or in any other
capacity with the Company, with any predecessor of the Company, or with any
constituent corporation in any merger or consolidation with the Company, or as a
result of or in connection with his or her serving or having served at any time
at the request or an behalf of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent or in any other capacity with any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, or other
<PAGE>

enterprise or entity of any kind, including, without limitation, any subsidiary
or affiliated company or any employee benefit plan or trust (the "Additional
Officer Liabilities").

WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore entered into an Indemnification Agreement
with the Officer pursuant to which the Company has agreed to hold harmless and
indemnify the Officer from and against Primary Officer Liabilities and
Additional Officer Liabilities (collectively, the "Officer  Liabilities"); and
WHEREAS, the Officer is a member of the Profit Sharing Committee under the
Company's Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan (the "Profit Sharing Committee");
and

WHEREAS, the Company and the Officer desire to confirm that the obligation of
the Company to hold harmless and indemnify the officer pursuant to the
Indemnification Agreement extends to expenses (including attorneys, fees),
judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and other liabilities and claims
of  any kind, that the Officer may at any time suffer or incur or become subject
to as a result of or in connection with his or her serving or having served at
any time as a member of the Profit Sharing Committee (the "Profit Sharing and
Retirement Plan Liabilities").

NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce the officer to continue to serve as a member
of the Profit Sharing Committee and in consideration of his continued service in
such capacities, the Company hereby agrees with the Officer as follows:

     1.   Notwithstanding any amendment, modification or repeal of the
          indemnification provisions of the Company's Certificate of
          Incorporation after the date hereof, the Officer Liabilities shall be
          deemed to include the Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan Liabilities,
          and the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted from time to
          time by applicable law, hold harmless and indemnify the Officer from
          and against any and all Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan Liabilities
          to the same extent, and in the same manner, that the officer is
          entitled to be held harmless and be indemnified by the Company from
          and against any and all Officer Liabilities.

     2.   Nothing contained in this Addendum is intended to limit or restrict
          the right of the Officer to obtain indemnification or advancement of
          costs and expenses under the provisions of the Delaware General
          Corporation Law as in effect from time to time, under the provisions
          of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation as in effect from time
          to time, under the provisions of the Indemnification Agreement as in
          effect from time to time, or otherwise; and the rights of the Officer
          to obtain indemnification and advancement of costs and expenses under
          this Addendum are in addition to any and all other rights the Officer
          may have from time to time to obtain indemnification or advancement of
          costs and expenses from the Company or otherwise.

     3.   This Addendum shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
          officer and his estate, heirs, legatees and personal representatives
          and shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Company and its
          successors and assigns (including,
<PAGE>

          without limitation, any successor by merger or consolidation and any
          transferee of all or substantially all of its assets); and this
          Addendum shall survive the termination of the officer's service as an
          officer of the Company and/or a member of the Profit Sharing Committee
          for any reason.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date first
above written.

ACCELERATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION WE INITIATED TWO YEARS
AGO IS PAYING OFF FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS, AND WILL DELIVER EVEN MORE

WALLACE EXCEEDED CORPORATE OBJECTIVES For the year ended July 31, 1995, sales
rose 21 percent to $712.8 million compared with the $588.2 million in fiscal
1994. Real unit sales growth provided approximately two thirds of the overall
increase, and higher selling prices from rising paper costs accounted for the
balance. Sales grew 31 percent over the last two years and 59 percent over the
last five.
     Net income increased 17 percent to $55.3 million, or $2.46 per share,
compared to $47.3 million or $2.13 per share before the cumulative effect of
accounting changes in fiscal 1994. Net income in 1994 increased by 3 cents per
share due to the adoption of FASB No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Post-
Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and FASB No. 109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes."  Earnings per share grew 34% over the last two years and 32% over
the last five.
     The company generated its strong earnings growth despite a LIFO charge of
39 cents per share for the sharply rising paper prices experienced during the
year. Analysts predict fewer paper price increases in the coming year which
should reduce LIFO charges in fiscal 1996. Also for the year, we recorded
incremental development expenses of six cents per share for our electronic forms
segment. We do not expect this operation to reach break-even before the second
half of fiscal 1996.

     Operating income grew 40% over the last two years and 53% over the last
five.

     Key financial measures indicate that the company's performance is growing
at an accelerating rate. The company's return on average equity increased to
12.8 percent, up from 12.3 percent, and the return on average assets rose to
9.8 percent versus 9.4 percent in the prior year. Since fiscal year 1990, net
income increased 40 percent. Fully 90 percent of this gain occurred during the
last two years as the benefits of our strategy and capital investments
accelerated results. Consequently, Wallace's shares have produced consistent
value for stockholders. From August 1, 1994, the beginning of fiscal 1995,
until July 28, 1995 (prior to the unsolicited hostile buyout offer for the
company by Moore) the value of Wallace shares, including reinvested dividends,
rose 43 percent. During the last two fiscal years, the value of Wallace stock
has increased 90 percent.

PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH SUPERIOR SERVICE AND VALUE In 1993, we established a
new, two-pronged strategy: to be the total source for an organization's
information management products and services, and to give customers the best
service and added-value in the market. We have aggressively embraced and
leveraged new technologies and ideas, and dramatically increased the company's
focus on customers.
     The success achieved in fiscal 1994 and the even stronger results in
fiscal 1995 are evidence that our strategy is working. During the last 24
months, Wallace has become the true industry leader in what really counts: not
mere size, but answering customers' needs and delivering greater value. Every
employee's daily commitment to "the customer is everything" has, and will
continue to increase sales, market share and stockholder value.

W.I.N. AND SELECT SERVICES CUSTOMERS INCREASE The Wallace Information
Network-TM- (W.I.N.-TM-) and Select Services-TM- programs best exemplify how we
are using technology to deliver greater customer value and to increase market
share. W.I.N. and Select Services are the leading forms and supplies management
systems for large organizations. They provide tools to generate dramatic cost
savings and improved management control for customers. To receive W.I.N.,
customers sign multi-year contracts of at least $1 million in annual sales;
Select Services customers exceed $400,000 in annual sales. Our ability to offer
these services, built upon the sophisticated information systems they require,
is the result of years of internal investment at what we believe is twice the
industry's average rate.
     We added 61 new W.I.N. and Select Services customers last year, bringing
the total to 157, an increase of 64 percent. These major companies are reaping
substantial cost savings through these unique Wallace services.
     Most W.I.N. and Select Services customers are new, having left
competitors. In aggregate, these 157 customers provided more than one third of
our consolidated 1995 sales. The programs were introduced only two and one-half
years ago, and we expect that their growth and impact on market share will
continue.

SUPERIOR GROWTH IN ALL PRODUCT SEGMENTS In fiscal 1995, every product group
grew faster than industry averages. This demonstrates the value not only of the
corporate strategy, but of the aggressive growth strategies pursued in every
product area.
     Led by the W.I.N. and Select Services programs, sales of business forms
products rose 15.8 percent in an industry that is declining three to five
percent per year. Sales of office products rose 31.2 percent, in comparison to
two percent growth in office products overall.
     Label product sales, exclusive of acquisitions, increased 17.6 percent
compared to overall industry growth of eight to 10 percent. Including the
acquisitions, label sales grew 26.7 percent.  Colorforms direct response
product sales rose 13.8 percent compared to nine to 10 percent for the
industry. Commercial printing sales increased 18.0 percent over the prior year,
about triple the overall growth rate for that product segment.

Fiscal 1995 sales in every product segment exceeded industry projected growth
rates.

INITIATIVES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH We took many aggressive actions last year to
generate future growth. Most of these are only beginning to yield the returns
that we anticipate.

- -->  We formed a unique alliance with United Stationers, one of the nation's
     largest office supply distributors, to position Wallace as the preferred
     contract stationer to corporate America. This joint venture takes a new
     approach, giving us a competitive advantage in the office supply market.

- -->  In fiscal 1995 we completed two acquisitions that expanded our product
     capabilities in the swiftly growing label business. Even without these
     acquisitions, our growth has been double the overall industry growth rate
     in each of the last few years. The acquisitions should enhance our growth
     rate.

- -->  We continued to invest in Platforms, our electronic forms business. Today,
     the electronic forms market is in its infancy. Following the end of the
     fiscal year, we made a key alliance with Delrina Corporation and we are
     completing development of the industry's most complete array of products
     and services. We have seen significant customer interest and endorsement of
     our approach and view Platforms as a key growth opportunity.

- -->  In the direct response segment we call Colorforms, we introduced several
     important new products and leveraged our leading-edge individual imaging
     capabilities for new applications. These initiatives should enhance our
     growth and profitability in this product segment and reduce the seasonal
     effects of the direct mail business.

- -->  The health care market is also a growth opportunity. In fiscal 1995, we
     formed alliances with MedPlus and United Ad Label to expand our offerings
     to the healthcare industry, and we developed significant contracts with
     major group purchasing organizations and health care providers. The
     momentum generated in fiscal 1995 suggests that there are more growth
     opportunities to come.

- -->  Innovations and aggressive review of internal systems promise increasing
     efficiency. In fiscal 1995 we began phase 1 installation of the
     Manufacturing Information Processing System (MIPS). This software system
     was developed by Wallace to generate cost savings for Wallace and its
     customers.  Phases 2 and 3 are scheduled for roll-out to all plants in
     fiscal 1996, and the next level of efficiency-enhancing systems are already
     in development, such as a new program we're calling ASPECTS. These programs
     will add significant customer value this coming year and beyond.


                                WALLACE - page 07

<PAGE>



- -->  In fiscal 1995 we expanded production capacity for the high-growth segments
     of our business. The Lebanon, Kentucky plant started-up in a temporary
     building to produce short-run, quick turnaround forms and electronic
     printing. The expansion of our Wilson, North Carolina plant was completed,
     doubling its capacity for manufacturing pressure-sensitive prime and EDP
     labels, and we made an addition to the Brenham, Texas label and imaging
     products facility. Expansions were initiated at the Metter, Georgia
     (business forms) and the Covington, Tennessee (office products) factories.
     We also began the renovation of one of our St. Charles, Illinois buildings
     to facilitate further growth of its label production capacity.

These 1995 initiatives were developed to enhance the total service and added-
value Wallace delivers to customers. They all promise future growth.

OUTSTANDING PROSPECTS FOR INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE We begin fiscal 1996
with record backlogs and a high degree of confidence in our prospects. The
volume of information in business is doubling every three to five years,
indicating that the need for Wallace's information management products,
services and solutions is stronger than ever. Combined with the market's
increasing recognition of the company's leadership position, unique competitive
advantages and aggressive growth initiatives, we anticipate another year of
significantly above-industry performance.
     We remain committed to building shareholder value by following our
customer-focused strategy. We thank our customers, stockholders, employees and
suppliers for their confidence and support.

PRODUCTS ARE ONLY HALF THE EQUATION. THE COMPETITIVE DIFFERENCE THAT HAS BUILT
WALLACE'S LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY CUSTOMERS IS ADDED-VALUE
OUTSOURCING SERVICES UNMATCHED IN THE INDUSTRY. Customers can choose from a
menu of special services that let them effectively outsource all the functions
of acquiring and managing supplies. The result is cost savings and increased
management control. Wallace sales representatives work with customers to
determine the best mix of services to leverage Wallace's strengths and achieve
the customer's cost management objectives.

<PAGE>




WALLACE INFORMATION NETWORK The cornerstone of outsourcing and service
relationships is Wallace's unique forms/supplies management system that is the
industry benchmark. The Wallace Information Network (W.I.N.) and Select
Services programs let companies retain full control over decision-making and
costs, while outsourcing to Wallace all the work of ordering and managing forms
and other supplies. By pulling data directly from Wallace's corporate-wide
information system, W.I.N. provides critical management information to the
customer. At the end of the fiscal year, 157 major corporations have
implemented W.I.N. or Select Services to manage all their forms, labels, office
products and other consumable supplies.

WALLACE'S ABILITY TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS IS BUILT ON TWO FOUNDATIONS: PEOPLE AND
AN ONGOING INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS. EVERY PERSON THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IS
FOCUSED ON LISTENING TO CUSTOMERS, ANALYZING THEIR NEEDS AND DELIVERING
SOLUTIONS. In fiscal 1995, for example, our people helped many customers review
their ordering and inventory systems to assure adequate supplies as the
availability of paper became tight. We also helped companies plan and manage
how their organizations could start integrating electronic and paper-based
systems while maintaining operational and accounting control.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WALLACE HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL FINANCIAL BASE AND A COMMITMENT TO INVESTING IN THE
BUSINESS THAT IS UNMATCHED IN THE INDUSTRY. THE RESULT FOR CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-VALUE SERVICES SUCH AS W.I.N., LOWER COST MANUFACTURING
SYSTEMS, AND A STREAM OF NEW PRODUCT IDEAS THAT ENHANCE AND EXPAND THE
SOLUTIONS WE CAN BRING TO BEAR. FOR SINGLE ORDERS OR LONG-TERM CONTRACT
RELATIONSHIPS, WALLACE IS THE COMPLETE SOURCE FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

</TABLE>

     Over the last five years, the company's average annual growth rate in
sales has been 9.7%.
     Fiscal 1995 was a very difficult business environment due to the dramatic
increase in paper costs over the past twelve months. Using 20 pound white
uncoated free sheet bond as a proxy for the paper market, we experienced seven
paper price increases for the year which raised the cost of paper by more than
100%. Depending upon the product, paper can represent anywhere from 30 to 80
percent of total cost.
     There is usually a 60 to 90 day lag between the time of a paper price
increase and our ability to realize higher selling prices. During this period,
the increased costs put pressure on our operating margins. It was not until the
third and fourth quarters of the year that we were able to recover most of the
paper cost increases. Higher selling prices coupled with increased unit growth
produced sales increases in the third and fourth quarters of 27.3% and 33.0%,
respectively.
     While it is difficult to precisely measure the impact of inflation on the
sale of custom products, we estimate unit growth accounted for two thirds of
the year's sales increase. In the third and fourth quarters, unit growth is
estimated to represent one half of the sales increase.

                    [PIE CHART showing revenue contribution by
                     product group. Percentages are reflected
                     in Table on this page.]

     During Fiscal 1995, the company continued to add new customers to the
Wallace Information Network (W.I.N.) and the Select Services programs. These
programs allow customers to sole source with Wallace for their business forms,
office products, labels and other information management requirements. These
proprietary software systems allow the customer to use Wallace's nationwide
warehousing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities to reduce their costs,
while still maintaining control over their supply purchases. At July 31, 1995,
one hundred and fifty-seven customers have either a W.I.N. or a Select Services
installation. These customers represented 35% of consolidated sales for the
year.
     The Business Forms product group benefited from the increasing number of
W.I.N. and Select Services customers. Most of the accounts added during Fiscal
1995 were new customers for the company. It usually takes six months to a year
to reach the full projected volume for a new account. The variable element is
the amount of inventory from the previous vendor at the time of conversion. New
accounts added in the second half of Fiscal 1995 will reach their projected
sales targets during the first half of Fiscal 1996. A new initiative will be
launched in the coming year to make the company even more competitive when
producing business forms in smaller quantities. Despite industry trends to the
contrary, we expect the Business Forms product group to achieve double digit
sales increases for Fiscal 1996.
     The Office Products group had a very good year. This division markets
items purchased for resale, such as computer and office supplies, as well as
items manufactured internally, such as legal pads, standardized business forms,
ribbons and add rolls. Due to the company's good relations with its five major
paper vendors, the office products group was able to meet increased demand for
its paper based products. Part of the increased demand was due to manufacturing


                               WALLACE - page 18

<PAGE>


problems at a major competitor. A key to the success for this group is the
company's warehousing and distribution systems which allow us to provide value
added services to our customers. The combination of value added services and
secure paper supplies allowed this group to recover all of the paper price
increases during the year.
     At the end of the third quarter, the company announced a new strategic
office products alliance which we believe will make us a major participant in
the contract stationers industry. Sales through this alliance in Fiscal 1995
totaled $1.5 million. Based on new orders booked, we expect the contract
stationers business to show significant growth in the coming years.
     Direct Response products are sold through our Colorforms division and
include both printing and personalization services. The company believes that
its personalization capabilities are state-of-the-art. During Fiscal 1995,
these capabilities allowed the division to introduce new services such as daily
mailings for regulated industries and weekly signage programs for major retail
customers. In Fiscal 1996, the division will seek to add additional customers
who require consistent and predictable mailings to help offset the seasonal
mailings by our customers in the publishing industry.
     The results for the Label Group include two acquisitions during Fiscal
1995 which added $7.4 million in sales. Before the acquisitions, sales for the
Group were up 18%. During the year, the Wilson, North Carolina plant was
doubled in size to accommodate increasing demand for both data processing and
prime labels. The expanding use of bar coded labels plus new government
mandated labeling requirements will continue to be the major drivers of growth
for this product category.
     The Commercial Printing Group had its best year in the company's
eighty-seven year history. Increasing demand for quick turnaround documents
such as Preferred Provider Organization directories contributed to the record
results. The company is planning to significantly expand its quick turnaround
capabilities during Fiscal 1996.
     We believe that the three core strengths of the company are its 700 person
salesforce, its warehousing and distribution systems and its information
services capabilities. Investments in the training of the salesforce and the
opening of sales offices in new cities are important factors in the company's
continued growth. The office products alliance plus expansions of the Metter,
Georgia and the Covington, Tennessee facilities will strengthen our
distribution capabilities. New features to be added to the W.I.N. and Select
Services software systems will bring additional benefits to our customers. We
are continuing to invest in new equipment and advanced manufacturing processes
to improve our manufacturing efficiencies.

     Net income before accounting changes increased by $8.0 million to $55.3
million, a 17.0% increase. The after-tax ratio to sales was 7.8%. Fiscal 1994's
results had included $.7 million of income from the adoption of two accounting
changes. Net income after accounting changes for Fiscal 1995 increased by
15.4%. Over the last five years, net income before accounting adjustments has
grown at an average compound rate of 6.9%. Earnings per share for the year were
$2.46 versus $2.13 last year before accounting changes and $2.16 after
accounting changes. The average number of shares outstanding increased by 1.3%
during Fiscal 1995.
     Operating income for the year increased by 18.7%. Margins during the year
were negatively impacted by rising raw material costs. During Fiscal 1995, the
LIFO charge was $13.8 million, or 39 cents per share versus $.7 million, or 2
cents per share in Fiscal 1994. $7.1 million of the current year charge was


                               WALLACE - page 19

<PAGE>


recorded in the fourth quarter. Before the effects of LIFO accounting, cost of
goods sold as a percentage to sales was 62.1% for Fiscal 1995 and 61.7% for
Fiscal 1994.
     Selling and administrative expenses increased by 11.4% for the year. As a
percent to sales, they were 18.8% in Fiscal 1995 and 20.4% in Fiscal 1994. The
sales organization did an especially good job of controlling expenses during
the year.
     During Fiscal 1995, the Company experienced lower than anticipated
payments under its retiree medical program. This positive experience coupled
with a modification of certain assumptions allowed us to record a fourth
quarter reduction in the retiree medical liability of $1.3 million. Offsetting
this gain was a substantial increase in the value of phantom stock equivalents
during the year. In November, 1994 the twelve executive officers elected to
convert 100% of their deferred cash bonus accounts to stock equivalents. The
stock equivalents will be included when measuring the executives' performance
against stock ownership guidelines established in Fiscal 1995 by the Board of
Directors. The Company's stock price at the time of conversion was $27.00. As
the value of Wallace's stock has increased, an additional charge to
compensation expense has been recorded. During Fiscal 1995, the total charge
for stock equivalents was $1.7 million; $.8 million of this amount occurred on
the last day of the Company's fiscal year when the unsolicited offer by the
Moore Corporation Limited was announced.
     Depreciation and amortization expense increased 13.0% to $37.3 million.
Included in this figure is $2.7 million for the amortization of internally
developed software programs. We expect software amortization expenses to
increase over the next few years as additional phases of the Manufacturing
Information Processing System (MIPS) are completed. This additional
amortization expense will be more than offset by improved manufacturing
efficiencies once MIPS is implemented company-wide.

     Investment income was comparative between years at $3.6 million. Interest
income from tax-exempt bonds was $2.5 million in 1995 and $2.3 million in 1994.
Interest expense of $1.2 million was slightly below the prior year. During
Fiscal 1995, we paid down $6.1 million of debt from the Colorforms acquisition
in 1991. Interest savings from the retirement of these obligations will be $.4
million for Fiscal 1996.
     During Fiscal 1995, the company incurred a net expense of $3.8 million for
the continuing development of electronic forms software, which is marketed
under the name of Platforms. During Fiscal 1994, the net expense had been $1.6
million. We do not expect Platforms to reach break-even before the second half
of Fiscal 1996. As our customers transition from paper based to electronic
forms, the Company will be able to offer them unique products, an effective
management control system, and a solution based approach to information
management needs.
     The effective income tax rate for Fiscal 1995 was 36.8% versus 36.0% last
year.
     Wallace enters Fiscal 1996 with record backlogs. The continued acceptance
of the W.I.N. and the Select Services programs, coupled with new initiatives
such as the office products alliance, enhanced short-run capabilities, and
state of the art personalization services, combine to make the company's
management confident that we can deliver increased shareholder value in Fiscal
1996 and beyond.
FISCAL 1994 VERSUS FISCAL 1993 Net sales for Fiscal 1994 increased by 7.9% to
$588.2 million. Business forms products accounted for 46% of total sales for
Fiscal years 1994 and 1993. Sales of forms products increased by 8% between
years, with the entire increase coming from unit growth.
     Label products had another strong year with a sales


                               WALLACE - page 20

<PAGE>

increase of 18%, of which approximately 2% came from higher prices and the
balance from unit growth. Prime labels had an especially good year.
     Direct response printing and personalization sold through our Colorforms
division showed a sales increase of 13%. Unit growth, as measured by material
usage, exceeded the sales increase due to price deflation in this product line.
     Office products accounted for approximately 20% of total sales, with a
sales increase during Fiscal 1994 in line with the consolidated results. Most
of the increase came from new customer contracts added by the direct salesforce.
     Two product segments reported sales decreases for the year. Commercial
printing  was down 6% because a large order received in Fiscal 1993 did not
repeat in Fiscal 1994. Hardware sales were down 20% due to fewer high speed
printers being sold. These printers use our roll-handling equipment to improve
their throughput.
     The Wallace Information Network (W.I.N.) and Select Services programs
allow customers to sole source with Wallace, providing a control tool for their
supply purchases while using Wallace's nationwide warehousing, distribution and
manufacturing capabilities to reduce their costs. At fiscal 1994 year-end, 94
customers had either a W.I.N. or a Select Services installation. Sales for this
customer group increased by 20% during the year, and represented in excess of
20% of consolidated sales.
     Net income after taxes increased by 16.4% to $47.9 million, an 8.1% return
on net sales. Included in the year's total is $663,000 representing the
after-tax benefit of adopting FASB No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for
Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", and FASB No. 109 "Accounting for
Income Taxes". Earnings per share for the year were $2.16 after accounting
adjustments, a 17.4% increase over the $1.84 reported for Fiscal 1993. Without
the accounting adjustments, we would have reported $2.13 per share. The
effective income tax rates were 36.0% in 1994 and 34.0% in 1993.

     Operating income in Fiscal 1994 increased by 17.6%. Operating expenses for
the year increased 5.4% versus the sales increase of 7.9%. Cost of goods sold
for Fiscal 1994 was 61.8% of sales, compared to 62.6% in 1993. Approximately
35% of this improvement came from lower material costs with the balance due to
lower labor and overhead expenses. Based on rising paper prices during the
fiscal year, LIFO accounting reduced reported results for Fiscal 1994 by 2
cents per share versus a 5 cent increase in earnings in 1993.
     Selling and administrative expenses were 20.4% of Fiscal 1994 sales versus
20.6% in Fiscal 1993. The cost of the company's medical programs benefited
during the year from the expanded use of managed care options by our employees.
Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent to sales remained at 5.6%.
     Investment income for Fiscal 1994 was $3.6 million versus $2.7 million the
previous year. The Fiscal 1993 figure included a one-time charge of $2.3
million for a loss on the disposition of some municipal bonds. Lower interest
rates during Fiscal 1994 were the principal reason for the decline in
investment earnings. Interest income from tax-exempt bonds was $2.3 million in
1994 and $2.2 million in 1993. Tax excludable dividends from preferred stocks
were $.1 million in 1994 and $1.3 million in 1993. Interest expense for Fiscal
1994 was $2.3 million versus $2.0 million in 1993.
     In November, 1993, the company acquired the technologies of software
developer First Electronic Forms and established the Platforms division to
further develop and market electronic forms solutions. Sales of electronic
forms products in Fiscal 1994 were negligible and start-up expenses for this
operation reduced earnings per share for the year by five cents.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working capital at July 31, 1995 increased by
$9.7 million to $193.1 million, including $41.1 million of cash and short-term
investments. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $51.5 million bringing
the total for the last five years to $191.6 million. $3.0 million of these
expenditures were financed by industrial revenue bonds; the balance was
financed through internally generated funds. Over the last five years, the
company also spent $19.3 million for the development of proprietary software
programs.
     The company was engaged in several construction projects at the end of
Fiscal 1995. A new corporate headquarters is being built in Lisle, Illinois.
The existing Hillside, Illinois facility will be retained for use by the
Information Services groups and by Chicago area sales offices. Manufacturing
and distribution expansions in Metter, Georgia and Covington, Tennessee will be
completed during the first half of Fiscal 1996, as will a new short-run plant
in Lebanon, Kentucky. The estimated cost during the next year to complete these
projects is $25 million. Alternative financing arrangements, such as a sale and
leaseback of the new corporate headquarters, are being reviewed. Total capital
expenditures for Fiscal 1996 will be in the range of $50 to $55 million.
     Long-term debt at July 31, 1995 was $25.6 million. $23.5 million
represents industrial revenue bonds issued in prior years for the construction
of plants in Lebanon, Kentucky, Manchester, Vermont and Covington, Tennessee.
The balance of $2.1 million represents deferred payments in connection with two
acquisitions made during Fiscal 1995. Under the terms of these purchase
agreements, a portion of the purchase price is being held in escrow pending the
resolution of open contingencies such as final income tax reviews.
     Stockholders' equity increased 11.2% to $456.1 million. Return on average
stockholders' equity was 12.8% in 1995 versus 12.3% last year. Book value per
share increased 9.7% to $20.10 at July 31, 1995.

     During Fiscal 1995, the company re-issued 296,210 shares of treasury stock
as part of its employee benefit programs. These shares had been purchased in
the open market during Fiscal 1993. At July 31, 1995, 106,613 shares remain in
treasury stock. These shares may be used for future acquisitions or for stock
purchases under the employee benefit programs.
     Over the last twelve months, the value of the company's inventories
increased by $23.8 million before the effects of LIFO. A majority of the
increase came from finished goods which reflect both higher material costs plus
increased units. As more customers look to Wallace to store inventories for
them, we expect the finished goods balance to continue increasing in the coming
years.
     Higher selling prices to recover raw material increases contributed to a
$32.2 million increase in accounts receivable, up 33.8%. This increase was in
line with the fourth quarter sales increase of $49.1 million, or 33.0%.
     We do not anticipate a need for additional borrowing during Fiscal 1996 to
cover capital expenditures or working capital requirements for the year.
COMMON STOCK Dividends were raised for the 23rd consecutive year in November,
1994 to $.74 per share, a 15.6% increase over last year's rate. The average
number of shares outstanding for the year was 22.5 million in Fiscal 1995
versus 22.2 million in Fiscal 1994. The increase in shares came entirely from
the exercise of options under the company's 1989 stock option plan and the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
     The company's stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol WCS.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 JULY 31, 1995

1. SUMMARY OF MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its subsidiary, which is wholly owned. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenues from product sales and software licenses are
recorded when the product is shipped to the customer. In some instances,
revenue is not recognized until installation is complete or customer acceptance
is acknowledged.
INVENTORIES:Inventories are stated at cost which does not exceed market and
include material, labor and overhead. Cost is determined on the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) basis for certain inventories, and on the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) basis for other inventories.
DEPRECIATION: Depreciation for financial statement purposes is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes
of property, plant and equipment.

</TABLE>

INTANGIBLE ASSETS: $1,382,000 of Intangible Assets arising from Acquisitions
represents the excess of cost over net assets of a business purchased in 1962.
This amount is not being amortized since the company does not believe any
reduction of continuing value has occurred. The Company periodically reviews
intangible assets to assess recoverability, and impairments would be recognized
in operating results if a permanent diminution in value were to occur.
     The excess of cost over the assigned value of the net tangible assets in
connection with all other acquisitions is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 40 years. Amortization expense amounted to $491,000 in 1995 and
$389,000 in each of 1994 and 1993. The unamortized balance relating to the
Retterbush and Sauer acquisition was $8,336,000 at July 31, 1995; the Lampro
balance was $2,850,000; the Colorforms balance was $14,008,000. The July 31,
1994 unamortized balance relating to the Colorforms acquisition was $14,397,000.
OTHER ASSETS: $5,462,000 in 1995, and $7,432,000 in 1994 represent the unused
balance of construction funds held for the Lebanon, Kentucky plant. The company
expenses as incurred the cost of maintaining existing computer software.
Purchased software is capitalized and then amortized over periods ranging from
three to seven years. Amortization expense for computer software was $2,866,000
in 1995; $1,595,000 in 1994; and $1,322,000 in 1993. The unamortized balance of
capitalized computer software was $15,253,000 in 1995 and $9,587,000 in 1994.
INCOME TAXES: Effective August 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income
Taxes." Under that standard, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of "temporary differences" by applying statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amount and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities.
Investment tax credits are amortized to income over the lives of the applicable
assets. The unamortized investment tax credit amounted to $401,000 in 1995 and
$598,000 in 1994.
INDUSTRY SEGMENT: The company is engaged primarily in the computer services and
supply industry.
NET INCOME PER SHARE: Net income per share is based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during each year. The exercise of outstanding
stock options would not have a significant dilutive effect upon net income per
share.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The company invests excess cash balances in
short-term securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, and
municipal bonds whose original maturities are less than three months.
CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS: Interest costs are capitalized based upon the cost
of capital projects in progress during the year. Interest costs capitalized (in
thousands) for the last three years were:

At July 31, 1995 and 1994 the cost of inventories aggregating $51,957,000 and
$49,474,000, respectively, was determined on the LIFO method.
     Inventories would have been $26,437,000 higher in Fiscal 1995 and
$12,658,000 higher in Fiscal 1994, if the FIFO method had been used for all
inventories.

</TABLE>


Based upon the interest rates currently available to the company for borrowings
with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the company's debt and
other financial instruments are either carried at fair value or do not
materially differ from fair value.
     The industrial revenue bonds due 2007, 2009 and 2019 may be tendered at
the option of the holders on dates specified in the agreements. The company
maintains arrangements with agents to remarket any bonds tendered before the
final maturity dates. The bonds are also supported by letters of credit.
     The company's financing arrangements contain certain restrictive financial
covenants. Under the most restrictive of the covenants, the company must
maintain a current ratio of at least 2 to 1, net worth of not less than $297
million and funded debt not greater than 40% of net tangible assets plus funded
debt. The company was in compliance with all debt covenants at July 31, 1995
and 1994.
     Principal payments due on long-term debt during the next five years are as
follows: $205,000 in 1996; $0 in 1997; $2,100,000 in 1998; and $0 in each of
1999 through 2000.
     At July 31, 1995 the company had $14,000,000 of unused short-term lines of
bank credit at the prime rate of interest. The company has agreed to maintain a
compensating balance equal to 5% for a $1,000,000 line. The balance of the
short-term credit lines are uncommitted and unsecured. There were no borrowings
under these lines in Fiscal 1995 or Fiscal 1994.
4. PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT PLAN: The company has a contributory profit
sharing and retirement plan covering most employees. Company contributions to
the Plan charged to operations were $11,906,000 in Fiscal 1995, $10,403,000 in
Fiscal 1994 and $8,386,000 in Fiscal 1993.
5. STOCK OPTIONS: The company has a 1989 stock option plan, which will expire
on September 12, 1999, under which options may be granted to officers and
others, except for non-employee directors. Two types of options to purchase
common stock may be granted: Incentive Options and Non-Qualified Options. In
the case of Incentive Options, the


                               WALLACE - page 29

<PAGE>


option price may not be less than 100% of the market value of the stock at the
date of grant. For Non-Qualified Options, the grant price may not be less than
85% of the market value; however, to date no options have been granted at less
than 100% of market value. The option price may be paid in cash or by
exchanging previously acquired company common stock with a market value equal
to the purchase price. Options become exercisable as to 40% of the shares
granted one year after grant and the remaining 60% of the shares granted become
exercisable two years after grant. Options expire 10 years after grant.
     The following table summarizes the activity under the stock option plan
for the last two years:

8. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS: All current retirees; employees at least 55 with 20
or more years of service as of December 31, 1993; and employees between the
ages of 50 and 54 who have at least 20 years of service as of December 31,
1993, and retire before December 31, 1998; are entitled to postretirement
health care coverage. These benefits are subject to the same deductibles and
co-payment provisions which apply to active employees. All other employees who
retire after December 31, 1993 will pay 100% of their retirement medical
coverage. The company may amend or change the plan periodically.
     Effective August 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 (SFAS 106), "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The company elected to
immediately recognize the transition obligation for future benefits to be paid
related to past employee services.
     The net-accrual basis expense for postretirement benefits as of July 31
was as follows:

</TABLE>

For financial reporting purposes, the actuarial computations assumed a discount
rate of 8.0% to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation,
and an assumed health care cost trend rate of 10.64% and 9.14% for pre-65 and
post-65 medical coverage, respectively, for 1995, declining gradually to 6.0%
in 2001, to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. However,
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would
increase the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the
annual postretirement expense by $30,000 and the postretirement benefit
obligation as of July 31, 1995 by $317,000.
9. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES: Effective August 1, 1994, the
company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115),
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which
requires securities that are available-for-sale to be carried at fair value,
with changes in net unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. Previously, fixed income securities
classified as available-for-sale were carried at the lower of amortized cost or
fair value, determined in the aggregate. The adoption of this statement had no
impact on net income, but decreased shareholders' equity by $181,000 at July
31, 1995 (net of tax).

Short-term investments were carried at amortized cost at July 31, 1994.
Maturities for all debt securities classified as short-term are less than one
year. The long-term investment is included in the "Other Assets" section of the
balance sheet.
     For Fiscal 1995, proceeds on the sale of available-for-sale securities
were $8,710,000, with gross realized gains of $144,000. The amortized cost of
these securities was based on specific identification. No securities during the
period were classified as trading securities. There have been no sales of
held-to-maturity securities other than at their maturity date. The net
unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities has decreased by $253,000 (net
of tax) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF WALLACE
COMPUTER SERVICES, INC. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Wallace Computer Services, Inc., (a Delaware corporation) and
Subsidiary as of July 31, 1995 and 1994 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three Fiscal
years in the period ended July 31, 1995. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Wallace Computer Services,
Inc. and Subsidiary as of July 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three Fiscal years in the
period ended July 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
     As discussed in Notes 7, 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
the company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and post
retirement benefits effective August 1, 1993, and its method of accounting for
certain investments in debt and equity securities effective August 1, 1994.
