                           ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

                           YEAR ENDED AUGUST 27, 1995

                         INFORMATION REQUIRED IN REPORT

                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business:

                  (a)      General development of business:

                           The Company was incorporated in Minnesota in 1950 for
                           the purpose of performing precision contract
                           machining for the aerospace, communication, and
                           industrial markets. Several years later, the Company
                           focused on providing precision machining services for
                           the computer peripheral market. That segment of
                           business has since provided the major portion of
                           company revenues; however, machining work for the
                           computer-peripheral related business is declining and
                           other markets are expected to be of greater
                           importance to the Company in the future. In 1960, the
                           Company started development of a hydraulic motor
                           which was the origin of the Fluid Power Division. In
                           1973, the Company purchased Von Ruden Mfg. Co., a
                           manufacturer of transmission devices used in
                           agricultural and industrial applications. During
                           fiscal 1983, the Fluid Power Division and the
                           Transmission Devices Division (Von Ruden Mfg. Co.)
                           were physically combined into the newly named Power
                           Components Division.

                           On May 1, 1985, the Company completed the acquisition
                           of the manufacturing business and assets of Rogers &
                           Oling, Inc., which was operated as part of a
                           subsidiary known as Washington Scientific Industries
                           of California, Inc. (formerly K. Y. Rogers,
                           Incorporated), a California manufacturer of precision
                           machined parts for the computer and aerospace
                           industries. On June 28, 1988, the Company announced a
                           restructuring of the California subsidiary operations
                           which entailed closing one of the two manufacturing
                           plants in California in early fiscal 1989.

                           On June 17, 1988, the Company acquired all of the
                           outstanding stock of Advanced Custom Molders, Inc.
                           (ACM), a Texas manufacturer of precision molded
                           plastic components.

                           On August 25, 1989, the Company sold the Power
                           Components Division because the product focus of the
                           Division was no longer compatible with the Company's
                           long-term commitment to high-production, precision
                           contract manufacturing.

                           On October 1, 1991, the Company announced the
                           restructuring of Advanced Custom Molders which
                           entailed closing one of its three manufacturing
                           plants in early fiscal 1992. Advanced Custom Molders
                           had manufacturing plants in Georgetown and El Paso,
                           Texas.

                           On April 13, 1992, the Company announced the
                           restructuring and closing of its Covina, California
                           plant. Production from that plant was moved to the
                           Company's Minnesota plants, and the Covina plant was
                           closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992. That
                           plant was closed primarily because of excess
                           manufacturing capacity and the Company's demonstrated
                           ability to reliably serve West Coast customers from
                           its Minnesota plants, where its technical machining
                           expertise is located.

                           As of the close of business on June 30, 1993, the
                           Company sold the business and substantially all of
                           the assets of Advanced Custom Molders, Inc. (ACM) to
                           Moll Plasticrafters, L.P. ACM was sold primarily
                           because it did not meet profit expectations and
                           because WSI's contract machining business required
                           the attention of all the Company's resources.

                           On June 27, 1994, the Company announced the
                           consolidation of its manufacturing operations in its
                           Long Lake, Minnesota plant and the closing of its
                           Owatonna, Minnesota plant. The consolidation allowed
                           the Company to reduce expenses and capital employed
                           in the business while optimizing plant capacity and
                           human resources.

                           On October 5, 1994, the Company announced that it had
                           entered into an agreement for the sale of its
                           Owatonna property to OTC, a division of SPX
                           Corporation. On January 4, 1995, the Company sold its
                           Owatonna, Minnesota real estate to OTC, a division of
                           SPX Corporation, for a total cash consideration of
                           $1,534,000.

                           Contract manufacturing now constitutes the Company's
                           business.

                  (b)      Financial information about industry segments:

                           As noted above, the Company's business is now
                           conducted in a single industry segment--contract
                           manufacturing. Sales and earnings of the Company's
                           discontinued plastic injection molding business
                           segment for the ten months ended June 30, 1993 are
                           set forth in Note 9 (Discontinued Operations) of the
                           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
                           in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of
                           this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page 18,
                           attached hereto, which note is incorporated herein by
                           reference.

                  (c)       Narrative description of the business:


                           (1)(i)   The principal products and services of the
                                    Company are set forth below.

                           The Company manufactures metal components in medium
                           to high volumes requiring tolerances as close as one
                           ten-thousandth (.0001) of an inch. These components
                           are manufactured in accordance with customer
                           specifications using materials generally purchased by
                           the Company, but occasionally supplied by the
                           customer. Thirty four percent of Company sales in
                           fiscal 1995 were made to customers in the computer
                           equipment market. This number includes sales made to
                           the large computer disk drive market, which amounted
                           to 18% of total Company sales. Company sales to the
                           large computer disk drive market have been declining
                           rapidly over the past few years and the Company
                           expects that trend to continue.

                           The Company embarked on a customer and market
                           diversification program several years ago in an
                           effort to reduce the impact of change caused by one
                           customer being such a significant part of the
                           Company's business and in anticipation of a decline
                           in the disk drive market. The Company continued
                           making significant progress in that effort in 1995
                           when sales of non-disk drive components substantially
                           replaced the sales decline the Company experienced in
                           disk drive business.

                           The Company has a reputation as a dependable
                           supplier, one capable of meeting stringent
                           specifications to produce quality components at high
                           production rates. The Company has demonstrated an
                           ability to develop sophisticated manufacturing
                           processes and controls essential to produce precision
                           and reliability in its products.

                                                       * * * * *

                           (ii)     The Company's machining business is
                                    continually developing or modifying
                                    processes, but no new single process in
                                    development is expected to require the
                                    investment of a material amount of the
                                    assets of the Company.

                           (iii)    Purchased materials for the Company are
                                    generally available in adequate supply.

                           (iv)     Patents and trademarks are not deemed
                                    significant to the Company.

                           (v)      The Company's business does not have a
                                    seasonal pattern.

                           (vi)     The Company does not believe that its
                                    business demands unusual working capital
                                    requirements.

                           (vii)    Total sales to the following companies in
                                    fiscal 1995 were more than ten percent of
                                    Company sales: John Deere, $7,546,000 or 25%
                                    of Company sales, IBM $6,104,000 or 20% of
                                    Company sales, Storage Technology,
                                    $4,340,000 or 14% of Company sales and The
                                    Trane Company, $3,330,000 or 11% of Company
                                    sales. Sales to IBM have declined steadily
                                    over the past several years because many of
                                    the IBM programs serviced by the Company
                                    have expired. The Company expects a further
                                    decline in its business with IBM in 1996.

                           (viii)   Approximate dollar backlog at August 27,
                                    1995 and August 28, 1994 was $9,043,000 and
                                    $14,061,000, respectively. Backlog is not
                                    deemed to be any more significant for the
                                    Company than for other companies engaged in
                                    similar businesses. The above backlog
                                    amounts are believed to be firm, and no
                                    appreciable amount of the backlog as of
                                    August 27, 1995 is scheduled for delivery
                                    later than during the current fiscal year.

                           (ix)     No material portion of the contract business
                                    is subject to renegotiation of profits or
                                    termination of contracts or subcontracts at
                                    the election of the government.

                           (x)      Although there are a large number of
                                    companies engaged in machining, the Company
                                    believes the number of entities with the
                                    technical capability and capacity for
                                    producing products of the class and in the
                                    volumes manufactured by the Company is
                                    relatively small. Competition is primarily
                                    based on product quality, service, timely
                                    delivery, and price.

                           (xi)     No material amount has been spent on
                                    company-sponsored research and development
                                    activities.

                           (xii)    No material capital expenditures for
                                    environmental control were made or are
                                    anticipated in the foreseeable future.

                           (xiii)   At August 27, 1995, the Registrant had 191
                                    employees.

                  (d)      Financial information about foreign and domestic 
                           operations and export sales:

                           The Company has no operations in any foreign country.
                           The Company's export sales in fiscal 1995, 1994, and
                           1993 were not significant.

Item 2.  Properties:

                  The Company's executive offices and a production facility are
                  located in Long Lake, Minnesota (a western suburb of
                  Minneapolis). The one-story, concrete block building is owned
                  by the Company, contains approximately 182,500 square feet of
                  floor space, and is located on approximately 25 acres of
                  property owned by the Company. Included is an expansion
                  consisting of a 32,500-square-foot manufacturing facility,
                  which was completed in fiscal 1989.

                  The Company considers its manufacturing equipment, facilities,
                  and other physical properties to be suitable and adequate to
                  meet the requirements of its business. The Company believes
                  that it may need to lease several new machines depending upon
                  the type of new business obtained in the fiscal year.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings:

                  Registrant is not a party to any material legal proceedings,
                  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its
                  business.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations:

                  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:

                  The Company's working capital increased to $2,740,000 at
                  August 27, 1995, and continued the recent trend of improving
                  levels of working capital. The increase in working capital
                  resulted primarily from cash provided by operations and the
                  sale of assets, offset by payments on long-term debt. Cash
                  provided by operating activities increased to $2,262,000 in
                  fiscal 1995 compared to $1,195,000 and $(28,000) in fiscal
                  years 1994 and 1993, respectively. The ratio of current assets
                  to current liabilities improved to 1.83 to 1.0 from 1.07 to
                  1.0 and .88 to 1.0 reported for fiscal years ended 1994 and
                  1993, respectively.

                  Additions to property, plant and equipment were $356,000
                  compared to $118,000 in 1994 and $513,000 in 1993. Acquisition
                  of machinery through capital leases was $1,730,000 compared to
                  $181,000 and $331,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
                  Machinery additions in 1995 were higher than the prior two
                  fiscal years primarily because new machinery was needed to
                  process new business and because capital additions in fiscal
                  years 1994 and 1993 had been minimized as a result of economic
                  measures imposed on itself by the Company.

                  Proceeds from the sale of equipment and other assets amounted
                  to $1,814,000 in fiscal 1995, compared to $412,000 in 1994 and
                  $50,000 in 1993. In 1995, the Company consolidated its
                  manufacturing operations in Long Lake, MN. As a result, in
                  January, 1995, the Company sold the real estate it owned in
                  Owatonna, MN for $1,534,000.

                  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs were $950,268,
                  $1,035,616 and $1,158,303 for the years ended August 27, 1995,
                  August 28, 1994 and August 29, 1993, respectively.

                  Proceeds of $300,000 were received on a note receivable in
                  fiscal 1995 compared with $200,000 received in 1994. Those
                  payments came from Moll PlastiCrafters L.P. and were for the
                  balance due on the purchase of substantially all of the assets
                  of Advanced Custom Molders, Inc. The balance of the note in
                  the amount of $217,000 is scheduled for payment in fiscal
                  1996.

                  On March 31, 1995, the Company restructured its term debt and
                  amended its line of credit agreement. The term debt was
                  refinanced with the same bank with which the Company has its
                  line of credit by amending the Credit and Security Agreement
                  with the bank. There were no penalty payments connected with
                  the term debt prepayment. The Amended and Restated Credit and
                  Security Agreement is for a three year time period and
                  requires substantially lower term debt payments over the next
                  three years than the former agreements. The credit line
                  available to the Company remains at $3,000,000; however, the
                  interest rate on the credit line was reduced by 1.5 percentage
                  points.

                  Payments made by the Company on its long-term debt and line of
                  credit, including payments to the former holders of the term
                  debt notes, were $6,913,000 in fiscal 1995. Placement of
                  long-term debt from refinancing was $3,940,000. The net of
                  payments on long-term debt and line of credit and placement of
                  long-term debt in fiscal 1995 was $2,973,000. This compares
                  with payments on long-term debt and line of credit of
                  $1,635,000 and $3,379,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                  Total Company debt was $394,000 lower at August 27, 1995 than
                  the previous fiscal year- end. Term Debt of $3,790,000 owed
                  the bank on August 27, 1995 was substantially lower than the
                  $5,303,000 of term debt at August 28, 1994. However, capital
                  lease debt increased to $1,901,000 at August 27, 1995 compared
                  to $782,000 of capital and other lease obligations at August
                  28, 1994.

                  At August 27, 1995, the Company did not have any credit line
                  debt. All debt owed the bank is secured by substantially all
                  of the assets of the Company.

                  It is management's belief that internally generated funds
                  combined with the line of credit will be sufficient to enable
                  the Company to meets its financial requirements during fiscal
                  1996.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:

                  Net sales of $30,409 000 decreased $414,000 from the previous
                  year. Even though sales have been almost level over the most
                  recent three years, with sales of $30,823,000 in 1994 and
                  $29,293,000 in 1993, there has been a significant change in
                  customer mix. Sales to IBM, which historically has been the
                  Company's main customer, have declined significantly because
                  many of the IBM programs serviced by the Company have expired.
                  Sales to IBM have declined from $22,230,000 in 1993 and
                  $15,965,000 in 1994 to $6,104,000 in 1995. To offset
                  this decline the Company has experienced an increase in
                  business from other customers. Sales revenue from other
                  customers increased from $7,063,000 in 1993 to $14,858,000 in
                  1994 to $24,305,000 in 1995, with no single customer
                  accounting for more than 25% of the Company's sales in 1995.
                  Based on information received from customers and recent trends
                  the Company's outlook is for lower sales in fiscal 1996
                  compared to fiscal 1995.

                  In fiscal 1995, the Company reported net earnings of $945,000
                  or $.39 per share compared to losses of $1,289,000 or $.54 per
                  share and $5,555,000 or $2.33 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
                  The earnings in fiscal 1995 were favorably affected by two
                  actions resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing
                  operations in the Company's Long Lake, MN. plant. The
                  consolidation permitted the Company to sell its Owatonna, MN.
                  plant and record a pension curtailment gain as a result of
                  having fewer employees in its pension plan. The gain from
                  those two actions was $1,144,000. Excluding the impact of
                  unusual gains, fiscal 1995 would show a loss from operations
                  in the first half and profitable third and fourth quarters.
                  The Company incurred many costs associated with its plant
                  consolidation in the first half year. Costs such as; labor
                  inefficiencies, start-up and overtime pay had a negative
                  impact on first half earnings.

                  Gross margin on parts sold in fiscal 1995 increased to 9.5
                  percent of sales compared to 8.0 percent of sales and 1.6
                  percent of sales in 1994 and 1993, respectively. The gross
                  margin improvement can be attributed to improved manufacturing
                  efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of all
                  manufacturing in one plant.

                  Selling and administrative expense increased $210,000 from the
                  prior year to $2,560,000. The higher spending was attributable
                  to increased advertising and other selling expenses, salaries
                  and professional services. Selling and administrative expense
                  was $2,350,000 in 1994 and $3,594,000 in 1993.

                  Other Expense and Income Information - Interest expense of
                  $645,000 decreased $120,000 from the prior year. This resulted
                  from lower debt levels and lower interest rates. Interest
                  expense was $765,000 in 1994 and $991,000 in 1993. Interest
                  and other income was $109,000 in 1995 compared to $50,000 and
                  $16,000 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                  Income Taxes - Effective August 31, 1992, the Company adopted
                  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,
                  Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and
                  liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for
                  income taxes. In fiscal 1994 and 1993 the Company was unable
                  to record the benefit of net operating losses and most other
                  net deductible temporary differences in the consolidated
                  statement of operations due to the fact that the likelihood of
                  realization of the tax benefits could not be established. In
                  fiscal 1995, the Company was able to recognize the benefit of
                  a portion of its net operating loss carryforwards, but
                  continues to provide a valuation allowance for excess deferred
                  tax assets. In addition, in fiscal 1995, the Company did
                  record a small tax benefit of $22,000 relating to the reversal
                  of an additional minimum pension liability.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Stockholders and Board of Directors
Washington Scientific Industries, Inc.
Long Lake, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Washington
Scientific Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 27, 1995
and August 28, 1994 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended August 27, 1995. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 14. These consolidated financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 27, 1995
and August 28, 1994 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended August 27, 1995 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.

WASHINGTON SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIES, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED AUGUST 27, 1995, AUGUST 28, 1994, AND AUGUST 29, 1993

1.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Fiscal Year - Washington Scientific Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries'
       (the Company) fiscal years represent a 52- to 53-week period ending the
       last Sunday in August. Fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993 each consisted of 52
       weeks.

       Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the
       accounts of Washington Scientific Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
       All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

       Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
       hand, overnight investments, and certificates of deposit with original
       maturities to the Company of three months or less.

       Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
       first-out method) or market. Inventory costs consist of material, direct
       labor, and manufacturing overhead. The Company's inventories are stated
       net of valuation allowances of approximately $334,000 and $152,000 at
       August 27, 1995 and August 28, 1994, respectively. The increase in the
       allowance at August 27, 1995 is related to the Company's estimate of
       certain specific excess inventory quantities.

       Depreciation - The cost of buildings and substantially all equipment is
       being depreciated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful
       lives of the assets are as follows:

       Buildings and improvements                                 15 to 32 years
       Machinery and equipment                                     3 to 10 years
       Leasehold improvements                                      4 to 20 years
       Automotive equipment                                        3 to  5 years

       Income Taxes - The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
       Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an
       asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for
       income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed
       annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
       assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
       in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
       periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
       Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
       tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is
       the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change
       during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

       Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common and Common Equivalent Shares - Net
       earnings (loss) per common and common equivalent shares has been computed
       by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common and
       common equivalent shares (stock options) outstanding during each period.
       The computed number of common equivalent shares was 61,611 for the year
       ended August 27, 1995. Outstanding stock options were not considered in
       the fiscal 1994 and 1993 calculations as they had an antidilutive effect.

       Business Segment - Since August 29, 1993, the Company's business has been
       conducted in a single industry segment--contract manufacturing.

2.     PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND PLANT CLOSINGS

       On June 27, 1994, the Company announced the closing of its plant located
       in Owatonna, Minnesota and the consolidation of operations in the Long
       Lake, Minnesota plant. The closing and consolidation was completed in the
       first half of fiscal 1995. A provision of $704,000 was recorded during
       fiscal 1994 and consisted principally of:

       had its line of credit. The agreement requires principal payments of
       $37,500 per month with the loan balance due at March 31, 1998. Interest
       on the term debt is calculated at the bank's base rate (8.75 % at August
       27, 1995) plus 1.75 percentage points, with payments made monthly.

       Interest on the line of credit is at the bank's base rate (8.75% at
       August 27, 1995) plus 1.5 percentage points, and expires March 31, 1998.
       The agreement maintains secured borrowing of up to $3,000,000; however,
       the Company is charged an annual unused credit line fee of 0.75%. At

       that the Company (1) maintain a net worth of not less than $3,000,000,
       (2) maintain a ratio of liabilities to net worth not greater than 4.0 to
       1.0, (3) limit capital expenditures to $3,000,000 in each fiscal year
       with no more than $1,000,000 coming from its line of credit and (4)
       maintain a defined cash flow coverage ratio of no less than 1.1 to 1.0.
       Cash dividends are fully restricted. At August 27, 1995, the Company was
       in compliance with respect to these financial covenants of the secured
       agreement.

       As of August 27, 1995, the Company had federal, Minnesota, and California
       state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
       $5,020,000, $917,000, and $1,108,000, respectively, of which most will
       expire in 2008. Also as of August 27, 1995, the Company had $454,000 in
       federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforward and
       approximately $46,000 in other credit carryforward. The AMT credits are
       available to offset future tax liabilities only to the extent that the
       Company has regular tax liabilities in excess of AMT tax liabilities.

7.     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

       During fiscal 1995 there were two events affecting the Company's
       non-contributory pension plans. First, as part of the Owatonna plant
       restructuring, the Owatonna employees were either terminated or
       transferred to the Long Lake facility during 1995. As a result, a
       curtailment of the non-union employee plan occurred during fiscal 1995,
       as defined in SFAS No. 88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and
       Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits.
       The amount of the curtailment gain was $254,419 and was reflected in the
       financial statements for the year ended August 27, 1995.

       Second, effective February 1, 1995, Washington Scientific Industries,
       Inc. combined its two noncontributory pension plans into one plan for
       employees who are at least 21 years of age and have completed at least
       one year of service. Benefits for the union employees are based on years
       of service and a preestablished rate in the year of retirement. Benefits
       for non-union employees are based on years of service and a percentage of
       annual compensation in the five years preceding retirement. Plan assets
       consist primarily of shares of a balanced fund offered by a major
       regional bank. Net periodic pension cost consisted of the following:

       In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the
       Company has recorded an additional minimum pension liability for the
       union pension plan of $364,645 at August 28, 1994. The amount represents
       the excess of unfunded accumulated benefit obligations over accrued
       pension liabilities. An intangible asset equal to the unrecognized
       prior-service cost was recorded in the amount of $279,287 at August 28,
       1994. An amount equal to the remaining minimum liabilities, net of
       related deferred tax assets, was reflected as a separate reduction of
       stockholders' equity at August 28, 1994.

       The Company's policy is to currently fund an amount to include full
       current costs and amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued
       liability over the expected future service of active participants;
       however, contributions are not in excess of the maximum allowable tax
       deduction for the Company. Pension liability amounts expected to be
       funded under this policy within one year are included in miscellaneous
       accrued expenses with amounts expected to be funded in periods beyond one
       year included as long-term liabilities.

       The Company has management incentive compensation plans for certain key
       employees designated annually by a committee of the Board of Directors.
       The amount of incentive compensation for eligible participants is
       contingent on attaining minimum pre-tax earnings. 

       All employees are eligible to participate in the Company's retirement
       savings 401(k) plan. The Company matches contributions up to 25% of the
       first 6% of employee contributions to the plan. Further discretionary
       contributions are authorized fully by the Board of Directors.
       Contributions charged to operations for fiscal 1995, 1994, and 1993 were
       approximately $29,933, $51,336, and $43,538, respectively.

8.     INFORMATION CONCERNING SALES TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS

       The Company had sales to four customers which exceed 10 percent of total
       sales during any one of fiscal years 1995, 1994 or 1993. Sales to those
       customers and the percentage of accounts receivable for those customers
       to total Company accounts receivable as of August 27, 1995 and August 28,
       1994 are listed below:

                    EMPLOYMENT (CHANGE OF CONTROL) AGREEMENT


     AGREEMENT made as of this 18th day of October, 1995 by and between
Washington Scientific Industries, Inc., a Minnesota corporation with its
principal offices at 2605 West Wayzata Boulevard, Long Lake, Minnesota ("WSI")
and Michael J. Pudil (the "Executive").

     WHEREAS, WSI considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and
vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests
of WSI and its shareholders; and

     WHEREAS, the Executive has made and is expected to make, due to Executive's
intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of WSI, its policies, methods,
personnel and problems, a significant contribution to the profitability, growth
and financial strength of WSI; and

     WHEREAS, WSI, as a publicly held corporation, recognizes that the
possibility of a Change in Control may exist and that such possibility, and the
uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the
departure of the Executive or distraction in the performance of the Executive's
duties to the detriment of WSI and its shareholders; and

     WHEREAS, Executive is willing to remain in the employ of WSI upon the
understanding that WSI will provide income security if the Executive's
employment is terminated under certain terms and conditions; and

     WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of WSI and its shareholders to
reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of management
personnel, including Executive, to their assigned duties without distraction and
to ensure the continued availability to WSI of the Executive in the event of a
Change in Control.

     THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other respective covenants
and agreements of the parties herein contained, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and
shall continue in effect until such time as WSI notifies the Executive of
termination of the Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if a
Change in Control occurs, this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period
of 36 months from the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control.

     2. Change in Control. No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless there
shall have been a Change in Control, as set forth below.

     For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of WSI shall mean any
of the following events which does not arise from a transaction or series of
transactions authorized, recommended or approved by formal action taken by the
Board of Directors:

          (i) if any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)
     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"))
     becomes a "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
     Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of WSI representing 20% or more
     of the combined voting power of WSI's then outstanding securities;

          (ii) if there ceases to be at least a seventy-five percent (75%)
     majority of the Board of Directors comprised of the following: (A)
     individuals who on the date hereof constituted the Board of Directors of
     WSI, and (B) any new director who subsequently was elected by, or on the
     nomination or recommendation of, at least a seventy-five percent (75%)
     majority of the directors who held such office immediately prior to a
     Change in Control;

          (iii) if a change in control otherwise occurs which would be required
     to be reported in response to Item 5(f) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A
     promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or not WSI is then subject to
     such reporting requirement;

          (iv) if there is a merger or consolidation of WSI with, or the sale of
     all or substantially all of the assets of WSI to, any person or entity or
     group of associated persons or entities; or

          (v) if the shareholders of WSI approve any plan or proposal for the
     liquidation or dissolution of WSI.

     3. Termination Following Change in Control. If a Change in Control shall
have occurred while this Agreement is in effect, Executive shall be entitled to
the benefits provided in subsection 4(d) unless such termination is (A) because
of Executive's death or Retirement, (B) by WSI for Cause or Disability, or (C)
by Executive other than for Good Reason.

          (a) Disability; Retirement. If, as a result of incapacity due to
     physical or mental illness, the Executive shall have been absent from the
     full-time performance of Executive's duties with WSI for six consecutive
     months, and within 30 days after written Notice of Termination is given the
     Executive shall not have returned to the full-time performance of the
     Executive's duties, WSI may terminate Executive's employment for
     "Disability". Any question as to the existence of Executive's Disability
     upon which Executive and WSI cannot agree shall be determined by a
     qualified independent physician selected by Executive (or, if the Executive
     is unable to make such selection, it shall be made by any adult member of
     the Executive's immediate family), and approved by WSI. The determination
     of such physician made in writing to WSI and to Executive shall be final
     and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement. Termination by WSI or
     Executive of Executive's employment based on "Retirement" shall mean
     termination with a normal retirement pension in accordance with the WSI
     Pension Plan and Trust.

          (b) Cause. Termination by WSI of Executive's employment for "Cause"
     shall mean termination for theft or embezzlement of WSI assets, intentional
     material violations of law or WSI written policies, a material breach of
     the provisions of this Agreement, or conviction by a court of competent
     jurisdiction for felony criminal conduct.

          (c) Good Reason. Executive shall be entitled to terminate his
     employment for Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason"
     shall mean, without Executive's express written consent, any of the
     following:

               (i) the assignment to Executive of any duties inconsistent with
          Executive's status or position with WSI, or a substantial alteration
          in the nature or status of Executive's responsibilities from those in
          effect immediately prior to the Change in Control;

               (ii) a reduction by WSI in Executive's annual base salary in
          effect immediately prior to a Change in Control;

               (iii) the relocation of WSI's principal executive offices to a
          location more than twenty-five miles from Long Lake, Minnesota, or WSI
          requiring Executive to be based anywhere other than WSI's principal
          executive offices except for required travel on WSI's business to an
          extent substantially consistent with Executive's prior business travel
          obligations;

               (iv) the failure by WSI to continue to provide Executive with
          benefits at least as favorable to those enjoyed by Executive under any
          of WSI's pension, life insurance, medical, health and accident,
          disability, deferred compensation, incentive or bonus, incentive and
          other stock option, or savings plans in which Executive was
          participating at the time of the Change in Control, the taking of any
          action by WSI which would directly or indirectly materially reduce any
          of such benefits or deprive Executive of any material fringe benefit
          enjoyed at the time of the Change in Control, or the failure by WSI to
          provide Executive with the number of paid vacation days to which
          Executive is entitled at the time of the Change in Control; provided,
          however, that WSI may amend any such plan or programs as long as such
          amendments do not reduce any benefits to which Executive would be
          entitled;

               (v) the failure of WSI to obtain a satisfactory agreement from
          any successor to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as
          contemplated in Section 8;

               (vi) the taking of any action by WSI that would materially
          adversely affect the physical conditions existing at the time of the
          Change in Control in or under which Executive performs his employment
          duties;

               (vii) any material breach of this Agreement by WSI; or

               (viii) notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if
          during a period commencing on the 91st day following a Change in
          Control (as herein defined) and ending on the 180th day following a
          Change in Control, the Executive may voluntarily terminate his
          employment for any reason, and such termination shall be deemed "Good
          Reason" for all purposes of this Agreement. The provisions contained
          herein governing Notice and Date of Termination and any dispute of
          termination shall apply to a voluntary termination pursuant to this
          Subsection.

          (d) Notice of Termination. Any purported termination of Executive's
     employment by WSI or by Executive shall be communicated by written Notice
     of Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section 9. For
     purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall mean a notice
     which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
     relied upon and shall set forth a summary of the facts and circumstances
     claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment.

          (e) Date of Termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "Date of
     Termination" shall mean:

               (i) if Executive's employment is terminated for Disability, 30
          days after Notice of Termination is given (provided that the Executive
          shall not have returned to the full-time performance of the
          Executive's duties during such 30 day period);

               (ii) if Executive's employment is terminated for Retirement, on
          the date of retirement pursuant to the WSI Pension Plan and Trust; and

               (iii) if Executive's employment is terminated pursuant to
          subsections (b) or (c) above or for any other reason (other than
          death, Disability or Retirement), the date specified in the Notice of
          Termination (which shall not be less than 10 days from the date such
          Notice of Termination is given).

          (f) Dispute of Termination. If, within 10 days after any Notice of
     Termination is given, the party receiving such Notice of Termination
     notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination,
     the Date of Termination shall be the date on which the dispute is finally
     determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties, or by a
     final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (which
     is not appealable or the time for appeal therefrom having expired and no
     appeal having been perfected); provided, that the Date of Termination shall
     be extended by a notice of dispute only if such notice is given in good
     faith and the party giving such notice pursues the resolution of such
     dispute with reasonable diligence. Notwithstanding the pendency of any such
     dispute, WSI shall continue to pay Executive full compensation in effect
     when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not
     limited to, base salary) and continue Executive as a participant in all
     compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which the Executive was
     participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given, until
     the dispute is finally resolved in accordance with this subsection. Amounts
     paid under this subsection are in addition to all other amounts due under
     this Agreement and shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts
     under this Agreement.

     4. Compensation Upon Termination or During Disability. Following a Change
in Control, upon termination of Executive's employment or during a period of
Disability, Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits:

          (a) During any period that Executive fails to perform full-time duties
     with WSI as a result of a Disability, WSI shall pay Executive, the base
     salary of the Executive at the rate in effect at the commencement of any
     such period, until such time as the Executive is determined to be eligible
     for long term disability benefits in accordance with WSI's insurance
     programs then in effect.

          (b) If Executive's employment shall be terminated by WSI for Cause or
     by Executive other than for Good Reason, Disability or Retirement, WSI
     shall pay to Executive his full base salary through the Date of Termination
     at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given and WSI
     shall have no further obligation to Executive under this Agreement.

          (c) If Executive's employment shall be terminated by WSI or by
     Executive for Disability or Retirement, or by reason of death, WSI shall
     immediately commence payment to the Executive (or Executive's designated
     beneficiaries or estate, if no beneficiary is designated) any and all
     benefits to which the Executive is entitled under WSI's retirement and
     insurance programs then in effect.

          (d) If Executive's employment by WSI shall be terminated (A) by WSI
     other than for Cause, Retirement, or Disability or (B) by Executive for
     Good Reason, then Executive shall be entitled to the benefits provided
     below:

               (i) WSI shall pay Executive the Executive's full base salary
          through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time the
          Notice of Termination is given;

               (ii) In lieu of any further salary payments for periods
          subsequent to the Date of Termination, WSI shall pay as a severance
          payment (the "Severance Payment") an amount equal to 2.99 times the
          average of the annual compensation which was paid to Executive by WSI
          (or any corporation ("Affiliate") affiliated with WSI within the
          meaning of section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
          amended (the "Code")) and includible in Executive's gross income for
          Federal income tax purposes for the five calendar years (or, if
          Executive has been employed by WSI for less than five, the number of
          complete calendar years of employment) (the "Base Period") preceding
          the earlier of the calendar year in which a Change in Control of WSI
          occurred or the calendar year of the Date of Termination. Such average
          shall be determined in accordance with temporary or final regulations
          promulgated under section 28OG(d) of the Code. Compensation payable to
          Executive by WSI (or an Affiliate) shall include every type and form
          of compensation includible in Executive's gross income in respect of
          Executive's employment by WSI (or an Affiliate), including
          compensation income recognized as a result of the exercise of stock
          options or sale of the stock so acquired, except to the extent
          otherwise provided in temporary or final regulations promulgated under
          section 28OG(d) of the Code. The Severance Payment shall be made
          within 60 days after termination of employment.

               (iii) For a 36 month period after the Date of Termination, WSI
          shall arrange to provide Executive with life, disability, accident and
          health insurance benefits substantially similar to those which the
          Executive is receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the
          Notice of Termination. Benefits otherwise receivable by Executive
          pursuant to this paragraph (iii) shall be reduced to the extent
          comparable benefits are actually received by Executive during such 36
          month period, and any such benefits actually received by Executive
          shall be reported to WSI.

               (iv) Except to the extent such payment would constitute a
          "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 28OG(b)(2) of the
          Code as determined under subsection (d)(v), WSI shall also pay to
          Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive as a
          result of such termination (including all such fees and expenses, if
          any, incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination or in
          seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this
          Agreement); and

               (v) The Severance Payment shall be reduced by the value of
          benefits actually provided in (iii) above and by the amount of any
          other payment or the value of any benefit received or to be received
          by Executive in connection with the termination of employment or
          contingent upon a Change in Control of WSI (whether payable pursuant
          to the terms of this Agreement, any other plan, agreement or
          arrangement with WSI or an Affiliate) unless (1) Executive shall have
          effectively waived receipt or enjoyment of such payment or benefit
          prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payment, (2) in the
          opinion of tax counsel selected by WSI and acceptable to Executive,
          such other payment or benefit does not constitute a "parachute
          payment" within the meaning of section 28OG(b)(2) of the Code, or (3)
          in the opinion of such tax counsel, the Severance Payment (in its full
          amount or as partially reduced, as the case may be) plus all other
          payments or benefits which constitute "parachute payments" within the
          meaning of section 28OG(b)(2) of the Code are reasonable compensation
          for services actually rendered, within the meaning of section
          28OG(b)(4) of the Code, and such payments are deductible by WSI. The
          value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred cash payment shall be
          determined by WSI in accordance with the principles of sections
          28OG(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

               (vi) If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a
          court or an Internal Revenue Service proceeding that, notwithstanding
          the good faith of Executive and WSI in applying the terms of this
          Subsection 4(d), the aggregate "parachute payments" paid to or for
          Executive's benefit are in an amount that would result in any portion
          of such "parachute payments" not being deductible by WSI or its
          Affiliates by reason of section 28OG of the Code, then Executive shall
          have an obligation to pay WSI upon demand an amount equal to the sum
          of (1) the excess of the aggregate "parachute payments" paid to or for
          the Executive's benefit over the aggregate "parachute payments" that
          would have been paid to or for the Executive's benefit without any
          portion of such "parachute payments" not being deductible by reason of
          section 28OG of the Code; and (2) interest on the amount set forth in
          clause (1) of this sentence at the applicable Federal rate (as defined
          in section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of Executive's receipt
          of such excess until the date of such payment.

          (e) Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any
     payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or
     otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in
     this Section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the
     result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits after
     the Date of Termination, or otherwise except as specifically provided in
     this Section 4.

          (f) In addition to all other amounts payable to Executive under this
     Section 4, Executive shall be entitled to receive all benefits payable to
     the Executive under the Washington Scientific Industries, Inc. Pension Plan
     and Trust and the Washington Scientific Industries, Inc. Employee Stock
     Ownership Plan and Trust and any other plan or agreement relating to
     retirement benefits.

     5. Funding of Payments. In order to assure the performance by WSI or its
successor of its obligations under this Agreement, WSI may deposit in trust an
amount equal to the maximum payment that will be due the Executive under the
terms hereof. Under a written trust instrument, the Trustee shall be instructed
to pay to the Executive (or the Executive's legal representative, as the case
may be) the amount to which the Executive shall be entitled under the terms
hereof, and the balance, if any, of the trust not so paid or reserved for
payment shall be repaid to WSI. If WSI deposits funds in trust, payment shall be
made by the Trustee to the Executive in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. If and to the extent there are not amounts in trust sufficient to pay
Executive under this Agreement, WSI shall remain liable for any and all payments
due to Executive. In accordance with the terms of such trust, at all times
during the term of this Agreement, Executive shall have no rights, other than as
an unsecured general creditor of WSI, to any amounts held in trust and all trust
assets shall be general assets of WSI and subject to the claims of creditors of
WSI.

     6. Confidential Information. Executive will not while this Agreement is in
effect or after its expiration or termination, use, other than in connection
with Executive's employment with WSI, or disclose any confidential information
to any person not employed by WSI or not authorized by WSI to receive such
information without the prior written consent of WSI. Executive will use
reasonable and prudent care to safeguard, protect and prevent the unauthorized
disclosure of confidential information. The obligations contained in this
Section 6 will survive for as long as WSI in its sole judgment considers the
information to be confidential information.

     7. Disclosure and Assignment.

          (a) Disclosure. Executive will disclose promptly in writing to WSI all
     inventions, improvements, discoveries and writings and other works of
     authorship ("works") which are conceived, made, discovered or written
     jointly or singly on WSI time or on Executive's time, providing the
     invention, improvement, discovery, writing or other work is capable of
     being used by WSI in the normal course of business, and all such
     inventions, improvements, discoveries, writings and works are hereby
     assigned to, and belong solely and exclusively to WSI.

          (b) Assignment. Executive will sign and execute all instruments of
     assignment and other papers to evidence vestiture of the entire right,
     title, and interest in such inventions, improvements, discoveries,
     writings, or works in WSI, and will do all acts and sign all papers that
     WSI may reasonably request, relating to applications for patents, to
     patents, to copyrights, and to the enforcement and protection thereof. If
     such acts are requested and performed when Executive is not a WSI employee,
     WSI will pay a fee, determined by WSI, covering authorized time and
     expenses of Executive but no others.

          (c) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the
     contrary, Executive is hereby given NOTICE that the assignment and
     statement of WSI ownership does not apply to any INVENTION for which no
     equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret information of WSI was used
     and which was developed entirely on Executive's own time, and (1) which
     does not relate (i) directly to the business of WSI or (ii) to WSI's actual
     or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (2) which does not
     result from any work performed by Executive for WSI.

          (d) Survival of Obligations.

               (i) The obligations of this Section 7 survive the expiration or
          termination of this Agreement.

               (ii) This Agreement, or any termination hereof, has no effect on
          any other Employee Agreement previously executed by Executive which
          remains in full force and effect. To the extent there are any
          conflicts between this Agreement and such other Agreement, this
          Agreement prevails.

               (iii) Upon termination of employment, Executive will not take or
          retain, and will return to WSI all WSI property of any nature or kind.

     8. Successors; Binding Agreement.

          (a) WSI will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by
     purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all
     of the business and/or assets of WSI to expressly assume and agree to
     perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that WSI
     would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
     Failure of WSI to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
     effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement.

          (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
     Executive's personal or legal representatives, successors, heirs and
     designated beneficiaries. If Executive should die while any amount would
     still be payable to Executive hereunder if the Executive had continued to
     live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's designated
     beneficiaries, or, if there is no such designated beneficiary, to the
     Executive's estate.

     9. Notice. For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all other
communications provided for shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given when delivered or mailed by United States first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the last known residence address of the Executive or in
the case of WSI, to its principal office to the attention of its then Chief
Executive Officer, with a copy to its Secretary, or to such other address as
either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith,
except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

     10. Miscellaneous. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived
or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in
writing and signed by the parties. No waiver by either party hereto at any time
of any breach by the other party to this Agreement of, or compliance with, any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at
the same or at any prior or similar time. No agreements or representations, oral
or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have
been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.
The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. The invalidity or
unenforceability or any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect.
