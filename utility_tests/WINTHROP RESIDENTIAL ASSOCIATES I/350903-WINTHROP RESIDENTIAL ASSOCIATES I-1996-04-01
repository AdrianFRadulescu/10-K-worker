Item 1.  Business.

Development

         Winthrop  Residential  Associates I ("WRA I") was originally  organized
under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act of the State of Maryland on January
30, 1981, for the purpose of investing,  as a limited partner,  in other limited
partnerships which would develop,  manage,  own, operate and otherwise deal with
apartment  complexes  assisted by Federal,  state or local  government  agencies
("Local Limited  Partnerships")  pursuant to programs which do not significantly
restrict  distributions  to owners or the rates of return on investments in such
complexes. On June 23, 1983, WRA I elected to comply with and be governed by the
Maryland  Revised  Uniform  Limited  Partnership  Act (the  "Act") and filed its
Agreement and Certificate of Limited  Partnership (the "Partnership  Agreement")
with the Maryland State  Department of Assessments  and Taxation.  In accordance
with and upon filing its certificate of limited partnership pursuant to the Act,
WRA I  changed  its  name  to  Winthrop  Residential  Associates  I,  A  Limited
Partnership (the "Partnership").

         The General  Partners of the Partnership  are One Winthrop  Properties,
Inc., a  Massachusetts  corporation  ("One  Winthrop" or the  "Managing  General
Partner"), and Linnaeus- Hampshire Realty Limited Partnership (formerly known as
Linnaeus-Hampshire   Realty  Company),   a  Massachusetts   limited  partnership
("Linnaeus-Hampshire").  One  Winthrop  is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of First
Winthrop Corporation ("First Winthrop"),  a Delaware corporation,  which in turn
is wholly-owned by Winthrop Financial Associates, A Limited Partnership ("WFA"),
a Maryland public limited partnership. See "Change in Control".

         The Partnership was initially  capitalized with contributions  totaling
$2,000 from its two General Partners and with  contributions of $5,000 from each
of the two Initial Limited Partners.

         In early 1981, the Partnership  filed a Registration  Statement on Form
S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (Registration No. 2-70828) with
respect to a public  offering of 25,000  Units of limited  partnership  interest
("Units") at a purchase  price of $1,000 per Unit (an aggregate of  $25,000,000)
with an additional  2,500 Units  registered over and above the maximum of 25,000
Units for sale in the event that  subscriptions  in excess of the  25,000  Units
were  received.  The  Registration  Statement was declared  effective on May 13,
1981. The offering terminated in September 1981, at which time subscriptions had
been received for 25,666 Units,  representing capital contributions from Limited
Partners of $25,666,000.  Capital  contributions net of selling  commissions and
sales registration costs were utilized to purchase interests in 16 Local Limited
Partnerships and the remainder in temporary short-term investments.

Description of Business

         The only business of the  Partnership is investing as a limited partner
in other limited  partnerships  that own apartment  complexes  subsidized by the
U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban  Development  ("HUD").  The  Partnership's
investment  objectives  and  policies  are  described  at  pages  22-27  of  its
Prospectus dated May 13, 1981 (the "Prospectus")  under the caption  "Investment
Objectives and Policies," which description is attached hereto as an exhibit and
incorporated herein by this reference.  The Prospectus was previously filed with
the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b).

Local Limited Partnerships

         The  Partnership  initially  acquired  equity  interests in the form of
limited  partnership  interests  in 16 Local  Limited  Partnerships  owning  and
operating apartment complexes. The Partnership completed its acquisitions in May
1982.  The  Partnership  has sold its  interests in five  properties:  Greentree
Apartments  (November 1986), Marsh Cove Apartments (December 1986), Orchard Hill
(October  1988),  Racquet Club (May 1989),  and  Columbine  (May 1989).  A sixth
property,  Copperfield  Apartments,  was  sold  in  1985  by its  Local  Limited
Partnership  which provided seller financing with a second  mortgage.  The buyer
subsequently  defaulted on the second  mortgage in 1988,  and the Local  Limited
Partnership  completed  the  reacquisition  of the property in August 1991.  The
Partnership  lost its ownership  interests in The Park Apartments and Candlewood
Apartments  when HUD foreclosed on the Local Limited  Partnerships  owning those
properties  in August 1993 and January  1995,  respectively.  In  addition,  the
Villas, Shadowbrook and Stonewood were in default. See "Defaults" below.

         The  following  table  sets forth  certain  information  regarding  the
properties owned by the nine Local Limited Partnerships in which the Partnership
has retained an interest and which continue to own apartment complexes:

Defaults

       As noted above, the Partnership  holds limited  partnership  interests in
Local Limited  Partnerships  which own apartment  properties,  all of which were
originally  financed  with HUD-  insured  first  mortgages.  If a Local  Limited
Partnership  defaults on a  HUD-insured  mortgage,  the mortgagee can assign the
defaulted  mortgage to HUD and recover the principal  owed on its first mortgage
from HUD.  HUD,  in its  discretion,  may then  either (i)  negotiate  a workout
agreement with the Local Limited Partnership,  (ii) sell the mortgage to another
lender, or (iii) pursue its right to transfer the ownership of the property from
the Local Limited Partnership to HUD through a foreclosure action. The objective
of a workout agreement between an owner and HUD is to secure HUD's sanction of a
plan which,  over time,  will cure any mortgage  delinquencies.  While a workout
agreement is effective and its terms are being met, HUD agrees not to pursue any
remedies  available to it as a result of the default.  If the owner does default
under the terms of the workout  agreement or if HUD concludes that a property in
default lacks the ability to generate sufficient revenue to cure its default, it
may pursue its right to assume  ownership of the property  through  foreclosure.
HUD may also sell the  mortgage  to  another  lender.  Some  workout  agreements
terminate upon the sale of the mortgage to another lender.

       The  Partnership   holds   ownership   interests  in  two  Local  Limited
Partnerships  (Shadowbrook  and the Villas)  which are  currently  in default on
their mortgage  obligations.  One other Local Limited  Partnership  (Stonegate),
which had been in default,  entered into an agreement with HUD pursuant to which
the existing loan was modified. One Local Limited Partnership  (Candlewood) lost
its  property  in  January  1995 in a  foreclosure  sale and the  Local  Limited
Partnership (Stonewood) lost its property in a March 1996 foreclosure.

       The  Local  Limited  Partnership  owning  Shadowbrook  defaulted  on  its
mortgage in November  1987,  and the mortgage was  subsequently  assigned by the
lender to HUD.  HUD  agreed to a two-year  workout  agreement  which  expired in
December 1990. Since then, the Local Limited  Partnership has submitted  various
proposals to HUD, all of which had been rejected by HUD. In December  1995,  HUD
sold the mortgage to DL Mortgage.  The Local  Limited  Partnership  has signed a
pre-negotiation  letter agreement with the new lender and has submitted  various
proposals which are currently under review by the new lender.

       The Local Limited Partnership owning The Villas defaulted on its mortgage
obligation in November 1991.  The lender  assigned the mortgage to HUD in August
1992.  In January  1995,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  negotiated a one-year
Provisional  Workout  Arrangement  which is effective  from  February 1, 1995 to
January 31, 1996.  The Local Limited  Partnership  submitted an extension of the
agreement to HUD, which extension is currently under review by HUD. The terms of
the Provisional  Workout Arrangement require minimum debt service payments equal
to 85% of  accruing  interest as well as  payments  for real estate  taxes and a
service charge.



<PAGE>




       The Local Limited  Partnership owning Stonegate defaulted on its mortgage
obligation in July 1991. The lender assigned the mortgage to HUD in August 1992.
In late  1994,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  negotiated  its third  one-year
Provisional  Workout  Arrangement  (the  "Current  Agreement"),  effective  from
February 1, 1995 to January 31,  1996.  On December 1, 1995,  the Local  Limited
Partnership signed a corrected Modification of Mortgage Note and Mortgage.  This
modification  increased  the  principal  amount by the  $442,579.41  of  accrued
interest,  has an  interest  rate of 7.5%  and  reamortized  the  debt  over the
remaining term through December 1, 2022.

       In June 1991, Candlewood defaulted on a workout agreement that previously
had been negotiated with HUD. Subsequently,  a workout proposal submitted to HUD
to further  reduce the debt service  obligations  was not  approved.  In January
1995, HUD sold the property pursuant to a foreclosure sale. The Partnership will
recognize a taxable gain in 1995 of approximately  $120 per investment unit as a
result of the foreclosure sale.

       The Local Limited  Partnership owning Stonewood defaulted on its mortgage
in February  1988,  and the mortgage was assigned to HUD in September  1988. The
Local Limited  Partnership was unable to negotiate a workout  proposal which HUD
will approve.  In May 1995,  HUD sold the mortgage to Condor One, Inc. The Local
Limited Partnership signed a pre- negotiation  agreement with the new lender and
submitted  various  proposals to the new lender all of which were rejected.  The
new owner of the mortgage foreclosed on its mortgage on March 14, 1996.

       All of the Local Limited  Partnerships face the possibility that HUD or a
new  lender  if HUD  sells  its  mortgage,  (collectively  the  "Lender")  could
foreclose  on the  properties  as long as (i) the Lender  and the Local  Limited
Partnerships  have not entered  into a workout  agreement;  (ii) there is unpaid
interest and principal  owed the Lender,  and the Lender  determines  that it is
unlikely that the property can generate  sufficient revenue to cure the mortgage
delinquency. To date, however, the Lender has allowed, with the exception of The
Park,  Candlewood  and  Stonewood,  all of the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  to
maintain ownership of the properties,  while the Local Limited  Partnerships and
the Lender  attempt to  negotiate a plan which will allow  those  Local  Limited
Partnerships to work toward reducing the unpaid amounts.

Employees

       The Partnership  does not have any employees.  Services are performed for
the  Partnership by the Managing  General  Partner,  and agents  retained by it,
including an affiliate of the General Partners, Winthrop Management.

Change in Control

     Until  December 22, 1994, the sole general  partner of Linnaeus  Associates
Limited Partnership ("Linnaeus"),  which is the sole general partner of WFA, and
the  general  partner  of  Linnaeus-Hampshire,  was Arthur T.  Halleran,  Jr. On
December 22, 1994, pursuant to an Investment Agreement entered into among Nomura
Asset Capital Corporation  ("NACC"),  Mr. Halleran and certain other individuals
who comprised the senior management of WFA, the general partnership  interest in
Linnaeus was transferred to W.L. Realty, L.P. ("W.L. Realty").  W.L. Realty is a
Delaware limited  partnership,  the general partner of which was, until July 18,
1995, A.I. Realty Company,  LLC ("Realtyco").  The equity securities of Realtyco
are currently  held by certain  employees of NACC. On July 18, 1995  Londonderry
Acquisition  II  Limited  Partnership  (Londonderry  II"),  a  Delaware  limited
partnership,  and  affiliate of Apollo Real Estate  Advisors,  L.P.  ("Apollo"),
acquired, among other things, Realtyco's general partner interest in W.L. Realty
and a sixty four percent (64%) limited partnership  interest in W.L. Realty. WFA
also acquired the sole general partner interest of Linnaeus-Hampshire.

         As a result of the foregoing  acquisitions,  Londonderry II is the sole
general  partner of W.L.  Realty which is the sole general  partner of Linnaeus,
and  which in turn is the  sole  general  partner  of WFA.  As a  result  of the
foregoing,  effective  July 18,  1995,  Londonderry  II, an affiliate of Apollo,
became the controlling  entity of the General  Partners.  In connection with the
transfer of control,  the  officers and  directors of One Winthrop  resigned and
Londonderry II appointed new officers and directors. See Item 10, "Directors and
Executive Officers of Registrant.

Item 2.      Properties.

       Other than the  interests  in the Local  Limited  Partnerships  which own
properties  described  under  Item 1  above,  the  Partnership  does not own any
property.

Item 3.      Legal Proceedings.

       The  Partnership  is not a  party,  nor  are  any of  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships subject, to any material pending legal proceedings.

Item 4.      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.   None.

         No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the period
covered by this report.

Item 5.  Market  for the  Registrant's  Common  Stock  and  Related  Stockholder
     Matters.

       The Registrant is a partnership and thus has no common stock. There is no
active market for the Units.  Trading in the Units is sporadic and occurs solely
through private transactions.

       As of March 1, 1995,  there were 2,884  holders of Units  holding  25,585
units.

       The   Partnership   Agreement   requires  that  any  Cash  Available  for
Distribution (as defined in said agreement) be distributed  monthly or quarterly
to the Partners in specified  proportions and  priorities.  There are no outside
restrictions   on  the   Partnership's   present  or  future   ability  to  make
distributions  of Cash Available for  Distribution.  There was no Cash Available
for Distribution in 1995 or 1994.

          Item 6.   Selected Financial Data.

         The following represents selected financial data for Registrant for the
years ended  December 31, 1995,  1994,  1993,  1992 and 1991. The data should be

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
     of Operations.

Liquidity and Capital Reserves

       As of March 15, 1996, the  Partnership  retained an equity  interest in 8
Local  Limited  Partnerships.  The  Partnership  follows  the  equity  method of
accounting for these interests and recognizes its proportionate  share of income
and  losses  incurred  by the Local  Limited  Partnerships.  Through  1990,  the
recognition of losses decreased due to two factors.  First,  certain  properties
have  reached  break even  operations.  Second,  losses  which  would  cause the
investment account of a property to become negative are not recognized since the
Partnership  has no  obligation  to fund  them.  To  date,  the  recognition  of
$19,429,468 of the  Partnership's  equity in losses has been deferred.  In 1995,
$729,425  of such losses  were  deferred.  As of 1989,  the  Partnership  ceased
recognizing losses in certain  properties  because the Partnership's  investment
account in certain of the Local Limited  Partnerships  had been reduced to zero.
In the event the Partnership's investment account in a Local Limited Partnership
is  increased,  then the  Partnership  will be able to recognize  losses in that
Local Limited Partnership until the investment therein is again reduced to zero.
In 1990 and  1991,  the  Partnership  recognized  losses  from two of the  Local
Limited  Partnerships  as a result of a revaluation of the collateral  under the
Wrap  Mortgage  for  Copperfield  and  an  operating  deficit  advance  made  to
Candlewood in 1990 and 1991.  The equity method of accounting is used solely for
financial  reporting  purposes;  all losses  continue to be  recognized  for tax
purposes.  In 1991, the equity in losses was significantly  increased because of
the  recognition of $308,049 of losses from the Local Limited  Partnership  that
owns  Copperfield due to a  determination  that the property was worth less than
the  reacquisition  price. In 1992, the only equity in loss which was recognized
was for the Local Limited  Partnership  owning  Copperfield  due to its positive
investment balance. In 1993, equity in income from the Local Limited Partnership
owning Copperfield was recognized.

       Between  1994 and 1995,  the  Partnership  sustained  a  decrease  in its
investment  in the Local  Limited  Partnerships  in the amount of $10,743.  This
change  in  its  investment  is   attributable  to  two  factors.   First,   the
Partnership's  investment was decreased by $3,927  representing its share of the
equity in  income  available  from a Local  Limited  Partnership  (Copperfield).
Second,  the  Partnership's  investment was reduced by $6,816  representing  the
amortization of goodwill and capitalized costs.

       The tax  losses of the  Partnership  will  decrease  over time  since the
advantages of accelerated  depreciation taken by the Local Limited  Partnerships
are greatest in the earlier years.  Also,  the deductions for mortgage  interest
expenses will steadily  decrease as the principal  amounts of the mortgage loans
are amortized.

     The  Partnership  requires  cash  to pay  its  general  and  administrative
expenses  or  to  make  capital  contributions  to  any  of  the  Local  Limited
Partnerships which the Managing General Partner deems to be in the Partnership's
best interest to preserve its ownership interest. To date, all cash requirements
have been satisfied by interest  income,  cash  distributed by the Local Limited
Partnerships to the Partnership or by loans from First Winthrop.  (See the first
and second  paragraphs  of Item  13(a) for a  discussion  of the First  Winthrop
loans.)  The  Partnership  will be  unable to repay  its  indebtedness  to First
Winthrop, the accrued interest on that indebtedness or to fully fund its general
and administrative  expenses until such time as (i) the operating results of any
or all of the Local Limited  Partnerships  improve  sufficiently to provide cash
distributions to the Partnership,  or (ii) any or all of the properties owned by
the Local Limited  Partnerships can be sold at a price sufficient to provide net
sales proceeds to the Partnership.  In addition, any future contributions by the
Partnership  to the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  would  have to be  funded  by
additional  First  Winthrop  loans.   Should  First  Winthrop  fail  to  provide
additional loans to the Partnership, the Partnership would be unable to meet its
general and  administrative  expenses.  First Winthrop has no obligation to fund
these loans and there can be no assurance that if such loans were needed,  First
Wintrhop would provide such amounts.

       The Partnership does not intend to make advances to fund future operating
deficits incurred by any Local Limited Partnership,  but retains its prerogative
to  exercise a business  judgment  to reverse  this  position  if  circumstances
change.  Moreover,  the  Partnership  is not obligated to provide any additional
funds to the Local Limited  Partnerships to fund operating deficits.  If a Local
Limited  Partnership  sustains  continuing  operating  deficits and has no other
sources of funding, it is likely that it will eventually default on its mortgage
obligations  and  risk  a  foreclosure  on its  property  by  the  lender.  If a
foreclosure  were to  occur,  the  Local  Limited  Partnership  would  lose  its
investment  in the property and would incur a tax liability due to the recapture
of tax benefits taken in prior years. The Partnership,  as an owner of the Local
Limited  Partnership,  would  share  these  consequences  in  proportion  to its
ownership interest in the Local Limited Partnership.

Results of Operations

       A number of the  properties  owned by the Local  Limited  Partnership  in
which the Partnership has invested have operated at a deficit for many years due
to their location in areas with weak economies or overbuilt rental markets. Five
Local  Limited  Partnerships  have  defaulted  on  their  mortgage  obligations,
Candlewood,  Stonegate,  The Villas,  Shadowbrook and Stonewood.  Candlewood was
foreclosed on by HUD in January 1995, and Stonewood was foreclosed on by its new
lender in March 1996. See Item 1, "Business - Defaults".

       The five remaining properties met their financial obligations but did not
generate sufficient revenue to distribute any cash flow to the Partnership.

        College  Green  operated  at  break  even  in  1995;  therefore  no cash
distributions  will be made to the  Partnership in 1996.  Cash flow generated in
1993 and 1994 was held as cash reserves by the Local Limited  Partnership owning
College Green.

       Revenues and expenses at Heritage  Hill during 1995 were even as compared
to  positive  cash  flow  in  1994.  No  cash  distributions  were  made  to the
Partnership in 1994 or 1993.

       Copperfield  generated positive cash flow during 1995 and 1994. The Local
Limited Partnership has not yet determined the amount of distributions,  if any,
based on 1995 operations.  Cash flow generated in 1994 and 1993 was held as cash
reserves by the Local Limited



<PAGE>



Partnership.  No cash distribution was made in 1995 from 1994 operations.

       Lynnwood generated positive cash flow during 1995 and 1994. The 1995 cash
flow was  distributed  to partners with the  Partnership  receiving its $100,973
share of such cash flow in March 1996.  Cash flow  generated in 1994 was used to
repay advances to the local general partner.

       Revenues and expenses at Albany  Landing  during 1995 were even.  No cash
distribution will be made to the Partnership in 1996 and none were made in 1995,
1994 or 1993 due to prior years deficit operations.

       The Local  Limited  Partnerships'  objectives  are to  improve  operating
results for their  respective  properties and to obtain  workout  agreements for
those properties that are in default on their respective  mortgage  obligations.
If the Local Limited  Partnerships which own properties in default are unable to
negotiate a workout agreement with the Lender, the Local Limited Partnership may
lose the  property  through  foreclosure.  Any workout  agreement  entered  into
between the Lender and the Local Limited Partnerships will have no affect on the
Partnership's  ability to deduct  mortgage  interest  expense  unless the Lender
agrees to forgive such interest indebtedness.  As of March 15, 1996, none of the
Local Limited  Partnerships had agreements which would forgive accrued interest.
Based  on  the  Partnership's   original  investment  in  the  8  Local  Limited
Partnerships  in which  the  Partnership  currently  owns an  interest,  the two
properties  currently in default without a workout  agreement with HUD represent
32% of the total capital contributions made to those Local Limited Partnerships.

       The results of operations  for future years may differ from those in 1995
as a result  of many  factors.  One will be the  ability  of the  Local  Limited
Partnerships  which own  properties  in  default on their  mortgage  obligations
(Shadowbrook  and the Villas) to negotiate  workout  agreements  to modify their
debt service  requirements.  Another  will be the ability of each Local  Limited
Partnership to deal with the consequences of changing  economic  conditions that
affect  property  operations.  The  Partnership's  investment  in Local  Limited
Partnerships  owning  rental  real estate is subject to the risk  involved  with
management and ownership of rental real estate.  Vacancy levels,  rental payment
defaults and operating  expenses are all dependent on general and local economic
conditions.  Shifts in the economy could result in differing  operating  results
for each individual Local Limited Partnership.

       The Partnership's plan is to work with the Local Limited  Partnerships to
maintain  ownership  of and seek  workout  agreements  for those  properties  in
default on their  mortgage.  Although the  Partnership has no ability to force a
sale of properties owned by the Local Limited Partnerships, the Partnership will
also work with the Local Limited  Partnerships to investigate sale opportunities
and will  continue to work with the Local  Limited  Partnerships  to improve the
financial  performance of all the properties.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL ASSOCIATES I, A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  balance  sheets  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL
ASSOCIATES  I, A LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP  (a Maryland  limited  partnership)  as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of operations, changes in
partners' capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and  schedule  based on our
audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statements  of certain  Local  Limited
Partnerships,  the  investments  in  which  are  reflected  in the  accompanying
financial statements using the equity method of accounting and were written down
to zero (see Note 2).  Those  statements  were audited by other  auditors  whose
reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts  included for those Local Limited  Partnerships,  is based solely on the
reports of the other auditors.




<PAGE>



We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that our  audits  and the  reports  of  other  auditors  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  based on our audits and the  reports  of other  auditors,  the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position  of  WINTHROP  RESIDENTIAL   ASSOCIATES  I,  A  LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31,
1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  Schedule III, listed in the index to the
financial statements,  is the responsibility of WINTHROP RESIDENTIAL  ASSOCIATES
I, A LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP  management and is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission's  rules and is not a required part
of the basic  financial  statements.  This  schedule  has been  subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion,  fairly  states in all material  respects,  the  financial  data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1995

1.      ORGANIZATION

Winthrop  Residential  Associates I, A Limited Partnership (the  "Partnership"),
was organized on January 30, 1981 under the Uniform  Limited  Partnership Act of
the State of Maryland  to invest in limited  partnerships  (the  "Local  Limited
Partnerships") that develop,  manage,  operate and otherwise deal in government-
assisted apartment complexes that do not significantly restrict distributions to
owners or the rate of  return on  investments  in such  properties.  On June 23,
1983,  the  Partnership  elected to comply with and be governed by the  Maryland
Revised Uniform Limited  Partnership  Act. On May 22, 1984, the Limited Partners
approved an amendment to the Partnership  Agreement  enabling the Partnership to
own investments in Local Limited  Partnerships where the distribution of project
funds from  operations  or the rate of return on  investments  is  limited.  The
Partnership  will terminate on December 31, 2011, or sooner,  in accordance with
the terms of the Partnership Agreement.

2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Financial  Statements - The financial statements of the Partnership are prepared
on the accrual basis of accounting.

Use of Estimates-  The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income  Taxes - No provision  has been made for  federal,  state or local income
taxes in the financial  statements of the Partnership.  Partners are required to
report on their  individual tax returns their allocable share of income,  gains,
losses, deductions and credits of the Partnership. The Partnership files its tax
returns on the accrual  basis.  On May 29, 1981,  the Internal  Revenue  Service
issued a ruling that the  Partnership  will be classified  as a partnership  for
federal income tax purposes.

Investments  in Local Limited  Partnerships - The  Partnership  accounts for its
investment in each Local Limited Partnership using the equity method.  Under the
equity method of accounting,  the  investment  cost  (including  amounts paid or
accrued)  is  subsequently  adjusted  by the  Partnership's  share of the  Local
Limited  Partnership's  results of operations and by  distributions  received or
accrued.  Costs relating to the  acquisition  and selection of the investment in
the Local Limited  Partnerships  are  capitalized to the investment  account and
amortized over the life of the  investment or until the  investment  balance has
been written down to zero. Costs in excess of the Partnership's initial basis in
the net assets of the Local Limited Partnership are amortized over the estimated
useful  lives of the  underlying  assets.  Equity  in the loss of Local  Limited
Partnerships  is not recognized to the extent that the investment  balance would
become  negative since the  Partnership is not obligated to advance funds to the
Local Limited Partnerships.


3.      TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

One Winthrop Properties, Inc. ("One Winthrop"), the Managing General Partner; WP
Management  Co.,  Inc.  ("WP  Management"),  the  manager  of the  Partnership's
investments in the Local Limited Partnerships;  and Winthrop Financial Co., Inc.
("Winthrop   Financial")  are  wholly  owned   subsidiaries  of  First  Winthrop
Corporation ("First Winthrop"), which in turn is wholly owned by Winthrop



<PAGE>









NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT
(Continued)

Financial Associates, a limited partnership ("WFA").

WP  Management  is entitled  to a fee for  services  rendered  in  managing  the
Partnership's  investments in the Local Limited Partnerships equal to 10% of the
Partnership's  share of cash distributions from the Local Limited  Partnerships,
not to exceed one half of 1% of the sum of (a) the  amount of the  Partnership's
aggregate  total  investment  in all Local  Limited  Partnerships,  plus (b) the
Partnership's allocable share of all liens and mortgages secured by the projects
of all Local Limited Partnerships. The fee is noncumulative and commences at the
closing of each Local Limited Partnership's  permanent loan. No fees were earned
in 1995, 1994 or 1993.

The General Partners are entitled to 5% of Cash Available for  Distribution.  No
distribution was paid or accrued to the General Partners in 1995, 1994 or 1993.

The  Partnership has depleted its available  reserves and, as a result,  borrows
amounts  from  First  Winthrop  to pay  operating  expenses  and fund  operating
deficits at properties owned by the Local Limited  Partnerships.  The borrowings
from First  Winthrop bear interest at the prime rate (8.5% at December 31, 1995)
plus 1%. The accrued interest payable to First Winthrop is $446,854 and $382,333
at December 31, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The Partnership  will repay First
Winthrop's loans from cash flow generated by the Local Limited  Partnerships and
the  proceeds  of  any  sales  of  real  estate  owned  by  the  Local   Limited
Partnerships.  Due to the  nature  of  these  loans,  it is not  practicable  to
estimate their fair value because it cannot be determined whether financing with
similar terms and conditions would be available to the Partnership.

During the liquidation stage of the Partnership,  the General Partners and their
affiliates  are  entitled  to receive  certain  distributions,  subordinated  to
specified   minimum  returns  to  the  Limited  Partners  as  described  in  the
Partnership Agreement.

4.      INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS

As of  December  31,  1995,  the  Partnership  has  Limited  Partnership  equity
interests in nine Local Limited  Partnerships that own fully operating apartment
complexes.  These Local Limited Partnerships have outstanding mortgages totaling
$36,974,317, which are secured by the Local Limited Partnerships' real property,
security interests, liens and endorsements common to first mortgage loans.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)

During 1995, the Partnership made no additional investments in the Local Limited
Partnerships.  As of December 31, 1995,  the net  cumulative  operating  deficit
advanced to the local Limited Partnerships was $3,249,248, which the Partnership
has recorded as capital  contributions.  However, the Local Limited Partnerships
have accounted for $2,213,085 of these investments as operating deficit advances
and  $898,411 as capital  contributions.  The  remaining  $137,752  represents a
purchase of interests in a Local Limited Partnership, which is not accounted for
by the Local Limited Partnership.

The investment balance in Local Limited Partnerships as of December 31, 1995 and
1994 is as follows:

5.      TAXABLE INCOME

The  Partnership's  taxable  income  for 1995  differs  from the net  income for
financial  reporting  purposes  primarily due to accounting  differences  in the
recognition of amortization,  equity losses and gain on foreclosure  incurred by
the Local Limited Partnerships. The taxable income for 1995 is as follows:

6.      FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE

During 1993, the general  partner of The Park, in which the  Partnership  owns a
limited partnership interest,  was notified that the United States Department of
Housing and Urban  Development  (HUD) foreclosed on its mortgage in August 1993.
The  Partnership's  investment in The Park was zero at the time of  foreclosure,
and it had no obligation to fund any liabilities related to The Park.

One of the Local  Limited  Partnership,  Candlewood,  was unable to  negotiate a
workout  agreement with HUD,  resulting in a foreclosure sale of the property in
January 1995. The Partnership's investment in Candlewood for financial reporting
purposes  was zero at the time of  foreclosure.  The net  proceeds  of  $104,000
received  by the  Partnership  has been  recorded  as equity  income in the 1995
statement of operations.  For tax purposes, the Partnership recognized a gain of
approximately $3,400,000 in 1995 as a result of the foreclosure.


7.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As  of  December  31,  1995,  three  Local  Limited  Partnerships  (The  Villas,
Shadowbrook  and Stonewood)  were in default on their mortgage  obligation.  The
Villas is  presently  seeking to extend the workout  agreement  with HUD, as the
previous agreement has expired on January 31, 1996. The other two mortgage notes
in default were sold by HUD to third  parties  during 1995,  and the  regulatory
agreements  with HUD were  canceled.  Shadowbrook  has signed a  pre-negotiation
letter agreement with the new lender and has submitted  various  proposals which
are currently under review by the new lender.  Stonewood was unable to negotiate
a  restructuring  of the loan agreement with the new lender and the mortgage was
foreclosed  upon on March 14, 1996 (Note 8). The Partnership is not obligated to
fund operating deficits on mortgage loans at the Local Limited Partnerships.

8.      SUBSEQUENT EVENT

The mortgage for Stonewood  Associates  LTD. was foreclosed  upon in March 1996.
The Partnership's  investment in Stonewood for financial  reporting purposes was
zero at the time of foreclosure.  The Partnership  will recognize a taxable gain
of  approximately  $100 per unit of limited  partnership  interest  in 1996 as a
result of the foreclosure.

       (f)  Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings.   None

Item 11.  Executive Compensation.

     Registrant  is not  required  to and did not  pay any  compensation  to the
officers or directors  of the Managing  General  Partner.  The Managing  General
Partner  does not  presently  pay any  compensation  to any of its  officers  or
directors. (See Item 13, "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.")

Item 12.     Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.

       (a)   Security ownership of certain beneficial owners.

       The General  Partners own the entire  general  partnership  interest.  No
person or group is known by the  Partnership to be the beneficial  owner of more
than 5% of the  outstanding  Units at March  15,  1996.  Under  the  Partnership
Agreement,  the voting  rights of the Limited  Partners are limited and, in some
circumstances,  are subject to the prior receipt of certain  opinions of counsel
or judicial decisions.

       Under the Partnership Agreement,  the right to manage the business of the
Partnership  is vested in the General  Partners and is generally to be exercised
only by the Managing  General  Partner,  although  approval of the other General
Partner,   Linnaeus,  is  required  as  to  all  investments  in  Local  Limited
Partnerships  and in  connection  with any votes or consents  arising out of the
ownership of a Local Limited Partnership interest.


<PAGE>







       (b)   Security ownership of management.

       None of the  partners  of WFA  and  none of the  officers,  directors  or
general partners of the General  Partners,  owned any Units at March 15, 1996 in
individual capacities; however, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Winthrop owns
105 Units (.40%).

       (c)   Changes in control.

       There exists no  arrangement  known to the  Partnership  the operation of
which may at a subsequent  date result in a change in control of the Partnership
except as follows:

         In connection with its acquisition of control of Linnaeus,  Londonderry
II issued  NACC a $22  million  non-recourse  purchase  money note due 1998 (the
"Purchase Money Note"),  as set forth in a loan agreement,  dated as of July 14,
1995, by and between NACC and Londonderry II. Initial  security for the Purchase
Money Note  includes,  among other  things,  the  partnership  interests in W.L.
Realty  acquired by Londonderry II and the W.L. Realty  partnership  interest in
Linnaeus.  Accordingly, if Londonderry II does not satisfy its obligations under
the  Purchase  Money  Note,  NACC  would have the right to  foreclose  upon this
security and, as result, would gain control of the Partnership.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

       (a)  Transactions with management and others.

       The Partnership  began borrowing from First Winthrop in 1986, and through
December 31, 1995,  has borrowed a total of  $1,164,672  from First  Winthrop to
fund operating  deficits incurred by some Local Limited  Partnerships and to pay
the  Partnership's  general and  administrative  expenses.  Through December 31,
1995,  the  Partnership  has  repaid  $498,399  to First  Winthrop,  leaving  an
outstanding  loan balance of $666,273 on December 31, 1995.  The  following is a
summary of yearly  additions and payments on both the  principal  balance of the
loan and interest that has accrued on the loan:

Boston  prime rate plus 1%. No specific  repayment  terms were  negotiated.  The
Partnership  intends to repay the loans when the Partnership  receives cash from
either cash flow or sales proceeds from a Local Limited Partnership.

       Under  the  Partnership   Agreement,   the  General  Partners  and  their
affiliates   are   entitled  to  receive   various   fees,   commissions,   cash
distributions,  allocations of taxable income or loss and expense reimbursements
from the Partnership. The amounts of these items and the times at which they are
payable to the General  Partners or their affiliates are described at pages 9-12
and 31-33 of the Prospectus  under the captions  "Management  Compensation"  and
"Profits or Losses for Tax Purposes and Cash Distributions," respectively, which
descriptions are attached hereto as an Exhibit and  incorporated  herein by this
reference.

       There  were  no  fees,   commissions  or  cash  distributions  which  the
Partnership paid to or accrued for the account of the General Partners and their
affiliates for the year ended December 31, 1995. Four properties  owned by Local
Limited Partnerships,  Candlewood,  Villas, Stonewood and Shadowbrook,  paid, in
the aggregate,  property management fees of $141, 591 to Winthrop Management, an
affiliate of WFA.

       For the year ended December 31, 1995, the Partnership  allocated  $45,370
of  taxable   income  to  the   Managing   General   Partner   and   $75,617  to
Linnaeus-Hampshire.  See Note 3 of Notes to Financial  Statements for additional
information about transactions  between the Partnership and the General Partners
and their  affiliates.  In  addition,  $64,521 of interest at the Bank of Boston
prime rate plus 1% was accrued to the  account of First  Winthrop in 1995 on its
loan to the Partnership, however no interest was paid to First Winthrop in 1995.
The  principal  outstanding  on the loan from First  Winthrop was $666,273 as of
December 31, 1995.

       (b)   Certain business relationships.
