   Description  
                                     Flavor

        The Company conducts its food flavor business through its wholly-
   owned subsidiary Universal Flavor Corporation ("Universal Flavor"). 
   Universal Flavor manufactures and supplies flavors and ingredient systems
   to the dairy, food processor and beverage industries worldwide and is a
   recognized leader in the dairy and beverage flavor markets.  It operates
   plants located in Kearny, New Jersey; Amboy, Illinois; Indianapolis,
   Indiana; and Fenton, Missouri.  Universal Flavor has eleven additional
   plants in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Australia,
   New Zealand, Hong Kong and the Philippines.  Products are sold primarily
   through employee sales representatives with some assistance from food
   brokers.

        Strategic acquisitions have expanded Universal Flavor's product lines
   and processing capabilities.  In April 1990, the Company acquired the
   international flavor business of Felton Worldwide, a subsidiary of
   Harrisons and Crosfield, PLC, of Great Britain.  This acquisition
   strengthened Universal Flavor's position as a major flavor producer in
   Great Britain and gave Universal Flavor a larger presence on the European
   continent and in the Pacific Rim.  In September 1991, the Company acquired
   Fantasy Flavors, Inc.  Combining Fantasy's product lines with the
   Company's existing BlankeBaer operation positions Universal Flavor as the
   premier dairy ingredient systems supplier in North America.  The January
   1992 acquisition of Curt Georgi Imes, S.P.A. brought particular strength
   in the Italian bakery and dairy flavor markets, as well as experienced
   research and development and sophisticated analytical capabilities.  The
   January 1994 acquisition of Destillaciones Garcia de la Fuente, S.A.
   (DGF), based in Granada, Spain, provided a depth of expertise for
   expanding into aroma chemicals and essential oils, both of which are used
   to create flavors as well as fragrances.  In July 1994, Universal Flavors,
   through its international subsidiary, purchased its partner's 51% interest
   in Azteca en Ambesco de Mexico.  This purchase brought beverages and dairy
   flavor technology to the Company's other existing Mexican flavor business. 


                                      Color

        The Company, through its subsidiary Warner-Jenkinson Company ("W-J"),
   is the world's leading manufacturer of certified food colors.  It also has
   a growing share of the international natural color market.  Its products,
   sold under such brand names as RED SEAL and SPECTRACOAT, are used by
   producers of soft drinks, bakery products, processed foods, confections,
   pet foods, alcoholic beverages and pharmaceuticals.  W-J is headquartered
   in St. Louis, Missouri, the site of its major manufacturing facilities. 
   Latin American customers are served by W-J de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., a
   manufacturing and sales subsidiary located just outside of Mexico City. 
   W-J Canada (formerly Dyeco Ltd.) operates out of Kingston, Ontario.  Other
   manufacturing facilities are located in King's Lynn, Norfolk, England;
   Amersfoort, The Netherlands; and Tullamarine, Victoria, Australia. 
   Domestically, the W-J product line is sold principally by the Company's
   own sales force.  International sales are made through distributors and
   directly by the Company.

        Recent acquisitions have strengthened the business internationally
   which operates as W-J International.  In August 1991, the Company acquired
   the international food and cosmetic color operations of Morton
   International, Inc. which provided additional technology in cosmetic
   colors and a worldwide distribution network.  In June 1992, the Company
   acquired Butterfield Food Ingredients, Ltd., a British food color
   manufacturer with particular expertise in natural colors and
   pharmaceutical applications and additional international distribution,
   particularly in the Far East.  During 1993, the Company acquired Spectrum
   S.A., a Mexican food color distributor with approximately 20% market share
   in that country. 

                               Dehydrated Products

        The Company's subsidiary, Rogers Foods, Inc. ("Rogers"), produces
   dehydrated onion and garlic and the Company believes it to be the third
   largest producer of these products in the United States.  These items are
   marketed under the trademark ROGERS FOODS and private labels.  Rogers also
   produces and distributes chili powder, chili pepper, paprika, dehydrated
   vegetables such as parsley, celery and spinach, and oleoresin (a liquid
   chili pepper used as a highly concentrated coloring agent) under the brand
   name CHILI PRODUCTS.  Rogers believes it is one of the largest producers
   of these products.

        Rogers sells dehydrated products directly and through brokers to food
   manufacturers for use as ingredients and also for repackaging under
   private labels for sale to the retail market and to the food service
   industry.  Rogers' processing facilities are located in Turlock,
   Livingston and Greenfield, California.

        During 1994, the Company acquired a leading European processor of air
   and freeze-dried vegetables.  The acquisition gives the Company a base
   from which to expand its dehydrated products business internationally. 
   This acquisition in Ireland from Campbell Soup Company also expands the
   Company's dehydrated technology base to include freeze drying and
   "puffing," an air-steam process.  Vegetables processed using these
   technologies are premium products because they have a short reconstitution
   time, a benefit in today's convenience foods such as soups, snacks and
   other dry foods.

        The Irish operation consists of two companies managed as a single
   entity in Midleton, County Cork.  The group employs about 120 people and
   now operates as Mallow Foods Ltd.

                                      Yeast

        The Company specializes in the production of compressed, active dry
   and nutritional yeast products for sale to industrial, institutional and
   retail accounts under the RED STAR trademark.  Compressed yeast and cream
   yeast must be refrigerated and used soon after production.  Active dry
   yeast is a dehydrated product which has the advantages of longer shelf
   life, lower shipping costs and ease of handling.  Nutritional yeast is a
   rich source of B-complex vitamins and proteins.  Other yeast strains are
   produced specifically for the wine industry, and the Company purchases a
   number of allied products, including bakery mixes and baking powder, from
   others and distributes them.

        The largest market for yeast is the domestic baking industry.  In
   addition, active dry yeast is sold to food processors for inclusion in
   bread, pizza and similar mixes.  The compressed, active dry and
   fast-acting dry yeast products of the Company bearing the RED STAR and RED
   STAR QUICK RISE trademarks are sold in ready-to-use packages to retail
   stores and in two pound packages for food service use.  The Company
   believes it is the largest North American supplier of yeast to the
   commercial bakery market and the second largest supplier to the retail
   market.

        The business also exports yeast and allied products throughout the
   world and manages investments in companies operating yeast and allied
   product facilities in 12 offshore locations, two of which are wholly-owned
   subsidiaries.  The Company receives revenues in the form of dividends and
   technical assistance fees from these foreign affiliates.

        Company owned yeast plants are located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin;
   Baltimore, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; and Oakland, California.  The Company
   distributes its fermentation products largely through its own sales force
   from its distribution branches.  In 1994, the Company purchased a 20%
   stock interest in and entered an agreement with Minn-Dak Yeast Company,
   Inc. for contract manufacturing by Minn-Dak under the Red Star label and
   for Minn-Dak to supply molasses, a major raw material in yeast production,
   to the Company.

                                   BioProducts

        During 1994, the Company created the Red Star BioProducts Division
   from its existing Red Star Specialty Products Division and two
   acquisitions.  Red Star Specialty Products had been established as a
   small, stand-alone profit center in 1989 out of the Company's Fermentation
   group.  With internally developed expertise, the group focused on highly
   technical product development using extracts from brewer's and baker's
   yeast.  During 1993, Universal BioVentures, the Company's biotechnology
   group, was integrated into Red Star Specialty Products.  This group was
   given the mission to develop new biotechnological products utilizing the
   Company's extensive expertise in fermentation, and its research strengths
   in the molecular biology of microorganisms.

        The 1994 acquisitions of Champlain Industries Limited and the Biolux
   Group expanded the division's product lines and international presence,
   making the division a more significant part of the Company.

        Champlain Industries Limited produces savory flavorings and flavor
   enhancers from vegetable proteins, yeast, meats and milk protein. It is a
   leading producer of hydrolyzed vegetable proteins (HVP) in North America. 
   The company has operations in Canada, the U.S., and the United Kingdom. 

        The Biolux Group is a leading European producer of food, nutritional
   and feed ingredients derived from brewer's yeast.  The acquisition makes
   the Company a world leader in brewer's yeast extract technology,
   production and sales.  The Biolux Group consists of New Biolux in Belgium
   and Vitalevor in France.  Its products include flavor enhancers, health
   foods, feed ingredients and nutrients for pharmaceutical and biotechnology
   processes.  The Biolux Group is a major purchaser and processor of
   brewer's yeast in the European market.

        The expanded Red Star BioProducts Division serves the food
   processing, fermentation, agriculture, aquaculture and chemical
   intermediates industries as a diversified supplier of natural extracts and
   specialty cultures.  It supplies various natural extracts from brewer's
   yeast, baker's yeast, vegetable proteins, meat, casein and other naturally
   occurring materials.  These specialty extracts function primarily as
   flavor and texture modifiers and enhancers, and secondary flavorings in
   the food processing industries.  They also enjoy widespread use as
   palatability enhancers in the pet food and animal foodstuffs markets.  The
   nutritional and functional properties of Red Star BioProducts extracts are
   the basis for their use in cheese starter and pharmaceutical fermentations
   and in personal care applications.  

        The Company believes Red Star BioProducts is the leading supplier of
   yeast extracts and second in the supply of HVPs in the U.S. market.  The
   products are marketed under a number of Red Star and Champlain trademarks. 
   Commercial production and export of a new product named RED STAR Phaffia
   Yeast began in 1993.  The yeast Phaffia rhodozyma is a source of the red
   carotenoid compound called astaxanthin which is the natural pigment found
   in salmon, trout and shellfish.  This product was developed for use as an
   ingredient for feeds given to salmon produced by aquaculture.  The
   purchase of the technological properties of ZeaGen from ACX Technologies,
   Inc in 1993 provides other processes for development.

        The expanded division operates production facilities in Milwaukee and
   Juneau, Wisconsin; Harbor Beach, Michigan; Clifton, New Jersey; and in
   Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium and France.  More than half of the
   Division's products are now produced outside of the United States.  Its
   products are marketed through technically trained sales personnel directly
   to the customer and through distributors in some international markets.

                                  Frozen Foods

        On August 1, 1994, the Company completed the sale of Universal Frozen
   Foods Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Frozen Foods"),
   to ConAgra, Inc. for a base consideration of $163 million and an earnout
   consideration of approximately $57 million, payable over a five year
   period.  The sale was a major step in Universal Foods' strategic
   transition to a focus on value-added ingredients and ingredient systems
   for foods and other products. 

        Frozen Foods produced frozen potato products for U.S. and
   international markets, selling most of its product to the food service
   industry.  It did have a share of the retail market with branded and
   private labeled products.  It operated processing facilities in Twin
   Falls, Idaho; Hermiston, Oregon; and Pasco, Washington.  


   Research and Development/Quality Assurance 

        The Company believes that its competitive advantage and ability to
   develop and deliver value-added products is based on its technical
   expertise in the processing and application of its technology for foods
   and other products.  Therefore, the Company provides an above-industry
   average investment in research, development and quality assurance, and is
   committed to the training and development of its people.

        The Company employs approximately 300 people in research and quality
   assurance.  Over the past five years, research and development
   expenditures have increased an average of 10.4%.  Expenditures in fiscal
   1994 increased 13.0% over fiscal 1993 to $32.2 million from $28.5 million. 
   Expenditures in fiscal 1993 increased 7.1% to $28.5 million from $26.6
   million in fiscal 1992.  The Company's commitment to research and product
   development continues at a level significantly higher than the food
   industry average.  Of the aforesaid amounts, approximately $17.3 million
   in fiscal 1992, $17.9 million in fiscal 1993 and $20.4 million in fiscal
   1994, were research and development expenses as defined by the Financial
   Accounting Standards Board.

        To improve its research and development capabilities, the Company has
   been  upgrading its technical facilities.  In 1991, the Company
   refurbished much of its Technical Center located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
   to enhance its capabilities in product and process areas related to
   fermentation, including microbial genetics work carried out to develop
   improved strains of bakers yeast and engineering development facilities
   for process development and new product production scale-up activities. 
   In 1992, an $8 million Fermentation Development Facility was completed at
   the Technical Center to scale-up new biotechnological products for the Red
   Star BioProducts Division.  Two 10,000-gallon pure culture fermenters in
   this facility produce sufficient volumes to test market new products in
   order to establish them as commercially acceptable prior to investment in
   a full-scale production plant.

        In 1992, the Company completed a new research center for seed
   genetics and tissue culture at Livingston, California, for Dehydrated
   Products, and the Company enlarged food flavor research laboratories in
   Kearny, New Jersey.  During 1993, beverage flavor laboratories in
   Indianapolis were enlarged, new modern laboratories for research on color
   products at W-J's production site in St. Louis, Missouri were completed,
   and a new facility for quality assurance and technical customer services
   was added to the Turlock, California complex.   All of these facilities
   are designed to meet the specialized, strategic needs of the Company's
   operating units.

        The Company has a massive training program designed to introduce all
   personnel to team problem solving using statistical process control,
   teamwork and communication procedures under a program named "The Universal
   Way."  This program promotes the Company's commitment to continuous
   quality improvement of its products and services as a primary Company
   objective.

        As part of its commitment to quality as a competitive advantage, the
   Company has undertaken efforts to achieve certification to quality
   standards established by the International Organization for
   Standardization in Geneva, Switzerland, through its ISO 9000 series.  Red
   Star BioProducts believes it was the first North American ingredients
   supplier to receive ISO 9002 certification.  Universal Flavor facilities
   in Indiana and New Jersey in the United States and facilities in The
   Netherlands and United Kingdom have also been certified.


   Competition

        All Company products are sold in highly competitive markets.   Some
   competitors have more product lines and greater resources than the Company
   has.  Since the Company and its competitors utilize similar methods of
   production, marketing and delivery, the Company competes primarily on
   technical product development, process expertise, quality and service. 
   The Company competes in many market niches where price is not the most
   important variable.

        With the evolution of food processing as a global business,
   competition to supply the industry has taken on an increasingly global
   nature.  Universal Foods competes with only a few companies across
   multiple ingredient lines, and is more likely to encounter competition
   specific to individual businesses.

        In the worldwide flavor market, the Company's principal competition
   comes from other U.S. and European producers.  Building an international
   presence is a key goal for Universal Flavor as witnessed by the
   acquisitions of the international flavor business of Felton Worldwide in
   1990, Curt Georgi Imes, S.P.A. in 1992 and Destillaciones Garcia de la
   Fuente, S.A. in 1994; and the completion of a new plant in Belgium in
   order to meet increasing international flavor demands.

        The Company believes W-J is a leading producer of certified colors in
   North America and Western Europe; state of the art equipment, the latest
   process technology, and the most complete range of synthetic and natural
   colors constitute the basis for its market leadership position. 
   Acquisitions have resulted in product and process technology synergies,
   particularly in the cosmetic color market, as well as a growing
   international presence.

        For Dehydrated Products, the acquisition in Ireland begins an
   international expansion and strengthens export opportunities for U.S.
   based operations. Some price competition has been evident in the United
   States as a domestic competitor seeks to gain market share and a new
   competitor is adding capacity to the industry.  Red Star Yeast & Products
   continues to experience pricing pressures as a result of industry
   overcapacity.  Competition in Red Star BioProducts comes primarily from
   European producers.


   New Product Activity 

        With the Company's strategic focus on value-added ingredients and
   ingredient systems, the Company's emphasis has shifted from the
   development of major new products to application activities and processing
   improvements in the support of its customers' numerous new and
   reformulated products.

        These activities include a line of stable aqueous dispersion of
   colors for foods and pharmaceutical products.  Patents have been granted
   on the products marketed under the SPECTRASPRAY label and applied for on
   the SPECTRABLEND label.  The development of natural food colors continues
   to expand and is a growth opportunity for W-J.

        A variety of activities at Universal Flavor focus on the development
   of flavor solutions for low-fat and no-fat applications.  The group has
   developed a reaction flavor for imparting animal fat flavor to
   nutritionally preferred vegetable oils.  A new technology was installed
   for production of aseptically processed fruits for frozen yogurt and other
   products requiring fruit pieces.  Emphasis has been placed on the
   development of low-fat dairy flavor systems.  In 1993, a low-fat,
   cholesterol-free program was introduced for frozen desserts.  New flavored
   fruit pieces have also been developed to provide new textures, flavors and
   unique performance properties in bakery items.

        In 1992, Red Star BioProducts introduced RED STAR Phaffia Yeast. 
   This is the only commercially viable natural source of pink pigmentation
   for farm-raised salmon which achieve their flesh color through dietary
   supplements.  Three other processes to provide natural coloring and
   nutrients for aquaculture and agribusiness are currently under
   development.  In 1993 Red Star BioProducts introduced the FlavorMate 950
   series, the most potent flavor enhancer on the market, and the SavoryMate
   series, which are flavor enhancers designed for specific areas such as
   beef, poultry, pork, etc.

        In addition, the discussion of operational activities on Pages 6, 8,
   10, 12 and 14 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated by

        The principal raw material used in the production of yeast products
   is molasses, which is purchased through brokers and producers under yearly
   fixed-price contracts.  Processes have been developed to permit partial
   replacement of molasses with alternate, readily available substrates for
   use if molasses supplies should become limited.  In 1994, the Company
   entered a supply agreement with Minn-Dak Yeast Company, Inc., a major
   North American molasses supplier, to provide additional assurances of
   adequate supplies.

        Chili peppers, onion, garlic and other vegetables are acquired under
   annual contracts with numerous growers in the western United States and
   Ireland.  Chemicals and petrochemicals used to produce certified colors
   are obtained from several domestic and foreign suppliers.  Raw materials
   for natural colors, such as carmine, beta carotene, annatto and tumeric,
   are purchased from overseas and U.S. sources.  In the production of
   flavors, the principal raw materials include essential oils, aroma
   chemicals, botanicals, fruits and juices and are obtained from local
   vendors.  Flavor enhancers and secondary flavors are produced from spent
   brewer's yeast, baker's yeast from the Company's own operations, and
   vegetable materials such as corn and soybeans.  The acquisition of the
   Biolux Group in 1994 provides long-term contracts on supplies of spent
   brewer's yeast for European production needs.

        The Company believes that its required raw materials are generally in
   adequate supply and available from numerous competitively priced sources.


   Patents, Formulae and Trademarks 

        The Company owns or controls many patents, formulae and trademarks
   related to its businesses.  The businesses are not materially dependent
   upon patent or trademark protection; however, trademarks, patents and
   formulae are important for the continued consistent growth of the Company.


   Employees

        As of September 30, 1994, the Company employed about 4,100 persons
   worldwide (which includes approximately 200 seasonal employees).
   Approximately 821 employees are represented by one of 17 unions with whom
   the Company has collective bargaining relationships.  The Company
   considers its employee relations to be good.


   Regulation 

        Compliance with government provisions regulating the discharge of
   material into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of
   the environment, did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
   operations for the year covered by this report nor is such compliance
   expected to have a material effect in the succeeding two years.  As is
   true with the food industry in general, the production, packaging,
   labeling and distribution of the products of the Company are subject to
   the regulations of various federal, state and local governmental agencies,
   in particular the Food & Drug Administration.

   ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

        Domestically, the Company had seventeen manufacturing and processing
   plants in nine states as of September 30, 1994.  Four plants produced
   bakers yeast, four facilities provided flavor enhancers and bioproducts,
   three produced dehydrated products, two plants produced colors and four
   plants produced flavors.  None of these properties is held subject to any
   material encumbrances. The Company also has investments in fifteen
   companies operating yeast and allied product facilities located in twelve
   offshore locations.  The Company operates five color plants, eleven flavor
   plants, five bioproducts facilities and one dehydrated vegetable plant in
   thirteen foreign countries.  For information regarding lease commitments,
   see Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Commitments and
   Contingencies, on Page 32 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders, which
   is hereby incorporated by reference.

   ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        The Company is a party to various legal proceedings of a character
   regarded as normal to its business and in which, the Company believes,
   adverse decisions, in the aggregate, would not subject the Company to
   damages of a material amount.

   ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

        There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during
   the last quarter of fiscal 1994.

   ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
             MATTERS

        The principal market in which the common stock of the Company is
   traded is the New York Stock Exchange.  The range of the high and low
   sales prices as quoted in the New York Stock Exchange - Composite
   Transaction tape for the common stock of the Company and the amount of
   dividends declared for fiscal 1994 appearing under "Quarterly Financial
   Data" on Page 22 of the 1994 Annual Report of the Company are incorporated
   by reference.  Common stock dividends were paid on a quarterly basis, and
   it is expected that quarterly dividends will continue to be paid in the
   future.  In addition to the restrictions contained in its Restated
   Articles of Incorporation, the Company is subject to restrictions on the
   amount of dividends which may be paid on its common stock under the
   provisions of various credit agreements.  On the basis of the consolidated
   financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 1994, $27,258,000
   is available for the payment of dividends on the common stock of the
   Company under the most restrictive loan covenants.

        The Company had a stock repurchase program, initially announced June
   7, 1984, under which the authorization terminated in fiscal 1994. 
   Consequently, on January 27, 1994 the Board of Directors established a new
   share repurchase program which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to
   2.5 million shares.  As of September 30, 1994, no shares had been
   repurchased under the new authorization.

        On September 8, 1988 the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a
   common stock shareholder rights plan which is described at Note E of Notes
   to Consolidated Financial Statements - Shareholders' Equity on Pages 29
   and 30 of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is incorporated
   by reference.

        The number of shareholders of record on December 2, 1994 was 6,351.

   ITEM 6.   SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

        Long-term obligations at September 30 were as follows:  1994:
   $172,235,000; 1993: $171,907,000; 1992: $167,746,000; 1991: $152,213,000;
   and 1990: $122,454,000.  Remaining information in response to this item is
   incorporated by reference from the "Five-Year Review" and the notes
   thereto of the 1994 Annual Report to Shareholders on Page 34.

   ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
             RESULTS OF OPERATION 

        Management's Analysis of Operations and Financial Condition is
   incorporated by reference from Pages 18 through 21 of the 1994 Annual
   Report to Shareholders.

   ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

        The supplementary financial information and financial statements
   required by this item are set forth on Pages 22 through 33 of the 1994
   Annual Report to Shareholders and are incorporated by reference.

                                    PART III

   ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

        Information regarding directors and officers appearing under
   "Election of Directors" (ending before "Committees of the Board of
   Directors") and "Other Matters" on Pages 3 through Page 6 and Page 16,
   respectively, of the Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement of the
   Company dated December 16, 1994, is incorporated by reference.

   ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

        Information relating to compensation of directors and officers is
   incorporated by reference from "Director Compensation and Benefits," and
   "Compensation and Development Committee Report" and "Executive
   Compensation" on Pages 7 through 14 of the Notice of Annual Meeting and
   Proxy Statement of the Company dated December 16, 1994.

   ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The discussion of securities ownership of certain beneficial owners
   and management appearing under "Principal Shareholders" on Pages 8 through
   9 of the Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement of the Company dated
   December 16, 1994, is incorporated by reference.

   ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

        There are no family relationships between any of the directors,
   nominees for director and officers of the Company nor any arrangement or
   understanding between any director or officer or any other person pursuant
   to which any of the nominees has been nominated.  No director, nominee for
   director or officer had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any
   business transaction of the Company or any subsidiary during the period
   October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994, or in any such proposed
   transaction.  In the ordinary course of business, the Company engages in
   business transactions with companies whose officers or directors are also
   directors of the Company. These transactions are routine in nature and are
   conducted on an arm's-length basis.  The terms of any such transactions
   are comparable at all times to those obtainable in business transactions
   with unrelated persons.

   FLAVOR

   Improved operating margins, strong U.S. food and beverage flavor
   performance and market penetration in the Pacific Rim were the ingredients
   for recovery in our Flavor Division. Operating profits were up and revenue
   rose by 9%.  Flavor formulations for teas, juices and isotonic beverages
   helped boost beverage flavor revenues 11% in the U.S. Food flavor revenues
   were up 16% on the strength of new bread and pizza dough flavor systems
   and snack flavors. More development efforts were devoted to applications
   in food service, the fastest growing segment of the food industry. And
   with 90% of U.S. shoppers turning to lite foods, our low fat bakery and
   dairy flavor systems were incorporated into leading brand cookies and
   super premium ice creams. We also continue to leverage our dairy
   technology to value-added uses.  International growth came from our
   expanding presence in the Pacific Rim where we established a technical
   service and application laboratory in Japan. In Europe, where the economy
   is still recovering, we opened new business opportunities through the
   acquisition of a Spanish aroma chemical business for flavor and fragrance
   formulations.  Capital spending focused on establishing an integrated
   information system and on expanding and upgrading dairy flavors and aroma
   chemical facilities and equipment.

   COLOR

   The Color Division continued its strong performance in 1994. Revenue was
   up 16%, volumes rose 26% and operating income continued to improve.
   Domestic food and cosmetic color revenue rose 15%. Sales of value-added
   color dispersions climbed 25% as we created specialized solutions for
   customers. Non-food uses and new markets boosted revenues from dyes by
   19%. New Age and fruit beverages helped propel a 23% increase in natural
   colors. We strengthened our process technology leadership through the
   ongoing transformation of our St. Louis, Missouri, manufacturing complex
   into the most modern color production facility in the world. During the
   year we completed the construction of a state-of-the-art facility to
   produce Lake pigments. These high-performance pigments are safe, water-
   insoluble coloring agents for foods, drugs, cosmetics, personal care items
   and food packaging materials. We also expanded our technical capabilities
   for manufacturing several new dye intermediates and drug and cosmetic
   dyes. Process technologies to purify and separate natural colors and
   blending and drying operations were improved. Internationally, improved
   economic conditions in Europe and strong Pacific Rim sales offset flat
   results in Latin America during 1994. A new warehousing and production
   facility serves Asia from Australia. We also expanded our European
   production and warehousing facilities.

   It's the extra measure of reliability and technical expertise that makes
   our colors more than a commodity for international candy manufacturer
   Leaf, Inc. Whether it's customized shades, easier-to-apply coatings,
   single color systems for use worldwide, research on foreign regulations
   and labeling or on-site help during production start-up, our color
   specialists have created a relationship that spells sweet success for such
   familiar brands as Good & Plenty, Switzer Licorice and Jolly Rancher Mega
   Fruit Gummis.

   DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS

   The acquisition of a European base for expanding our Dehydrated Products
   business and three top supplier awards for our North American operations
   marked the year. Operating profits and revenue were up.  Intensified
   attention to customer needs through on site interviews and our own ongoing
   employee involvement teams paid off for our California-based operations
   during 1994. They were named supplier of the year by three food processors
   for product quality, reliability and the intangibles related to exceeding
   customer expectations. Our North American operations are also expanding
   their product line in response to customer needs. Additions include bell
   peppers, leeks and carrots with a number of others being considered and
   tested. For our major onion, garlic and chili product lines, crop
   conditions were generally good and harvests normal. Volumes of specialty
   parsley and other dehydrated greens were up significantly.  As a base from
   which to expand internationally, we purchased a leading European processor
   of dehydrated vegetables in June.  The acquisition in Ireland from
   Campbell Soup Company also expands our technology to include freeze drying
   and "puffing," an air-steam process. Vegetables processed using these
   technologies are premium products because they have a short reconstitution
   time, a benefit in today's soups, snacks and other convenience foods. 

   The Pillsbury Company expects more of its suppliers and is sparing in its
   awards. The $4 billion food company has over 1,000 suppliers; fewer than
   1% are honored each year. We were the first dehydrated vegetable supplier
   to earn their coveted Supplier of the Year Award, not just for on-time
   delivery of quality products or technical support, but for going the
   "extra mile." Through our innovative Voice of the Customer program, we
   visited Pillsbury's operations, interviewed people at all levels, listened
   to their needs and, most importantly, took action.

   RED STAR YEAST & PRODUCTS

   Securing our position as the leading, low cost yeast supplier in North
   America was the top priority for Red Star Yeast & Products. Volumes and
   revenue were up though operating margins declined. With continued pricing
   pressure in the baker's yeast market due to the competitive environment
   and overcapacity, we took several steps to reduce costs while ensuring a
   high level of customer satisfaction. These included restructuring our
   sales and marketing group, improving manufacturing efficiency and
   enhancing product quality. We also developed partnerships with
   distributors to provide reliable service at lower costs. To secure an
   adequate source of molasses, the raw material that feeds yeast cell
   growth, we entered a supply agreement with a major molasses producer. 
   With shifts in consumer habits and new nutritional guidelines, we've
   benefitted from the growing market for bagels, nutritional and "boutique"
   breads, and frozen dough for restaurant use. We also introduced a new
   dough conditioner with all natural ingredients to meet commercial bakers'
   needs.  Retail yeast sales continued to get a boost from the bread machine
   boom, promoted through joint marketing and couponing with bread machine
   and packaged bread mix makers. We also introduced a yeast specially
   formulated and packaged for bread machines.

   Creating healthy breads is the passion of the people at Natural Ovens of
   Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Only natural, quality ingredients will do. That's
   why they have relied on Red Star Yeast as their business has blossomed
   over the past 17 years. Whether it's fresh yeast for rising 25,000 loaves
   a day or active-dry yeast for new low-fat bread machine mixes, we nurture
   consistent product quality through continuous improvement efforts like the
   one that won our Presidential Leadership Award for a Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
   production team.

   <PAGE>

   RED STAR BIOPRODUCTS 

   Red Star BioProducts was created in 1994 from our Specialty Products
   Division and two acquisitions to quadruple the size of this business.
   Revenue and operating profits were up significantly in the base business,
   with additional contributions from the acquisitions.  From an internal
   venture developing highly technical products using our baker's yeast and
   spent brewer's yeast, this business has grown to become the leading North
   American producer of flavor extracts. It is poised for rapid global
   expansion with over half of our production now outside the U.S.   The
   fourth quarter acquisitions of Champlain Industries and the Biolux Group
   significantly expanded our product lines and international reach. By
   combining our technology with their expertise, we can create new, high
   performance natural extracts and specialty cultures, and have a European
   base from which to build a strong international market position. Champlain
   Industries produces savory flavorings and flavor enhancers from vegetable,
   meat and milk proteins and yeast. It is a leading producer of hydrolyzed
   vegetable proteins in North America, with operations in Canada, the U.S.,
   and the United Kingdom.  The acquisition of the Biolux Group makes us the
   world leader in brewer's yeast extract technology, production and sales.
   With operations in Belgium and France, its products include flavor
   enhancers, health foods, feed ingredients and micro-nutrients for
   pharmaceutical and biotechnology processes. 

   Today's multi-national food companies expect their research and
   development people to roll out and support hundreds of products a year.
   Our specialists know that effectively presenting ideas that meet these
   companies' needs helps drive their innovation. By going beyond traditional
   sales calls, we educate customers on the unique characteristics of our Red
   Star flavor enhancers. And we demonstrate their capabilities by
   formulating them into our customers' existing products. For our customers,
   the demonstration of good taste is the ultimate test.

   MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
   Years ended September 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992

   Summary of Operations

   In line with Universal Foods' strategy to seek higher-growth
   opportunities, the Company divested its Frozen Foods Division in 1994 and
   made four acquisitions totalling approximately $100 million in annualized
   revenue. Results for the year were affected by the sale of the Frozen
   Foods Division, which represented 26% of 1994 revenue and 30% of 1993
   revenue, but less than that of operating income. The acquisitions made
   modest contributions to the results of the year, based on when they were
   acquired during fiscal 1994.

   Net earnings in 1994 were $50.9 million or $1.95 per share compared with
   $33.0 million or $1.25 per share in 1993. The 1994 net earnings include a
   one time pre-tax charge for restructuring of $12.1 million or $0.29 per
   share after tax. The 1993 net earnings include the cumulative effect of
   accounting changes of $23.6 million or $0.90 per share. Excluding the
   restructuring charge and accounting changes, earnings per share rose 4% to
   $2.24 in 1994 from $2.15 in 1993. Revenue for 1994 also rose 4% to $929.9
   million compared with $891.6 million in 1993.

   The restructuring includes product line consolidations in the Company's
   Flavor Division and the reorganization of sales, marketing and
   distribution functions in the Red Star Yeast & Products Division. The
   restructuring is being implemented during the first half of fiscal 1995
   and will help boost the Company's future performance.

   Results in 1994 were favorably impacted by the strong performance of the
   Color Division and improvements in the Flavor Division's domestic food and
   beverage business, as well as results in the Pacific Rim and the
   contribution of an acquisition in Europe. Strong growth in its base
   business and two acquisitions benefitted the Red Star BioProducts
   Division.

   Financial Condition and Outlook

   Universal Foods' financial condition remains sound. The company is
   conservative in its financial dealings, but will take prudent risks when
   the anticipated return is appropriate. 

   The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.7 in 1994
   compared with 1.8 in 1993 and 1.6 in 1992. Long-term debt was 31.2% of
   total invested capital at the conclusion of 1994, 32.1% at the end of 1993
   and 33.9% at the end of 1992. 

   Although the Company focuses on higher-growth businesses, it continues to
   compete in a low-inflation and slow-growth environment in the food
   industry, especially domestically where food processors are experiencing
   only modest volume growth coupled with competitive pricing. The result
   will be an ongoing emphasis on cost reduction efforts aimed at suppliers,
   and further consolidation and downsizing among food processors. The
   Company views these industry conditions as an opportunity to be among the
   select number of companies participating in long-term supplier
   relationships. 

   Universal Foods' growth in this industry environment will come from volume
   gains generated by market share growth, the impact of previous
   acquisitions, modest price increases, a continued shift to high-margin
   product mixes and decreased costs. Additional growth is possible through
   acquisitions. The Company also expects to continue to increase total
   revenue provided by exports and manufacturing operations outside the
   United States to enhance its position as a supplier to international
   customers.

   Certain of the Company's businesses and products provide slower, stable
   growth while others can be expected to achieve higher levels of
   performance. As a supplier of value-added ingredients, the Company can
   benefit from new trends in the food and beverage industry. It has the
   technology and flexibility to meet changing customer needs as well as to
   supply both brand name and private label manufacturers. Additional
   opportunities exist in leveraging its food-related technology and
   processing expertise into other areas. Currently, about 10% of revenue
   comes from non-food applications.

   Review of Operations

   Revenue: Revenue in 1994 was $930 million compared with $892 million in
   1993 and $883 million in 1992. In 1994 the Company's ongoing operations
   increased revenues by $67 million which was offset by revenue declines of
   $29 million in the Frozen Foods Division which was sold on August 1, 1994.

   Of the 1994 sales growth from ongoing operations, 33% was generated from
   the Flavor Division by volume gains through acquisitions, growth in U.S.
   food and beverage flavors and strong sales in the Pacific Rim. The Color
   Division generated 29% of the revenue growth through volume gains and a
   concentration of sales in higher dollar-value products. The BioProducts
   Division contributed 22% of the gains through growth in higher-value
   products and the benefit of two acquisitions in the fourth fiscal quarter.
   Modest revenue gains were also achieved by the Dehydrated and Red Star
   Yeast & Products Divisions. 

   In 1993, the Company was able to continue growth in revenue through
   acquisitions, volume increases and market share growth, both domestically
   and internationally, despite the loss of approximately $35 million in
   revenue from the closing of a Minnesota french fry processing plant in
   1992. Of the 1993 increase in revenue of $43 million from ongoing
   operations, 24% of the growth was generated by the Color Division due to
   volume gains from acquisitions and a concentration of sales in higher
   dollar-value products. Increased volumes and strong retail sales fueled
   the Red Star Yeast & Products Division's contribution of another 23% to
   the total revenue gain. The gains more than offset the 6% revenue decline
   in the Frozen Foods Division resulting primarily from the closing of the
   Minnesota plant in 1992. Revenue from the Flavor Division declined
   slightly due to weak demand in Europe and in the domestic dairy flavors
   market.

   International Revenue: Revenue generated outside the United States is
   becoming increasingly important to the Company. In 1994, such revenue was
   $232 million, or approximately 25% of total revenue. Approximately 20% of
   total revenue was from international manufacturing activities and the
   remaining 5% from export sales.

   The Company continues to recognize that expansion internationally will
   play a key role in its overall growth. With the 1994 sale of the Frozen
   Foods Division and the full-year impact of acquisitions made in the fourth
   quarter of fiscal 1994, the percentage of revenue generated outside of the
   U.S. is expected to reach approximately 35% in 1995.

   Revenue generated outside the United States was $184 million in 1993, or
   21% of total Company sales. In 1992, it was $176 million or 20%.

   Cost of Products Sold: The cost of products sold represented 66% of
   revenue in 1994 and 1993, and 67% in 1992. The flat level in 1994 compared
   with 1993 reflects higher raw material costs in the Frozen Foods Division
   which were offset by volume efficiencies in the Flavor and BioProducts
   Divisions.
    
   Selling and Administrative Expenses: Expenses remained flat at 22% of
   revenue in 1994 and 1993, compared with 21% in 1992. The flat level of
   expenses reflects the Company's continued focus on cost reduction.

   Operating Income: Excluding a one-time charge for restructuring of $12.1
   million, operating income in 1994 increased by $3 million, or 3%. This
   compares with an increase of $3 million, or 3%, in 1993 when compared with
   1992 operating income, excluding a one-time, pre-tax charge of $19.3
   million. Operating income decreased $4 million, or 3%, in 1992.

   The 1994 increase is attributable to operating income increases in the
   Flavor, Color and BioProducts Divisions which offset weak operating
   earnings in the Frozen Foods Division due to increased selling costs and
   production costs associated with raw material quality. 

   The 1993 increase was attributable to a sales focus on higher-margin
   products Company-wide, and to improvements in the Frozen Foods Division.
   The operating income decline in 1992 was attributable to very competitive
   conditions in the frozen french fry and baker's yeast industries.

   Income Tax: The effective rate of income tax expense was 37.3% in 1994,
   compared with 37.5% in 1993 and 37.8% in 1992. The effective tax rate
   varies from the statutory rate due to the addition of state taxes and the
   non-tax-deductibility of intangible amortization, less the benefits of tax
   credits. We anticipate the effective tax rate for fiscal 1995 will be
   approximately 37.5%, excluding any impact from the sale of the Frozen
   Foods Division.

   In August 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 was signed into law
   as an amendment to the United States Internal Revenue Code. The Company
   has reviewed the provisions of the Act and, based on the initial
   assessment, it is anticipated that the new tax act will not have a
   material impact on the Company's future operating results. 

   Accounting Changes: During 1993, Universal Foods adopted Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for
   Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," SFAS No. 112 "Employers'
   Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for
   Income Taxes." Standards 106 and 112 require the accrual of certain
   benefit costs during the years an employee provides service rather than
   when they are paid. The combined impact of these accounting changes
   resulted in a cumulative, non-cash charge to net earnings in 1993 of $23.6
   million or $0.90 per share. 

   Review of Financial Condition--Balance Sheet

   Assets: Assets increased 5%. The increase reflects approximately $130
   million of assets acquired offset by the sale of Frozen Foods Division
   assets of approximately $171 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased
   primarily as a result of $163 million of cash proceeds received to date
   from the sale of the Frozen Foods Division less the cost of businesses
   acquired and the reduction in short-term borrowings. 

   In 1993, assets increased 4%. A strong sales performance in September
   resulted in a 6% increase in trade accounts receivable as well as the flat
   inventory levels at the end of the year. Two small business acquisitions,
   Spectrum, S.A. and Columbia Sun, Inc., and the 1993 capital expenditure
   program contributed to the increase. Assets increased 7% in 1992 primarily
   due to acquisitions. Trade accounts receivable increased 19%, reflective
   of three European acquisitions made since August 1991. 

   Current Liabilities and Long-Term Debt: Current liabilities in 1994
   increased 10% primarily as a result of the 1994 acquisitions and the
   Frozen Foods sale. Long-term debt, including current maturities, increased
   $15 million. During 1994 the Company borrowed $40 million of fixed-rate
   long-term debt at interest rates of approximately 6.54%. 

   In 1993, current liabilities decreased 5% while long-term debt experienced
   an increase of 2%. Certain short-term borrowings were paid off from
   positive cash flow generated in 1993 or were refinanced with long-term
   borrowings. Two 1993 business acquisitions and the purchase of certain
   technological properties from a third business also required the use of
   additional long-term debt.

   The increase in total liabilities in fiscal 1992 was a direct result of
   two European acquisitions and the repurchase of approximately 459,000
   shares of Company stock.

   Floating rate borrowings under a commercial paper program are classified
   as long-term debt because the committed revolving credit line which backs
   up this program has a two-year term.

   Universal Foods has a goal of maintaining long-term debt below 35% of
   invested capital, and if exceeded, to return to that level within a three-
   year period. Long-term borrowings were in line with this objective in
   1994.

   Shareholders' Equity: Total shareholders' equity rose $22.3 million, or
   7%, in 1994. The Company's goal is to achieve a return on average
   shareholders' equity of 20% each year. In 1994, this return was 18.5%
   compared with 18.0% in 1993 and 17.6% in 1992, excluding adjustments for
   accounting changes and unusual items.

   Review of Financial Condition Cash Flow

   Operating Activities: Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents net of
   short-term borrowings, improved by $42.4 million in 1994 following an
   increase of $17.6 million in 1993 and a $25.6 million decrease in 1992.
   The increase was due to the sale of the Frozen Foods Division.

   The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash provided from
   operating activities and external debt. Historically, the Company's
   liquidity position has been adequate to fund substantial investments to
   sustain the Company's growth. Working capital needs and plant and
   equipment requirements during 1994 were funded from internally generated
   cash and the proceeds of the sale of the Frozen Foods Division, as well as
   long-term borrowing made in accordance with the Company's credit
   agreements. 

   It is anticipated that the Company's internally generated cash will be
   sufficient to fund anticipated operating and capital expenditures during
   fiscal 1995. Acquisitions may require additional funding but will be made
   in accordance with the Company's long-term debt-to-capital ratio objective
   as well as other measures of financial strength.

   Investing Activities: With customers placing increased responsibility on
   their suppliers to develop unique products and provide the best service,
   continued investment in technology and process expertise is key to
   remaining a supplier of choice. Capital spending in 1994 totaled $55.1
   million compared with $36.3 million during 1993. Among the more
   significant capital projects in 1994 were ones to add capacity and upgrade
   computer systems in the Flavor Division, to improve efficiencies in the
   Frozen Foods Division, and to increase capacity in the Color Division.

   During 1994, the Company acquired four businesses: Destillaciones Garcia
   de la Fuente, S.A., a Spanish flavor and fragrance business; a unit of the
   Campbell Soup Company based in Ireland which now operates as Mallow Foods,
   a dehydrator of vegetables products; Champlain Industries Limited, a
   Canadian producer of flavor enchancers and savory flavorings; and the
   Biolux Group, a European producer of ingredients from brewer's yeast. The
   total purchase price was $91.5 million. In 1994, the Company also entered
   an agreement with Minn-Dak Yeast Company, Inc. for contract manufacturing
   under the Red Star label and to supply molasses, a major raw material in
   yeast production. In keeping with the Company's overall business strategy,
   these acquisitions are expected to enhance current manufacturing and
   distribution capabilities, as well as expand its abilities in new product
   development.

   In fiscal 1995, capital expenditures are anticipated to be between $40 and
   $50 million; depreciation should approximate $30 million.

   Financing Activities: The Company is favorably viewed by many lenders in
   the short-term debt market and can borrow at very attractive rates. For
   this reason, it uses commercial paper raised in the Milwaukee market as a
   source for much of its working capital needs.

   The Company has paid uninterrupted quarterly dividends since commencing
   public trading in its stock over twenty years ago. In 1994 dividends paid
   per share were $0.92, up 5% over $0.88 in 1993, which was an increase of
   5% over $0.84 in 1992. As evidence of the Company's continued effort to
   provide shareholders with immediate and tangible participation of current
   earnings, the dividends paid in 1994 represented 41% of net earnings
   before the one-time restructuring charge, exceeding the Company's goal of
   paying annual cash dividends between 35% and 40% of earnings. Subsequent
   to year-end, the dividend on common shares was increased to an annualized
   rate of $0.96 per share, a 4% increase.

   Other Issues

   Inflation: Over the last three fiscal years, inflation has had a minimal
   effect on reported results of operations and the Company's financial
   condition. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by
   adjusting product prices, as well as aggressively making cost and quality
   improvements, including capital investments in more efficient plants and
   equipment and investment in employee training and development. Although
   inflation has slowed in the United States in recent years, it is still a
   factor in some of the Company's markets around the world. Nevertheless,
   inflation is not expected to adversely affect 1995 results.

   Environmental Issues: Universal Foods has a proactive environmental
   program, taking the initiative rather than waiting for legal mandates to
   prod action. The Company provides employee training and encourages active
   employee involvement with respect to environmental concerns.

   The Company has strengthened its environmental policy, placing emphasis on
   process changes to reduce or eliminate environmental discharges, rather
   than relying on costly emission control investments to treat waste after
   it is produced.

   Equal Opportunity Policy: Universal Foods is an Equal Opportunity
   Employer. The Company strives to create a working environment free of
   discrimination and harassment with respect to race, sex, color, national
   origin, religion, age, disability or being a veteran of the Vietnam era,
   as well as to make reasonable accommodations in the employment of
   qualified individuals with disabilities.

   Corporate Governance: Universal Foods believes it is managed in a way that
   is fair to all its shareholders and which allows its shareholders to
   maximize the value of their investment by participating in the present and
   future growth of the Company. 

   Independent Board of Directors: The Company's Board of Directors is
   composed primarily of independent members. Nominees for board members are
   selected to provide a diversity of expertise, experience and achievements
   in general business and food-related fields which allow the Board to most
   effectively represent the interests of all the Company's shareholders. 

   Independent Committees: The principle audit, nominating and compensation
   and development committees of the board are composed of directors who are
   not employees of the Company. These committees, as well as the entire
   Board, consult with and are advised by outside consultants and experts in
   connection with their deliberations as needed. 

   Executive Compensation: A significant portion of executive compensation is
   tied to the Company's success in meeting specific performance goals. The
   overall objectives of this policy are to attract and retain the best
   possible executive talent, to motivate these executives to achieve the
   Company's business strategy goals, to link executive and shareholder
   interests through equity-based plans and to provide a program that
   recognizes individual contributions. 

   Scientific Advisory Committee: As an advisory committee to the Board, this
   group reviews research and development programs with respect to the
   quality and scope of work undertaken, advises the Company on maintaining
   product leadership through technological innovation, reports on new
   technological trends and suggests new emphasis for research. 

   Confidential Voting: The Company provides for confidential shareholder
   voting by employing an independent tabulation service. Proxy cards which
   identify the particular vote of a shareholder are not seen by the Company
   unless it is necessary to meet legal requirements or in the event a
   shareholder has made a written comment.

   Corporate Responsibility: The Company is committed to the health and well-

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   Years ended September 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992

   Note A  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

   Nature of Business The Company manufactures and distributes dehydrated
   products, food colors and flavors, frozen potato products, yeast and other
   fermentation products. In 1994, the Company sold its frozen potato
   products business (see Note B).

   Consolidated Subsidiaries and Investments in Other Companies Substantially
   all of the Company's subsidiaries are wholly-owned and their accounts are
   consolidated into the Company's financial statements. The Company also has
   minority interests in certain foreign companies for which it reports
   earnings when cash is received for technical assistance fees and
   dividends. There are no immediate prospects of other earnings
   distributions.

   Cash and Cash Equivalents Checks outstanding in excess of related cash
   balances for disbursing accounts of approximately $5,211,000 and
   $7,584,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively, have been
   reclassified as accounts payable and accrued expenses. The Company
   considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
   less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The effect of the Company's
   foreign operations on cash flows is not material.

   Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
   determined using primarily the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

   Depreciation Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
   plant and equipment using the straight-line method for financial
   reporting. Accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes.

   Intangibles Intangibles represent primarily the excess of cost over net
   tangible assets of companies acquired. Goodwill is being amortized on the
   straight-line method over forty years. Other intangibles, including supply
   contracts, non-compete agreements and formulae, are stated at cost and
   amortized on the straight-line basis over periods of two to twenty years.

   Financial Instruments In the normal course of its business, the Company
   enters into financial instrument transactions with off-balance sheet risk
   in order to hedge its exposure to market risk regarding currency
   transactions and interest rates.

   Foreign Currency Contracts The Company enters into contracts to hedge
   transactions denominated in international currencies and to hedge payment
   of intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. At September
   30, 1994, the Company had approximately $27,600,000 of foreign currency
   forward contracts and currency swaps outstanding. The difference between
   the contracts and estimated fair values at September 30, 1994 is not
   significant. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts that
   hedge operating activities are recognized currently in net earnings.
   Realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts that hedge net
   investments are recognized in the foreign currency adjustment in
   shareholders' equity.

   Interest Rate Swaps The Company utilizes interest rate swaps of various
   maturities with multiple major financial institutions to manage interest
   rate exposure associated with the Company's debt. The notional amount of
   interest rate swaps outstanding as of September 30, 1994 and 1993 was
   $40,000,000. Credit and market risk exposure are limited to net interest
   differentials which are reflected in interest expense as they are accrued.
   The fair value of the swaps, a (payable) receivable of ($200,000) and
   $1,200,000, are the approximate amounts that would be paid or received to
   terminate the agreements as of September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   Translation of Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities of foreign
   operations are translated into United States dollars at current exchange
   rates. Income and expense accounts are translated into United States
   dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
   Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements of most
   international units are included as foreign currency translation
   adjustments in the equity section of the balance sheets. Net transaction
   (gains) losses of ($697,000) in 1994, $162,000 in 1993 and ($705,000) in
   1992, are included in earnings before income taxes.


   Note B  Acquisitions, Divestiture and Unusual Items:

   The Company entered into an agreement to sell its Frozen Foods Subsidiary
   effective July 31, 1994. The sale price has not been finalized and,
   accordingly, at September 30, 1994 the base consideration received of
   $163,000,000 less the net book value of the subsidiary and other costs
   related to the sale has been included on the balance sheet with accounts
   payable and accrued expenses. The anticipated gain resulting from the sale
   will be reflected in the Company's results of operations upon resolution
   of the closing balance sheet valuation.

   In July 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
   Champlain Industries Limited, a manufacturer of savory flavorings and
   flavor enhancers, for $61,744,000 of which $37,258,000 was paid in cash
   and the remaining purchase price is payable in equal installments of
   $12,243,000 on June 30, 1995 and June 30, 1996. Also during 1994, the
   Company purchased several other businesses for an aggregate purchase price
   of $33,302,000. The excess of the total aggregate cost of all the 1994
   acquisitions over the fair value of net assets acquired of approximately
   $61,413,000 is being amortized by the straight-line method over forty
   years. On an unaudited pro forma basis, the effects of the acquisitions
   were not significant to the Company's 1994 results of operations.

   In the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company provided for the costs of
   restructuring its worldwide operations. The charge relates primarily to
   the consolidation of its operations. This restructuring charge reduced
   1994 earnings before income taxes, net earnings and earnings per share by
   $12,125,000, $7,600,000 and $.29, respectively. 

   In 1993, the Company acquired technology and two businesses for $9,614,000
   cash.

   During 1992, the Company acquired two foreign businesses for an aggregate
   purchase price of $23,741,000. The excess of the total aggregate cost over
   the fair value of net assets acquired of approximately $20,159,000 is
   being amortized by the straight-line method over forty years.

   The above acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and,
   accordingly, their results of operations have been included in the
   financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.

   In July 1992, the Company terminated the lease of its frozen potato
   processing facility in Park Rapids, Minnesota. In connection with the
   lease termination, a one-time pre-tax charge to earnings of $19,300,000
   was recorded and is shown as an unusual item. This charge includes early
   termination of the lease, disposition of leasehold improvements and other
   costs related to ceasing production in this facility. The charge resulted
   in a decrease in net earnings of $12,014,000 ($.45 per share) for the year
   ended September 30, 1992.

   Note C  Inventories:

   Inventories include finished and in-process products in the amount of
   $101,046,000 and $114,178,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993,
   respectively, and raw materials and supplies of $55,075,000 and
   $60,404,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   Note D Debt:

   Long-term debt consists of the following obligations:

   The Company has a $55,000,000 Revolving Loan Agreement with a group of
   five banks. Under the agreement, the Company has the option to elect to
   have the interest rates determined based upon the prime commercial rate,
   Eurodollar rate plus margin or the certificate of deposit rate plus
   margin. A commitment fee is payable on the unused amount of credit. The
   facility matures in July 1996. Uncommitted lines of credit totalling
   $139,000,000 are also available to the Company from several banks, some of
   which participate in the Revolver.

   The Company issues short-term commercial paper obligations supported by
   committed lines of credit included in the Revolving Loan Agreement. The
   Company intends to exercise its option to borrow under the commitment
   prior to its expiration date, or in the event commercial paper borrowings
   cannot be renewed. Consequently, at September 30, 1994 and September 30,
   1993, $1,031,000 and $46,489,000 have been reclassified as long-term debt,
   respectively.

   The aggregate amounts of maturities on long-term debt each year for the
   five years subsequent to September 30, 1994 are as follows: 1995,
   $20,775,000; 1996, $41,912,000; 1997, $7,066,000; 1998, $7,781,000 and
   1999, $9,817,000.

   Substantially all of the loan agreements contain restrictions concerning
   working capital, borrowings, investments and dividends. Earnings
   reinvested of $27,258,000 at September 30, 1994 were unrestricted.

   The fair value of long-term debt (including current maturities) is
   calculated using discounted cash flows for all fixed rate debt. Market
   interest rates are used to determine discount factors used in the
   calculation. The fair value at September 30, 1994 and 1993 was
   approximately $190,000,000 and $193,000,000, respectively.

   Short-term borrowings consist of the following obligations:

   Note E  Shareholders' Equity:

   In 1988, the Board of Directors adopted a common stock shareholder rights
   plan ("Right") which entitles each shareholder of record to receive a
   dividend distribution of common stock upon the occurrence of certain
   events. The Right becomes exercisable and tradeable ten days after a
   person or group acquires 20% or more, or makes an offer to acquire 20% or
   more, of the Company's outstanding common stock. When exercisable, each
   Right entitles the holder to purchase $100 worth of Company common stock
   for $50. Further, upon the occurrence of a merger or transfer of more than
   50% of the Company's assets, the Right entitles the holder to purchase
   common stock of the Company or common stock of an "acquiring company"
   having a market value equivalent to two times the exercise price of the
   Right. At no time does the Right have any voting power. The Right is
   subject to redemption by the Company's Board of Directors for $.01 per
   Right at any time prior to the date which a person or group acquires
   beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Company's common stock or
   subsequent thereto at the option of the Board of Directors. The Rights
   expire on September 8, 1998.

   In January 1994, the shareholders approved the 1994 Employee Stock Plan
   (the "1994 Plan") under which the Company may issue up to 1,200,000 shares
   of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options or the grant of
   restricted stock. Of the total number, up to 250,000 shares may be awarded
   as restricted stock. The 1994 Plan also authorizes the grant of up to
   400,000 stock appreciation rights (SARs) in connection with stock options.
   The Company also has shares available under the previously approved 1990
   Stock Plan for Executive employees (the "1990 Plan"). 

   Under the 1990 Plan, SARs have been granted in connection with certain
   stock options.  In lieu of exercising a stock option, SAR holders are
   entitled, upon exercise of a SAR, to receive cash in an amount equal to
   the excess of the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise
   over the option price.

   The Plans have awarded shares of restricted stock which become freely
   transferable at the end of the period of restriction--five years. During
   the period of restriction, the employee has voting rights and is entitled
   to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the
   stock.

   Transactions with respect to stock options are summarized as follows:

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   At September 30, 1994, 868,662 shares were exercisable at prices ranging
   from $11.833 to $36.125.

   The Company is authorized to issue 250,000 shares of cumulative preferred
   stock.

   The Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") had loans with a
   third party lender which were guaranteed by the Company. During 1994, the
   ESOP repaid the loans with proceeds from Company contributions and
   dividends paid on Company stock. The ESOP's debt of $2,200,000 at
   September 30, 1993 is shown as a reduction of shareholders' equity.

   Note F Retirement Plans:

   The Company primarily provides benefits under defined contribution plans
   including a savings plan and ESOP. The savings plan covers substantially
   all domestic salaried and certain non-union hourly employees and provides
   for matching contributions up to 4% of each employee's salary. The ESOP
   covers substantially all domestic employees not covered by a defined
   benefit plan and provides for contributions of 6% to 10% of the employees
   salary. Total expense for the Company's defined contribution plans was
   $8,112,000, $7,364,000 and $6,994,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
   respectively.

   Note G Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits:

   The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to eligible
   domestic retirees and their dependents. Effective October 1, 1992, the
   Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
   Standards No. 106 (SFAS No. 106) "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
   Benefits Other Than Pensions," whereby the cost of postretirement benefits
   is accrued during an employee's active service period. Prior to October 1,
   1992, benefits were charged to operations in the period the claims were
   paid and were not material. The Company elected to immediately recognize
   the transition obligation for future benefits to be paid relating to past
   employee services in fiscal 1993.

   The postretirement benefit expense includes the following components:

   (Dollars in thousands)                         1994     1993  
    
   Service cost                                  $1,586   $1,784 
   Interest cost on accumulated
    benefit obligation                            1,977    2,118 
   Amortization of prior service cost              (352)      -- 
   Other                                             --      160 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Postretirement benefit expense                $3,211   $4,062 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Company continues to fund benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go basis, with
   retirees paying a portion of the costs. The status of the Company's
   postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 1994 and 1993 was:

   (Dollars in thousands)                         1994     1993  
   Actuarial present value of accumulated
    benefit obligation:
     Retirees                                   $ 8,287  $ 8,422 
     Fully eligible active plan participants      2,253    2,555 
     Other active plan participants              11,506   14,230 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Accumulated benefit obligation                22,046   25,207 
   Unrecognized prior service cost                5,277    7,032 
   Unrecognized gain                              2,662       -- 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Postretirement benefits accrued              $29,985  $32,239 

   The weighted average discount rates used in determining the accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 1994 and 1993 were 8.0%
   and 7.5%, respectively. The assumed health care cost trend rate used in
   measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 15% in
   1993, 14% in 1994, gradually declining to 7% by the year 2001 and
   remaining at that level thereafter. A one percentage point increase in the
   assumed cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement
   benefit obligation as of September 30, 1994 by approximately $4,300,000
   and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the 1994
   postretirement benefit expense by $867,000.

   During 1994, the Company had a curtailment of accumulated postretirement
   benefits relating to employees of the Frozen Foods Subsidiary which was
   sold effective July 31, 1994. The gain resulting from the curtailment has
   been included with other costs of the transaction and will be recognized
   when the sale is finalized (see Note B).

   In addition, effective October 1, 1992, the Company adopted Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS No. 112), "Employers' Accounting For
   Postemployment Benefits." This standard requires employers to accrue the
   cost of benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but
   before retirement.

   The adoption of SFAS Nos. 106 and 112, resulted in a non-cash pre-tax
   charge of $37,700,000 as of October 1, 1992 and has been reflected as a
   cumulative effect of accounting changes. Net earnings per share, before
   cumulative effect of accounting changes, for the year ended September 30,
   1993 would have been $2.25, as compared to $2.15, if SFAS Nos. 106 and 112
   had not been adopted.

   Note H Income Taxes:

   Effective October 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109).
   The cumulative and fiscal 1993 effect of the accounting change was not
   material. SFAS No. 109 requires the Company to compute deferred income
   taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
   bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the
   years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
   allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to
   the amount expected to be realized.

   The provision for income taxes, including the income tax effect of
   accounting changes in 1993, is as follows:

   (Dollars in thousands)                 1994       1993        1992

                                        --------   --------    --------

   The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
   portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

   Domestic income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of
   foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be permanently invested. If
   undistributed foreign earnings were to be remitted, foreign tax credits
   would substantially offset any resulting domestic tax liability.

   Note I  Commitments and Contingencies:

   Aggregate minimum rental commitments at September 30, 1994 for all
   noncancelable operating leases with an initial term greater than one year
   were as follows:

   MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The management of Universal Foods Corporation is responsible for
   preparation of the financial statements and other financial information
   included in this annual report. The financial statements have been
   prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

   It is management's policy to maintain a control-conscious environment
   through an effective system of internal accounting controls. These
   controls are supported by the careful selection of competent and
   knowledgeable personnel and by the communication of standard accounting
   and reporting policies and procedures throughout the Company. These
   controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
   safeguarded against material loss or unauthorized use and to produce the
   records necessary for the preparation of reliable financial information.
   There are limits inherent in all systems of internal control based on the
   recognition that the costs of such systems should be related to the
   benefits to be derived. Management believes that its systems provide this
   appropriate balance.

   The control environment is complemented by the Company's internal audit
   function, which evaluates the adequacy of the controls, policies, and
   procedures in place, as well as adherence to them, and recommends
   improvements for implementation when applicable. In addition, the
   Company's independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have developed an
   understanding of the Company's accounting and financial controls and have
   conducted such tests as they considered necessary to render an opinion on
   the Company's financial statements.

   The Board of Directors pursues its over-sight role with respect to the
   Company's financial statements through the Audit Committee, which is
   composed solely of outside directors. The Audit Committee recommends
   selection of the Company's auditors and meets with them and the internal
   auditors to review the overall scope and specific plans for their
   respective audits and results from those audits. The Committee also meets
   with management to review overall accounting policies relating to the
   reporting of financial results. Both the independent auditors and internal
   auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.

   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

   To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Universal Foods Corporation:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal
   Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and 1993, and
   the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and
   cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
   1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
   management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
   statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
   obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
   free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
   basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
   statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
   used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
   the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
   provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
   all material respects, the financial position of the companies as of
   September 30, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their
   cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
   1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

   As discussed in Note G to the consolidated financial statements, effective
   October 1, 1992, the companies changed their methods of accounting for
   postretirement benefits other than pensions and postemployment benefits to
   conform with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 and No.
   112, respectively.
