PART I

Item 1.         Business.

      The Turner Corporation (the "Company") is  a
holding company that is engaged together with  its
subsidiaries in general building construction  and
construction management in the United  States  and
abroad and in real estate investment in the United
States.    The   Turner  Corporation   establishes
general   policy   direction,   coordination   and
planning,  and provides cash management,  internal
accounting  control and other management  services
for its operating subsidiaries.

    Due  to economic conditions generally, and  to
factors specifically affecting the commercial real
estate  market,  beginning in 1989,  there  was  a
significant  slowdown in commercial  construction.
In  an  effort  to  minimize the effects  of  this
slowdown,  during  the  last  several  years,  the
company's   construction  subsidiaries   increased
their    focus    on   manufacturing, municipal,
institutional,  public,  justice   and   amusement
(i.e.,  hospital, university, aviation, aquariums,
arenas  and similar) projects.  Approximately  70%
in  dollar value of the contracts awarded  to  the
construction  subsidiaries in 1994 were  in  these
areas.

     During   1993,   plans  were   developed   to
significantly   reduce   the   company's    future
operating  costs  and  expenses  and  to   improve
productivity.     This    restructuring    program
principally involved a reduction in the number  of
staff,  plus  the  consolidation  of  offices  and
facilities  and  the  reorganization  of   support
functions.   This  program  was  implemented   and
substantially completed in 1994. Its  final  phase
is  expected  to be completed in  1995.   While  a
portion  of  the  benefits of  restructuring  were
realized  in 1994, the full benefits are  expected
to be realized in 1995 and thereafter.

    During  the early 1980's, the Company acquired
and  developed a number of properties.   In  1987,
the  Company  decided to discontinue its new 
development activities and began trying to dispose
of the properties it owned.

    During 1994, the Company sold one developed real
estate property, two land parcels and a number of
condominium  units  for $7.5  million  which was
essentially the carrying amount of the properties on the company's  books.
While the Company continues to seek purchasers for
its real estate properties, it is unlikely it will
be  able  to  dispose of its properties  in  their
entirety  until  there  are  more  stable   market
conditions  in  the areas in which  the  company's
properties are located.

    In addition to its property sales, during 1994
the Company sold its master lease and development
rights at the Rickenbacker Air Industrial Park for
$1.8 million.

    Financial  information about the  registrant's
operations  in  its construction and  real  estate
segments  appear  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements and in footnote 15 on page 34  in  Part
II, Item 8 of this report.

    At  December 31, 1994, The Turner  Corporation
and   subsidiaries  employed  approximately  2,500
staff  employees, of which 1,400 held  supervisory
positions    and    1,100   held   non-supervisory
positions.
Construction Business

       The   Turner   Corporation's   construction
business  is conducted by a number of construction
subsidiaries  (together,  "Turner  Construction").
Turner  Construction is engaged primarily  in  the
construction   of   commercial  and   multi-family
residential buildings, manufacturing and  research
facilities,  hospitals,  correctional  facilities,
stadiums   and  other  entertainment   facilities,
airports  and  other structures.  It  also  has  a
division  which  does  interior  work,   such   as
building-out  office  space.  Turner  Construction
normally  does not build roads, dams,  or  similar
infrastructure   elements.   Turner   Construction
primarily acts as a general building contractor or
as   a   construction  manager.   However,  Turner
Construction  also sometimes acts as a  consultant
to owners and others.

     Although  Turner Construction is a nationwide
(and  to  a lesser extent, worldwide) construction
firm,  Turner  Construction  attempts  to  compete
locally  in  major  cities of  the  United  States
through    essentially   self-contained   regional
offices   and   partially  self-contained   branch
offices. Its objective is to be a major builder in
each city or region in which it has an office.

       The    Turner    Corporation's    principal
construction  subsidiary  is  Turner  Construction
Company.   Universal Construction Co.,  Inc.,  The
Lathrop  Company  Inc., and  Turner  Caribe  Inc.,
wholly-owned  subsidiary companies of  The  Turner
Corporation  or Turner Construction  Company,  are
also  engaged  in construction activities  in  the
United   States  principally  in  the   Southeast,
Midwest and the Caribbean Islands.

       When   it   acts  as  a  general   building
contractor,    Turner    Construction     normally
undertakes to construct a project and is paid  the
entire  price  for  the completed  project.   Most
aspects   of   the  construction,   however,   are
performed by subcontractors who are paid by Turner
Construction.  The functions actually performed by
Turner   Construction   are   the   planning   and
scheduling   of   a  construction   project,   the
procurement  of materials, the marshaling  of  the
manpower required for the project, the awarding of
subcontracts  and the direction and management  of
the  construction operation.  During  1994,  1993,
and  1992  general building contracting activities
represented  81%,  75%, and 83%, respectively,  of
Turner Construction's value of work completed.

      Turner Construction makes extensive  use  of
specialty  contractors (such as  structural  steel
contractors,  electrical contractors and  plumbing
contractors) as subcontractors in the  performance
of  its  construction contracts.   The  extent  to
which  work  is performed by workmen  on  its  own
payroll  varies with the location of a  particular
project   and   is   largely  dependent   on   the
availability  of experienced subcontractors  in  a
particular   area.   Work  performed   by   Turner
Construction  is  generally limited  to  temporary
facilities,  foundation,  concrete,  masonry   and
carpentry work.

     In its performance of construction management
services, Turner Construction, for a fee, monitors
and  coordinates the progress of the work done  by
specialty contractors who are employed directly by
the owner to build the project.  During 1994, 1993
and  1992  management  construction  services  and
consulting   represented   19%,   25%   and   17%,
respectively,  of Turner Construction's  value  of
work completed.  Construction management contracts
involve less risk than do projects in which Turner
Construction  is  a  general building  contractor.
However,  the profit from construction  management
contracts  can  be substantially  less  than  that
which Turner Construction can earn when it acts as
a general building contractor.

      Construction contracts include lump  sum  or
fixed   price  contracts,  cost-plus   fixed   fee
contracts  and variations thereof including  cost-
plus guaranteed total contracts.  The majority  of
Turner Construction's business involves negotiated
contracts.   The  remainder of its  contracts  are
secured by competitive bidding.

     The  Company  is a partner with Karl  Steiner
Holding  AG ("Steiner") of Switzerland in a  joint
venture    by   the   name   of   Turner   Steiner
International  SA, which renders general  building
construction and construction consulting  services
outside   Turner  Construction's   and   Steiner's
respective home markets.

     In South America, Turner Construction Company
is  a  partner with Birmann SA of Brazil in a joint
venture  by the name of Turner Birmann Construction
Management Do Brazil SA.  The purpose of the  joint
venture is to provide construction management  and
consulting services to clients in Brazil and other
South American markets.

     The  Company  is  also a partner  with  EMCON
in a joint venture  by the name of ET Environmental
Corporation    which     provides environmental 
 engineering,   general    building
construction, and construction management services
on  environmental projects throughout  the  United
States.

       The  United  States  building  construction
industry  is  intensely  competitive  and   Turner
Construction   Company  and  the  other   domestic
construction subsidiaries compete with other major
contractors  as  well as with  small  contractors.
Competition in the industry takes on a  number  of
forms,  including fee levels, quality  of  service
and   degree  of  risk  assumption.   Construction
companies can expand their operations rapidly  and
each  large  population  center  generally  has  a
number   of   medium-sized  building   contractors
accustomed to undertaking all but the largest  and
most    complicated   projects.     Through    its
organizational     structure    of     permanently
established   decentralized  branch  offices   and
subsidiaries,    Turner   Construction    competes
directly  with  those locally  based  contractors.
Year-to-year operations may be adversely  affected
by   general   economic   conditions   which   are
unfavorable  for  business  and  industry.   Exact
statistical  data is not available for determining
the   relative  size  of  construction  companies,
however,   based   on   the  contract   value   of
construction  contracts  received  in   1994   and
published   industry  data,  Turner   Construction
believes  that  it is one of the largest  building
contractors  operating  principally   within   the
United States.

      A  portion  of  the  Company's  construction
activity   is   performed   under    payment   and
performance   bonds   obtained   through   bonding
capacity  from  its sureties.  Projects  requiring
surety bonds are usually either publicly funded or
private projects, which often require FHA  -  type
mortgage  insurance.  While the Company's sureties
limit  the  amount of new payment and  performance
bonds  available, this limitation did not restrict
the  Company's ability to secure new work.   There
could be certain circumstances, however, when this
limitation could influence the Company's selection
of prospective projects to pursue.

       At   December  31,  1994,  the  anticipated
earnings associated with backlog from work  to  be
completed    under   construction,    construction
management  and construction consulting  contracts
and  under awards believed to be firm but not  yet
confirmed  by  signed formal contracts  was  $92.6
million.  The anticipated earnings from work to be
completed on  contracts and awards at December 31,
1993  was $91.8 million. Approximately 44% of  the
December   31,   1994   earnings   backlog    from
construction contracts relates to work expected to
be  performed during 1996 and beyond.  The backlog
is important to long-range planning and continuity
of   work  for  the  company's  permanent   staff.
However,  anticipated earnings  from  construction
contracts  cannot and should not be  used  as  the
basis  of  predictions with respect to future  
operating results.
     The anticipated value of work to be completed
under  construction, construction  management  and
construction consulting contracts and under awards
believed  to  be  firm but not  yet  confirmed  by
signed  formal  contracts  was  $4.55  billion  at
December 31, 1994.  The anticipated value of  work
to   be  completed  on  contracts  and  awards  at
December    31,    1993   was    $4.66    billion.
Approximately  48%  of  the  December   31,   1994
construction  backlog is expected to be  completed
during 1996 and beyond.

      Value  of  construction completed represents
the  cost  of  work  put in  place  and  materials
fabricated  during the year and  related  earnings
pursuant    to   construction   and   construction
management  contracts,  together  with  fees   and
reimbursed expenses from consulting contracts.  It
is  essentially a measure of construction activity
during  the year rather than "sales" or "revenues"
in  the  sense that those terms are used in  other
industries.

       Because   of  the  varying  proportion   of
construction,    construction    management    and
construction  consulting  work,  the   impact   of
inflation  on the value of construction completed,
changes  in anticipated earnings from construction
contracts  and anticipated value of work completed
will not necessarily be correlative.

      At  December  31, 1994, Turner  Construction
employed  approximately 2,400 staff employees,  of
whom   about   1,200   were  executives,   project
managers,  superintendents, engineers,  purchasing
agents,  estimators, senior accountants and  other
supervisory   personnel.   In   addition,   Turner
Construction   employs   foremen   and    building
craftsmen for construction work which has not been
subcontracted  to  specialty contractors.   During
1994,  approximately  2,300 foremen  and  building
craftsmen were employed at various times.

Real Estate.

     The  Company's subsidiaries involved in  real
estate operations are Rickenbacker Holdings,  Inc.
("RHI"),  and  Turner Development Corporation  and
subsidiaries  ("TDC").  The Company  also has
certain other real estate holdings, either directly
or  through  joint  venture interests,  which  are
currently  being marketed.  These holdings  relate
to  residential condominium developments in Boston
and Puerto Rico.

     From 1980 to 1987, TDC engaged in real estate
development  in the United States, principally  in
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan and Virginia.
TDC  developed  and marketed office buildings  and
other   commercial  and  residential   properties,
principally in metropolitan suburban areas.

      TDC essentially discontinued new development
activity  in 1987.  It is attempting to sell  land
parcels previously held for development as well as
certain developed projects.  At December 31, 1994,
TDC owned properties in seven states.

      TDC's  development  projects  were  financed
principally  by  construction and mortgage  loans.
TDC   is   attempting   to  market   projects   to
institutional  and other investors  in  commercial
real   estate.   In  connection  with   sales   of
projects, TDC may be required to guarantee  levels
of occupancy and rentals for limited periods.

      Turner Medical Building Services ("TMBS") is
engaged  in  project  consulting  and  development
services  for  ancillary medical and other  health
care   facilities.   Its  principal  clients   are
hospitals,   physician  group  practice   clinics,
nursing   home  and  life  care  sponsors.    TMBS
provides    management   of   architectural    and
construction  services.   TMBS  subcontracts   the
design and construction of its projects.
      At  December 31, 1994, TDC (including Turner
Medical  Building Services) had  3  employees,  of
whom 2 were management, and marketing personnel.

     RHI owns and leases an air cargo distribution
facility located at the Rickenbacker Air Industrial 
Park in Columbus, Ohio. In 1994, the Company  sold  its
master lease and development rights to  the  1600
acre   air   industrial  park  adjacent   to   the
distribution facility.  In addition,  the  Company
has  renegotiated a lease with the existing lessee
extending the maturity date from 1996 to 2010.

Item 2.         Properties.

      The  Company's executive offices and offices
of  subsidiary  companies are  located  in  leased
facilities in commercial office buildings,  except
for Universal Construction Co., Inc., which owns a
small  office  building in which its  offices  are
located.  The Company's corporate headquarters and
New  York branch office occupy 100,000 square feet
of space which is leased until 2005.  Rental expense
for this space during 1994 was $2.14 million.
Each  construction  project  has  temporary  field
offices.

      Turner Construction operates three equipment
and  storage yards, located in Newark, New Jersey,
Cincinnati, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri  for  the
storage  and repair of its construction tools  and
equipment.   Turner  Construction  owns  the  Ohio
storage  and  repair  yards  and  leases  the  New
Jersey and Missouri  facilities.    Universal
Construction  Co., Inc., owns a  yard,  while  The
Lathrop  Company,  Inc.,  leases  yards  for   the
storage and repair of construction equipment.

     Turner Construction leases major construction
equipment  such  as hoists, cranes  and  personnel
lifts   from  equipment  suppliers  for   use   on
particular projects and generally owns only  small
tools and other miscellaneous equipment; Universal
Construction  Co., Inc., and The Lathrop  Company,
Inc. each own construction equipment, earth-moving
equipment and small tools.

      TDC  holds  as an investment a  wholly-owned
apartment   complex   which  it   had   previously
developed,   located  in  Orlando,  Florida   (200
units).  This property is encumbered by a mortgage
note payable.

      RHI  owns  certain buildings and  air  cargo
handling equipment at the Rickenbacker Air Industrial
Air Park in Columbus, Ohio, which collateralize related
revenue bonds.

Item 3.         Legal Proceedings.

      Since  1990, the Company and a joint venture
including Prudential Insurance Company of America,
have  been engaged in a litigation in the  Circuit
Court  of  Cook  County,  Illinois  in  which  the
Company  is seeking an unpaid portion of the  cost
of  constructing the Prudential Plaza 2  Tower  in
Chicago  and  Prudential is  seeking  damages  for
alleged construction delays.  The Company believes
it  fully performed its obligations with regard to
the  Prudential Tower.  If it were determined that
there were impermissible construction delays,  the
Company   might  have  resulting  claims   against
others.
     The Company is a defendant in various litigations
incident to its business. In some instances the amounts
sought are very substantial, including some which are
proceeding to trial involving substantial claims and
counterclaims, and certain parties are withholding
significant amounts included in construction receivables
pending the outcome of the litigation.  Although the
outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty, in the opinion of management based on the
facts known at this time, the resolution of such
litigation is not anticipated to have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations
of the Company.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

Results of Operations 1994 vs. 1993
The Company reported net income of $3.7 million or
$0.35  per common share compared to a net loss  of
$6.2  million  in 1993 or $1.55 per common  share.
The  most significant factors contributing to this
change    were   improvements   in   real   estate
operations,  reductions in operating  and  general
and administrative expenses and the recognition of
income tax benefits resulting from both operations
and  excess  tax  reserves.  In  addition,  1993's
results  included pretax charges of  $8.5  million
for restructuring costs and $6.0 million for real  estate
valuation adjustments.  Results for 1994 include a
pretax restructuring credit of $1.1 million  which
represents excess restructuring reserves.

Gross  earnings declined 8 percent  from  1993  to
$54.6   million  primarily  due   to   losses   on
construction  projects in the  Caribbean  of  $7.7
million and a decline in the value of construction
completed.   These reductions were  offset  by  an
improvement in real estate operations.

General  and administrative expenses decreased  10
percent    primarily   due   to    savings    from
restructuring steps taken, as well as  a  leveling
off  of the start-up costs of the Company's "Total
Quality  Management" program.  1994's results  are
more   fully  described  in  the  discussion  that
follows.

Construction:
Earnings  from construction contracts declined  19
percent  from  1993  to $54.9  million.   While  a
portion  of that can be attributed to a 5  percent
decline  in  construction completed, the  majority
was  the  result of the $7.7 million loss incurred
by  the Company's Caribbean operations in the U.S.
Virgin  Islands  and  Puerto Rico.   These  losses
stemmed from overruns on lump sum contracts  begun
in  prior  years  and substantially  completed  in
1994.

In  recent years construction management contracts
have figured more significantly in the mix of  the
Company's  value  of construction  completed.   In
1994 construction management projects amounted  to
19  percent of the value of construction completed
compared  to 25 percent in 1993 and 17 percent  in
1992.  Construction management contracts  normally
involve  lower risk than other types of contracts;
they   also  typically  carry  lower  fees.    The
significant proportion of construction  management
contracts  has,  therefore,  contributed  to   the
decline  in  the profitability ratio (construction
earnings   divided   by  value   of   construction
completed).

The  value  of new contracts secured in  1994  was
$2.69  billion, essentially unchanged  from  1993.
Although  the  expected growth  in  the  Company's
traditional markets did take place, the flat sales
numbers   reflect  the  fact  that  the  Company's
penetration  in  fact  declined  in  the  face  of
intense   competition.   Construction   management
contract sales in 1994 declined in favor  of  more
traditional general contracting projects reversing
the trends previously noted.

According to F.W. Dodge, the Company's traditional
non-residential building markets for 1994 grew  by
12  percent over 1993.  Projections are that these
markets  will  continue to grow in 1995,  and  the
Company  should be in a position to take advantage
of that growth.

The Company's sureties limit the annual amount  of
new payment and performance bonds available to the
Company.   This  limitation did not  restrict  the
Company's ability to secure new business in  1994;
however, there could be circumstances in which  it
could   influence  the  Company's   selection   of
prospective projects.

At  the  end  of  1994,  the anticipated  earnings
associated with backlog from work to be  completed
under  contracts and awards believed  to  be  firm
were   $92.6  million_essentially  unchanged  from
1993.    The   backlog  in  terms  of   value   of
construction  to be completed declined  2  percent
from  1993  to  $4.55  billion.   The  decline  in
backlog volume is a result of the cancellation  in
1994 of certain projects that had been secured  in
1993  and  in prior years.  The unchanged earnings
backlog does represent, however, an improvement in
the   profitability  ratio  of  the   construction
backlog  when compared to prior years.  In support
of  this,  fees on contracts secured in 1994  were
slightly   higher,  on  average,  than   fees   on
contracts secured in 1993, which is a continuation
of the trend begun in 1993.

Approximately  44 percent of the earnings  backlog
and  48  percent  of  the  value  of  construction
backlog  relates to work to be performed  in  1996
and  beyond.  Estimated earnings from construction
backlog  cannot and should not be used as a  basis
for predicting future net income.

Real Estate:
Losses  from  real estate operations  amounted  to
$277,000 in 1994 compared to $8.1 million in 1993.
Included  in  the 1993 losses was a  $6.0  million
valuation provision set up as additional  reserves
against asset values in relation to their carrying
value.    During  1994,  the  Company   sold   one
developed  property, two land parcels and  certain
condominium   units,  all  at  their   approximate
carrying value.

The majority of 1994's excess of real estate sales
over  the  cost of sales comes from  the  sale  of
lease   rights   at  the  Company's   Rickenbacker
facility.   Rental  income  and  direct  operating
costs   declined  by  8  percent  and  13  percent,
respectively, due to sales of properties  in  1993
and 1994.

The Company's real estate portfolio is carried  at
estimated  net  realizable value or  at  cost,  as
applicable.  Management believes that  the  timing
of   future   sales  will  depend  upon  achieving
reasonable   values  under  more   stable   market
conditions  which  the Company  believes  will  be
within the next few years for developed properties
and  a more prolonged period for undeveloped  land
parcels.   Until  conditions in  the  real  estate
market  improve to the point that will permit  the
Company  to conduct real estate transactions,  the
Company  will continue to review the asset  values
of  the properties in relation to prospective  net
realizable   value   and   make   adjustments   as
necessary.
During 1994, the Company sold its master lease and
development  rights to the 1,600-acre Rickenbacker
Air   Industrial  Park  for  $1.8   million.    In
addition, the Company as lessor, successfully 
renegotiated  a lease for a 66-acre site,  with  the
existing lessee, extending the maturity date  from
1996  to 2010.  As a result of these transactions,
the operations of the Rickenbacker facility should
not   have  any  future  adverse  effect  on   the
Company's cash flow.

Operating and General and Administrative Expenses:

Restructuring credits and charges - in the  fourth
quarter  of  1993  the Company  recorded  an  $8.5
million   provision   for   restructuring.     The
provision included estimated expenses required  to
implement   the  Company's  plan  to   consolidate
certain   support   functions   and   scale   down
operations   in   shrinking  geographic   markets.
During  1994, the Company charged $6.5 million  of
expenditures  against the reserve  which  included
severance,    benefits   and   other    incentives
associated  with staff reductions,  the  costs  of
the consolidation of offices and facilities resulting
from down-sizing operations in shrinking geographic  markets,  and
the  reorganization of certain support  functions.
Approximately $897,000 of the reserve  remains  in
accrued   liabilities  at   December   31,   1994,
representing  the  balance of the  charges  to  be
funded  in  1995.   The remainder  of  the  unused
reserve of $1.1 million was credited to income  in
1994.

The benefits of the restructuring efforts taken in
1994 are reflected in the 11 percent reduction  in
operating and general and administrative  expenses
to  $53.4  million  from  $59.8  million  in  1993
(exclusive   of  the  restructuring  credits   and
charges).   Management  believes  that  the   full
benefit  of  the  restructuring  efforts  will  be
realized in 1995 and thereafter.

Other Income:
In  1994 the Company recorded other losses of $1.9
million  compared to $870,000 in  1993.   A  major
part   of   the  loss  is  attributable   to   the
absorption,  on a pretax basis, of the  cumulative
foreign  translation adjustment  relating  to  the
planned   liquidation  of  one  of  the  Company's
inactive    foreign   subsidiaries.     Cumulative
translation   adjustments  had   previously   been
charged  directly to stockholders' equity  net  of
tax.

The   Company's   investment  in  Turner   Steiner
International SA resulted in a $1.7  million  loss
to  the Company in 1994 compared to a $3.0 million
loss  in  1993.   This foreign joint  venture  has
secured work in Europe, the Middle East and  Asia-
Pacific  markets and is expected to break-even  in
1995.

1994 losses were partially offset by interest and
dividend income and other foreign investments.

Income Taxes:
The  net  tax  benefit for 1994 amounted  to  $3.2
million  and  is  due primarily  to  the  benefits
derived  from  losses incurred in Puerto  Rico  as
well  as the reversal of excess reserves resulting
from  the  planned  liquidation  of  one  of   the
Company's inactive foreign subsidiaries.

The Company has recorded $18.4 million of deferred
tax  assets having resulted principally  from  net
operating   loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.
Management believes that no valuation allowance is
required  for  these  assets  due  to  the  future
reversals    of    existing   taxable    temporary
differences  primarily related  to  the  Company's
pension plan.

Fourth  Quarter  1994 Compared  to  Third  Quarter
1994:
Results  for  the fourth quarter amounted  to  net
income  of  $698,000  or $0.05  per  common  share
compared  to net income of $896,000 or  $0.08  per
common share recorded in the third quarter.

Fourth  quarter  construction operations  reported
value  of  construction completed of $711  million
and  operating income of $4.8 million compared  to
$659  million  and $3.4 million, respectively,  in
the    third   quarter.    The   improvement    is
attributable   to   the  change  in   construction
activity  and  the increase in productivity  as  a
result of the restructuring program.

Real  estate reported operating losses of  $23,000
in the fourth quarter compared  to $1.5 million in
the   third   quarter.    This   improvement    is
attributable to reduced direct operating costs due
to  the  sale of properties as well as a reduction
in   operating  expenses  as  a  result   of   the
restructuring steps taken in previous quarters.

The  excess restructuring reserve of $1.1  million
was credited to income in the fourth quarter.

Exclusive of the restructuring credit, general and
administrative expenses increased  56  percent  to
$5.3  million  in  the fourth  quarter  from  $3.4
million  in the third quarter.  These changes  are
primarily  attributable to the payment of  certain
incentive benefits which are typically charged  to
the  fourth  quarter  and the growth  in  interest
expense  from  slightly increased  borrowings  and
higher interest rates.

The  Company  recorded a $1.2  million  charge  to
other  income representing the recognition of  the
cumulative  foreign translation  adjustment  which
had   previously   been   charged   directly    to
stockholders'  equity.  In addition,  the  Company
released  tax reserves in the fourth quarter  that
had  been held pending the planned liquidation  of
an inactive foreign subsidiary.

Results of Operations 1993 vs. 1992
The Company reported a net loss of $6.2 million in
1993  or  $1.55 per common share compared  to  net
income of $4.0 million in 1992 or $0.50 per common
share.  This change was primarily attributable  to
provisions  for restructuring charges in  1993  of
$5.6 million and real estate valuation adjustments
in  1993  of  $4.0 million, both net of  tax.   In
addition,  1992's  net  income  included  a   non-
recurring extraordinary gain of $316,000 from  the
extinguishment of debt and a gain of $1.5  million
due  to  the  cumulative effect of  an  accounting
change, both net of tax.

1993 gross earnings declined 9.4 percent from 1992
to  $59.4  million primarily due to a  decline  in
construction earnings and an increase in the  real
estate loss due to the valuation adjustments noted
above.

General  and administrative expenses increased  26
percent primarily due to increased interest  costs
associated  with corporate credit  facilities  and
costs   incurred  in  implementing  the  Company's
"Total Quality Management" program.

Financial Condition:
In total, the Company recorded an increase in cash
and cash equivalents in 1994 of $29.3 million.

Operating  activities provided positive cash  flow
of  $7.8 million primarily as a result of domestic
construction  profitability and  reduced  overhead
expenditures.
Cash  expended  to fund the restructuring  program
amounted  to $6.5 million in 1994 and was provided
by  operations.   The  remaining  balance  of  the
restructuring charge amounts to $897,000 and  will
be expended in early 1995.

Cash  flows from investing activities amounted  to
$17.4  million and were due primarily to sales  of
marketable  securities and the three  real  estate
properties noted earlier.  $5.0 million  was  also
returned to the Company from its investment  in  a
Boston  condominium project from unit sales.   The
remainder  of  this  project  is  expected  to  be
substantially sold in 1995.

Cash  flows from financing activities amounted  to
$4.1  million  which  represents  the  excess   of
borrowings over debt paydowns during the year.  In
the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company sold $39.5
million of Senior Notes in a private placement  to
institutional  investors, including the  Company's
pension  plan which participated to the extent  of
$9.5 million.  Proceeds from the sale were used to
paydown  short-term borrowings under the Company's
revolving  credit facility.  The revolving  credit
facility remains available to the Company.

Management believes the Company's cash flows  from
construction  backlog, its $40  million  revolving
credit   facility  and  amounts   available   from
overnight credit facilities will be sufficient  to
support  the Company's operations.  Debt  maturing
in  1995  will  be paid from funds generated  from
operations  or  will be refinanced  prior  to  its
actual maturity date.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
As   described   in  Note  16  to  the   financial
statements,  certain  financial  instruments  have
fair  values  which  differ  from  their  carrying
amounts.  The difference in the values related to
Notes Payable reflect current favorable  interest
rates and terms, given the underlying value of the
loan collateral.

Inflation:
Inflation  and changing prices during the  current
fiscal  year  have not significantly affected  the
major  markets in which the Company  conducts  its
business.   Domestically,  prices  have   remained
relatively  stable.  In view of the moderate  rate
of inflation, its impact on the Company's business
has not been significant.

Impairment of Loans:
In May of 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board  issued  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  114, "Accounting by Creditors  for
Impairment  of  a  Loan",  which  was  amended  in
October  1994 by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 118.

These statements require that a loan be recognized
as impaired when, based on current information and
events,  it  is probable that a creditor  will  be
unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual   terms   of   the   loan   agreement.
Impairments   would  be  recognized  by   creating
valuation allowances with corresponding charges to
bad debt expense.
The  statements  are effective  for  fiscal  years
beginning after December 15, 1994, and are  to  be
initially  applied  as  of  the  beginning  of  an
enterprise's fiscal year.

The   Company  will  adopt  the  standard  at  the
beginning  of  1995, and management believes  that
the  impact will not be material to the  financial
statements.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To The Turner Corporation:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets  of  The  Turner  Corporation   (a
Delaware  corporation)  and  Subsidiaries  as   of
December  31,  1994  and  1993,  and  the  related
consolidated     statements     of     operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows  for  each  of
the  three years in the period ended December  31,
1994.    These   financial  statements   are   the
responsibility  of the Company's management.   Our
responsibility is to express an opinion  on  these
financial statements based on our audits.

We   conducted  our  audits  in  accordance   with
generally  accepted  auditing  standards.    Those
standards  require that we plan  and  perform  the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the  financial  statements are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on  a
test  basis,  evidence supporting the amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management,
as   well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We  believe  that   our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated
financial  statements, the Company has significant
interests  in  real  estate properties  which  are
carried  at  the  lower of cost or  estimated  net
realizable value.  The financial statements do not
purport  to present the Company's entire portfolio
of  real estate interests at their current  market
value or liquidation value, which may be less than
the  carrying  amounts presented.   The  Company's
management  presently intends to hold  these  real
estate interests until they can be sold for prices
which they believe reflect reasonable values under
more  stable market conditions.  Given the current
market  for land, management expects to  hold  the
undeveloped land parcels for a prolonged period of
time.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial position of The Turner  Corporation
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the results of their operations and their cash
flows  for  each of the three years in the  period
ended  December  31,  1994,  in  conformity   with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As   further   discussed  in  Note   10   to   the
consolidated   financial   statements,   effective
January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits other  than
pensions.   As also discussed in Note  10  to  the
consolidated   financial   statements,   effective
January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of
accounting  for  amortizing  unrecognized  pension
actuarial gains and losses for the defined benefit
pension plan.

THE TURNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share amounts)

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles  of  Consolidation:   The  consolidated
financial statements include the accounts  of  The
Turner  Corporation  and  Subsidiaries  and  their
proportionate   interest  in   the   accounts   of
construction  joint ventures (the  Company).   The
Company also has investments in affiliates and  in
real  estate  joint ventures, which are  accounted
for   under   the  equity  or  cost   method,   as
appropriate.     All   significant    intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated.  Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified in  the
consolidated  financial  statements  in  order  to
provide a presentation consistent with the current
year.

Construction  Operations:  The Company  determines
construction  earnings  under  the  percentage  of
completion method.  Under this method, the Company
recognizes as earnings that portion of  the  total
earnings  anticipated from a  contract  which  the
value of the work completed bears to the estimated
total  value of the work covered by the  contract.
As  the Company's construction contracts generally
extend over more than one year, revisions in costs
and  earnings estimates during the course  of  the
work  are reflected in the year in which the facts
which  require the revision become known.  When  a
loss is forecasted for a contract, the full amount
of  the  anticipated  loss is  recognized  in  the
period in which it is determined that a loss  will
occur.   Claims  are  included  in  earnings  from
construction contracts at an amount based  on  the
related   contract  costs  when   realization   is
probable and the amount can be reliably estimated.

The   Company   continuously   reviews   estimated
earnings  from  construction contracts  and  makes
necessary adjustments based on current evaluations
of  the indicated outcome.  In 1994 and 1993,  the
Company    wrote    down   certain    construction
receivables and claims deemed unrecoverable.

Under certain contracts, owners of buildings  make
payments  directly to suppliers and subcontractors
for  all  or for portions of work covered  by  the
contract.   The  Company considers such  costs  in
determining contract percentage of completion  and
reports  such amounts in the value of construction
completed.

Real  Estate Operations:  Rental income, including
fixed  minimum rents and additional  rents,  under
operating   leases  with  tenants   is   generally
recognized on a contractual basis.

Profit  on  sales of real estate is recognized  in
full  when the profit is determinable, an adequate
down payment has been received, collectability  of
the  sales  price  is reasonably assured  and  the
earnings  process is substantially  complete.   If
the   sales   transaction  does  not  meet   these
criteria,  all  profit  or a  portion  thereof  is
deferred until such criteria are met.

The  real  estate properties which  are  held  for
investment  are  carried at cost less  accumulated
depreciation  and  are assessed  periodically  for
impairment   based  on  the  sum  of  undiscounted
estimated  future  cash  flows.   All  other  real
estate  properties and investments in real  estate
joint ventures are carried at the lower of cost or
estimated net realizable value (Note 4).
Depreciation   and  Amortization:    The   Company
calculates depreciation on property and equipment,
and  on real estate primarily on the straight-line
method.   Estimated useful lives are  as  follows:
buildings  and  improvements, 20-40 years;  office
machines and furniture, 5-10 years; and equipment,
10  years.  Leasehold improvements (the Company as
lessee) to property used in Company operations are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the  lease
terms.    Tenant  improvements  (the  Company   as
lessor) on real estate properties are amortized on
a  straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Maintenance  and  repairs are expensed  currently,
except  that  expenditures  for  betterments  are
capitalized.

In  connection  with  the  renegotiated  lease  of
certain   facilities  at  the   Rickenbacker   Air
Industrial  Park, effective January 1,  1995,  the
Company revised the estimated depreciable life  of
the  facilities  to coincide with  the  new  lease
term.

Cash:    The  Company  considers  all  investments
purchased with maturities of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents.
The    Company's    other   liabilities    include
approximately $36,800 and $26,400 net  payable  to
banks  for  checks  drawn but not  cleared  as  of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Marketable Securities:
On  January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement
of  Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  115
"Accounting  for Certain Investments in  Debt  and
Equity   Securities."   In  accordance  with   the
provisions  of SFAS No. 115, marketable securities
which  consist primarily of equity and bond mutual
funds are classified as available-for-sale and are
reported in the Balance Sheet at fair value as  of
December 31, 1994.  Prior to that date, marketable
securities  were carried at the lower of  cost  or
market at the Balance Sheet date.

Unrealized  gains and losses in 1994 are  reported
as  a  separate component of stockholders' equity.
In  prior  periods,  net  unrealized  losses  were
charged to expense.  The effect of the adoption of
the  Standard  was not material to  the  financial
statements.

Loans Receivable:  Effective January 1, 1995,  the
Company  will  adopt SFAS No. 114  "Accounting  by
Creditors  for  Impairment of a  Loan"  which  was
amended by SFAS No. 118.  These statements require
that  a loan be recognized as impaired when, based
on  current information and events, it is probable
that  a  creditor will be unable  to  collect  all
amounts due according to the contractual terms  of
the   loan   agreement.   Impairments   would   be
recognized  by creating valuation allowances  with
corresponding   charges  to  bad   debt   expense.
Management  believes the impact of  the  standards
upon   adoption  will  not  be  material  to   the
financial statements.

Income  Taxes:  Prior to January 1, 1993, deferred
income  tax expenses or benefits were recorded  to
reflect the tax consequences of timing differences
between  the recording of income and expenses  for
financial  reporting purposes and for purposes  of
filing  income  tax  returns in  effect  when  the
difference arose.

Effective  January  1, 1993, the  Company  adopted
SFAS  No.  109,  "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes."
Under SFAS No. 109, deferred assets or liabilities
are  computed based on the difference between  the
financial statement and income tax bases of assets
and  liabilities  using the enacted  marginal  tax
rate.   Deferred income tax expenses  or  benefits
are based on the changes in the asset or liability
from  period  to  period.   The  adoption  of  the
standard   was  not  material  to  the   financial
statements.

The  Company  does  not provide for  U.S.  Federal
income  taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries  since it is the Company's  intention
to permanently reinvest those earnings outside the
United States.

Foreign   Currency   Translation:    Assets    and
liabilities   of  operations  that  represent   an
investment  in  a foreign country  are  translated
into  U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect  at
year-end,   while   revenues  and   expenses   are
translated  at  average exchange rates  prevailing
during the year.  The resulting translation  gains
and losses are accumulated as a separate component
of   stockholders'   equity.    Foreign   exchange
transaction  gains  and  losses  are  included  in
results of operations during the periods in  which
they arise.

Earnings  Per Common Share:  Primary earnings  per
common share is based on net income less preferred
stock  dividends (net of tax benefits relating  to
Series  B preferred stock) divided by the weighted
average  number  of  common and common  equivalent
shares  outstanding.  Fully diluted  earnings  per
common  share is further adjusted to  reflect  the
assumed conversion of convertible preferred  stock
and the convertible debenture, and the elimination
of  the  preferred  stock dividends  and  interest
expense  on  the  convertible  debenture,  net  of
applicable  income taxes, if such conversions  are
dilutive.

2.  Restructuring Charges

During 1993, plans were developed to significantly
reduce  the Company's future operating  costs  and
expenses   and  to  improve  productivity.    This
restructuring  program  principally   involved   a
reduction  in  the  number  of  staff,  plus   the
consolidation  of offices and facilities  and  the
reorganization of support functions.  The  results
of  operations for 1993 included $8,500 of  pretax
charges ($5,600 net of tax benefits, or $1.08  per
share)  related  to  this  program.   The  charges
included  provisions for severance pay,  incentive
programs relating to employee terminations,  costs
related to the consolidation of offices and  other
reorganization    costs.    This    program    was
implemented   in   1994  and   was   substantially
completed  by  the end of the year.  During  1994,
$6,458 was charged to the reserve and $897 remains
in  accrued liabilities at December 31, 1994.  The
balance  of  the  unused  reserve  of  $1,145  was
credited to income in the fourth quarter of 1994.

3.  Construction Receivables

Due on contracts included $116,856 of retainage at
December   31,   1994.   It   is   expected   that
approximately  86%  of  such  retainage  will   be
collected  by December 31, 1995.  At December  31,
1993,   retainage   was   $106,665.   Construction
receivables  include estimated  net  claims.   The
settlement  of  the claims depends  on  individual
circumstances,  accordingly,  the  timing  of  the
collection  will  vary and may extend  beyond  one
year.  Those claims, primarily due to owner-caused
delays,   incomplete  specifications  or   similar
reasons,   amounted  to  $8,600  and  $10,800   at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

4.  Real Estate

The  Company  owns  a portfolio  of  real  estate,
either   directly   or   through   joint   venture
interests,   that   includes   commercial   office
properties,       mixed-use      warehouse/service
properties,  residential  properties,  undeveloped
land, and certain buildings and hangars located at
an   air  industrial  park.   The  properties  are
located   throughout   the  United   States,   but
primarily   in  the  Southeast  and  Great   Lakes
regions.  Accumulated depreciation at December 31,
1994   and   1993   was   $34,639   and   $32,037,
respectively.


Given  the current real estate market, the Company
has  determined that its interests  in  commercial
office,   mixed-use  and  residential  condominium
properties, and undeveloped land parcels  will  be
available  for  sale when they  can  be  sold  for
prices  which  the  Company believes  reflect  the
reasonable  value  of  the properties  under  more
stable  market conditions.  Management expects  to
dispose  of  its  interests in commercial  office,
mixed-use  and residential condominium  properties
for  those  prices generally within the  next  few
years.   Based  on  management's intended  holding
period,   the  Company's  interests   in   certain
developed   properties  are   carried   at   their
estimated  fair  value.  Given the current  market
for    undeveloped   land   parcels,    management
anticipates a prolonged period before land  values
recover.  Due to the relatively low holding  costs
of  the  Company's undeveloped land  parcels,  the
Company intends to and has the ability to hold the
properties for a prolonged period of time in order
to    achieve   more   reasonable   prices    upon
disposition.    The  carrying   amounts   of   the
Company's  interests in these developed properties
were  $45,934 and $57,692, and in the  undeveloped
land  parcels were $30,458 and $31,076 at December
31,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.   These  real
estate interests are carried at the lower of  cost
or   estimated  net  realizable  value.   The  net
realizable values reflect the Company's  estimates
of the net sales proceeds less anticipated capital
expenditures  through the estimated date  of  sale
and disposal costs, which have not been discounted
to net present value.

The Company estimates the net realizable values by
evaluating  and  making assumptions  about  future
events   with  respect  to  the  property,  market
conditions  and  anticipated  investor  rates   of
return.   The  net realizable values reflect  each
disposition   based   on  the  Company's   current
intended  holding  period, and  do  not  represent
liquidation  values.  Judgments  regarding  future
events  are  not subject to precise quantification
or  verification and may change from time to  time
as  economic and market factors, and the Company's
evaluation of them, change and the effects of such
changes may be significant.

The  Company  actively monitors market  conditions
and   reviews,  on  a  quarterly  basis,  the  net
realizable values of its real estate interests and
reduces  carrying  amounts when  required.   On  a
periodic  basis,  generally not exceeding  two  to
three   years,   the   Company   has   independent
appraisals  performed for significant real  estate
interests  for the purpose of assisting management
in   determining   their  fair   value   and   the
appropriate timing of disposition.  In  connection
with  the Company's review of the carrying amounts
of  its  real estate interests, additional  write-
downs and reserves of $6,018 were recorded for the
year ended December 31, 1993.

5.  Property and Equipment

Other                   7,034     7,188
Total               $ 106,879 $ 102,365

Senior  Notes:  On December 21, 1994, the  Company
sold   $39,500  of  Senior  Notes  in  a   private
placement  to  institutional investors,  including
the Company's pension plan (Note 10).  Proceeds of
the   Notes   were  used  to  paydown   short-term
borrowings  under  the revolving credit  facility.
The  Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 11.74%
and  mature in even principal amounts on the third
through  seventh anniversary dates of  the  Notes.
The   Note  Purchase  Agreement  contains  various
covenants,  the most restrictive  of  which  is  a
fixed-charge coverage requirement.

Land   and  Building  Mortgages:   Variable   rate
mortgages  bear interest at rates  of  LIBOR  plus
2.25%  or  prime plus 0.5% and mature  in  varying
installments  through 1999.  The weighted  average
interest  rate for 1994 and 1993 was approximately
7.47% and 6.64%, respectively.  In connection with
a  variable  rate building mortgage, in  1994, the
Company   entered  into  an  interest  rate   swap
agreement with a bank for a notional amount  equal
to the underlying mortgage ($9,562 at December 31,
1994).   The swap agreement provides for  a  fixed
interest  rate of 6.96% through January 27,  1998.
Fixed rate mortgages of $5,163 bear interest at 7%
or  9.375%  and  are  due in varying  installments
through 2001.

Revenue  Bonds:  Adjustable rate revenue refunding
bonds  collateralized  by properties  at  the  air
industrial  park  mature in  varying  installments
through 2010.  The bonds bear interest at a weekly
variable rate.  The weighted average interest rate
for  1994  and  1993 was approximately  2.89%  and
2.46%, respectively.  The bonds are supported by a
letter of credit for which the Company pays  1.50%
per  annum.  The Company entered into an  interest
rate  swap  agreement with a bank  for  a  $15,000
notional  amount  providing for a  fixed  interest
rate of 4.13% through December 15, 1996.

Multi-family facility revenue bonds collateralized
by  a  residential property were retired  in  1993
upon  disposition of the property.  The bonds bore
interest  at a weekly variable rate.  The weighted
average  interest rate for 1993 was  approximately
3.32%.

Extinguishment  of  Debt:  In December  1992,  the
Company restructured certain debt relating to  the
air  industrial park.  The previously  outstanding
revenue bonds, which carried a fixed interest rate
of  8.75% were redeemed at 102% of par value.   In
addition,  $2,500  of  other  debt  was  forgiven.
Proceeds   for   the  redemption  were   primarily
provided  by  a series of adjustable rate  revenue
refunding  bonds  issued in  November  1992.   The
transaction  resulted in a net extraordinary  gain
of $316.
Employee  Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):  This  loan
was  used  to fund the Company's loan to the  ESOP
and  is  payable  in varying installments  through
1999.  Interest is payable quarterly at a variable
rate  equal  to  83%  of  the  prime  rate  or   a
percentage of LIBOR, at the Company's option.  The
loan  is  collateralized  by  first  mortgages  on
certain  real  estate properties  and  letters  of
credit.     The   loan   allows   for   collateral
substitution   and   upon  disposition   of   such
properties  may require additional  collateral  to
maintain    loan-to-value   relationships.     The
weighted  average interest rate for 1994 and  1993
was  approximately 4.56% and 3.44%,  respectively.
The  loan  agreement  contains various  covenants,
including  the maintenance of a minimum amount  of
stockholders' equity and debt coverage ratio.   At
December   31,  1994,  the  minimum  stockholders'
equity  required  was  $54,000  and  increases  by
$4,000 annually to $74,000 in 1999.

Revolving  Credit Facility:  The  Company  has  an
unsecured   $40,000  revolving   credit   facility
maturing in 1996, the proceeds of which are  being
used  for general corporate purposes.  The current
facility  permits  the Company to  choose  between
various   interest  rate  options.   The  weighted
average  interest  rate  for  1994  and  1993  was
approximately 6.84% and 5.97%, respectively.   The
Company pays a commitment fee at an annual rate of
0.5% on  the unused portion of the facility.   The
facility  contains  various  covenants,  the  most
restrictive  of  which is a fixed-charge  coverage
requirement.

Convertible Debenture:  In July 1992, the  Company
issued  a $6,000 8.5% convertible debenture  which
matures  in 1997.  The Company may not prepay  the
principal balance prior to its maturity.   At  the
option of the holder, the debenture is convertible
into  6,000  shares of Series D  8.5%  convertible
preferred  stock of the Company.  The holder  must
convert  the full debenture principal  balance  at
the  time  of conversion.  The Series D  stock  is
ultimately convertible into 600,000 shares of  the
Company's  common stock and carries terms  similar
to the Series C stock of the Company, except as to
the election of directors (Note 12).

Other:   This amount includes a bank loan for  the
purpose of financing improvements to the Company's
corporate offices which had an outstanding balance
of  $3,000  and $5,000 at December  31,  1994  and
1993,  respectively.  The principal is payable  in
semi-annual installments through 1995.   The  loan
bears  interest at LIBOR plus 0.25%.  The weighted
average interest rate for 1994 and 1993, including
associated    letter   of   credit    fees,    was
approximately 7.74% and 4.85%, respectively.

The  Company maintains overnight credit facilities
with  various banks at varying rates.  The Company
had   available  $10,500  of  which   $2,400   was
outstanding at December 31, 1994.  The  facilities
are subject to periodic renewal from the banks and
certain  facilities carry annual  commitment  fees
ranging  from  0.375% to 0.5%.   During  1994  and
1993,  the  weighted average interest  rates  were
7.59% and 6.31%, respectively.

Aggregate maturities of notes due are as follows:

  1995     1996   1997    1998    1999   Thereafter
$11,9888 $3,288 $22,971 $20,190 $11,926  $36,516

Interest  cost, which approximates  amounts  paid,
for  the  years ended December 31, 1994, 1993  and
1992 was $7,923, $7,427 and $8,124, respectively.

At  December 31, 1994, the carrying value  of  the
real  estate  that was pledged as  collateral  for
notes payable was $68,629.
7.  Income Taxes

The components of the income tax provision (benefit) are as follows:

              1994     1993     1992
Current:

Total      $ (3,160) $(3,564) $ 3,196

The income tax provision (benefit) above consists of the following components:

                           1994      1993     1992
Operations            $  (3,160)  $ (3,564) $ 1,972

                      $  (3,160)  $ (3,564) $ 3,196

In  the Statement of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 1992, the extraordinary gain and  the
cumulative  effect  of the accounting  change  are
shown net of the related tax provision.

Deferred   income  taxes  result  from   temporary
differences   between   the  financial   statement
carrying  amounts and the tax bases of assets  and
liabilities.  The source of these differences  and
tax  effect of each at December 31, 1994 and  1993
and  for the year ended December 31, 1992  are  as
follows:

                       Deferred Income Tax       Provision (Benefit) for
                        Liability (Asset)          Deferred Income Taxes

The  Company has recorded $18,411 of deferred  tax
assets   having  resulted  principally  from   net
operating   loss  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.
Management believes that no valuation allowance is
required  for  these  assets  due  to  the  future
reversals    of    existing   taxable    temporary
differences  primarily related  to  the  Company's
defined benefit pension plan.

A  comparison of the Federal statutory  rate  with
the company's effective tax rate is as follows:

                         1994    1993    1992  

Statutory Federal income  34.0 %  (34.0) % 34.0 %
 tax rate (benefit)             
State and local taxes,    86.6 %    2.2 %   8.3 %
 net of Federal benefit
Effective foreign tax   (489.3) % (3.0) %   0.7 %
 rate                     
Reserve reversals       (355.2) %    --      --   
Other                     79.0 %  (1.7) %   1.4 %
Effective tax rate      (644.9) % (36.5) % 44.4 %
 (benefit)

Income taxes paid (refunded) were $(455), $73  and
$(3,397) for 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively.

For  Federal income tax purposes, the company  has
available  at  December 31, 1994 a  net  operating
loss carryforward of $26,422 which is available to
offset future taxable income and expires from 2006
through  2009,  and  an  alternative  minimum  tax
credit carryforward of $2,451 which can be carried
forward indefinitely.

The unrecognized deferred tax liability related to
cumulative   undistributed  earnings  of   foreign
subsidiaries which were permanently reinvested was
$164 at December 31, 1994.

8. Incentive Compensation Plans

The  Company  sponsors two incentive  compensation
plans.  The Executive Incentive Compensation  Plan
(EICP)  authorizes payments of awards to executive
officers  and  other designated employees  of  the
Company  in the form of cash and common  stock  of
the  Company, which may be deferred in part at the
election  of  the recipient.  The  committee  that
administers  the  plan determines  the  particular
recipients  who  are  to receive  awards  and  the
amounts  of their respective awards.  The  amounts
charged   to  expense  in  1994,  1993  and   1992
aggregated $849, $39, and $1,092, respectively.

The   staff  Incentive  Compensation  Plan   (ICP)
authorizes payment of awards in the form  of  cash
and   common  stock  of  the  Company  to  certain
salaried employees who are not participants in the
Company's  EICP.  All awards are  deferred  for  a
period of five years and are paid out in cash  and
common  stock  over a six-year period  thereafter.
Recipients   must   remain   in   the   continuous
employment  of the Company up to the  distribution
date  in  order to receive the award.  The amounts
charged   to  expense  in  1994,  1993  and   1992
aggregated $134, $116 and $78, respectively.

The  Company plans to liquidate the ICP during the
first  quarter  of 1995.  The liquidation  of  the
plan  will  be  done  through issuance  of  21,379
shares  of  the  Company's  common  stock  to  the
current  participants of the program.  Each  share
will  be  valued at $7.919, which is  the  average
market  price  of the Company's common stock  over
the  last 20 business days of December, 1994.  The
total gross value of the liquidation is $283.
9. Stock Options

The  Company  has  incentive  stock  option  plans
adopted  in  1986 and 1992 which provide  for  the
granting  of  options to officers  and  designated
employees of the Company to purchase shares of the
common  stock of the Company at a price  not  less
than  the market value of the common stock on  the
date  the  option  is granted.   In  addition,  an
incentive plan adopted in 1981 has been terminated
and no new options can be granted under this plan,
although unexercised options remain outstanding.

Options  are exercisable in whole or in part  from
one to ten years from the date of the grant at the
discretion of the stock option committee.  Options
granted  under  each plan may not  exceed  400,000
shares.   No charges to income arise in connection
with the plans.

Option  plan transactions during 1994 and 1993 are summarized  in  the
following table:

                                                     Price Range

10.  Employee Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plan:
The  Company has a noncontributory defined benefit
pension  plan which covers salaried employees  who
meet   minimum   age   and   length   of   service
requirements.

On  March  31,  1991,  the Company  curtailed  its
defined benefit pension plan such that benefits do
not  accrue to plan participants for future  years
of  service  under the benefit formula.   Benefits
earned  prior  to the curtailment  were  based  on
members'  years  of  service  and  averaged  final
salary.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company amended the
defined benefit pension plan to add a cash balance
plan   feature,  to  provide  benefits   to   plan
participants  that were previously provided  under
the  defined contribution retirement  plan.   Past
benefits  earned  by  plan participants  prior  to
curtailment are not changed and benefits earned by
participants for future service are provided under
a  different  benefit formula.   New  participants
will earn benefits only under the revised formula.
The  new benefit formula provides for credits into
notional  individual account balances  based  upon
salary   and   years   of   service.    Management
anticipates  that  the  cash  balance  plan   will
significantly  reduce  the  net  periodic  pension
credit recognized in future years, and result in a
reduction of the prepaid pension asset.
The projected unit credit actuarial method is used
to  determine  the  recognition  of  net  periodic
pension   expense   and   to   determine   funding
requirements.  The Company will continue  to  fund
the plan as required.

The  Company amortizes unrecognized prior  service
costs  on a straight-line basis over a period  not
exceeding the average life expectancy of retirees.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed the
method   for   amortizing   unrecognized   pension
actuarial gains and losses, under which  the  full
amount  of the net actuarial gain or loss  in  the
year   is  being  amortized  over  a  period   not
exceeding   the   average   life   expectancy   of
employees.  The effect of the change in accounting
method  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1992
related  to  the  1992  pension  expense  was   to
increase net income by $641, net of tax, or  $0.12
per  share on primary earnings per share and $0.10
per share on fully diluted earnings per share.

Plan  assets  consist primarily of pooled  equity,
debt  and  short-term investment funds,  a  pooled
real  estate  equity fund, 675,000 shares  of  the
Company's common stock and $9,500 of the Company's
Senior Notes (Note 6).

The  table  below sets forth the funded status  of
the  defined benefit pension plan and the  amounts
recognized  in the Company's financial  statements
at  December 31, 1994 and 1993 and for  the  years
then ended:

The  assumptions used in measuring the actuarial
value of projected benefit obligations and
determining the net periodic pension credit were:

                                          1994       1993

Defined Contribution Pension Plans
From  April  1,  1991 to December  31,  1993,  the
Company    sponsored   a   defined    contribution
retirement  plan covering salaried  employees  who
met    minimum   age   and   length   of   service
requirements.    Contributions   were   based   on
salaries and length of service.  The Company  also
sponsors  a  Section 401(k) tax  deferred  savings
plan  which  covers  salaried employees  who  meet
minimum  age  and length of service  requirements.
Matching   contributions  are  based  on  employee
contributions and are limited to one-half  of  the
first   3%   of   the   employee's   compensation.
Effective    January   1,   1994,   the    defined
contribution retirement plan was merged  into  the
Section  401(k)  tax deferred  savings  plan.   No
additional  contributions  will  be  made  to  the
defined  contribution retirement  plan.   Benefits
earned  under  the  Section  401(k)  tax  deferred
savings  plan  remain  unchanged.   The  aggregate
amount  charged  to expense for  these  plans  was
$1,653 and $6,933 in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Postretirement Benefit Plan
Employees  retiring from the Company and  eligible
for an immediate benefit from the retirement plans
(generally  age 55 with 15 years of  service)  are
eligible   to   continue  their  current   medical
insurance  coverage into retirement.  The  medical
benefits   continue   to   be   subject   to   the
deductibles,   copayment  provisions   and   other
limitations.   Retirees pay for a portion  of  the
total cost of their medical insurance and starting
with  1993  retirements, the portion of the  total
cost  will be dependent on the individual's  total
Company service at retirement.  The medical  plans
of  the  Company  are  funded on  a  pay-as-you-go
basis.

Effective  January  1, 1993, the  Company  adopted
SFAS   No.   106   "Employers'   Accounting    for
Postretirement  Benefits  Other  Than   Pensions,"
which   mandates  the  accrual  of  postretirement
health  benefits during the years  that  employees
render service.
The  following table sets forth the funded  status
of  the  plan  and the amounts recognized  in  the
Company's  financial statements  at  December  31,
1994 and 1993 and for the years then ended:
                                                   1994    1993

   Accrued postretirement benefit obligation   $  3,536   $ 1,757


Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes
the following components:
   Service cost                               $    336    $   286

   Increase in accumulated postretirement
   benefit obligation                         $ 1,186     $ 1,619


The  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was  computed  using an assumed  weighted  average
discount  rate of 8.5% in 1994 and 7.5%  in  1993.
The  healthcare cost trend rate was assumed to  be
12%  in 1994 decreasing by 1% a year to 6% in 2000
and 5.5% in 2001 and beyond.

Effective  January  1, 1994, the  Company  adopted
SFAS   No.   112,   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits."  This statement mandates
the   accrual   of  all  types  of  postemployment
benefits provided to former or inactive employees,
their  beneficiaries and covered dependents  after
employment  but before retirement. The  effect  of
the  adoption of the standard was not material  to
the financial statements.

11.  Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The   Company  has  a  leveraged  Employee   Stock
Ownership  Plan (ESOP) for salaried employees  who
meet   minimum   age   and   length   of   service
requirements.   To  fund  the  ESOP,  the  Company
originally  borrowed $18,092.   Proceeds  of  this
borrowing were loaned to the ESOP, which purchased
850,000  shares of Series B convertible  preferred
stock.

Eligible  employees  are allocated  the  Series  B
stock  over  the term of the ten-year  ESOP  loan.
The  allocated  shares vest after  five  years  of
service.

The  Series  B stock is callable, in whole  or  in
part,  at  the option of the Company at  any  time
after July 1, 1994, at a price per share expressed
as  a percentage of the issue price of $21.29.  At
the Company's option, the call may be satisfied by
common shares, cash or a combination thereof.  The
call  price is 112% in 1995 and decreases to  100%
in  1999  and  for years thereafter.  The  trustee
may,  at any time, convert each share of Series  B
stock into one share of common stock.

Prior   to  the  retirement  of  the  ESOP   debt,
employees  can only redeem their vested  preferred
shares upon death or age 70 1/2.  Once the debt is
retired,  shares  can be redeemed  at  retirement,
termination  or  death.  The redemption  value  is
established  at  the  end  of  each  year  by   an
independent appraiser.  The latest appraised value
dated  March 7, 1995 was $17 per preferred  share.
At the Company's option, redemption by an employee
may  be  satisfied  by common shares,  cash  or  a
combination thereof.

The   preferred  stockholders  are   entitled   to
identical  voting rights as the holders of  common
shares.

The  loan to the ESOP is on the same terms as  the
Company's bank loan.  The ESOP will repay the loan
(plus  interest) with proceeds from the  quarterly
dividends   paid  on  the  Series  B   stock   and
contributions from the Company.  All contributions
to  the ESOP in excess of dividends are treated as
compensation expense.

Compensation expense and interest income  for  the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 were:

                                
                       1994 1993  1992
Compensation expense   $412 $340  $215
Interest income        $546 $509  $627
                                

The  interest income earned by the Company on  the
ESOP loan offsets the interest expense incurred on
the  original  borrowing, with no  impact  on  the
results of operations.

12.  Stockholders' Equity

On  July  20, 1992, the Company sold Karl  Steiner
Holding AG (Steiner) 9,000 shares of Series C  8.5%
convertible  preferred  stock  and  6,000 shares
of Series D 8.5% convertible preferred stock for a
total of $15,000.  On July 22, 1992, the Series D
stock was exchanged for an 8.5% convertible debenture
due in 1997 in the principal amount of $6,000 (Note 6).

The  Series C stock is convertible into  1,000,000
shares  of  common stock or can be  exchanged  for
9,000  shares of Series E 8.5% convertible preferred
stock (which is substantially identical to the Series
C stock, except as to transferability  and election of directors). 
The debenture  is  convertible into  6,000  shares  of
Series  D stock, which is convertible into 600,000
shares  of common stock.  The Series C stock  has,
and  the Series D and Series E stock will  have  a
liquidation preference of $1,000 per share  and  a
cumulative  dividend preference of $85  per  share
per  year.   At their option, the holders  of  the
Series  C,  Series D and Series E stock will  have
the  right to convert either the full amount or  a
partial percentage into common stock.
While  the  Series C stockholders  own  securities
constituting (after conversion)  more
than  10  percent  of  the  Company's  outstanding
common stock, on a fully diluted basis, the Series
C  stockholders  have the right  to  elect,  as  a
class,  between one and three directors, depending
on  the percentage of the outstanding stock owned.
Holders of Series D and Series E stock, and Series
C stock (except when they are entitled to elect at
least  one  director as a class), vote on  an  as-
converted basis as though they held common  stock.
Holders  of Series C or Series D stock  also  have
the  right  to elect a director if the Company  is
six   quarters  or  more  in  arrears  in   paying
dividends.

In  connection with the purchase of the  Company's
securities  by  Steiner, the Company  executed  an
agreement  providing the Company and Steiner  with
certain  rights,  obligations  and  options  which
terminate on June 30, 2002, unless extended.

Under  this  agreement, Steiner has the  right  of
first  refusal  in some instances with  regard  to
sales by the Company of more than five percent  of
its  stock.   In  addition, if the Company  issues
additional  stock or convertible  or  exchangeable
securities, Steiner will have the option  in  some
instances  to purchase similar securities  to  the
extent   necessary  to  maintain  its   percentage
ownership.

If the Company issues, in a transaction or related
series   of   transactions,   common   stock    or
convertible or exchangeable securities totaling at
least  15% of  the Company's  outstanding
common stock, on a fully diluted basis, the Series
C  stock will be redeemable during a 30-day period
at  its  liquidation preference  plus  accrued  or
accumulated dividends, unless the holders of  two-
thirds   of   the  Series  C  stock  approve   the
transaction.

The  Company  has  a right of first  refusal  with
regard  to  sales  or transfers of  the  Company's
securities owned by Steiner constituting more than
five  percent of the Company's outstanding  common
stock, on a fully diluted basis.  In addition, the
Company has the option to repurchase the Company's
securities  owned  by Steiner, upon  a  change  in
control in the ownership of Steiner.

If  after  December 31, 1994,  the  price  of  the
Company's common stock is below $7 for at least 20
consecutive  trading days (or if the agreement  is
not  extended),  Steiner may require  the  Company
either  to find a buyer (which may be the Company)
for all of Steiner's holdings (or all its holdings
except  the  debenture or Series D stock),  or  to
sell  Steiner  additional common  stock  equal  to
Steiner's  existing  holdings on  an  as-converted
basis, at a price selected by Steiner which is not
higher than 115% of the market price of the
Company's  common  stock.  The  Company  will  not
decide until it knows the terms on which it is  to
find  a  buyer for Steiner's holdings or  to  sell
Steiner additional common stock, which of the  two
options it would elect.

13.  Commitments and Contingencies

The  Company (as lessee) leases office space under
operating  leases having remaining  non-cancelable
lease  terms in excess of one year. Rental expense
for  the  years ended December 31, 1994, 1993  and
1992  amounted  to  $9,254,  $9,779  and  $10,103,
respectively.  Future minimum rental payments  are
as follows:

 1995    1996   1997   1998   1999  Thereafter
$8,597 $7,740 $6,604 $5,599  $5,079  $15,652

The  Company (as lessor) has operating leases with
tenants  that provide for fixed minimum  rent  and
reimbursement  of  a portion of  operating  costs.
Additional  rents for reimbursements  included  in
rental income amounted to $373, $390, and $447 for
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Tenant  leases on commercial office and  mixed-use
properties  have  terms of up to  ten  years,  and
leases  on  residential properties generally  have
terms  of one year or less.  Minimum future rental
revenue  from non-cancelable leases in  effect  at
December 31, 1994 are as follows:

 1995   1996    1997   1998  1999  Thereafter
$8,199 $5,405 $4,198 $3,147 $2,553  $17,499

The  Company has jointly and severally  guaranteed
completion  of  an  $93,300 construction  contract
which   was   entered  into  by   Turner   Steiner
International SA in which the Company  has  a  50%
interest.  The Company has guaranteed $2,750 of  a
$5,000  letter of credit facility and  $275  of  a
$500  line  of  credit facility of Turner  Steiner
International SA.

In  connection with the sale of certain assets and
liabilities  of  a  construction  subsidiary,  the
Company  agreed to guaranty or otherwise indemnify
their  surety up to $15,000 in obtaining bonds  in
excess of $45,000 through December 31, 1997.

The  Company  owns certain buildings, hangars  and
equipment  and  is  the  ground  lessee   on   the
underlying land located at an air industrial park.
The  Company has leased to a tenant the buildings,
hangars,  equipment and land with  a  term  of  15
years  expiring in 2010. Rental income under  this
lease represented 37%, 33% and 30% of total rental
income for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company is a defendant in various litigations
incident  to its business.  In some instances  the
amounts  sought  are  very substantial,  including
some  which  are  proceeding  to  trial  involving
substantial claims and counterclaims, and  certain
parties   are   withholding  significant   amounts
included   in  construction  receivables   pending
the outcome  of the litigation.  Although the  outcome
of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty,
in  the  opinion of management based on the  facts
known  at  this  time,  the  resolution  of   such
litigation  is not anticipated to have a  material
adverse  effect  on  the  financial  position   or
results of operations of the Company.

16.   Disclosures  about Fair Value  of  Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to
estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amount of
cash  and cash equivalents approximates fair value
due to the short-term maturity of these amounts.

Marketable   Securities:   The   fair   value   of
marketable  securities is based on  quoted  market
prices for such investments.  At December 31, 1994
and 1993, the fair value approximates the carrying
amount.

Construction    Receivables    and    Construction
Payables:   The  carrying amount  of  construction
receivables  and construction payables approximate
fair  value as these amounts generally are due  or
payable within the Company's operating cycle.

Notes Payable:

The  fair value of notes payable secured  by  real
estate   properties   is   estimated   based    on
discounting the future cash flows at the Company's
year-end risk-adjusted incremental borrowing  rate
for   a   similar  debt  instrument,   given   the
underlying value of the loan collateral.

The  fair  value  of unsecured  notes  payable  is
estimated  based on the Company's year-end,  risk-
adjusted   incremental borrowing rate for  similar
liabilities.

At  December 31, 1994 and 1993, the fair value  of
notes    payable   was   $99,064   and    $95,021,
respectively.

Convertible  Debenture:  The  fair  value  of  the
convertible  debenture is estimated based  on  the
greater of the Company's risk-adjusted incremental
borrowing  rate for a similar debt instrument,  or
the  value of the debt assuming conversion at  the
year-end  stock  price, which  would  reflect  the
probability of conversion by the debt holder.   At
December  31,  1994 and 1993, the fair  value  was
$5,700.

ESOP  Loan Receivable:  The fair value of the loan
receivable from the ESOP is estimated based on the
fair value of the Company's borrowing to fund  the
ESOP.   At  December 31, 1994 and 1993,  the  fair
value was $10,714 and $12,255, respectively.

Interest  Rate Swap Agreements:  The Company  uses
unleveraged  interest rate swaps to provide  fixed
interest  rates for selected periods  of  time  on
certain   outstanding  loans   (Note   6).    Cash
settlements  on  the swaps occur monthly  and  are
recorded  as  an  adjustment to interest  expense.
The   fair   value  of  the  interest  rate   swap
agreements  is  estimated based on the  discounted
value of the difference between the fixed payments
on  the  swap  and  the  payments  that  would  be
required  at  current market  fixed  rates  for  a
similar  financial instrument.  The fair value  of
the  interest rate swap asset was $869 at December
31,  1994.   The  fair value of the interest  rate
swap liability was $286 at December 31, 1993.

Responsibilities for Financial Reporting:

The  management  of  The  Turner  Corporation  and
Subsidiaries has the responsibility for  preparing
the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and  for  their  integrity and  objectivity.   The
financial  statements were prepared in  accordance
with   generally  accepted  accounting  principles
applied   on  a  consistent  basis  and  are   not
misstated  due  to material fraud or  error.   The
financial  statements  include  amounts  that  are
based   on   management's   best   estimates   and
judgments.   Management also  prepared  the  other
information   in   the  annual   report   and   is
responsible for its accuracy and consistency  with
the financial statements.

The  fair  presentation of the Company's financial
position, results of operations and cash flows are
reported on by the independent public accountants,
Arthur  Andersen  LLP (see Report  of  Independent
Public Accountants) for each of the three years in
the  period ended December 31, 1994.  Their report
emphasizes   that  the  Company  has   significant
interests in real estate properties, the  carrying
amounts of which are based on management's present
intent  to  hold  these  properties  until  market
conditions  improve  to the  extent  necessary  to
achieve   reasonable  prices   upon   disposition.
Management  has made available to Arthur  Andersen
LLP  all  of  the Company's financial records  and
related   data,   as  well  as  the   minutes   of
stockholders'     and     directors'     meetings.
Furthermore,   management   believes   that    all
representations made to Arthur Andersen LLP during
its audit were valid and appropriate.

To fulfill the responsibility for the reporting of
financial results, management maintains  a  system
of  accounting  and internal controls.  Management
has operational and financial personnel perform
procedures to provide assurance of compliance with
controls  and policies.  In addition,  based  upon
management's  assessments  of  risk,  operational,
financial  and  special reviews are  performed  by
contracted  auditors to monitor the  effectiveness
of  selected controls.  Management seeks to assure
the  quality  of  financial reporting  by  careful
selection   and   training  of   supervisory   and
management  personnel, by organization  structures
that   provide   an   appropriate   division    of
responsibility, and by communication of accounting
and  business  policies and procedures  throughout
the  Company.   Management believes  the  internal
accounting  controls  in  use  provide  reasonable
assurance   that   the   Company's   assets    are
safeguarded,  that transactions  are  executed  in
accordance  with management's authorizations,  and
that  the financial records are reliable  for  the
purpose  of  preparing financial  statements.   In
addition,  the Company has distributed a statement
of its policies for conducting business affairs in
a  lawful and ethical manner and receives  reports
of compliance annually.

The   Board   of  Directors,  through  the   Audit
Committee  of  the  Board,  meets  separately  and
jointly  with management, the contracted  auditors
and  the  independent  public  accountants  on   a
periodic  basis  to  assure itself  that  each  is
carrying out its responsibilities.

to state a material fact necessary, in order to make the statements
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.  The Company knows of no facts
(other than matters of a general economic nature) not disclosed in
the Disclosure Information which individually or in the aggregate,
so far as the Company can now foresee, could have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          2.3  INCORPORATION, GOOD STANDING AND OWNERSHIP OF
SUBSIDIARIES.  Schedule 2.3 is a complete and correct list of
Subsidiaries of the Company, showing, as to each Subsidiary, the
correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its incorporation and the
percentage of shares of each class of securities of such Subsidiary
owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary of the Company.  All
of the outstanding shares of each of the Subsidiaries shown in
Schedule 2.3 as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries 

                                        3<PAGE>
<PAGE>
have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and,
except as set forth in Schedule 2.3, are owned by the Company or
another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien.  All of the
Subsidiaries are consolidated Subsidiaries of the Company.  No
shares of the Company are owned by any of its Subsidiaries.

          Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character
of the properties owned or held under lease by it or nature of the
business transacted by it requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified individually and in the aggregate
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  Each Subsidiary has all
requisite power and authority to own or hold under lease the
property it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the
business it transacts  and, in the case of the Guarantor, to
execute and deliver the Guaranty Agreement and to perform the
provisions thereof.

          2.4  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company has delivered to
you copies of 

               A.   the consolidated balance sheets of the Company
     and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993
     and the related consolidated statements of operations,
     stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries for each of the fiscal years ending on said
     dates, all with reports thereon of Arthur Andersen & Co.,
     independent public accountants; and

               B.   the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
     Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1994 and the
     related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows
     of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal quarter and
     nine-month period then ended.

All such financial statements (including any related schedules and
notes) are complete and correct and present fairly the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates of such consolidated balance sheets and the
consolidated results of their operations for the periods ended on
said dates and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied by the Company and its Subsidiaries throughout
the periods involved (subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments).  Since December 31, 1993, there has been no change in
the assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than changes
(which have not, either individually or in the aggregate, been
materially adverse) reflected in the financial statements referred
to in Subsection B above or in the ordinary course of business.

          2.5  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC.  The
execution, delivery  and performance by the Company of this 

                                        4<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Agreement and the Notes and the execution, delivery and performance
by the Guarantor of the Guaranty Agreement will not:  (A) conflict
with the corporate charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any Subsidiary; (B) result in any
breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation
of, or obligation to create, any Lien in respect of any property of
the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed
of trust, bank loan or credit agreement, or any other agreement or
instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which their respective properties may be bound or affected; or (C)
conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Order of any court, arbitrator or Governmental
Body applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or violate any
provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Body applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.

          As used in this Agreement, the term "GOVERNMENTAL BODY"
includes any federal, state, municipal or other governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign; and the term "ORDER" includes any order, writ,
injunction, decree, judgment, award, penalty, determination,
direction or demand.

          2.6  NO DEFAULTS UNDER EXISTING DEBT.  Schedule 2.6 is a
complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company
and each Subsidiary as of the dates therein stated, showing as to
each item the obligor, the obligee, the aggregate principal amount
outstanding and the final maturity date and a brief description of
any security therefor.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
in default (whether or not waived) in the performance or observance
of any of the terms, covenants or conditions contained in any
instrument evidencing any Debt and no event has occurred and is
continuing which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both, would become such a default and there is no pending request
for any waiver in respect of any contemplated or possible default.

          2.7  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC.  No consent,
approval or authorization of, or declaration, registration or
filing with, any Governmental Body is required for the validity of
the execution and delivery or for the performance of this
Agreement, the Notes or the Guaranty Agreement.

          2.8  LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND
ORDERS.  There are no actions, suits or proceedings (including
counterclaims) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or
any property of the Company or any Subsidiary in any court or
before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental
Body, except actions, suits or proceedings which (A) individually
do not in any manner draw into question the validity of this
Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement or the Notes and (B) in the
aggregate do not involve the reasonable possibility of adverse
decisions which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                        5<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
under any Order of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Body or in
violation of any statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Body, except for possible defaults or violations which would not in
the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

          2.9  TAXES.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed
all tax returns in all jurisdictions in which such returns are
required to have been filed by them and have paid all taxes,
assessments, fees and governmental charges due and payable with
respect to such returns to the extent the same have become due and
payable and before they have become delinquent, other than those
being contested in good faith by appropriate means and with respect
to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has set
aside on its books adequate reserves in conformity with GAAP.  The
federal income tax liabilities of the Company have been determined
by the Internal Revenue Service and paid, or closed by lapse of
time, for all tax years up to and including the tax year ended
December 31, 1990.

          2.10 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; POSSESSION UNDER LEASES.  The
Company and its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to
their respective real properties and good title to their respective
other properties reflected in  the consolidated balance sheet as at
December 31, 1993, described in Section 2.4A, or purported to have
been acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary after said date (other
than properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of
business and real properties disposed of prior to September 30,
1994), subject to no Liens except as described in Schedule 2.6.

          The Company and each Subsidiary have complied with all
material obligations under all leases to which the Company or such
Subsidiary is a party, and all such leases are valid, subsisting
and in full force and effect.  Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under all
such leases under which it is tenant.

          2.11 LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.  The Company and its Subsid-
iaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises, authori-
zations, patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names, or rights
thereto, material to the conduct of their respective businesses,
without known conflict with the rights of others, and there are no
agreements providing for the expiration or termination of any of
the same prior to the final maturity of the Notes, except that
construction licenses and permits must be renewed periodically.

          2.12 COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.  Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred with respect to an ERISA Plan (A) any
"accumulated funding deficiency" or "waived funding deficiency"
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Sections 302 and
303(c) of ERISA which has not been fully satisfied, or (B) any
liability to the PBGC established under ERISA (other than for the
payment of current premiums); nor has the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate had any tax or penalty assessed against it by the 

                                        6<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor for any alleged
violation under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 
The current value (as determined using the actuarial assumptions
used for the most recent valuation of the applicable ERISA Plan
submitted with such ERISA Plan's annual report) of the benefit
liabilities (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) of each
ERISA Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, other than a
Multiemployer Plan, does not exceed the fair market value of the
assets of such ERISA Plan as of the most recently ended plan year
of each such ERISA Plan.  Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred an unsatisfied withdrawal liability
obligation with respect to a Multiemployer Plan which is not
reflected in the most recent audited financial statements referred
to in Section 2.4A, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
would incur such a liability if it were to make a partial or
complete withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, except as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.  The transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to occur on the Closing Date will not involve a
prohibited transaction (as such term is defined in Section
4975(c)(1)(A),(B),(C) or (D) of the Code or Section 406(a) of
ERISA) that could subject the Company or any holder of a Note to
any tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed under said
Section 4975 of the Code or by Section 502(i) of ERISA. 
Immediately following the purchase and sale of the Notes on the
Closing Date by or on behalf of the Retirement Plan, the Notes will
constitute "qualifying employer securities", as defined in Section
407(d)(5) of ERISA, with respect to the Retirement Plan.  The
representations by the Company in the preceding two sentences are
made in part in reliance upon your representation in Section 3.2
and the representations of the other purchasers in Section 3.2 of
the other agreements referred to in Section 2.19.

          2.13 PRIVATE OFFERING.  Neither the Company nor anyone
acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securi-
ties for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same
from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof
with, any Person other than you, the other purchasers listed in
Schedule I and not more than 40 other institutional investors. 
Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or
will take, any action which would subject the issuance or sale of
the Notes to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

          2.14 USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS.  The Company
will use the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to repay
existing Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement.  No
part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be
used, and no part of the proceeds of such existing Indebtedness was
used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or 
carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation G of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 207, as
amended), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in
any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company
in a violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to
involve any broker or dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said

                                        7<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Board (12 CFR 220).  The assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
do not include any such margin stock and the Company does not
presently intend that margin stock will at any time constitute more
than 25% of such assets.  As used in this Section, the terms
"MARGIN STOCK" and "PURPOSE OF BUYING OR CARRYING" shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the aforementioned Regulation G.

          2.15 FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS.  None of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the use of
proceeds of the sale of the Notes) will result in a violation of
any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States
Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended), or
any ruling issued thereunder or any enabling legislation or
Presidential Executive Order in connection therewith.

          2.16 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS. 
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company"
or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company", or a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or a "public utility", within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

          2.17 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.   A.  The operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries comply in all respects with all
Environmental Laws and all other applicable Requirements of Law
concerning environmental health and safety, except where the
failure so to comply individually or in the aggregate would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

          In addition to the foregoing, except as set forth on
Schedule 2.17, and except for matters relating to construction
sites not owned by the Company, a Subsidiary or a Joint Venture
Arrangement (which matters in the aggregate would not have a
Material Adverse Effect):

               neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any
     property or operations currently owned or leased by the
     Company or any Subsidiary, is subject to, and no property or
     operations formerly owned or leased by the Company or any 
     Subsidiary during such period of ownership or lease were 
     subject to, any outstanding Order from or agreement with any 
     court, arbitrator or Governmental Body of competent juris
     diction or subject to any judicial or docketed administrative 
     proceeding respecting (x) any Environmental Law or any other 
     environmental or health or safety Requirement of Law, (y) any 
     action required to clean up, remove, treat or in any other way
     address Contaminants in the indoor environment or (z) any 
     claim under any Environmental Law arising from the release or 
     threatened release of a Contaminant into the environment;

                                        8<PAGE>
<PAGE>
               all necessary authorizations, consents, permissions,
     licenses and agreements under Environmental Laws (collectively
     "ENVIRONMENTAL CONSENTS") required to be obtained by the 
     Company and its Subsidiaries have been lawfully obtained to 
     enable each of such entities to carry on its business 
     effectively in the places and in the manner in which such 
     business is now carried on, and all Environmental Consents are
     valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect;

               the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied at 
     all times with all material conditions attaching to 
     Environmental Consents (whether such conditions are expressly 
     imposed or implied by statute) and the Company is not aware of
     any circumstances which would render it impossible for the 
     Company or any Subsidiary to comply with such conditions in 
     the future;

               neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received 
     any notice,  Order, correspondence or communication in any 
     other form from any Governmental Body in respect of any 
     Environmental Consent revoking, suspending, modifying or 
     varying the same, or threatening to do so, and the Company 
     does not know of any reason for any Environmental Consent to 
     be revoked, suspended, modified or varied;

               neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received 
     any communication in any form from any Governmental Body in 
     respect of any violation of any Environmental Law; and the 
     Company is not aware of any circumstances which would be 
     reasonably expected to give rise to such a communication being
     received, or of any intention on the part of any competent
     authority to deliver any such communication;

               there are no conditions or circumstances associated 
     with any property of the Company or any Subsidiary currently 
     owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary or any of 
     their predecessors or with the current or, to the best of the 
     Company's knowledge, former operations of the Company or any 
     Subsidiary, and there were no such conditions or circumstances
     associated with any property of the Company or any Subsidiary 
     formerly owned or operated by the Company or any Subsidiary or
     with their former operations which were applicable during such
     period of ownership or operation, in all cases including 
     off-site disposal practices, of the Company or any Subsidiary 
     which would reasonably be expected to give rise to liability 
     to any Person in respect of any Environmental Law;

               no site owned or occupied by the Company or any
     Subsidiary has been used for the deposit of waste during the 
     ownership or occupation of the Company or any Subsidiary 
     except for such usage in accordance with Environmental Law or 
     pursuant to all requisite material consents thereunder;

                                        9<PAGE>
<PAGE>
               all Contaminants produced in the course of the
     businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been 
     lawfully disposed of; and

               the Company and its Subsidiaries have at all times 
     supplied to the competent authorities such information as is 
     required by Environmental Laws, and all such information given
     was correct in all material respects at the time such 
     information was supplied.

          2.18 SOLVENCY.  The Company is, and after giving effect
to the issuance of the Notes on the Closing Date will be, a
"solvent institution", as said term is used in Section 1405(c) of
the New York Insurance Law, whose "obligations . . . are not in
default as to principal or interest", as said terms are used in
said Section 1405(c).

          2.19 OTHER AGREEMENTS.  Concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company is entering into Note
Purchase Agreements identical with this Agreement (except as to the
aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased) with the other
purchasers named in Schedule I.  The sales to you and said other
purchasers are to be separate and several sales.

     SECTION 3.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
PURCHASER.  You represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          3.1  PURCHASE OF NOTES.  You are acquiring the Notes
being purchased by you on the Closing Date without a view to the
distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of your
property shall at all times be within your control.

          3.2  SOURCE OF FUNDS.  With respect to each source of
funds to be used by you to purchase the Notes being purchased by
you on the Closing Date (respectively, the "SOURCE"), at least one
of the following statements is accurate as of the Closing Date:

               the Source is an "insurance company general 
     account", as such term is defined in the proposed Prohibited 
     Transaction Class Exemption published on August 22, 1994 at 59
     Federal Register 43,134 et seq., and there is no "plan" with 
     respect to which the aggregate amount of such general 
     account's reserves for the contracts held by or on behalf of 
     such "plan" and all other "plans" maintained by the same 
     employer (and affiliates thereof as defined in Section V(a)(1)
     of such proposed Exemption) or by the same employee 
     organization (in each case determined under Section 807(d) of 
     the Code) exceeds or will exceed 10% of the total of all 
     liabilities of such general account (within the meaning of 
     such proposed Exemption) as of the Closing Date;

               the Source is the Retirement Plan;

                                        10<PAGE>
<PAGE>
               the Source is either an insurance company pooled 
     separate account or a bank collective investment fund, in
     which case (1) the purchase of Notes is exempt in accordance 
     with Prohibited Transaction Exemption ("PTE") 90-1 (issued 
     January 29, 1990) or PTE 91-38 (issued July 12, 1991) with 
     respect to each "plan" whose assets in such separate account 
     or investment fund do not exceed and are not expected to 
     exceed 10% of the total assets of such account or fund as of 
     the Closing Date and (2) on or prior to the Closing Date you 
     shall have identified to the Company in writing pursuant to 
     this Subsection C each "plan" whose assets in such separate 
     account or investment fund exceed or are expected to exceed 
     10% of the total assets of such account or fund as of the 
     Closing Date;

               the Source is one or more "plans", or a separate 
     account or trust fund comprising one or more "plans", each of 
     which has been identified in writing pursuant to this
     Subsection D; or

               the Source is not a "plan".

          As used in this Section, "plan" or "plans" shall have the
meaning set forth in Section 3(3) of ERISA and, for purposes of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2, each reference to a
"plan" or "plans" shall be deemed to include any entity whose
assets are deemed for purposes of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, or such other similar laws relating to plans as may be
applicable, to be assets of a plan.

     SECTION 4.     CONDITIONS OF CLOSING.  Your obligation to

Insurance Law of the State of New York), and you shall have
received such certificates or other evidence as you may reasonably

Notes as hereinafter set forth.

          5.1  PREPAYMENTS.  On December 21, 1997 and on each
December 21 thereafter to and including December 21, 2000, the
Company will prepay $8,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Notes (or, if less, the unpaid balance thereof), each such
prepayment to be made at the principal amount to be prepaid,
together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such
prepayment, without premium and allocated as provided in Section
5.4.  No prepayment of less than all of the outstanding Notes
pursuant to Section 5.2 shall relieve the Company of its
obligations to make prepayments of Notes required by this Section
5.1.

          5.2  PREPAYMENT.  Upon notice given as provided in
Section 5.3, the Company may at any time prepay the Notes as a
whole, or from time to time in part (in a minimum amount of
$5,000,000 and otherwise in integral multiples of $100,000), in
each case at the principal amount to be prepaid, together with
interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for such prepayment,
plus the applicable Make-Whole Premium (if any) for each such Note.

          5.3  NOTICE OF OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT; MAKE-WHOLE COMPUTA-
TION.  The Company shall call Notes for prepayment pursuant to
Section 5.2 by giving written notice thereof to each holder of the
Notes, which notice shall be given not less than 30 nor more than
60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment and shall
specify the principal amount so to be prepaid and the date fixed
for such prepayment and shall also set forth the Company's estimate
(which may be a range based upon then current market information)
of the Make-Whole Premium (if any) with respect to such prepayment
for the Notes being prepaid (and include calculations in reasonable
detail used in determining such Make-Whole Premium together with
the source of market data used in respect of such calculations). 
Notice of prepayment having been so given, the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes as specified in such notice, together with
interest accrued thereon to the date of such prepayment, plus the
Make-Whole Premium, if any, with respect to each such Note, shall
become due and payable on the specified prepayment date.

          Three Business Days prior to the date fixed for
prepayment of Notes pursuant to Section 5.2, the Company will 

                                        13<PAGE>
<PAGE>
furnish to each holder of a Note being so prepaid a certificate
signed by an Executive Officer of the Company setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation and the methodology and
assumptions made in connection therewith and attaching a copy of
the source of the market data by which the Treasury Yield was
determined in connection with such computation.  If for any reason
the Required Holders, by notice to the Company, object to such
calculation of the Make-Whole Premium, the Make-Whole Premium
calculated by such Holders and specified in such notice shall be
final and binding upon the Company and the holders of the Notes
absent manifest error.  If the Required Holders shall give the
notice specified in the preceding sentence, the Company will
forthwith provide a copy of such notice to all other holders of
outstanding Notes.

          5.4  PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS PRO RATA.  Upon any prepayment
of less than all of the outstanding Notes pursuant to Section 5.1
or 5.2, the principal amount so prepaid shall be allocated to all
Notes at the time outstanding ratably in proportion to the
respective unpaid principal amounts thereof.

          5.5  PURCHASE OF NOTES.  The Company will not, and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire
directly or indirectly by purchase or otherwise any of the
outstanding Notes except by way of payment or prepayment in
accordance with the provisions of the Notes and of this Agreement.

                                        17<PAGE>
<PAGE>
the Company is present), in each case upon reasonable notice and at
such reasonable times during normal business hours and as often as
you or such holder may reasonably request.  All expenses incurred
by you or any such other holder in connection with your and such
holder's exercise of rights pursuant to this subsection shall be
borne by you or by such holder, except that the Company agrees to
pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you and such other
holder in connection with such exercise of rights at any time when

auditors or counsel who are subject to confidentiality obligations
in the course of their duties) any information with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary which is furnished pursuant to or
obtained under this Agreement and which is designated by the
Company to you in writing as confidential, provided that you may
disclose any such information (1) as has become generally available
to the public (other than through disclosure by you or your
Affiliate in contravention of this Agreement), (2) as may be
required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony
submitted to any Governmental Body having or claiming to have
jurisdiction over you or to the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or similar organizations or their successors, (3) as

comply with any law, Order, regulation or ruling applicable to you,
(5) to a prospective transferee in connection with any contemplated
transfer of any of the Note by you (provided that such prospective
transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
Subsection), or (6) to the extent you reasonably believe such
disclosure is necessary to correct any public information
attributed to you or the Company or any Subsidiary about the
relationship of you to the Company or any Subsidiary under this
Agreement.  Without limiting your right to disclose information as
provided in clause (3) or (4) of the preceding sentence without
giving notice to the Company, the Company requests that you inform
the Company in connection with any such summons or subpoena or
action (other than routine filings) to comply.

          8.2  TO KEEP BOOKS, RESERVES; CORPORATE EXISTENCE;
PAYMENT OF TAXES;  MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS;

to:

          A.   keep proper books of record and account, and keep 
     appropriate reserves, all in accordance with GAAP;

          B.   subject to Section 8.10, do or cause to be done all 
     things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect
     its corporate existence, material rights (charter and 
     statutory) and franchises, provided that the Company shall not
     be required to preserve any of its rights or franchises, and 
     no Subsidiary shall be required to preserve its corporate 
     existence or any right or franchise of such Subsidiary, if the
     Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation 
     thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business 
     of the Company and the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as 
     a whole and that the loss thereof would not have a Material 
     Adverse Effect;

          C.   pay and discharge or cause to be paid and discharged
     all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies 
     imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or upon any of 
     its property, real, personal or mixed, or upon any part 
     thereof, when due and so long as the same can be paid without 
     interest or penalty, as well as all lawful claims for labor, 
     materials and supplies which, if unpaid, could by law become 
     a Lien upon its property, provided that neither the Company 
     nor any Subsidiary shall be required to pay any such tax, 
     assessment, charge, levy or claim if (1) the amount, 
     applicability or validity thereof shall be contested on a 
     timely basis in good faith by appropriate proceedings (so long
     as the enforcement of any Lien arising out of such nonpayment 
     shall be stayed during any proceedings) and if appropriate 
     reserves, to the extent required by GAAP, shall have been made
     therefor, and (2) the nonpayment of all such taxes, 
     assessments, charges, levies or claims in the aggregate would 
     not have a Material Adverse Effect;

          D.   maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and 
     kept, its material properties in good repair, working order 
     and condition (other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the
     business carried on in connection therewith may be properly 
     and advantageously conducted at all times, provided that 
     nothing in this Subsection shall prevent the Company or any 
     Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation and the 
     maintenance of any such properties if such discontinuance is, 
     in the opinion of the senior management of the Company, in the
     best interest of the Company and the Company and its 
     Subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not have a Material 
     Adverse Effect; 

                                        19<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          E.   obtain, comply in all material respects with, 
     preserve and keep in full force and effect all licenses, 
     permits, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental 
     Bodies individually or in the aggregate material to the 
     conduct of its business and its ownership of properties and 
     comply with all applicable statutes, regulations and Orders 
     of, and all applicable material restrictions imposed by, any 
     Governmental Body, in respect of the conduct of its business 
     and the ownership of its properties (including without 
     limitation applicable Environmental Laws and statutes, 
     regulations and Orders relating to equal employment opportu
     nities and employee benefits), except to the extent any 
     failure so to comply would not either individually or in the 
     aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; and

          F.   insure and keep insured with financially sound and 
     reputable insurers so much of its respective properties, and 
     such insurance shall be against such hazards and risks and in 
     such amounts (and with such deductibles), and maintain surety 
     bonding capacity with financially sound and reputable sureties
     in respect of its construction activities, in each case as is 
     reasonable and prudent in the circumstances and as is in 
     accordance with good business practice for companies in the 
     same or similar businesses, of the same or similar size and in
     the same or similar localities, provided that such insurance 
     may be subject to co-insurance, deductibility or similar 
     clauses which, in effect, result in self-insurance of certain 
     losses if and to the extent that (1) adequate reserves in 
     accordance with GAAP are maintained with respect thereto, and 
     (2) such self-insurance is consistent with good business 
     practices of corporations of established reputation engaged in
     the same or similar businesses and owning or operating similar
     properties.

          8.3  LINES OF BUSINESS.  The Company and itsSubsidiaries

          assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax 
          imposed by Section 4975 of the Code;

               (2)  terminate or withdraw from any ERISA Plan, 
          including a Multiemployer Plan, in a manner, or take any

                                        20<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          ERISA), which could result in any liability of the
          Company or a Subsidiary to a Multiemployer Plan, to the
          PBGC or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042(b) of
          ERISA;

               (3)  incur any liability to the PBGC on account of

          provide security to such ERISA Plan under Section 307 of 
          ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code;

if such actions individually or in the aggregate would have a
Material Adverse Effect;

               (B)  permit to exist any accumulated funding 
          deficiency, within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code
          or Sections 302 and 303(c) of ERISA with respect to any 
          ERISA Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan); or

               (C)  take any action or allow any circumstance to 
          occur which would cause the Notes to cease to be 
          "qualifying employer securities", as defined in Section 
          407(d)(5) of ERISA, with respect to (and while Notes are 
          held by) the Retirement Plan or any successor plan 
          thereto.

permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur, guarantee or
otherwise become or be liable with respect to any Debt except:

                (iv)     subject to Subsection B below in the case
          of Debt of a Subsidiary, other Debt, provided that after 
          giving effect to the incurrence of such Debt (including 
          without limitation each borrowing under the Revolving 
          Credit Agreement), Consolidated Debt will not exceed the 
          applicable percentage of Consolidated Total

Notes or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this
Agreement or in the Notes, or the holder of any Note may proceed to
enforce the payment of all sums due upon such Note or to enforce
any other legal or equitable right of the holder of such Note.

          Without limiting the generality of Section 17.1, the
Company covenants that, if default shall be made in the making of
any payment due under any Note or in the performance or observance
of any agreement contained in this Agreement or the Notes, the
Company will pay to each holder of a Note such further amounts, to
the extent lawful, as shall be sufficient to pay all costs and
expenses of collection or of otherwise enforcing such holder's
rights under this Agreement, the Guaranty Agreement or the other
Notes, including counsel fees.

          10.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.  No remedy herein conferred
upon you or the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of
any other remedy and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative
and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
otherwise.

          10.4 REMEDIES NOT WAIVED.  No course of dealing between
the Company and you or the holder of any Note (other than a waiver
obtained in compliance with Section 13) and no delay or failure in
exercising any rights hereunder or under this Agreement in respect
of such Note shall operate as a waiver of any of your rights or the
rights of any holder of such Note.

     SECTION 11.    REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES. 
The Company will keep at the Company's principal office, or at such
other office or agency in the United States as the Company may from
time to time designate in writing to the holders of the Notes, a
register (the "NOTE REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, but at its expense (other than
transfer taxes, if any), it will provide for the registration and
transfer of Notes.

          Whenever a Note shall be surrendered at the principal
office or at such other office or agency of the Company for
transfer or exchange, within five Business Days thereafter the
Company will execute and deliver in exchange therefor a new Note or
Notes, as may be requested by such holder, in the same aggregate
unpaid principal amount as the unpaid principal amount of the Note
so surrendered.  Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person
as such holder may request.  Each Note presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by
the registered holder of such Note or such holder's attorney duly
authorized in writing.  Any Note issued in exchange for any other
Note or upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid
interest and interest to accrue which were carried by the Note so
exchanged or transferred, and neither gain nor loss of interest
shall result from any such transfer or exchange.  Any transfer tax
relating to such transaction shall be paid by the holder requesting
the exchange and the  Company may refuse to deliver any such new
Note until it shall have received evidence (provided the Company
makes timely request for such evidence) reasonably satisfactory to
it as to the payment of such transfer tax or the absence of any
requirement to pay the same.  In the case of you or any other
institutional investor holder of a Note, a written statement to
such effect by an authorized person (or an opinion to such effect
of your or such holder's in-house counsel) shall be deemed
satisfactory evidence to the Company.

          The Company and any agent of the Company may deem and
treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the owner
of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of the principal
of and premium, if any, and interest on such Note and for all other

                                        41<PAGE>
<PAGE>
purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue and the
Company shall not be affected by notice to the contrary.

          You agree that the Company shall not be required to
register the transfer of any Note to any Person (other than your
nominee) or to any separate account maintained by you unless the
Company receives from the transferee a representation to the
Company (and appropriate information as to any separate accounts or
other matters) to the same or similar effect with respect to the
transferee as is contained in Section 3.2 or other assurances
reasonably satisfactory to the Company that such transfer does not
involve a prohibited transaction (as such term is used in Section
2.12) and that such transfer does not cause the Notes to fail to
constitute qualifying employer securities (as such term is used in
said section).  You shall not be liable for any damages in
connection with any such representations or assurances provided to
the Company by any transferee.

     SECTION 12.    LOST, ETC., NOTES.  Upon receipt by the Company
of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Note, and (in case of loss, theft
or destruction) of indemnity satisfactory to it, and upon surrender
and cancellation of such Note, if mutilated, within five Business
Days thereafter the Company will deliver in lieu of such Note a new
Note in a like unpaid principal amount, dated as of the date to
which interest has been paid thereon or dated the date of the lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been
paid thereon.  In the case of you or any other institutional
investor holder of a Note, your or such holder's unsecured
agreement of indemnity shall be deemed satisfactory to the Company.

     SECTION 13.    AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.  A.  Any provision of
this Agreement or the Notes may, with the consent of the Company,
be amended or waived (either generally or in a particular instance
and either retroactively or prospectively), by one or more
substantially concurrent written instruments signed by the Required
Holders, provided that:

               no such amendment or waiver shall;

               change the rate or time of payment of interest on 
          any of the Notes, change the amount or time of payment or
          prepayment of any of the Notes or affect the premium 
          payable on any prepayment or purchase of a Note, or 
          modify Section 14, without the consent of the holder of 
          each Note so affected;

               modify any of the provisions of this Agreement with 
          respect to the payment or prepayment or purchase of 
          Notes, or change the percentage of the principal amount 
          of the Notes the holders of which are required with 
          respect to any such amendment or to effectuate any such 
          waiver, or to accelerate any Note or Notes, without the 

                                        42<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          consent of the holders of all of the Notes then 
          outstanding, or;

               be effective prior to the Closing Date without your 
          consent; and

               no such waiver shall extend to or affect any 
          obligation not expressly waived or impair any right 
          consequent thereon.

          Any amendment or waiver pursuant to Subsection A above
shall apply equally  to all of the holders of the Notes and shall
be binding upon them, upon each future holder of any such Note and
upon the Company, in each case whether or not a notation thereof
shall have been placed on any Note.

          The Company will not solicit, request or negotiate for or
with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or the Notes unless each holder of a
Note affected thereby (irrespective of the principal amount of
Notes then held by it) shall be informed thereof by the Company and
shall be afforded the opportunity of considering the same and shall
be supplied by the Company with sufficient information to enable it
to make an informed decision with respect thereto.  Executed or
true and correct copies of any amendment or waiver effected
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be delivered by
the Company to each holder of Notes forthwith following the date on
which the same shall have become effective.  Neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates will directly or indirectly pay or cause
to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or
additional interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder of a Note as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by such
holder of any such amendment or waiver unless such remuneration is
concurrently paid ratably to the holders of all of the Notes then
outstanding.
 
          For purposes of determining whether the holders of
outstanding Notes of the requisite percentage of outstanding shares
or unpaid principal amount at any time have taken any action
authorized by this section or otherwise by this Agreement, any
Notes owned by the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate (other
than the Retirement Plan) of the Company shall not be deemed
outstanding.

     SECTION 14.    HOME OFFICE PAYMENT.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement or the Notes, so long as you or
any nominee designated by you shall be the holder of any Note, the
Company shall pay all amounts which become due and payable on such
Note by wire or electronic funds transfer of immediately available
funds to you at your address set forth in Schedule I by 11:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the date any such amounts become due, or at
such other place in the United States and in such other manner as
you may designate by notice to the Company, without presentation or
surrender of such Note.  You agree that prior to the sale, transfer

                                        43<PAGE>
<PAGE>
or other disposition of any Note, you will make notation thereon of
the portion of the principal amount prepaid and the date to which
interest has been paid thereon, or surrender the same in exchange
for a Note or Notes aggregating the same principal amount as the
unpaid principal amount of the Note so surrendered.  The Company
agrees that the provisions of this section shall inure to the
benefit of any other institutional investor holder of a Note (or
nominee thereof) who shall have agreed to comply with the
requirements of this Section and furnished the Company with payment
information in connection herewith.

     SECTION 15.    LIABILITIES OF THE PURCHASER.  Neither this
Agreement nor any disposition of any of the Notes shall be deemed
to create any liability or obligation of you or any other holder of
any of the Notes to enforce any provision hereof for the benefit or
on behalf of any other Person who may be the holder of any of the
Notes.

     SECTION 16.    CERTAIN TAXES.  The Company agrees to pay all
stamp, documentary or similar taxes which may be payable in respect
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or of the execution
and delivery (but not the transfer) of any of the Notes or of any
amendment of, or waiver or consent under or with respect to, this
Agreement or any of the Notes and will save you and all subsequent
holders harmless against any loss or liability resulting from
nonpayment or delay in payment of any such tax.  The obligations of
the Company under this Section shall survive the payment of the
Notes.

     SECTION 17.    MISCELLANEOUS.

          17.1 EXPENSES.  The Company agrees, whether or not the
transactions hereby contemplated shall be consummated, to pay all
reasonable expenses incident to such transactions (including all
document production costs and other expenses, the fees and
disbursements of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, your special counsel,
for their services with relation to such transactions, the expenses
of obtaining a private placement number for the Notes and all
out-of- pocket expenses in connection with the shipping to and from
your office or the office of your nominee of the Notes and upon any
exchange or substitution pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement), and to reimburse you for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses in connection therewith.  The Company also agrees to pay
all reasonable expenses incurred by you (including reasonable
counsel and financial adviser fees) in connection with the
enforcement and collection of the Notes or the enforcement of this
Agreement or the Guaranty Agreement, responding to any subpoena or
other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or by reason of any holder's having acquired any Note (other
than in connection with any investigation relating to your
activities and only indirectly involving the Company or the
issuance of the Notes), including without limitation costs and
expenses incurred in any bankruptcy case, and in connection with 

                                        44<PAGE>
<PAGE>
any amendment or requested amendment of, or waiver or consent or
requested waiver or consent under or with respect to, this
Agreement or any of the Notes or the Guaranty Agreement, whether or
not the same shall become effective.  The obligations of the
Company under this section and Section 10.2 shall survive the
payment of the Notes.

          In furtherance of the foregoing, on the Closing Date the
Company will pay or cause to be paid the fees and disbursements
(including estimated unposted disbursements as of the Closing Date)
of your special counsel which are reflected in the statement of
such special counsel submitted to the Company on or prior to the
Closing Date.  The Company will also pay, promptly upon receipt of
supplemental statements therefor, additional fees, if any, and
disbursements of such special counsel in connection with the
transactions hereby contemplated (including disbursements unposted
as of the Closing Date to the extent such disbursements exceed
estimated disbursements paid as aforesaid).

          17.2 RELIANCE ON AND SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS.  All
agreements, representations and warranties of the Company or any
Subsidiary contained herein and in any certificates or other
instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall (A) be
deemed to have been relied upon by you, notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by you or on your
behalf, and (B) shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the delivery of the Notes to you, and shall continue
in effect so long as any Security is outstanding and thereafter as
provided in Sections 16, 17.1 and 17.6.

its permitted successors and assigns hereunder, you and your
successors and assigns, and, in addition, shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by all holders from time to time of
the Notes, provided that the benefits of Sections 6, 7, 12 (as to
satisfactory indemnity) and 14 shall be limited as provided
therein.

          17.4 COMMUNICATIONS.  Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all notices and other communications provided for

confirmed facsimile transmission (hard copy to be sent by overnight
mail on the date of such transmission) or delivered by hand or sent

extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, exonerate and

free and harmless from and against any and all actions, causes of
action, suits, losses, liabilities and damages, and expenses in
connection therewith, including without limitation reasonable
counsel fees and disbursements (collectively the "INDEMNIFIED
LIABILITIES") incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them as a
result of, or arising out of, or relating to, any transaction

indirectly with proceeds from the sale of any of the Notes or the
execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of this Agreement

arising on account of such Indemnitee's gross negligence or willful
misconduct; and if and to the extent the foregoing undertaking may
be unenforceable for any reason, the Company agrees to make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the
Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. 
The obligations of the Company under this section shall survive
payment of the Notes.

          17.6 GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the Notes shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York.

<TEXT>

<PAGE>


                      THE TURNER CORPORATION

                    DIRECTORS' RETIREMENT PLAN


          This is the Directors' Retirement Plan (the "Plan") of
The Turner Corporation (the "Company"), which was adopted by the
Board of Directors of the Company on December   , 1994.

     1.   Purpose of the Plan.  The purpose of the Plan is to
provide retirement benefits to persons who, while not employed by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, served as Directors of the
Company.  These retirement benefits are given to those persons in
recognition of the services they rendered to the Company and its
shareholders while serving as directors of the Company.

     2.   Participants.  Each person who has served or serves in
the future as a Non-Employee Director will be a participant in the
Plan (a "Participant").  A "Non-Employee Director" is a member of
the Board of Directors of the Company who is not an employee of the
Company or of any entity 50% or more of the equity of which is
owned by the Company.

     3.   Retirement Benefits.  (a)  Each Participant will receive
Retirement Payments during each calendar year in which the
Participant is alive following the later of (i) the year in which
the Participant ceased or ceases to be a Director of the Company,
and (ii) the year in which the Participant had or has his or her<PAGE>
<PAGE>
seventieth birthday, except that if a person ceases to be a
Director of the Company because of physical or mental disability
which the Board of Directors determines makes it impracticable for
the person to continue as a Director of the Company, Retirement
Payments to that person will begin in the calendar year following
the year in which the person ceases to be a Director of the
Company, without regard to whether that is before or after the
person's seventieth birthday.  Retirement Payments to a Participant
in a calendar year will be paid in equal quarterly installments on
the first day of January, April, August and October of the year.

          (b)  The Retirement Payments in a calendar year to a
Participant whose service as a Non-Employee Director (including
service prior to the date of this Plan) totals at least five years
will be equal to the amount paid during that calendar year to
Non-Employee Directors for serving on the Board of Directors
(without including any compensation they receive for serving on
Committees of the Board of Directors).

          (c)  The Retirement Payments in a year to a Participant
whose service as a Non-Employee Director (including service prior
to the date of this Plan) will be (i) the payments the person would
have received if the person had served as a Non-Employee Director
for a total of at least five years, times (ii) a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of full years (with partial years
aggregated) the person served as a Non-Employee Director and the
denominator of which is five.

                                        2<PAGE>
<PAGE>
          (d)  Notwithstanding what is said in subparagraphs (a),
(b) and (c), no Retirement Payments will be made to any Partici-
pants prior to January 1, 1996, and no Participant will have any
right to receive payments after January 1, 1996 with regard to
Retirement Payments the Participant would have received prior to
January 1, 1996 but for the provisions of this subparagraph (c).

     4.   Effects of Change of Control.  If there is a Change in
Control, the following will occur:

          (a)  Each person who is serving as a Non-Employee
Director immediately prior to the Change of Control will be treated
for the purposes of this Plan, including but not limited to for the
purpose of determining whether he or she had served as a
Non-Employee Director for at least five years, as though he or she
would continue to serve as a Non-Employee Director until the Annual
Meeting of Shareholders of the Company following his or her
seventieth birthday.

          (b)  At or before the time the Change of Control occurs
(or, if that is not possible, as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control occurs), the Company will purchase for each
Participant from an insurance company rated by Best's Insurance
Reports as A or better an annuity contract under which that
insurance company will agree make payments to the Participant which
are identical as to amount and date of payment with the payments
the Participant is or would become entitled to receive under the

                                        3<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Plan assuming (i) if the Participant is a Non-Employee Director at
the time of the Change of Control, that person will remain a
Non-Employee Director until, and will cease to be a Non-Employee
Director on, the Participants' seventieth birthday, and (ii) the
fee paid to Non-Employee Directors each calendar year after the
Change of Control occurs will be (i) the annual fee being paid to
Non-Employee Directors immediately before the Change of Control
occurs, increased each year by a percentage equal to the yield on
ten-year United States Treasury bonds on the thirtieth day before
the day on which the Change of Control takes place.  For the
purposes of this Plan, (A) there will be a "Change of Control" if,
and at the time when, (x) securities which entitle the holders to
cast more than 30% of the votes in elections of directors (other
than solely as a result of a failure to pay dividends on preferred
shares) are acquired by any person (as that term is used in
Sections 13(d), including Section 13(d)(3) and Section 14(d),
including Section 14(d)(2), of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
after the date this Plan is adopted, (y) the Board of Directors
determines that a tender offer statement filed by any person (as
defined in clause (x)) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
indicates an intention on the part of that person to acquire
control of the Company, or (z) during any period of 24 consecutive
months, individuals who at the beginning of the period were members
of the Board of Directors of the Company cease to constitute a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors, and (B) the
yield on ten-year United States Treasury bonds on a day will be the
mid-afternoon yield quotation issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of

                                        4<PAGE>
<PAGE>
New York for that day (or, if that day is not a day for which the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York issues quotations, on the next
preceding day for which it issues quotations) with regard to United
States Treasury bonds maturing as early as possible ten years after
that day.

     5.   Interpretations.  Any interpretations by the Board of
Directors of the terms of this Plan will be binding on all
Participants, except that an interpretation by the Board of
Directors made after there has been a Change of Control will be
binding on Participants only if it is determined by a court in a
proceeding in which the affected Participants are parties to be a
reasonable interpretation.

     6.   Governing Law.  This Plan will be governed by, and
construed under, the laws of the State of New York.

     7.   Amendment and Termination.  This Plan may be amended or
terminated at any time by the Board of Directors of the Company. 
However, (i) neither an amendment to, nor termination of, this Plan
may deprive any Participant of any benefits to which the Partici-
pant is or will become entitled under this Plan (without taking
account of the amendment) by reason of service on the Board of
Directors of the Company prior to the date the Plan is amended or
terminated, including, but not limited to, benefits to which the
Participant is or will become entitled because of the operation of
Paragraph 4.
