PART I

Item 1.         Business.

      The Turner Corporation (the "Company") is  a holding  company  that 
is predominantly engaged together with its subsidiaries in general building
construction  and construction management in the United  States  and abroad,
and also has limited real estate operations in the United States.   The
Turner Corporation establishes general policy direction, coordination and
planning, and provides cash  management, internal accounting control  and
other management services for its operating subsidiaries.

    As  the various segments of the United  States non-residential 
construction market  continue  to shift,  the  Company  responds  to  and 
positions itself to take advantage of the stronger market segments.   During
the last several years, the Company's construction  subsidiaries increased
their focus on manufacturing, education, research and development,
healthcare, retail, public, justice and amusement (i.e., hospital, university,
aviation, aquariums, arenas and similar) projects.  Approximately 72% in 
dollar value of the contracts awarded to the construction subsidiaries in 1995
were in these areas.  The remaining 28% of the contracts awarded were in the 
Company's traditional commercial markets.

     During 1993, plans were developed to significantly reduce the Company's
future operating costs and expenses and to improve productivity. This  
restructuring program principally involved a reduction in the number  of 
staff, plus the consolidation of offices and facilities and the
reorganization of support functions.  This  program was implemented and
substantially  completed in 1994,  and  its  final phase was completed in
1995.

    During  the early 1980's, the Company acquired and  developed a number of
real estate properties. In  1987,  the  Company decided to cease  its  new
development  activities.   Since  that  time,  the Company's  real estate
portfolio has been  reduced from  $200  million  at the end  of  1987 to $91
million at the end of 1995.  The remainder of  the real  estate  portfolio,
which  is  owned  either directly or through joint  venture  interests,
includes commercial office properties, a mixed-use warehouse/service property,
residential properties, undeveloped land and certain buildings and hangars
located at an air industrial park.

    During  1995,  the Company sold one  developed property with an adjacent
land parcel and a number of  condominium  units, all at  their  approximate
carrying  value.  While the Company  continues  to seek purchasers for its real
estate properties, it is  unlikely  it  will be able to dispose  of  its
properties in their entirety until there are  more stable market conditions in
the areas in which the Company's properties are located.

    Financial information about the  registrant's operations  in  its
construction and  real  estate segments  appear  in  the  Consolidated 
Financial Statements and in footnote 15 on page 36  in  Part II, Item 8 of
this report.

    At  December 31, 1995, The Turner  Corporation and subsidiaries  employed
approximately  2,600 staff employees, of which 1,500 held  supervisory
positions and 1,100 held non-supervisory positions.

Construction Business

       The Turner Corporation's construction business  is conducted by a number
of construction subsidiaries  (together,  "Turner  Construction"). Turner
Construction is engaged primarily  in  the construction   of   commercial  and 
multi-family residential buildings, manufacturing and  research facilities,
hospitals,  correctional  facilities, stadiums   and  other  entertainment  
facilities, airports  and  other structures.  It  also  has  a division 
which  does  interior  work,   such   as building-out  office  space.  Turner
Construction normally  does not build roads, dams,  or  similar 
infrastructure   elements.   Turner   Construction primarily acts as a general
building contractor or as a construction manager. However, Turner Construction
also sometimes acts as a  consultant to owners and others.

     Although  Turner Construction is a nationwide (and  to  a lesser extent,
worldwide) construction firm,  Turner  Construction  attempts  to  compete
locally  in  major  cities of  the  United  States through  essentially  28
self-contained  regional offices  and  12  partially self-contained  branch
offices.   Its objective is to be a major  builder in each city or region in
which it has an office.

       The Turner Corporation's principal construction  subsidiary  is  Turner
Construction Company.   Universal Construction  Company,  Inc., The  Lathrop 
Company Inc., and Turner Caribe Inc., wholly-owned  subsidiary companies of 
The Turner Corporation  or Turner Construction  Company,  are also  engaged  in
construction activities in the United States  principally in the Southeast,
Midwest and the Caribbean Islands.

       When it acts as a general building contractor, Turner Construction
normally undertakes to construct a project and is paid the entire  price  for
the completed project. Most aspects of the  construction, however, are
performed by subcontractors who are paid by Turner Construction.  The functions
actually performed by Turner Construction  are the planning and scheduling of
a construction project, the procurement  of materials, the marshaling  of the
manpower required for the project, the awarding of subcontracts and the
direction and management  of the construction operation.  During 1995, 1994
and 1993, general building contracting activities represented 83%, 81% and 75%,
respectively, of Turner Construction's value of work completed.

      Turner Construction makes extensive  use  of specialty  contractors
(such as structural steel contractors, electrical contractors and  plumbing
contractors) as subcontractors in the  performance of  its  construction
contracts. The extent to which  work  is performed by workmen  on  its  own
payroll  varies with the location of a  particular project and is largely
dependent on the availability  of experienced subcontractors in a particular
area. Work performed by Turner Construction is generally limited to temporary
facilities, foundation, concrete, masonry and carpentry work.

   In its performance of construction management services, Turner Construction,
for a fee, monitors and  coordinates the progress of the work done by
specialty contractors who are employed directly by the owner to build the
project.  During 1995, 1994 and  1993,  management construction services and
consulting represented 17%, 19% and 25%, respectively, of Turner Construction's 
value of work completed.  Construction management contracts involve less risk
than do projects in which Turner Construction is a general building contractor.
However, the profit from construction  management contracts can be
substantially less than that which Turner Construction can earn when it acts
as a general building contractor.

   Construction contracts include lump sum  or fixed price contracts, cost-plus
fixed fee contracts  and variations thereof including  cost-plus guaranteed
total contracts.  The majority  of Turner Construction's business involves
negotiated contracts. The remainder of its contracts are secured by competitive
bidding.

   The Company is a partner with Karl Steiner Holding  AG ("Steiner") of
Switzerland in a joint venture by the name of Turner Steiner International SA,
which renders general building construction and construction consulting
services outside Turner Construction's and Steiner's respective home markets.

   In South America, Turner Construction Company is a partner with Birmann SA
of Brazil in a joint venture by the name of Turner Birmann Construction 
Management Do Brazil SA.  The purpose of the joint venture is to provide
construction management and consulting services to clients in Brazil and
other South American markets.

   The Company is also a partner with EMCON in a joint venture by the name of
ET Environmental Corporation which provides environmental engineering, general
building construction, and construction management services on environmental
projects throughout the United States.

   The Company was involved in a number of major projects in 1995 including
the home of the new National Football League team, the Carolina Panthers, in
Charlotte North Carolina, the new Tennis Center for the United States  Tennis
Association in New York City, major amusement attractions  for  Universal 
Studios in Orlando, Florida  and the Disney Institute in Florida.   In
Cleveland, the Company completed the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, and
in San Francisco, the Company is involved in several specialized seismic
upgrades to existing building including City Hall and the Civic Auditorium.
In total, the Company completed approximately 24 million square feet  of
construction in 1995.

    The  United  States  building  construction industry  is  intensely 
competitive and Turner Construction Company and the other domestic construction
subsidiaries compete with other major contractors  as  well as with  small
contractors. Competition in the industry takes on a number  of forms, including
fee levels, quality  of service and degree of risk assumption. Construction
companies can expand their operations rapidly and each large population center
generally has a number of medium-sized building contractors accustomed to
undertaking all but the largest and most complicated projects. Through   
its organizational structure of permanently established decentralized branch
offices and subsidiaries, Turner Construction competes directly with those
locally based contractors. Year-to-year operations may be adversely  affected
by general economic conditions which are unfavorable for business and industry.
Exact statistical data is not available for determining the relative size  of
construction companies, however, based on the contract value of construction 
contracts secured in 1995 and published industry data, Turner Construction
believes that it is one of the largest building contractors operating
principally within the United States.

   A portion of the Company's construction activity is performed under payment
and performance bonds obtained through bonding capacity  from  its sureties. 
Projects requiring surety bonds are usually either publicly funded or private
projects, which often require FHA-type mortgage insurance.  While the Company's
sureties limit the amount of new payment and performance bonds available, this
limitation has not restricted the Company's ability to secure new work. There
could be certain circumstances, however, when this limitation could influence
the Company's selection of prospective projects to pursue.

    At December 31,1995, the anticipated earnings associated with backlog
from work to be completed under construction, construction management and
construction consulting contracts and awards believed to be firm but not yet
confirmed by signed formal contracts was $92.1 million. The anticipated
earnings from work to be completed on contracts and awards at December 31,
1994  was $92.6 million. Approximately 40% of the December 31,1995 earnings 
backlog from construction contracts relates to work expected to be performed
during 1997 and beyond.  The backlog is important to long-range planning and
continuity of work for the Company's permanent staff. However, anticipated
earnings  from  construction contracts should not be used as the basis  of
predictions with respect to future operating results.

   The anticipated value of work associated with backlog from work to be
completed under construction, construction management and construction
consulting contracts and awards believed to be firm but not yet confirmed
by signed formal contracts was $3.99 billion at December 31, 1995.
The anticipated value of work to be completed on contracts and awards at
December 31, 1994 was $4.55 billion. Approximately 37% of the December 31,1995
construction backlog is expected to be completed during 1997 and beyond.

    Value  of  construction completed represents the cost of work put in place
and materials fabricated during the year and related earnings pursuant to  
construction and construction management contracts, together with fees and
reimbursed expenses from consulting contracts.  It also includes costs directly
incurred by owners in connection with work under construction management and
similar contracts. It is essentially a measure of construction activity during
the year.

    Because of the varying proportion of construction, construction management
and construction consulting work, the impact of inflation on the value of
construction completed, changes in anticipated earnings from construction
contracts  and anticipated value of work completed will not necessarily be
correlative.

    At December 31,1995, Turner Construction employed approximately 2,500 staff
employees,of whom about 1,400 were executives, project managers,
superintendents, engineers, purchasing agents, estimators, senior accountants
and other supervisory personnel. In addition, Turner Construction employs 
foremen and building craftsmen for construction work which has not been
subcontracted to specialty contractors. During 1995, approximately  2,200
foremen and building craftsmen were employed at various times.

Real Estate

   The Company's subsidiaries involved in real estate operations are 
Rickenbacker Holdings, Inc. ("RHI"),and Turner Development Corporation and
subsidiaries ("TDC"). The Company also has certain other real estate holdings,
either directly or through joint venture interests, which are currently being
marketed. These holdings relate to residential condominium developments  in
Boston and Puerto Rico.

 From 1980 to 1987, TDC engaged in real estate development in the United States,
principally in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan and Virginia. TDC
developed and marketed office buildings  and other commercial and residential
properties, principally in metropolitan suburban areas.  These projects were
financed principally by construction and mortgage loans.

  TDC essentially  ceased  new  development activity in 1987 and is now seeking
purchasers for its real estate properties.

  In connection with sales of projects, TDC may be required to guarantee levels
of occupancy  and rentals for limited periods.

  Turner Medical Building Services ("TMBS") is engaged  in  project  consulting
and development services for ancillary medical and other health care facilities.
Its principal clients are hospitals, physician group practice clinics, nursing 
home and life care sponsors. TMBS provides management of architectural  and
construction  services. TMBS  subcontracts   the design and construction of its
projects.

   At  December 31, 1995, TDC had 3  employees, who were management and 
marketing personnel.

   RHI owns and leases an air cargo distribution facility located at the
Rickenbacker Air Industrial Park in Columbus, Ohio.  In  1994, the Company
sold its  master lease  and  development rights  to  the  1600  acre  air 
industrial  park adjacent   to   the  distribution  facility.    In addition,
in 1995 the Company renegotiated a lease with  the  existing lessee extending
the maturity date from 1996 to 2010.

Item 2.  Properties.

      The  Company's executive offices and offices
of  subsidiary  companies are  located  in  leased
facilities in commercial office buildings,  except
for  Universal Construction Company,  Inc.,  which
owns  a small office building in which its offices
are located.  The Company's corporate headquarters
and  New York branch office occupy 100,000  square
feet  of space which is leased until 2005.  Rental
expense  for  this  space during  1995  was  $2.09
million.   Each construction project has temporary
field offices.

      Turner  Construction operates two  equipment
and  storage yards, located in Newark, New  Jersey
and Cincinnati, Ohio for the storage and repair of
its  construction  tools  and  equipment.   Turner
Construction owns the Ohio storage and repair yard
and  leases  the  New Jersey facility.   Universal
Construction Company, Inc., owns a yard, while The
Lathrop  Company,  Inc.,  leases  yards  for   the
storage and repair of construction equipment.

     Turner Construction leases major construction
equipment  such  as hoists, cranes  and  personnel
lifts   from  equipment  suppliers  for   use   on
particular projects and generally owns only  small
tools and other miscellaneous equipment; Universal
Construction  Company,  Inc.,  and   The   Lathrop
Company,  Inc.  each  own construction  equipment,
earth-moving equipment and small tools.

      TDC  holds  as an investment a  wholly-owned
apartment   complex   which  it   had   previously
developed,   located  in  Orlando,  Florida   (200
units).  This property is encumbered by a mortgage
note payable.

      RHI  owns  certain buildings and  air  cargo
handling   equipment  at  the   Rickenbacker   Air
Industrial   Park   in   Columbus,   Ohio,   which
collateralize related revenue bonds.

Item 3.         Legal Proceedings.

      Since  1990, the Company and a joint venture
including Prudential Insurance Company of America,
had  been  engaged in a litigation in the  Circuit
Court  of  Cook  County,  Illinois  in  which  the
Company was seeking an unpaid portion of the  cost
of  constructing the Prudential Plaza 2  Tower  in
Chicago  and  Prudential was seeking  damages  for
alleged  construction delays.  The case was  tried
in  1995.  The jury found in favor of the  Company
and   the  Company  received  the  amount  of  its
receivable in the judgment.

       The  Company  is  a  defendant  in  various
litigation  incident  to its  business.   In  some
instances the amounts sought are very substantial,
including  some  which  are  proceeding  to  trial
involving  substantial claims  and  counterclaims.
Although  the  outcome  of  litigation  cannot  be
predicted  with  certainty,  in  the  opinion   of
management based on the facts known at this  time,
the   resolution   of  such  litigation   is   not
anticipated to have a material adverse  effect  on
the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

      Because  of  the  risk associated  with  the
industry  and  the number of disputes  that  often
occur,  each  year the Company incurs  substantial
legal  expenses  in pursuit of its  claims  or  in
defense against actions taken against it.

Item  7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
         Condition and Results of Operations

To  be  more consistent with industry practice, the  Company
has  changed  its  reporting format and now reports  revenue
from   construction  contracts  and  cost  of   construction
contracts  as well as  earnings from construction contracts.
Revenue from construction contracts includes not only  costs
incurred  by  the  Company, its related  earnings,  and  its
proportionate share of construction joint ventures, but also
its   proportionate   share  of  previously   unconsolidated
construction   affiliates.   Results   from   unconsolidated
affiliates had previously been reported on the equity method
and included in other income.

Results of Operations 1995 vs. 1994
The  Company  reported  1995  net  income  of  $1.3  million
compared  to  $3.7  million  in  1994.   After  taking  into
consideration   the  payment  of  dividends   to   preferred
shareholders,  the  Company reported a  loss  of  $0.11  per
common  share in 1995 compared to income of $0.35 per common
share  in  1994.   1995's  results  were  impacted  by   the
recognition  of a significant loss on a major contract,  and
the  write-down  of  a long outstanding  account  receivable
associated with an overseas project which had been completed
in  1987.   1994's results were largely due  to  a  net  tax
benefit  of  $3.2  million primarily resulting  from  losses
incurred  in  Puerto  Rico and the reversal  of  excess  tax
reserves  resulting from the planned liquidation of  one  of
the Company's inactive foreign subsidiaries.

On  a  pretax basis, the Company recognized income  of  $3.3
million  in  1995 compared to $490,000 in 1994.   Growth  in
construction  revenue as well as improvement in construction
margins  on  new  work  secured were  the  most  significant
factors contributing to this change.

Operating  and general and administrative expenses increased
as  a  result  of the increase in construction activity  and
heavier than usual legal costs, but continued to decline  as
a  percentage  of construction revenue reflecting  increased
staff  productivity.  In addition, 1994  included  a  pretax
restructuring  credit  of $1.1 million  representing  excess
restructuring reserves.

Real  estate  operations produced a $227,000  loss  in  1995
compared  to  income of $1.3 million in 1994.  Most  of  the
1994  results were attributable to a one-time gain from  the
sale of lease rights at the Company's Rickenbacker facility.

While   interest   expense  increased  compared   to   1994,
reflecting  changes in the Company's borrowing  rate,  other
income increased as well, due to the Company's improved cash
position.   1995's results are more fully described  in  the
discussion that follows.

Construction
The  value  of  construction completed, which  includes,  in
addition  to revenue, construction costs incurred by  owners
on  construction  management and similar projects  increased
23%  from  $2.67 billion in 1994 to $3.28 billion  in  1995.
Revenue  from  and  costs  of  construction  contracts  both
increased  by  25%  from  1994 to $2.73  billion  and  $2.66
billion, respectively.

The increase in construction activity is a reflection of the
continued   growth   of  the  Company's   traditional   non-
residential construction markets as noted in 1994,  as  well
as   the  emphasis  the  Company  placed  on  its  marketing
activities.   In  addition, the average  size  of  contracts
secured  in  1994 and 1995 has declined when  compared  with
prior  periods.  This  in  turn has  led  to  a  more  rapid
absorption of backlog as well as faster start-up of projects
sold in the current year.

The  value  of  new  contracts secured  in  1995  was  $2.79
billion,  up 4% from the $2.69 billion secured in 1994.   On
average, the margin on 1995 sales was up 9% over the  margin
on  sales  secured in 1994.  These factors reflect both  the
growth  of  the market, and therefore, the opportunities  to
improve fees.
The  Company's  sureties  limit the  annual  amount  of  new
payment  and  performance bonds available  to  the  Company.
Each  year  this limit has increased commensurate  with  the
Company's growth in revenues.  While the limitation did  not
restrict  the Company's ability to secure new work in  1995,
and  the Company had substantial unused capacity at the  end
of  1995,  there could be circumstances where the limitation
might influence the selection of prospective projects.

Earnings from construction contracts improved by 21.4%  over
1994  from  $56.5 million to $68.5 million, reflecting  both
the  growth in construction revenues as well as the improved
margins  in  the backlog from prior years and the  new  work
secured in 1995.  As a percentage of revenue, earnings  from
construction contracts showed a slight decline from 2.60% to
2.51%  and below the margin level of 3.28% achieved in 1993.
1995's  margins were depressed by the recognition of a  $4.9
million  loss on a contract in Minneapolis, and  the  write-
down  of a $3.2 million account receivable with regard to  a
project  in  Egypt that had been completed  in  1987.   This
write-down was the result of a ruling by a judge against the
Company  in  February  1996 in its effort  to  collect  this
receivable.   While the Company has not yet decided  whether
to  appeal the ruling, it has made provision to do  so.   In
1994, the margins were affected by $7.7 million of losses in
the Company's Caribbean operations.  Work under construction
management   contracts   as  a  percentage   of   value   of
construction completed continued to decline from 19% in 1994
to  17% in 1995.  Construction management contracts normally
involve lower risk than other types of contracts; they  also
typically  carry  lower  fees.  The  trend  away  from  less
profitable  construction management work has therefore  also
contributed to the improvement in construction margins.

At the end of 1995, the anticipated earnings associated with
backlog from work to be completed under contracts and awards
believed to be firm was $92.1 million, essentially unchanged
from  1994.  The backlog of the value of construction to  be
completed declined 12% from 1994 to $3.99 billion at the end
of  1995.   The  decline  in  backlog  volume  is  primarily
attributable to the acceleration of when work under contract
commenced,  as well as a change in the reporting of  certain
construction  management projects.   The  stability  of  the
earnings  backlog against the reduction in  the  backlog  of
construction  to  be completed represents a continuation  of
the  trend in the improvement in margins which had begun  in
1993.    This   is  also  a  reflection  of  the   continued
improvement in fees on new work secured in 1995.

Approximately  40% of the earnings backlog and  37%  of  the
value  of  construction  backlog  relates  to  work  to   be
performed  in  1997  and  beyond.  Estimated  earnings  from
construction  backlog should not be  used  as  a  basis  for
predicting future net income.

Operating and General and Administrative Expenses
Operating  expenses  directly  in  support  of  construction
operations increased 16% to $46.2 million in 1995 from $39.8
million  in  1994.  1995 expenses included  unusually  heavy
legal costs in connection with the successful defense  of  a
major  litigation.  Because of the risk associated with  the
industry  and the number of disputes that often occur,  each
year   the   Company  incurs  significant  legal   expenses.
Litigation  backlog  has,  however,  continued  to   decline
steadily   over   the  last  several  years.    Construction
operating  expenses will vary with the level of construction
revenue  and  a  significant  portion  of  the  increase  in
construction  operating  expenses was  related  to  the  25%
increase  in  construction  revenue.   As  a  percentage  of
construction   revenue,   however,  construction   operating
expenses  declined steadily from 2.12% in 1993 to  1.83%  in
1994  to 1.69% in 1995.  This improvement in efficiency  was
in  large part a result of the restructuring steps taken  in
1994.   General and administrative expenses, which  includes
all  of  corporate overhead expenses, shows  only  a  slight
increase  of  3%  over  1994  to $11.1  million  from  $10.7
million.

All  of  the outstanding balance of $897,000 of the  accrued
liabilities associated with the restructuring reserve set up
in  1993 was absorbed by the end of 1995, in accordance with
the program previously established.

Real Estate
In 1995, the Company changed its presentation of real estate
operations in its Statements of Operations to a single  item
described  as  "Income  from real estate  operations."   The
components   of   this   item  are   described   below   the
"Consolidated  Statements of Operations."  This  change  has
been  made  because of the less significant impact  of  real
estate  operations on the Company's consolidated results  of
operations.   The  Company  has  been  able  to  dispose  of
properties at essentially their carrying value over the past
few   years,   and  income  generated  from  the   operating
properties  are  more  than sufficient to  offset  operating
costs   (exclusive  of  depreciation).   From  a   liquidity
standpoint,  real  estate operations are  slightly  positive
even   after  taking  into  consideration  interest  expense
associated with real estate debt.

Losses  from real estate operations amounted to $227,000  in
1995  compared  to  $1.3 million in  income  in  1994.   The
majority  of 1994's income from real estate operations  came
from  the sale of lease rights at the Company's Rickenbacker
facility.   During  1995  the  Company  sold  one  developed
property  with  an  adjacent land parcel  and  a  number  of
condominium units, all at their approximate carrying  value.
Rental  and other income and the cost of operations declined
by 28% and 24%, respectively, due to the sales of properties
in  1994  and  1995  and the renegotiated lease  of  certain
facilities at the Rickenbacker Air Industrial Park in 1995.

In  1995,  the  Company  had a net  loss  from  real  estate
operations  other than property sales of $509,000,  compared
with  a  net  loss  of $367,000 in 1994.   However,  because
expenses   included  $3.94  million  of   depreciation   and
amortization  in 1995 and $5.60 million in 1994,  there  was
positive  cash flow from real estate operations in  each  of
these  years, even after payment of interest on real  estate
debt.

The  Company's real estate portfolio is carried at estimated
net  realizable  value  or at cost,  as  applicable.   Until
conditions  in the real estate market improve to  the  point
that  will permit the Company to readily conduct real estate
transactions, the Company will continue to review the  asset
values  of  the  properties in relation to  prospective  net
realizable   value  and  make  adjustments   as   necessary.
Management believes the timing of future sales for developed
properties   may  be  accelerated  as  more  stable   market
conditions begin to prevail.  For undeveloped land  parcels,
however,  a  prolonged period of time will  be  required  to
achieve reasonable values.

Interest Expense and Other Income
In  1995,  the Company changed its presentation of  interest
expense   to  a  separate  line  item  below  "Income   from
construction  operations"  and  "Income  from  real   estate
operations"  in  its Consolidated Statement  of  Operations.
Interest expense includes interest cost and related  expense
associated with all the Company's borrowings including  both
corporate and real estate debt.

In  total, interest expense increased 17% to $9.3 million in
1995  from  $7.9  million in 1994.  The increase  is  almost
entirely due to the coupon rate of the Senior Notes sold  in
the  fourth  quarter of 1994.  Although the  amount  of  the
Company's 1995 average borrowings declined when compared  to
1994, the interest rates incurred averaged over 11% in  1995
compared to approximately 7% in 1994.

Interest  expense associated with real estate debt  declined
by  16%  as  a  result of debt paydowns  from  the  sale  of
properties.  Interest expense is further discussed in  Notes
6 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In  1995,  the  Company  changed its presentation  of  other
income.   Other income now includes primarily  interest  and
investment income and certain other miscellaneous items.
Other income in 1995 amounted to $1.5 million compared to  a
loss  of  $2,000  in 1994.  In 1994 the Company  charged  to
other  income  the  absorption on  a  pretax  basis  of  the
cumulative  foreign translation adjustment relating  to  the
planned liquidation of one of the Company's inactive foreign
subsidiaries.   Cumulative translation adjustments,  net  of
tax,  had  previously been charged directly to stockholders'
equity.   Exclusive  of the cumulative  foreign  translation
adjustment other income would have amounted to $1.2 million.

Income Taxes
The  provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax
rate  of 61% in 1995.  The difference between this rate  and
the  34%  statutory rate is primarily attributable to  state
income  and other taxes and the non-deductibility of certain
operating costs.

In  1994,  the  Company realized a net tax benefit  of  $3.2
million  due  primarily to the benefits derived from  losses
incurred  in Puerto Rico as well as the reversal  of  excess
reserves  resulting from the planned liquidation of  one  of
the Company's inactive foreign subsidiaries.

The  Company  has  recorded $16.0 million  of  deferred  tax
assets  which  resulted principally from net operating  loss
and  tax credit carryforwards.  Management believes that  no
valuation allowance is required for these assets due to  the
future  reversal  of existing taxable temporary  differences
primarily related to the Company's employee benefits plans.

Fourth Quarter 1995 Compared to Third Quarter 1995
Results  for the fourth quarter of 1995 amounted  to  a  net
loss  of $2.0 million compared to net income of $1.2 million
for  the third quarter.  After taking into account dividends
on  preferred shares, the net loss per common share amounted
to  $0.47  in the fourth quarter, compared to net income  of
$0.13  per  common share in the third quarter.  Construction
revenue was $692 million for the fourth quarter compared  to
$741  million  in  the  third  quarter,  and  earnings  from
construction contracts were $14.9 million and $19.0  million
for  the same periods, respectively.  The slight decline  in
construction activity between the two periods is not unusual
and does not represent any significant trend in construction
activity.   The  significant change in  the  fourth  quarter
results was due to the loss on the Minneapolis project, most
of  which was recorded in the fourth quarter, and the write-
down  of  the  account receivable from the Egyptian  project
discussed above.

Fourth  quarter  operating  and general  and  administrative
expenses amounted to $16.1 million compared to $14.7 million
in   the   third   quarter.   Much  of  this  increase   was
attributable  to  certain  employee  benefits   which   were
incurred in the fourth quarter.

Loss from real estate operations amounted to $128,000 in the
fourth quarter compared to essentially a third quarter break-
even.   This  change is the result of reduced rental  income
from the sale of properties earlier in the year.

Interest  expense  and  other  income  remained  essentially
unchanged between the third and fourth quarters.

Results of Operations 1994 vs. 1993
The  Company reported net income of $3.7 million in 1994  or
$0.35  per  common  share compared to a  net  loss  of  $6.2
million or $1.55 per common share in 1993.

Although  revenue from construction contracts  increased  4%
from  1993  to  1994,  earnings from construction  contracts
declined  18%  from $68.8 million to $56.5 million  for  the
same  period.  This reduction was largely the  result  of  a
significant   loss  incurred  by  the  Company's   Caribbean
operations  in  the  U.S. Virgin Islands  and  Puerto  Rico.
These  losses  stemmed from overruns on lump  sum  contracts
begun  in  prior years and substantially completed in  1994.
Total  operating  and  general and  administrative  expenses
declined  by  13%  from  1993  to  1994.   This  decline  is
primarily attributable to the restructuring steps  taken  in
1994  which  included the downsizing of staff  in  shrinking
geographic markets and the reorganization of certain support
functions.   In  1993 the Company recorded an  $8.5  million
provision  for  restructuring.   During  1994,  the  Company
charged  $6.5  million of expenditures against  the  reserve
which  included  severance, benefits  and  other  incentives
associated  with staff reductions.  An unused  $1.1  million
remainder of the reserve was credited to income in 1994.

Income  from real estate operations amounted to $1.3 million
in  1994 compared to a $6.9 million loss in 1993.  In  1994,
the   Company  sold  its  lease  rights  at  the   Company's
Rickenbacker  facility  which  accounted  for  most  of  the
income.  Included in 1993's loss from real estate operations
was  a $6.0 million valuation provision set up as additional
reserves  against asset values in relation to their carrying
value.   The decline in rental and other income and cost  of
operations was due primarily to sales of properties in  both
1993 and 1994.

Interest expense increased 7% from $7.4 million in  1993  to
$7.9  million in 1994 primarily due to higher interest rates
on the Company's corporate credit facilities.

Other  income  in  1994 amounted to a loss of  $2,000  after
taking  into  consideration a $1.2 million  charge  for  the
pretax  absorption  of  the cumulative  foreign  translation
adjustment relating to the planned liquidation of one of the
Company's  inactive  foreign  subsidiaries.   Excluding  the
charge  for  the  cumulative translation  adjustment,  other
income,  which primarily consists of interest and investment
income,  amounted  to  $1.2  million.   This  represented  a
decline  of  $900,000 from 1993 due in  part  to  investment
income of $861,000 recognized in 1993.

Financial Condition
In  total, the Company recorded an increase in cash and cash
equivalents in 1995 of $31.7 million.

Cash  provided  by  operating activities amounted  to  $40.1
million,  reflected in the Company's peak cash  position  at
December  31,  1995.   Improved cash  collection  procedures
generated  most of the significant year end  cash,  much  of
which will be disbursed in the first quarter of 1996 to fund
outstanding trade accounts payable.

The  increase  in construction activity, and  the  continued
shift away from construction management contracts were  also
factors  contributing  to  the  improved  cash  flows   from
operating activities.

The  remaining balance of $897,000 set up in prior years for
the  Company's  restructuring program was also  expended  in
1995.

Cash  provided  by  investing activities amounted  to  $11.6
million  primarily  due to the sale of  one  developed  real
estate   property,  and  a  number  of  units  in  a  Boston
condominium project and a Puerto Rican condominium project.

In  addition, the Company collected funds from the repayment
of  note receivables from the sale of real estate properties
in prior periods.


Cash  used  in financing activities amounted to $20  million
and is primarily attributable to the excess of debt paydowns
over  borrowings.  Funds provided by the sale of real estate
properties  were  used  to  pay down  associated  debt.   In
addition, the Company paid down the outstanding balances  on
certain loans and lines of credit used for general operating
purposes.

Management   believes   the  Company's   cash   flows   from
construction  backlog,  its  $40  million  revolving  credit
facility   and  amounts  available  from  overnight   credit
facilities,  will  be  sufficient to support  the  Company's
operations.  Debt maturing in 1996 will be paid  from  funds
generated from operations or will be refinanced prior to its
actual maturity date.

Inflation
Inflation and changing prices during the current fiscal year
have  not significantly affected the major markets in  which
the  Company conducts its business.  In view of the moderate
rate of inflation, its impact on the Company's business  has
not been significant.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In  March  1995,  the Financial Accounting  Standards  Board
issued  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards  (SFAS)
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of".

This  statement requires that long-lived assets to  be  held
and  used  in  an  entity's  operations  be  recognized   as
impaired,   whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances
indicate  that the carrying amount of an asset  may  not  be
recoverable.   In  addition,  the  statement  requires  that
certain  long-lived assets to be disposed of be reported  at
the  lower  of  carrying amount or fair value less  cost  to
sell.

The  statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995.

The  Company  will  adopt the standard at the  beginning  of
1996,  and management believes that the impact will  not  be
material to the financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation
In  October  1995, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board
issued    SFAS   No.   123   "Accounting   For   Stock-Based
Compensation".

This  statement  defines  a "fair  value  based  method"  of
accounting  for an employee stock option and encourages  the
adoption  of that method for all employee stock compensation
plans.   However, it also allows an entity  to  continue  to
measure   compensation  cost  for  those  plans  using   the
"intrinsic  value based method" of accounting prescribed  by
APB  Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for  Stock  Issued   To
Employees".  Entities electing to remain with the accounting
in Opinion 25 must make certain pro forma disclosures, as if
the  fair value based method of accounting had been applied.
The  accounting requirements of this statement are effective
for  transactions  entered into in fiscal years  that  begin
after  December  15, 1995.  The disclosure requirements  for
this  statement  are effective for financial statements  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.

The  Company will elect to remain with the accounting method
in   Opinion  25,  and  will  conform  with  the  pro  forma
disclosure requirements beginning in 1996.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To The Turner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of  The  Turner  Corporation  (a Delaware  corporation)  and
Subsidiaries  as  of December 31, 1995  and  1994,  and  the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity  and  cash flows for each of the three years  in  the
period  ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements
are  the  responsibility of the Company's  management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We   conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  auditing standards.  Those standards require  that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about  whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting  the amounts  and  disclosures  in  the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing  the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management,  as  well  as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits  provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to  above
present  fairly,  in  all material respects,  the  financial
position  of The Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries  as  of
December  31,  1995  and  1994, and  the  results  of  their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three  years
in  the  period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.

The Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except share amounts)

The  Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) is  a
multinational  construction  contractor,  which   also   has
limited  real estate operations in the United  States.   The
Company   is  predominantly  engaged  in  general   building
construction  and  construction  management  throughout  the
United States.  The construction operations primarily relate
to  the construction of commercial, multifamily residential,
manufacturing,   research   and   development,   healthcare,
entertainment,   education,  justice  and   other   building
structures.  The Company also performs interior construction
work  and construction consulting services.  Specialty trade
contractors   are  used  extensively  by  the   Company   as
subcontractors  in  the  performance  of  its   construction
contracts.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Changes  in  Presentation:   To  be  more  consistent   with
industry   practice,  in  1995  the  Company   changed   its
presentation  of  reporting  gross  earnings  to  a   format
reflecting   construction  revenue,  cost  of   construction
revenue   and   operating  and  general  and  administrative
expenses.   The  Company now includes in  its  accounts  its
proportionate  interest  in  its  previously  unconsolidated
construction affiliates.  In prior years, the investments in
these  affiliates  were accounted for on the  equity  method
with the change in equity included in "Other income, net".

In  addition,  for  1995 the Company is presenting  interest
expense as a separate item on the Consolidated Statement  of
Operations.   This item represents all the interest  expense
of  the Company including interest on real estate as well as
general  corporate debt.  In prior years,  interest  expense
had  been included in income from real estate operations and
in   general  and  administrative  expenses.   Prior   years
presented  have been changed to conform to the current  year
presentation, which had no effect on net income for  any  of
the periods presented.

Principles  of  Consolidation:  The  consolidated  financial
statements  include  the accounts of  the  Company  and  its
proportionate  interest  in  the  accounts  of  construction
affiliates  and  construction joint ventures.   The  Company
also  has  investments in real estate joint ventures,  which
are  accounted  for  under the equity  or  cost  method,  as
appropriate.  All significant intercompany transactions  and
balances  are eliminated.  Certain prior year balances  have
been  reclassified in the consolidated financial  statements
in  order  to  provide  a presentation consistent  with  the
current year.

Use  of  Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements
in  conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that
affect  the  reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the  date
of  the  financial statements, and the reported  amounts  of
revenues   and   expenses  during  the   reporting   period.
Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing
the   Company's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and
prudent,  however,  actual results could differ  from  those
estimates.

Construction    Operations:     The    Company    determines
construction  earnings  under the percentage  of  completion
method.   Under  this  method,  the  Company  recognizes  as
earnings that portion of the total earnings anticipated from
a  contract which the value of the work completed  bears  to
the  estimated  total  value of  the  work  covered  by  the
contract.  As the Company's construction contracts generally
extend  over  more  than one year, revisions  in  costs  and
earnings  estimates  during  the  course  of  the  work  are
reflected  in the year in which the facts which require  the
revision become known.  Due to uncertainties inherent in the
estimation  process,  it is reasonably  possible  that  such
estimates will be revised over the next year.  When  a  loss
is  forecasted  for  a  contract, the  full  amount  of  the
anticipated loss is recognized in the period in which it  is
determined  that a loss will occur.  Claims are included  in
earnings  from construction contracts at an amount based  on
the  related contract costs when realization is probable and
the amount can be reliably estimated.
The  Company  continuously reviews estimated  earnings  from
construction contracts and makes necessary adjustments based
on  current evaluations of the indicated outcome.  In  1995,
1994  and  1993, the Company wrote down certain construction
receivables and claims deemed unrecoverable.

Under  certain contracts, owners of buildings make  payments
directly  to  suppliers and subcontractors for  all  or  for
portions  of  work  covered by the  contract.   The  Company
considers  such costs in determining contract percentage  of
completion  and  reports  such  amounts  in  the  value   of
construction completed.

Real  Estate  Operations:   Rental income,  including  fixed
minimum  rents and additional rents, under operating  leases
with tenants is generally recognized on a contractual basis.

Profit  on  sales of real estate is recognized in full  when
the  profit  is determinable, an adequate down  payment  has
been   received,  collectability  of  the  sales  price   is
reasonably assured and the earnings process is substantially
complete.   If  the sales transaction does  not  meet  these
criteria, all profit or a portion thereof is deferred  until
such criteria are met.

The real estate properties which are held for investment are
carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  are
assessed  periodically for impairment based on  the  sum  of
undiscounted  estimated future cash flows.  All  other  real
estate  properties  and investments  in  real  estate  joint
ventures  are carried at the lower of cost or estimated  net
realizable value (Note 4).

Depreciation  and  Amortization:   The  Company   calculates
depreciation on property and equipment, and on  real  estate
primarily  on  the  straight-line method.  Estimated  useful
lives  are  as  follows:  buildings and improvements,  20-40
years;  office  machines  and  furniture,  5-10  years;  and
equipment, 10 years.  Leasehold improvements (the Company as
lessee) to property used in Company operations are amortized
on  a  straight-line  basis over the  lease  terms.   Tenant
improvements  (the  Company  as  lessor)  on   real   estate
properties are amortized on a straight-line basis  over  the
term  of  the  lease.  Maintenance and repairs are  expensed
currently,  except  that expenditures  for  betterments  are
capitalized.

Cash:  The Company considers all investments purchased  with
maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

The   Company's   other  liabilities  include  approximately
$50,900  and  $36,800 net payable to banks for checks  drawn
but   not  cleared  as  of  December  31,  1995  and   1994,
respectively.

Marketable Securities:  Marketable securities which  consist
primarily of equity and bond mutual funds are classified  as
available-for-sale   and  are  reported   at   fair   value.
Unrealized  gains  and  losses are reported  as  a  separate
component of stockholders' equity.

Income Taxes:  Deferred income tax assets or liabilities are
computed  based  on  the  difference between  the  financial
reporting  and  income tax bases of assets  and  liabilities
using  the  enacted marginal tax rate.  Deferred income  tax
expenses  or benefits are based on the changes in the  asset
or liability from period to period.

The  Company does not provide for U.S. Federal income  taxes
on  undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since  it
is  the  Company's intention to permanently  reinvest  those
earnings outside the United States.
Foreign  Currency  Translation:  Assets and  liabilities  of
operations that represent an investment in a foreign country
are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect
at  year-end,  while revenue and expenses are translated  at
average  exchange  rates prevailing during  the  year.   The
resulting translation gains and losses are accumulated as  a
separate   component  of  stockholders'   equity.    Foreign
currency  transaction  gains  and  losses  are  included  in
results  of  operations  during the periods  in  which  they
arise.

Earnings  Per  Common  Share:  Primary earnings  per  common
share  is based on net income less preferred stock dividends
(net  of tax benefits relating to Series B preferred  stock)
divided by the weighted average number of common and  common
equivalent  shares outstanding.  Fully diluted earnings  per
common  share  is  further adjusted to reflect  the  assumed
conversion   of   convertible  preferred   stock   and   the
convertible debenture, and the elimination of the  preferred
stock  dividends  and interest expense  on  the  convertible
debenture,   net  of  applicable  income  taxes,   if   such
conversions are dilutive.

Stock-Based  Compensation:  The  Company  accounts  for  its
stock-based employee compensation plans using the  intrinsic
value  based  method,  under  which  compensation  cost   is
measured  as the excess of the stock's market price  at  the
grant  date over the amount an employee must pay to  acquire
the stock.

2.  Restructuring Charges
During  1993,  plans were developed to significantly  reduce
the  Company's  future operating costs and expenses  and  to
improve    productivity.     This   restructuring    program
principally  involved a reduction in the  number  of  staff,
plus  the  consolidation of offices and facilities  and  the
reorganization  of  support  functions.   The   results   of
operations  for  1993  included  $8,500  of  pretax  charges
($5,600 net of tax benefits, or $1.08 per share) related  to
this program.  The charges included provisions for severance
pay,  incentive programs relating to employee  terminations,
costs  related  to  the consolidation of offices  and  other
reorganization costs.  This program was implemented in  1994
and  was  substantially completed by the end  of  the  year.
During  1994,  $6,458 was charged to the  reserve  and  $897
remained  in  other liabilities at December 31,  1994.   The
balance  of  the  unused reserve of $1,145 was  credited  to
income  in  the  fourth quarter of 1994.  During  1995,  the
final  costs  were incurred and the reserve was  closed  out
with no material impact to the results of operations.

3.  Construction Receivables
Due  on contracts included $135,619 of retainage at December
31,  1995.   It is expected that approximately 89%  of  such
retainage  will  be  collected by  December  31,  1996.   At
December  31,  1994,  retainage was  $116,856.  Construction
receivables  include estimated net claims.  Claims  made  by
the   Company  involve  negotiations  and  in   some   cases
litigation.   The  Company believes that it has  established
legal bases for pursuing recovery of recorded claims and  it
is   management's  intention  to  pursue  these  claims  and
litigate,  if  necessary, until a decision or settlement  is
reached.   Claims  involve the use of estimates  and  it  is
reasonably   possible  that  revisions  to   the   estimated
recoverable amounts of recorded claims could be made  within
the  next  year.   The settlement of the claims  depends  on
individual  circumstances, accordingly, the  timing  of  the
collection will vary and may extend beyond one year.   Those
claims,  primarily  due to owner-caused  delays,  incomplete
specifications or similar reasons, amounted  to  $8,200  and
$8,600 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

4.  Real Estate
The Company owns a portfolio of real estate, either directly
or through joint venture interests, that includes commercial
office  properties, a mixed-use warehouse/service  property,
residential   properties,  undeveloped  land,  and   certain
buildings  and  hangars located at an air  industrial  park.
The properties are located throughout the United States, but
primarily   in  the  Southeast  and  Great  Lakes   regions.
Accumulated depreciation at December 31, 1995 and  1994  was
$30,732 and $34,639, respectively.
Given the current real estate market, the Company intends to
presently hold its interests in commercial office, mixed-use
and residential condominium properties, and undeveloped land
parcels.   The Company has determined that such real  estate
properties will be available for sale as conditions  in  the
real  estate  market continue to improve to the  point  that
such  properties  can be sold for prices which  the  Company
believes  reflect  the reasonable value of  the  properties.
Management  believes  the timing  of  future  sales  of  the
commercial  office,  mixed-use and  residential  condominium
properties   may  be  accelerated  as  more  stable   market
conditions  begin  to prevail.  Accordingly,  the  Company's
interests  in  certain developed properties are  carried  at
their estimated fair value.  However, management anticipates
a  prolonged period before land values recover.  Due to  the
relatively  low  holding costs of the Company's  undeveloped
land parcels, the Company intends to and has the ability  to
hold  the properties for a prolonged period of time in order
to achieve reasonable prices upon disposition.  The carrying
amounts  of  the  Company's  interests  in  these  developed
properties  were $33,641 and $45,934, and in the undeveloped
land  parcels were $29,824 and $30,458 at December 31,  1995
and  1994,  respectively.  These real estate  interests  are
carried  at  the  lower of cost or estimated net  realizable
value.   The  net  realizable values reflect  the  Company's
estimates of the net sales proceeds less anticipated capital
expenditures through the estimated date of sale and disposal
costs, which have not been discounted to net present value.

The   Company  estimates  the  net  realizable   values   by
evaluating  and making assumptions about future events  with
respect  to  the property, market conditions and anticipated
investor rates of return.  The net realizable values reflect
each  disposition  based on the Company's  current  intended
holding  period,  and  do not represent liquidation  values.
Judgments regarding future events are not subject to precise
quantification or verification and may change from  time  to
time  as  economic  and market factors,  and  the  Company's
evaluation  of them, change and the effects of such  changes
may   be  significant.   Changes  in  assumptions  and   the
Company's  evaluation  of  the  market  could  cause   these
estimates to change within the next year.

The Company actively monitors market conditions and reviews,
on  a quarterly basis, the net realizable values of its real
estate interests and reduces carrying amounts when required.
On  a  periodic basis, generally not exceeding two to  three
years, the Company has independent appraisals performed  for
significant  real  estate  interests  for  the  purpose   of
assisting management in determining their fair value and the
appropriate timing of disposition.  In connection  with  the
Company's review of the carrying amounts of its real  estate
interests,  additional write-downs and  reserves  of  $6,018
were recorded for the year ended December 31, 1993.

In  March  1995,  the Financial Accounting  Standards  Board
issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived  Assets  and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Dispose  Of".
This  statement requires that long-lived assets to  be  held
and  used  by  an entity be recognized as impaired  whenever
events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that   the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and when
impaired to record an impairment loss to state the asset  at
its  fair  value.  In addition, the statement requires  that
long-lived assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower
of  carrying  amount or fair value less cost to  sell.   The
statement is required to be adopted no later than January 1,
1996,  although  earlier implementation is permitted.   SFAS
No.  121 is required to be applied prospectively for  assets
to  be held and used, and as a cumulative effect of a change
in  accounting principle upon initial application for assets
to be disposed of.

The  Company  will adopt the standard effective  January  1,
1996 relating to its real estate interests, which are to  be
held and used by the Company.  Management believes that  the
impact  upon adoption will not be material to the  financial
statements.
5.  Property and Equipment

Total                                     $ 94,790    $106,879

Senior Notes:  In December 1994, the Company sold $39,500 of
Senior   Notes  in  a  private  placement  to  institutional
investors,  including the Company's pension plan (Note  10).
Proceeds  of  the  Notes were used to  pay  down  short-term
borrowings under the revolving credit facility.   The  Notes
bear  interest at a fixed rate of 11.74% and mature in  even
principal  amounts on the third through seventh  anniversary
dates  of  the Notes.  The Note Purchase Agreement  contains
various covenants, the most restrictive of which is a fixed-
charge coverage requirement.

Land  and Building Mortgages:  Variable rate mortgages  bear
interest at rates of LIBOR plus 2.25% or prime plus 0.5% and
mature  in varying installments through 1998.  The  weighted
average  interest  rate for 1995 and 1994 was  approximately
9.0% and 7.47%, respectively.  In connection with a variable
rate building mortgage, in 1994, the Company entered into an
interest  rate  swap agreement with a bank  for  a  notional
amount  equal to the underlying mortgage ($9,322 at December
31, 1995).  The swap agreement provides for a fixed interest
rate   of  6.96%  through  February  5,  1998.   Fixed  rate
mortgages  of $5,106 bear interest at 7% or 9.375%  and  are
due in varying installments through 2001.

Revenue  Bonds:   Adjustable rate  revenue  refunding  bonds
collateralized  by  properties at the  air  industrial  park
mature in varying installments through 2010.  The bonds bear
interest  at  a weekly variable rate.  The weighted  average
interest rate for 1995 and 1994 was approximately 3.96%  and
2.89%, respectively.  The bonds are supported by a letter of
credit  for  which the Company pays 1.25%  per  annum.   The
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with  a
bank  for  a $15,000 notional amount providing for  a  fixed
interest rate of 4.13% through December 15, 1995.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):  This loan was used to
fund  the  Company's  loan to the ESOP  and  is  payable  in
varying  installments  through 1999.   Interest  is  payable
quarterly at a variable rate equal to 83% of the prime  rate
or a percentage of LIBOR, at the Company's option.  The loan
is  collateralized by first mortgages on certain real estate
properties  and  letters of credit.   The  loan  allows  for
collateral  substitution  and  upon  disposition   of   such
properties  may  require additional collateral  to  maintain
loan-to-value relationships.  The weighted average  interest
rate  for  1995 and 1994 was approximately 6.08% and  4.56%,
respectively.    The   loan   agreement   contains   various
covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum amount  of
stockholders' equity and debt coverage ratio.   At  December
31,  1995,  the  minimum stockholders' equity  required  was
$58,000 and increases by $4,000 annually to $74,000 in 1999.

Revolving  Credit  Facility:  The Company has  an  unsecured
$40,000 revolving credit facility maturing in December 1996,
the  proceeds  of  which  are  used  for  general  corporate
purposes.   No  borrowings were outstanding at December  31,
1995 and 1994.  The current facility permits the Company  to
choose  between various interest rate options.  The weighted
average  interest  rate for 1995 and 1994 was  approximately
8.44%   and  6.84%,  respectively.   The  Company   pays   a
commitment  fee  at  an annual rate of 0.5%  on  the  unused
portion  of  the  facility.  The facility  contains  various
covenants,  the most restrictive of which is a  fixed-charge
coverage requirement.

Convertible  Debenture:   The  Company  has  a  $6,000  8.5%
convertible  debenture which matures in 1997.   The  Company
may  not prepay the principal balance prior to its maturity.
At  the  option of the holder, the debenture is  convertible
into  6,000  shares  of Series D 8.5% convertible  preferred
stock  of  the  Company.  The holder must convert  the  full
debenture principal balance at the time of conversion.   The
Series D stock is ultimately convertible into 600,000 shares
of  the Company's common stock and carries terms similar  to
the Series C stock of the Company, except as to the election
of directors (Note 12).

Other:   The  Company maintains overnight credit  facilities
with  various  banks  at  varying rates.   The  Company  had
available $10,000, none of which was drawn down at  December
31,  1995  and $2,400 was outstanding at December 31,  1994.
The  facilities  are subject to periodic  renewal  from  the
banks  and  certain facilities carry annual commitment  fees
ranging  from  0.375% to 0.5%.  During 1995  and  1994,  the
weighted  average  interest  rates  were  8.87%  and  7.59%,
respectively.

The  Company leases certain computer equipment and  vehicles
under agreements which are classified as capital leases  and
bear  a  weighted average implicit interest rate  of  7.06%.
The  leases have original terms ranging from three  to  five
years  and  payments  under the leases are  due  in  varying
installments through 2000.  At December 31, 1995, $5,051  of
obligations   under   capital   lease   arrangements    were
outstanding.

This  amount  included  a  bank  loan  for  the  purpose  of
financing  improvements to the Company's  corporate  offices
which  was paid down in 1995 and had an outstanding  balance
of  $3,000 at December 31, 1994.  The principal was  payable
in  semi-annual  installments through July 1995.   The  loan
bore  interest  at  LIBOR plus 0.25%.  The weighted  average
interest rate for 1995 and 1994, including associated letter
of   credit   fees,  was  approximately  9.51%  and   7.74%,
respectively.

Aggregate maturities of notes due are as follows:

  1996   1997   1998     1999    2000   Thereafter
$6,177 $24,374 $20,970 $12,229 $9,222      $21,818

Interest cost approximates amounts paid for the years  ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

At  December 31, 1995, the carrying value of the real estate
that  was  pledged  as  collateral  for  notes  payable  was
$59,747.

7.  Income Taxes

The components of the income tax provision (benefit) are  as
follows:

                                1995          1994          1993
Current:
Federal                       $  131       $ (2,924)     $     -
Foreign                          300             59          145

                               1,025         (2,329)         252

Deferred:
Federal                          962          1,659       (4,027)
Foreign                            -         (2,482)           -
State & Local                      -             (8)         211
                                 962           (831)      (3,816)
Total                         $1,987       $ (3,160)     $(3,564) 

The  current  Federal provision for the year ended  December
31,  1995  reflects  the benefit of the utilization  of  net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,800.

Deferred  income  taxes  result from  temporary  differences
between the financial reporting carrying amounts and the tax
bases  of  assets  and  liabilities.  The  source  of  these
differences and tax effect of each at December 31, 1995  and
1994 are as follows:

                                  Deferred Income Tax
                                   Liability (Asset)
                                   1995           1994
Construction earnings          $    583       $    656
Employee benefit plans           23,654         24,629   
Depreciation                      4,050          5,857 
Real estate properties           (1,787)        (2,736) 
Net operating loss benefits      (9,778)       (11,933)

Jobs credit carryforward            (75)           (75)
Deferred compensation plan         (511)          (611)
Contributions carryover          (1,278)        (1,056)
Other                              (150)           (80)
                               $ 12,257        $11,961

The  Company  has  recorded $16,030 of deferred  tax  assets
having resulted principally from net operating loss and  tax
credit carryforwards.  Management believes that no valuation
allowance  is  required for these assets due to  the  future
reversals   of   existing   taxable  temporary   differences
primarily related to the Company's employee benefit plans.

A comparison  of  the  Federal  statutory  rate  with  the
Company's effective tax rate is as follows:

                                                  1995    1994    1993
Statutory Federal income tax rate (benefit)      34.0%   34.0%  (34.0)%
State and local taxes, net of Federal benefit    12.0%   86.6%    2.2%
Effective foreign tax rate                        6.1% (489.3)%  (3.0)%
Reserve reversals                                   -  (355.2)%     -
Other                                             8.9%   79.0%   (1.7)%
Effective tax rate (benefit)                     61.0% (644.9)% (36.5)%

Income taxes paid (refunded) were $(507), $(455) and $73 for
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

For  Federal income tax purposes, the Company has  available
at  December  31, 1995 a net operating loss carryforward  of
$20,965  which is available to offset future taxable  income
and  expires  from  2006 through 2009,  and  an  alternative
minimum  tax  credit  carryforward of $2,451  which  can  be
carried forward indefinitely.

The   unrecognized   deferred  tax  liability   related   to
cumulative  undistributed earnings of  foreign  subsidiaries
which  were permanently reinvested was $323 at December  31,
1995.

8.  Incentive Compensation Plans
The  Company  sponsors the Executive Incentive  Compensation
Plan (EICP) which authorizes payments of awards to executive
officers  and other designated employees of the  Company  in
the form of cash and common stock of the Company.  The award
may  be  deferred in part at the election of the  recipient.
The  committee  that  administers the  plan  determines  the
particular  recipients  who are to receive  awards  and  the
amounts of their respective awards.  The amounts charged  to
expense in 1995, 1994 and 1993 aggregated $33, $849 and $39,
respectively.  No awards were made under the EICP in 1995.

The   staff   Incentive  Compensation  Plan   (ICP),   which
authorized payment of awards in the form of cash and  common
stock of the Company to certain salaried employees who  were
not  participants  in  the Company's  EICP,  was  liquidated
during the first quarter of 1995 with the issuance of 21,272
shares   of  the  Company's  common  stock  to  the  current
participants  of  the  program.  Each share  was  valued  at
$7.919,  which was the average market price of the Company's
common  stock  over the last 20 business  days  of  December
1994.   The  total gross value of the liquidation was  $282.
The  amounts charged to expense in 1994 and 1993  aggregated
$134 and $116, respectively.

9. Stock Options
The Company has incentive stock option plans adopted in 1986
and  1992  which  provide  for the granting  of  options  to
officers and designated employees of the Company to purchase
shares  of  the common stock of the Company at a  price  not
less  than the market value of the common stock on the  date
the  option  is  granted.  In addition,  an  incentive  plan
adopted  in 1981 has been terminated and no new options  can
be  granted  under  this plan, although unexercised  options
remain outstanding.

Options are exercisable in whole or in part from one to  ten
years  from the date of the grant at the discretion  of  the
stock option committee.  Options granted under each plan may
not  exceed 400,000 shares.  No charges to income  arise  in
connection with the plans.

Option plan transactions during 1995 and 1994 are summarized
in the following table:

                                                              Price Range

Options available for grant at December 31 206,020   247,390

10.  Employee Benefit Plans
Defined   Benefit   Pension  Plan:   The   Company   has   a
noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan  which  covers
salaried  employees  who  meet minimum  age  and  length  of
service requirements.

On March 31, 1991, the Company curtailed its defined benefit
pension  plan  such  that benefits do  not  accrue  to  plan
participants for future years of service under  the  benefit
formula.   Benefits  earned prior to  the  curtailment  were
based  on  members'  years  of service  and  averaged  final
salary.

Effective  January 1, 1994, the Company amended the  defined
benefit pension plan to add a cash balance plan feature,  to
provide  benefits to plan participants that were  previously
provided  under  the defined contribution  retirement  plan.
Past   benefits  earned  by  plan  participants   prior   to
curtailment   are  not  changed  and  benefits   earned   by
participants  for  future  service  are  provided  under   a
different  benefit formula.  New participants earn  benefits
only  under  the  revised formula.  The new benefit  formula
provides  for  credits  into  notional  individual   account
balances based upon salary and years of service.  Management
anticipates  that  the cash balance plan will  significantly
reduce  the net periodic pension credit recognized in future
years,  and  result  in a reduction of the  prepaid  pension
asset.

The  projected  unit  credit actuarial  method  is  used  to
determine  the  recognition of net periodic pension  expense
and  to  determine funding requirements.  The  Company  will
continue to fund the plan as required.

The  Company  amortizes  unrecognized  prior  service  costs
related  to the curtailed benefits on a straight-line  basis
over  a period not exceeding the average life expectancy  of
retirees.

The  Company  amortizes the full amount of the  unrecognized
pension  actuarial  gains  and losses  for  the  year  on  a
straight-line  basis  over  the  average  remaining  service
period of employees.

Plan  assets  consist primarily of pooled equity,  debt  and
short-term  investment funds, a pooled  real  estate  equity
fund,  675,000  shares  of the Company's  common  stock  and
$9,500 of the Company's Senior Notes (Note 6).

The  table  below,  which  reflects  the  updated  actuarial
measurement  at June 30, 1995, sets forth the funded  status
of   the  defined  benefit  pension  plan  and  the  amounts
recognized in the Company's financial statements at December
31, 1995 and 1994 and for the years then ended:

The  assumptions  used in measuring the actuarial  value  of
projected  benefit  obligations  and  determining  the   net
periodic pension credit were:

                                             1995     1994

Defined  Contribution Pension Plans:  From April 1, 1991  to
December   31,  1993,  the  Company  sponsored   a   defined
contribution retirement plan covering salaried employees who
met   minimum   age  and  length  of  service  requirements.
Contributions were based on salaries and length of  service.
The  Company  also  sponsors a Section 401(k)  tax  deferred
savings  plan  which  covers  salaried  employees  who  meet
minimum  age  and  length of service requirements.  Matching
contributions  are based on employee contributions  and  are
limited  to  one-half  of the first  3%  of  the  employee's
compensation.   Effective  January  1,  1994,  the   defined
contribution  retirement plan was merged  into  the  Section
401(k)   tax   deferred   savings   plan.    No   additional
contributions  will  be  made to  the  defined  contribution
retirement  plan.  Benefits earned under the Section  401(k)
tax  deferred savings plan remain unchanged.  The  aggregate
amount charged to expense for these plans was $1,578, $1,653
and $6,933 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Postretirement  Benefit Plan:  Employees retiring  from  the
Company  and  eligible  for an immediate  benefit  from  the
retirement plans (generally age 55 with 15 years of service)
are  eligible  to  continue their current medical  insurance
coverage into retirement.  The medical benefits continue  to
be  subject  to  the deductibles, copayment  provisions  and
other  limitations.  Retirees pay for a portion of the total
cost  of  their  medical insurance and  starting  with  1993
retirements, the portion of the total cost will be dependent
on  the  individual's total Company service  at  retirement.
The medical plans of the Company are funded on a pay-as-you-
go basis.
The following table sets forth the funded status of the plan
and  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  Company's  financial
statements at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and for  the  years
then ended:

      benefit obligation                              $  1,371     $ 1,186
The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
computed using an assumed weighted average discount rate  of
7.5%  in  1995 and 8.5% in 1994.  The healthcare cost  trend
rate  was assumed to be 11% in 1995 decreasing by 1% a  year
to 6% in 2000 and 5.5% in 2001 and beyond.

Employee  benefit  plan  obligations  are  determined  using
actuarial   estimates.   These  estimates   are   based   on
historical information along with certain assumptions  about
future  events.   Changes in those assumptions  as  well  as
changes in actual experience could cause these estimates  to
change within the next year.

11.  Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The  Company  has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership  Plan
(ESOP)  for  salaried  employees who meet  minimum  age  and
length  of  service  requirements.  To fund  the  ESOP,  the
Company  originally  borrowed  $18,092.   Proceeds  of  this
borrowing  were loaned to the ESOP, which purchased  850,000
shares of Series B convertible preferred stock.

Eligible employees are allocated the Series B stock over the
term  of the ten-year ESOP loan as the loan is repaid.   The
allocated  shares  vest after five  years  of  service.   At
December  31, 1995, the number of allocated and  unallocated
shares were 425,551 and 423,009, respectively.

The  Series B stock is callable, in whole or in part, at the
option  of the Company at a price per share expressed  as  a
percentage  of the issue price of $21.29.  At the  Company's
option, the call may be satisfied by common shares, cash  or
a  combination thereof.  The call price was 112% in 1995 and
decreases  to 100% by 1999.  The trustee may, at  any  time,
convert  each  share of Series B stock  into  one  share  of
common stock.

Prior to the retirement of the ESOP debt, employees can only
redeem  their vested preferred shares upon death or  age  70
1/2.   Once  the debt is retired, shares can be redeemed  at
retirement, termination or death.  The redemption  value  is
established  at  the  end  of each year  by  an  independent
appraiser.  The latest appraised value, dated March 7, 1996,
was  $18.50  per preferred share.  At the Company's  option,
redemption by an employee may be satisfied by common shares,
cash or a combination thereof.

The  preferred stockholders are entitled to the same  voting
rights as the holders of common shares.

The  loan  to the ESOP is on the same terms as the Company's
bank  loan.   The  ESOP will repay the loan (plus  interest)
with  proceeds  from  the quarterly dividends  paid  on  the
allocated  and  unallocated Series B stock and contributions
from  the Company.  All contributions to the ESOP in  excess
of dividends are treated as compensation expense.

Compensation expense and interest income for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were:

                           1995    1994    1993
Compensation expense       $589    $412    $340
Interest income            $622    $546    $509

The  interest income earned by the Company on the ESOP  loan
offsets  the  interest  expense  incurred  on  the  original
borrowing, with no impact on the results of operations.

12.  Stockholders' Equity
On  July 20, 1992, the Company sold Karl Steiner Holding  AG
(Steiner)   9,000  shares  of  Series  C  8.5%   convertible
preferred   stock  and  6,000  shares  of  Series   D   8.5%
convertible preferred stock for a total of $15,000.  On July
22,  1992,  the  Series D stock was exchanged  for  an  8.5%
convertible debenture due in 1997 in the principal amount of
$6,000 (Note 6).

The  Series C stock is convertible into 1,000,000 shares  of
common  stock or can be exchanged for 9,000 shares of Series
E  8.5%  convertible preferred stock (which is substantially
identical   to   the   Series  C   stock,   except   as   to
transferability and election of directors).   The  debenture
is convertible into 6,000 shares of Series D stock, which is
convertible into 600,000 shares of common stock.  The Series
C  stock has, and the Series D and Series E stock will have,
a   liquidation  preference  of  $1,000  per  share  and   a
cumulative  dividend preference of $85 per share  per  year.
At  their option, the holders of the Series C, Series D  and
Series  E  stock will have the right to convert  either  the
full amount or a partial percentage into common stock.

While  the Series C stockholders own securities constituting
(on  an  as-converted basis) more than 10% of the  Company's
outstanding  common  stock, on a fully  diluted  basis,  the
Series  C stockholders have the right to elect, as a  class,
between one and three directors, depending on the percentage
of  the  outstanding stock owned.  Holders of Series  D  and
Series  E  stock, and Series C stock (except when  they  are
entitled to elect at least one director as a class), vote on
an  as-converted  basis as though they  held  common  stock.
Holders of Series C or Series D stock also have the right to
elect  a director if the Company is six quarters or more  in
arrears in paying dividends.

In  connection with the purchase of the Company's securities
by  Steiner, the Company executed an agreement providing the
Company  and  Steiner with certain rights,  obligations  and
options which terminate on June 30, 2002, unless extended.

Under this agreement, Steiner has the right of first refusal
in  some  instances with regard to sales by the  Company  of
more  than five percent of its stock.  In addition,  if  the
Company   issues   additional  stock   or   convertible   or
exchangeable  securities, Steiner will have  the  option  in
some  instances to purchase similar securities to the extent
necessary to maintain its percentage ownership.

If the Company issues, in a transaction or related series of
transactions,  common stock or convertible  or  exchangeable
securities   totaling  at  least  15%   of   the   Company's
outstanding  common  stock, on a fully  diluted  basis,  the
Series C stock will be redeemable during a 30-day period  at
its  liquidation  preference  plus  accrued  or  accumulated
dividends, unless the holders of two-thirds of the Series  C
stock approve the transaction.

The  Company  has a right of first refusal  with  regard  to
sales  or  transfers  of the Company's securities  owned  by
Steiner constituting more than five percent of the Company's
outstanding  common  stock, on a fully  diluted  basis.   In
addition,  the  Company  has the option  to  repurchase  the
Company's  securities owned by Steiner,  upon  a  change  in
control in the ownership of Steiner.

If  the price of the Company's common stock is below $7  for
at least 20 consecutive trading days (or if the agreement is
not  extended),  Steiner may require the Company  either  to
find a buyer (which may be the Company) for all of Steiner's
holdings (or all its holdings except the debenture or Series
D  stock), or to sell Steiner additional common stock  equal
to  Steiner's existing holdings on an as-converted basis, at
a price selected by Steiner which is not higher than 115% of
the market price of the Company's common stock.  The Company
will  not decide until it knows the terms on which it is  to
find  a  buyer  for Steiner's holdings or  to  sell  Steiner
additional common stock, which of the two options  it  would
elect.

13.  Commitments and Contingencies
The  Company (as lessee) leases office space under operating
leases having remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess
of one year. Rental expense for the years ended December 31,
1995,  1994 and 1993 amounted to $9,438, $9,254 and  $9,779,
respectively.   Future  minimum  rental  payments   are   as
follows:

           1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    Thereafter
         $7,936  $6,988  $6,260  $5,595  $5,108     $13,368

The  Company  (as lessor) has operating leases with  tenants
that  provide for fixed minimum rent and reimbursement of  a
portion   of   operating   costs.   Additional   rents   for
reimbursements included in rental income amounted  to  $285,
$373, and $390 for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Tenant  leases on commercial office and mixed-use properties
have  terms  of  up to ten years, and leases on  residential
properties  generally  have  terms  of  one  year  or  less.
Minimum future rental revenue from non-cancelable leases  in
effect at December 31, 1995 are as follows:

           1996     1997    1998    1999    2000    Thereafter
         $7,036   $5,401  $4,404  $3,546  $2,649     $15,676  

The  Company has jointly and severally guaranteed completion
of  an $105,400 construction contract which was entered into
by Turner Steiner International SA, in which the Company has
a 50% interest.  The Company has also guaranteed $2,750 of a
$5,000 letter of credit facility and $275 of a $500 line  of
credit facility of Turner Steiner International SA.

In   connection  with  the  sale  of  certain   assets   and
liabilities of a construction subsidiary, the Company agreed
to  guaranty  or  otherwise indemnify  their  surety  up  to
$15,000  in  obtaining bonds in excess  of  $45,000  through
December 31, 1997.

The  Company  has  also guaranteed up to $500  of  a  credit
facility  of  a  supplier of materials  to  certain  of  its
contracts.

The  Company  owns certain buildings, hangars and  equipment
and  is the ground lessee on the underlying land located  at
an   air  industrial  park.   The  Company  has  leased  the
buildings,  hangars, equipment and land to a  tenant  for  a
term of 15 years expiring in 2010.  Rental income under this
lease  represented 23%, 37% and 33% of total  rental  income
for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company is a defendant in various litigation incident to
its business.  In some instances the amounts sought are very
substantial,  including some which are proceeding  to  trial
involving  substantial  claims and counterclaims.   Although
the   outcome   of  litigation  cannot  be  predicted   with
certainty, in the opinion of management based on  the  facts
known at this time, the resolution of such litigation is not
anticipated  to  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the
financial position or results of operations of the  Company.
As  these matters continue to proceed through the litigation
process  to  ultimate resolution, it is reasonably  possible
that  the Company's estimation of the effect of such matters
could change within the next year.

16.  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The  following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of each class of financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amount of cash  and
cash  equivalents approximates fair value due to the  short-
term maturity of these amounts.
Marketable   Securities:   The  fair  value  of   marketable
securities  is  based  on  quoted  market  prices  for  such
investments.   Marketable securities are  reported  at  fair
value.

Construction  Receivables  and Construction  Payables:   The
carrying amount of construction receivables and construction
payables  approximate fair value as these amounts  generally
are due or payable within the Company's operating cycle.

Notes  Payable:  The fair value of notes payable secured  by
real estate properties is estimated based on discounting the
future  cash  flows at the Company's year-end, risk-adjusted
incremental  borrowing rate for a similar  debt  instrument,
given the underlying value of the loan collateral.

The fair value of unsecured notes payable is estimated based
on   the   Company's  year-end,  risk-adjusted   incremental
borrowing rate for similar liabilities.

At  December  31,  1995 and 1994, the fair  value  of  notes
payable was $90,383 and $99,064, respectively.
Convertible  Debenture:  The fair value of  the  convertible
debenture is estimated based on the greater of the Company's
year-end,  risk-adjusted incremental borrowing  rate  for  a
similar  debt instrument, or the value of the debt  assuming
conversion at the year-end stock price, which would  reflect
the  probability  of  conversion by  the  debt  holder.   At
December  31, 1995 and 1994, the fair value was  $6,193  and
$5,700, respectively.

ESOP Loan Receivable:  The fair value of the loan receivable
from  the ESOP is estimated based on the fair value  of  the
Company's borrowing to fund the ESOP.  At December 31,  1995
and   1994,   the  fair  value  was  $8,914   and   $10,714,
respectively.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements:  The Company uses unleveraged
interest  rate  swaps to provide fixed  interest  rates  for
selected periods of time on certain outstanding loans  (Note
6).   Cash  settlements on the swaps occur monthly  and  are
recorded  as  an adjustment to interest expense.   The  fair
value  of  the  interest rate swap agreements  is  estimated
based on the discounted value of the difference between  the
fixed  payments on the swap and the payments that  would  be
required  at  current  market  fixed  rates  for  a  similar
financial  instrument.  The fair value of the interest  rate
swap  asset was $65 and $869 at December 31, 1995 and  1994,
respectively.

Responsibilities for Financial Reporting:
The  management  of  The  Turner  Corporation  and
Subsidiaries has the responsibility for  preparing
the accompanying consolidated financial statements
and  for  their  integrity and  objectivity.   The
financial  statements were prepared in  accordance
with   generally  accepted  accounting  principles
applied   on  a  consistent  basis  and  are   not
misstated  due  to material error or  fraud.   The
financial  statements  include  amounts  that  are
based   on   management's   best   estimates   and
judgments.   Management also  prepared  the  other
information   in   the  annual   report   and   is
responsible for its accuracy and consistency  with
the financial statements.

The  fair  presentation of the Company's financial
position, results of operations and cash flows are
reported on by the independent public accountants,
Arthur  Andersen  LLP (see Report  of  Independent
Public Accountants) for each of the three years in
the  period  ended December 31, 1995.   Management
has  made available to Arthur Andersen LLP all  of
the  Company's financial records and related data,
as  well  as  the  minutes  of  stockholders'  and
directors'   meetings.   Furthermore,   management
believes  that all representations made to  Arthur
Andersen  LLP  during  its audit  were  valid  and
appropriate.

To fulfill the responsibility for the reporting of
financial results, management maintains  a  system
of  accounting  and internal controls.  Management
has  operational  and financial personnel  perform
procedures to provide assurance of compliance with
controls  and policies.  In addition,  based  upon
management's   assessment  of  risk,  operational,
financial  and  special reviews are  performed  by
contracted  auditors to monitor the  effectiveness
of  selected controls.  Management seeks to assure
the  quality  of  financial reporting  by  careful
selection   and   training  of   supervisory   and
management  personnel, by organization  structures
that   provide   an   appropriate   division    of
responsibility, and by communication of accounting
and  business  policies and procedures  throughout
the  Company.   Management believes  the  internal
accounting  controls  in  use  provide  reasonable
assurance   that   the   Company's   assets    are
safeguarded,  that transactions  are  executed  in
accordance  with management's authorizations,  and
that  the financial records are reliable  for  the
purpose  of  preparing financial  statements.   In
addition,  the Company has distributed a statement
of its policies for conducting business affairs in
a  lawful and ethical manner and receives  reports
of compliance annually.

The   Board   of  Directors,  through  the   Audit
Committee  of  the  Board,  meets  separately  and
jointly  with management, the contracted  auditors
and  the  independent  public  accountants  on   a
periodic  basis  to  assure itself  that  each  is
carrying out its responsibilities.
