                                     PART I
Item 1.         Business.

     The Turner Corporation (the "company") is a holding company that
is engaged together with its subsidiaries in general building
construction and construction management in the United States and
abroad and in real estate investment in the United States.  The Turner
Corporation establishes general policy direction, coordination and
planning, and provides cash management, internal accounting control
and other management services for its operating subsidiaries.

   Due to economic conditions generally, and to factors specifically
affecting the commercial real estate market, beginning in 1989, there
was a significant slowdown in commercial construction.  In an effort
to minimize the effects of this slowdown, during the last several
years, the company's construction subsidiaries increased their focus
on municipal, institutional, public, justice and amusement (i.e.,
hospital, university, aviation, aquariums, arenas and similar)
projects.  Approximately 55% in dollar value of the contracts awarded
to the construction subsidiaries in 1993 were in this area.

   During 1993, plans were developed to significantly reduce the
company's future operating costs and expenses and to improve
productivity.  This restructuring program principally involves a
reduction in the number of staff, plus the consolidation of offices
and facilities and the reorganization of support functions.  This
program will be implemented in 1994 and is expected to be completed in
1995.

   During the early 1980's, the company acquired and developed a
number of properties.  In 1987, the Company decided to discontinue its
property development activities and began trying to dispose of the
properties it owned.

   During 1993, the company sold three real estate properties and a
number of condominium units for $23.5 million which was essentially
the carrying amount of the properties on the company's books.  While
the company continues to seek purchasers for its real estate
properties, it is unlikely it will be able to dispose of its
properties in their entirety until there are more stable market
conditions in the areas in which the company's properties are located.

   Financial information about the registrant's operations in its
construction and real estate segments appear in the consolidated
financial statements and in footnote 15 on page 34 in Part II, Item 8
of this report.

   At December 31, 1993, The Turner Corporation and subsidiaries
employed approximately 2,500 staff employees, of which 1,400 held
supervisory positions and 1,100 held non-supervisory positions.
Construction Business.
     The Turner Corporation's construction business is conducted by a
number of construction subsidiaries (together, "Turner Construction").
Turner Construction is engaged primarily in the construction of
commercial and multi-family residential buildings, manufacturing and
research facilities, hospitals, correctional facilities, stadiums and
other entertainment facilities, airports and other structures.  Also,
it has a division which does interior work, such as building-out
office space.  Turner Construction normally does not build roads,
dams, or similar infrastructure elements.  Turner Construction
primarily acts as a general building contractor or as a construction
manager.  However, Turner Construction also sometimes acts as a
consultant to owners and others.

    Although Turner Construction is a nationwide (and to a lesser
extent, worldwide) construction firm, Turner Construction attempts to
compete locally in major cities of the United States through
essentially self-contained regional offices and partially self-
contained branch offices.  Its effort is to be a major builder in each
city or region in which it has an office.

    The Turner Corporation's principal construction subsidiary is
Turner Construction Company.  Universal Construction Co., Inc., The
Lathrop Company Inc., and Turner Caribe Inc., wholly-owned subsidiary
companies of The Turner Corporation or Turner Construction Company,
are also engaged in construction activities in the United States
principally in the Southeast, Midwest and Puerto Rico.  BFW
Construction Co., Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
through June 30, 1993 and was engaged in construction activities in
the Southwest.

     When it acts as a general building contractor, Turner
Construction normally undertakes to construct a project and is paid
the entire price for the completed project.  Most aspects of the
construction, however, are performed by subcontractors who are paid by
Turner Construction.  The functions actually performed by Turner
Construction are the planning and scheduling of a construction
project, the procurement of materials, the marshalling of the manpower
required for the project, the awarding of subcontracts and the
direction and management of the construction operation.  During 1993,
1992, and 1991 general building contracting activities represented
69%, 78%, and 83% respectively of Turner Construction's value of work
completed.

     Turner Construction makes extensive use of specialty contractors
(such as structural steel contractors, electrical contractors and
plumbing contractors) as subcontractors in the performance of its
construction contracts.  The extent to which work is performed by
workmen on its own payroll varies with the location of a particular
project and is largely dependent on the availability of experienced
subcontractors in a particular area.  Work performed by Turner
Construction is generally limited to temporary facilities, foundation,
concrete, masonry and carpentry work.

     In its performance of construction management services, Turner
Construction, for a fee, monitors and coordinates the progress of the
work done by specialty contractors who are employed directly by the
owner to build the project.  During 1993, 1992 and 1991 management
construction services and consulting represented 31%, 22% and 17%,
respectively, of Turner Construction's value of work completed.
Construction management contracts involve less risk than do projects
in which Turner Construction is a general building contractor.
However, the profit from construction management contracts can be
substantially less than that which Turner Construction can earn when
it acts as a general building contractor.

     Construction contracts include lump sum or fixed price contracts,
cost-plus fixed fee contracts and variations thereof including cost-
plus guaranteed total contracts.  The majority of Turner
Construction's business involves negotiated contracts.  The remainder
of its contracts are secured by competitive bidding.

   Turner International Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries were
engaged in construction activities during 1993 in the United Kingdom,
Kuwait, Taiwan and other foreign countries.

    The company is also a partner with Karl Steiner Holding AG
("Steiner") of Switzerland in a joint venture by the name of Turner
Steiner International S.A., which renders general building
construction and construction consulting services outside Turner
Construction's and Steiner's respective home markets.

     The United States building construction industry is intensely
competitive and Turner Construction Company and the other domestic
construction subsidiaries compete with other major contractors as well
as with small contractors.  Competition in the industry takes on a
number of forms, including fee levels, quality of service and degree
of risk assumption.  Construction companies can expand their
operations rapidly and each large population center generally has a
number of medium-sized building contractors accustomed to undertaking
all but the largest and most complicated projects.  Through its
organizational structure of permanently established decentralized
branch offices and subsidiaries, Turner Construction competes directly
with those locally based contractors.  Year-to-year operations may be
adversely affected by general economic conditions which are
unfavorable for business and industry.  Exact statistical data is not
available for determining the relative size of construction companies,
however, based on the contract value of construction contracts
received in 1993 and published industry data, Turner Construction
believes that it is one of the largest building contractors operating
principally within the United States.

     A portion of the company's construction activity is performed
under  payment and performance bonds obtained through bonding capacity
from its sureties.  Projects requiring surety bonds are usually either
publicly funded or private projects, which often require FHA - type
mortgage insurance.  While the company's sureties limit the amount of
new payment and performance bonds available, this limitation did not
significantly restrict the company's ability to secure new work.
There could be certain circumstances, however, when this limitation
could influence the company's selection of prospective projects to
pursue.

     At December 31, 1993, the anticipated earnings associated with
backlog from work to be completed under construction, construction
management and construction consulting contracts and under awards
believed to be firm but not yet confirmed by signed formal contracts
was $91.8 million.  The anticipated earnings from work to be completed
on  contracts and awards at December 31, 1992 was $96.6 million.
Approximately 49% of the December 31, 1993 earnings backlog from
construction contracts relates to work expected to be performed during
1995 and beyond.  The backlog is important to long-range planning and
continuity of work for the company's permanent staff.  However,
anticipated earnings from construction contracts cannot and should not
be used as the basis of predictions with respect to future net income.

     The anticipated value of work to be completed under construction,
construction management and construction consulting contracts and
under awards believed to be firm but not yet confirmed by signed
formal contracts was $4.66 billion at December 31, 1993.  The
anticipated value of work to be completed on contracts and awards at
December 31, 1992 was $5.09 billion.  Approximately 53% of the
December 31, 1993 construction backlog is expected to be completed
during 1995 and beyond.

     Value of construction completed represents the cost of work put
in place and materials fabricated during the year and related earnings
pursuant to construction and construction management contracts,
together with fees and reimbursed expenses from consulting contracts.
It is essentially a measure of construction activity during the year
rather than "sales" or "revenues" in the sense that those terms are
used in other industries.

     Because of the varying proportion of construction, construction
management and construction consulting work, the impact of inflation
on the value of construction completed, changes in anticipated
earnings from construction contracts and anticipated value of work
completed will not necessarily be correlative.

     At December 31, 1993, Turner Construction employed approximately
2,400 staff employees, of whom about 1,320 were executives, project
managers, superintendents, engineers, purchasing agents, estimators,
senior accountants and other supervisory personnel.  In addition,
Turner Construction employs foremen and building craftsmen for
construction work which has not been subcontracted to specialty
contractors.  During 1993, approximately 3,300 foremen and building
craftsmen were employed at various times.

Real Estate.

    The Company's subsidiaries involved in real estate operations are
Rickenbacker Holdings, Inc. ("RHI"), and Turner Development
Corporation and  subsidiaries ("TDC").  Turner Construction also has
certain real estate holdings, either directly or through joint venture
interests, which are currently being marketed.  These holdings relate
to residential condominium developments in Boston and Puerto Rico.

     From 1980 to 1987, TDC engaged in real estate development in the
United States, principally in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan and
Virginia.  TDC developed and marketed office buildings and other
commercial and residential properties, principally in metropolitan
suburban areas.

     TDC essentially discontinued new development activity in 1987.
It is attempting to sell land parcels previously held for development
as well as certain developed projects.  At December 31, 1993, TDC
owned properties in seven states.

     TDC's development projects were financed principally by
construction and mortgage loans.  TDC is attempting to market projects
to institutional and other investors in commercial real estate.  In
connection with sales of projects, TDC may be required to guarantee
levels of occupancy and rentals for limited periods.

     Turner Medical Building Services ("TMBS") is engaged in project
consulting and development services for ancillary medical and other
health care facilities.  Its principal clients are hospitals,
physician group practice clinics, nursing home and life care sponsors.
TMBS provides  management of architectural and construction services.
TMBS subcontracts the design and construction of its projects.

     At December 31, 1993, TDC (including Turner Medical Building
Services) had 4 employees, of whom 3 were management, marketing and
other supervisory personnel.

     RHI owns and leases an air cargo distribution facility located at
the Rickenbacker Airport in Columbus, Ohio.  It is attempting to
market fifteen hundred acres of an adjacent property.  It has one
principal tenant of the facility whose lease expires in 1996.  Unless
RHI is able to extend the lease or replace the tenant, its earnings
will be adversely affected.

Item 2.         Properties.

     The Company's executive offices and offices of subsidiary
companies are located in leased facilities in commercial office
buildings, except for Universal Construction Co., Inc., which owns a
small office building in which its offices are located.  The company's
corporate headquarters and New York branch office are in 100,000
square feet of space which is leased until 2005.  Rental expense for
this space during 1993 was $2,140,000.  Each construction project has
temporary field offices.

     Turner Construction operates three equipment and storage yards,
located in Newark, New Jersey, Cincinnati, Ohio and St. Louis,
Missouri for the storage and repair of its construction tools and
equipment.  Turner Construction owns the Ohio storage and repair yards
and leases the New Jersey, and Missouri facilities.  Universal
Construction Co., Inc., owns a yard, while The Lathrop Company, Inc.,
leases yards for the storage and repair of construction equipment.

     Turner Construction leases major construction equipment such as
hoists, cranes and personnel lifts from equipment suppliers for use on
particular projects and generally owns only small tools and other
miscellaneous equipment; Universal Construction Co., Inc., and The
Lathrop Company, Inc. each own construction equipment, earth-moving
equipment and small tools.

     TDC holds as an investment a wholly-owned apartment complex which
it had previously developed, located in Orlando, Florida (200 units).
This property is encumbered by a mortgage note payable.

     RHI owns certain buildings and air cargo handling equipment at
the Rickenbacker Airport in Columbus, Ohio, which collateralize
related revenue bonds.

Item 3.         Legal Proceedings.

     The company is a defendant in various routine litigations
incident to its business.  While in some instances the amounts sought
are very substantial, and  certain parties are withholding amounts
included in construction receivables pending the outcome of the
litigation, in the opinion of management the resolution of such
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or results of operations of the company.

Item 4.         Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Item 5.         Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related
Stockholder Matters.
              
          The Turner Corporation common stock is listed on the

Item 7.         Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Results of Operations 1993 vs. 1992
The company reported a net loss of $6.2 million in 1993 or $1.55 per
common share compared to net income of $4.0 million in 1992 or $0.50
per common share.  This change is primarily attributable to provisions
for restructuring charges in 1993 of $5.6 million and real estate
valuation adjustments in 1993 of $4.0 million, both net of tax.  Also
1992's net income included a non-recurring extraordinary gain of $.3
million from the extinguishment of debt and a gain of $1.5 million due
to the cumulative effect of an accounting change, both net of tax.

Gross earnings declined 9.4 percent from 1992 to $59.4 million
primarily due to a decline in construction earnings and an increase in
the real estate loss due to the valuation adjustments noted above.

General and administrative expenses also increased 26 percent
primarily due to increased interest costs associated with corporate
credit facilities and costs incurred in implementing the company's
"Total Quality Management" program.

1993's results are more fully described in the discussion that
follows.

Construction:
Earnings from construction for 1993 were $67.4 million or 7.8 percent
less than 1992.  Despite a 4.7 percent increase in construction
completed, earnings from construction contracts declined, due in part
to the continuing soft market and to more intense competition that has
put pressure on fees from work secured over the last two years.  In
addition, provisions were made for certain contract disputes that are
expected to be concluded in future periods.

The nature of the company's construction activity has also shifted in
recent years, resulting in a significant increase in construction
management contracts which represented 25 percent of the value of
construction completed in 1993 as opposed to 17 percent in 1992 and 11
percent in 1991.  While this type of contract normally involves lower
risk than other types of construction contracts it also typically
carries lower fees than other types of contracts.  Therefore, the
increasing frequency of construction management contracts has
contributed to the decline in the profitability ratio (construction
earnings divided by value of construction completed).

The value of new contracts secured in 1993 was $2.67 billion, down 15
percent from 1992.  The reduction in sales is a result of a continuing
soft market and more intense competition.  The sales increase that had
been experienced in 1992 by focusing on selected markets was not
repeated in 1993 due to the increased competition in these markets;
however, the commercial markets began to rebound in 1993 and the
company's penetration in these markets has also improved.  In
addition, construction management sales in 1993 have declined in favor
of more traditional general contracting projects, the effects of which
should be reflected in 1994.

According to F.W. Dodge, the company's traditional non-residential
building market is expected to increase by approximately 10 percent in
1994 and management believes it is well positioned to take advantage
of this growth.

The company's sureties limit the annual amount of new payment and
performance bonds available to the company.  This limitation did not
significantly restrict the company's ability to secure new business in
1993; however, there could be certain circumstances in which it could
influence the company's selection of prospective projects.

At the end of 1993 the anticipated earnings associated with backlog
from work to be completed under contracts and awards believed to be
firm were $91.8 million, down five percent from 1992.  The backlog in
terms of value of construction to be completed declined 8.5 percent
from 1992 to $4.66 billion.  The decline in both backlog earnings and
construction volume is a reflection of the reduced sales in 1993 and
carryover of the reduced fees from contracts secured in 1992.  On
average, fees on contracts secured in 1993 were slightly higher than
fees secured in 1992, which management believes is an indication that
the decline in fees is reversing.

Approximately 49 percent of the earnings backlog and 53 percent of the
value of construction backlog relates to work to be performed in 1995
and beyond.  Estimated earnings from construction backlog cannot and
should not be used as a basis for predicting future net income.

Real Estate:
Losses from real estate operations increased 6 percent from 1992 to
$8.1 million.  While operating costs were reduced in 1993 due to the
sale of properties, the outsourcing of property management operations,
and reduced interest costs, an additional valuation provision of $6.0
million was charged to real estate operations in 1993 as a reserve
against asset values in relation to their carrying value.

The company's real estate portfolio is carried at estimated net
realizable value or at cost, as applicable.  During 1993 the company
sold three properties and certain condominium units at their
approximate carrying value.

Management believes that the timing of future sales will depend upon
achieving reasonable values under more stable market conditions which
the company estimates may take up to two years for the developed
properties and a more prolonged period for the undeveloped land
parcels.

Until conditions in the real estate market improve to the point that
will permit the company to conduct real estate transactions, the
company will continue to review the asset values of the unsold
properties in relation to prospective net realizable value and make
adjustments as necessary.

As part of a transaction in 1986 in which the company acquired the
development rights to the 1,600-acre Rickenbacker Air Industrial Park,
the company entered into a lease, as lessor, for a 100-acre site for a
term of 10 years.  Under the original term of the lease agreement, the
company may continue to experience losses of approximately $.5 million
per year, before taxes, primarily due to depreciation charges relating
to the facility's buildings and equipment.  These losses do not have a
significant impact on the company's cash flow.  The company is
currently negotiating with the tenant to renew the lease when it
expires in 1996.  Unless the company is able to extend the lease or
replace the tenant, expiration of the lease will adversely affect the
company's earnings.

Operating and General and Administrative Expenses:
Recognizing the ongoing decline in its traditional markets and the
reduced profitability from work secured, the company has taken steps
to reduce its future expense base.  In the fourth quarter the company
recorded an $8.5 million ($5.6 million after tax) provision for
restructuring.  The provision included estimated expenses required to
implement the company's plan to consolidate certain support functions
company-wide and to scale down operations in shrinking geographic
markets.  These measures were taken to streamline operations and
improve profitability and the company expects that they will begin to
benefit financial performance in the later periods of 1994 with the
full impact being felt in 1995 and thereafter.  The benefits are
expected to come from reduced staff and staff support costs.

In total, operating and general and administrative expenses increased
2.3 percent to $59.8 million in 1993 exclusive of the restructuring
charge noted above.  The majority of the change reflects an increase
in interest costs associated with corporate credit facilities, costs
incurred in implementing the company's "Total Quality Management"
program which was put in place in most of the company's business units
in 1993 and an increase in the company's employee benefit expenses.

Operating expenses for construction and real estate operating expenses
continued to decline due to the benefit of a full year of cost
reduction programs put into effect in prior years.

Other Income:
In 1993 the company recorded other losses of $.9 million down from
$2.9 million in 1992.  The other losses are primarily associated with
the investment in Turner Steiner International S.A. (TSI), which
resulted in a $3.0 million loss to the company in 1993 compared to a
$1.7 million loss in 1992.  This foreign investment continues to
operate at a loss as it establishes itself in markets in Europe, the
Middle East and the Far East.  Work has been secured in all three
markets and TSI is expected to approach profitability in the latter
part of 1994.  In 1992 other losses also included an investment in
other overseas operations which was sold in 1993. The 1993 losses were
partially offset by gains recorded from the company's investments in
marketable securities.

Income Taxes:
In 1993 the company derived a net tax benefit of 37 percent of the pre-
tax loss.  In 1992 the provision for income taxes amounted to 44
percent of pre-tax income.  The difference is primarily attributable
to a minimum state and local tax obligation not associated with
operating results.

The company has recorded $16.8 million of deferred tax assets having
resulted principally from net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Management believes that no valuation allowance is
required for these assets due to available tax planning strategies
primarily related to the company's pension plan.

Fourth Quarter 1993 Compared to Third Quarter 1993:
Results for the fourth quarter of 1993 amounted to a net loss of $9.0
million or $1.83 per common share compared to net income of $.9
million or $0.09 per common share recorded in the third quarter.  A
significant amount of the fourth quarter results were attributable to
the restructuring charge and the real estate valuation charge noted
above.

Fourth quarter construction operations reported value of construction
completed of $715.1 million and operating income of $5.8 million
compared to $735.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively in the third
quarter.  The decline in fourth quarter performance is attributable to
projects winding down in the latter part of the year which have been
replaced by new work scheduled to start after the first quarter of
1994.

Exclusive of the valuation charge, real estate operating losses
decreased by 33 percent from the third to the fourth quarter.
Essentially this improvement was attributable to reduced costs due to
the sale of properties.
Operating and general and administrative expenses, exclusive of the
restructuring charge, increased 7 percent from the third quarter
primarily due to the reduction in construction activity noted above
which resulted in a reduction in the amount of staff costs chargeable
to projects.

In the fourth quarter of 1993 the company recorded a $1.1 million
other loss compared to $.4 million of other income recorded in the
third quarter.  The positive results in the third quarter reflected
gains on the sale of marketable securities most of which were recorded
in that period.  The losses in the fourth quarter were mostly
attributable to the TSI results.

1992 Compared to 1991:
The company reported net income of $4.0 million in 1992 compared with
$11.3 million in 1991.  However, the 1991 net income was due entirely
to a $29.9 million gain from curtailment of a pension plan.  The 1992
results were primarily due to improved performance in both the
construction and real estate segments of the company's operations, as
well as reductions in operating and overhead expenses.  Included in
1992's results was a $1.7 million net loss associated with the
investment in Turner Steiner International S.A. which was charged to
Other Income.

Construction earnings increased by $4.4 million due to improved
earnings on work carried over from prior years.  Losses from real
estate operations decreased by $3.1 million, primarily due to improved
operating results and declining interest rates.  Operating and general
and administrative expenses decreased by $10.4 million due to the
company's continued cost containment efforts which had begun in prior
years.  In 1992 the company also recorded an extraordinary gain of $.3
million from the extinguishment of debt and a gain of $1.5 million due
to the cumulative effect of an accounting change, both net of tax.

Financial Condition:
In total, the company recorded a decrease in cash and cash equivalents
in 1993 of $12.8 million or 33 percent from 1992, primarily related to
the paydown of real estate debt.

Operating activities provided positive cash flows of $8.5 million
primarily associated with construction profitability.  The charges for
restructuring and real estate valuation had no cash impact in 1993.
Much of the restructuring charge is expected to be expended in the
first two quarters of 1994 and management believes that cash provided
from operations, its revolving credit facility and its short-term
borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund the expenditures.

Cash flows provided by investing activities amounted to $5.5 million
and were due primarily to the funds received from the sale of real
estate properties.  The company also invested $6.5 million in a
condominium project in Boston which is expected to be substantially
sold by the end of 1994.  Cash flows used in financing activities
amounted to $26.9 million, primarily attributed to the paydown of debt
associated with the real estate properties sold.

Management believes the company's cash flows from construction
backlog, its $40 million revolving credit facility and amounts
available from overnight credit facilities will be sufficient to
support the company's operations.  Debt maturing in 1994 will be paid
from funds generated from operations or will be refinanced prior to
its actual maturity date.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
As described in Note 16 to the financial statements, certain financial
instruments have fair values which differ from their carrying amounts.
The difference in the values related on Notes payable reflect current
favorable interest rates and terms, given the underlying value of the
loan collateral.

Inflation:
Inflation and changing prices during the current fiscal year have not
significantly affected the major markets in which the company conducts
its business.  Domestically, prices have remained relatively stable.
In view of the moderate rate of inflation, its impact on the company's
business has not been significant.

Investments in Equity Securities:
In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" which mandates that debt
and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity
securities or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale
securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.  The Statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1993, and is to be initially applied as
of the beginning of an enterprise's fiscal year.  The company's
investment in marketable securities would be classified as available-
for-sale.  The company will adopt the standard at the beginning of
1994 and management believes that the impact will not be material to
the financial statements.

To The Turner Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
Turner Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993.  These financial
statements and the schedules referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As further discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has significant interests in real estate
properties which are carried at the lower of cost or estimated net
realizable value.  The financial statements do not purport to present
these real estate interests at their current market value or
liquidation value, which may be less than the carrying amounts
presented.  The Company's management presently intends to hold these
real estate interests until they can be sold for prices which they
believe reflect reasonable values under more stable market conditions.
Management expects to dispose of their interests in the developed
properties for those prices generally within the next two years, and
to hold the undeveloped land parcels for a longer period of time.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all materials respects, the financial position of The
Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions.  As also
discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of
accounting for amortizing unrecognized pension actuarial gains and
losses for the defined benefit pension plan.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedules listed in the
index to the financial statements are presented for the purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are
not part of the basic financial statements.  These schedules have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

THE TURNER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except share amounts)

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles  of  Consolidation:  The consolidated financial  statements
include  the  accounts of The Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries  and
their  proportionate  interest in the accounts of  construction  joint
ventures   (the  company).   The  company  also  has  investments   in
affiliates and in real estate joint ventures, which are accounted  for
under  the  equity  or cost method, as appropriate.   All  significant
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.  Certain  prior
year  balances  have  been reclassified in the consolidated  financial
statements  in  order  to provide a presentation consistent  with  the
current year.

Construction Operations:  The company determines construction earnings
under  the  percentage of completion method.  Under this  method,  the
company  recognizes  as earnings that portion of  the  total  earnings
anticipated  from  a  contract which the value of the  work  completed
bears  to  the  estimated  total value of  the  work  covered  by  the
contract.   As  the company's construction contracts generally  extend
over  more  than  one year, revisions in costs and earnings  estimates
during  the course of the work are reflected in the year in which  the
facts  which  require  the revision become  known.   When  a  loss  is
forecasted for a contract, the full amount of the anticipated loss  is
recognized  in the period in which it is determined that a  loss  will
occur.  Claims are included in earnings from construction contracts at
an  amount  based  on the related contract costs when  realization  is
probable and the amount can be reliably estimated.

The  company continuously reviews estimated earnings from construction
contracts and makes necessary adjustments based on current evaluations
of  the  indicated outcome.  In 1993 and 1992, the company wrote  down
certain construction receivables and claims deemed unrecoverable.

Under certain contracts, owners of buildings make payments directly to
suppliers  and subcontractors for all or for portions of work  covered
by  the  contract.   The company considers such costs  in  determining
contract  percentage  of completion and reports such  amounts  in  the
value of construction completed.

Real  Estate Operations:  Rental income, including fixed minimum rents
and additional rents, under operating leases with tenants is generally
recognized on a contractual basis.

Profit  on sales of real estate is recognized in full when the  profit
is   determinable,  an  adequate  down  payment  has  been   received,
collectability  of  the  sales price is  reasonably  assured  and  the
earnings  process is substantially complete.  If the sales transaction
does  not  meet  these criteria, all profit or a  portion  thereof  is
deferred until such criteria are met.

The  real estate properties which are held for investment are  carried
at  cost  less  accumulated depreciation and are assessed periodically
for  impairment  based on the sum of undiscounted future  cash  flows.
All  other real estate properties and investments in real estate joint
ventures  are carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value (Note 4).

Depreciation and Amortization:  The company calculates depreciation on
property  and equipment, and on real estate primarily on the straight-
line  method.   Estimated useful lives are as follows:  buildings  and
improvements, 20-40 years; office machines and furniture, 5-10  years;
and  equipment,  10  years.  Leasehold improvements  (the  company  as
lessee)  to  property used in company operations are  amortized  on  a
straight-line  basis over the term of the lease.  Tenant  improvements
(the  company as lessor) on real estate properties are amortized on  a
straight-line  basis  over  the term of the  lease.   Maintenance  and
repairs   are   expensed  currently,  except  that  expenditures   for
betterments are capitalized.

Cash  Equivalents:   The  company considers all investments  purchased
with maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

Marketable Securities:  Marketable securities are carried at the lower
of  cost  or market. Unrealized losses on marketable securities,  held
for short term investment, are charged to expense.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.  115,  "Accounting  for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" which mandates that
debt  and  equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity
securities  or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale
securities  and  reported  at fair value, with  unrealized  gains  and
losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component  of
stockholders'  equity.   SFAS No. 115 is effective  for  fiscal  years
beginning  after December 15, 1993, and is to be initially applied  as
of  the  beginning  of  an enterprise's fiscal  year.   The  company's
investments in marketable securities would be classified as available-
for-sale.   The  company will adopt the standard at the  beginning  of
1994  and management believes that the impact will not be material  to
the financial statements.

Income  Taxes:  Prior to January 1, 1993, deferred income tax expenses
or  credits  were recorded to reflect the tax consequences  of  timing
differences between the recording of income and expenses for financial
reporting  purposes and for purposes of filing income tax  returns  in
effect when the difference arose.

Effective  January 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for  Income  Taxes."
Under  SFAS No. 109, deferred assets or liabilities are computed based
on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases
of  assets  and  liabilities  using the  enacted  marginal  tax  rate.
Deferred  income tax expenses or credits are based on the  changes  in
the  asset  or liability from period to period.  The adoption  of  the
standard   effective  January  1,  1993  was  not  material   to   the
consolidated financial statements.

The  company  does  not  provide  for U.S.  Federal  income  taxes  on
undistributed  earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries  since  it  is  the
company's intention to permanently reinvest those earnings outside the
United States.

Foreign  Currency Translation:  Assets and liabilities  of  operations
that  represent an investment in a foreign country are translated into
U.S.  dollars at exchange rates in effect at year-end, while  revenues
and  expenses  are  translated at average  exchange  rates  prevailing
during  the  year.   The resulting translation gains  and  losses  are
accumulated as a separate component of stockholders' equity.   Foreign
exchange  transaction  gains and losses are  included  in  results  of
operations during the periods in which they arise.

Earnings Per Common Share:  Primary earnings per common share is based
on  net  income  less preferred stock dividends (net of  tax  benefits
relating to Series B preferred stock) divided by the weighted  average
number  of  common  and common equivalent shares  outstanding.   Fully
diluted  earnings per common share is further adjusted to reflect  the
assumed  conversion of convertible preferred stock and the convertible
debenture,  and the elimination of the preferred stock  dividends  and
interest  expense  on  the convertible debenture,  net  of  applicable
income taxes, if such conversions are dilutive.
2.  Restructuring Charges
During  1993,  plans  were  developed  to  significantly  reduce   the
company's   future  operating  costs  and  expenses  and  to   improve
productivity.   This  restructuring  program  principally  involves  a
reduction  in the number of staff, plus the consolidation  of  offices
and  facilities  and  the reorganization of support  functions.   This
program will be implemented in 1994 and is expected to be completed in
1995.   The  results of operations for 1993 include $8,500  of  pretax
charges  ($5,600 net of tax benefits, or $1.08 per share) relating  to
this  program.   The  charges include provisions  for  severance  pay,
incentive   programs   relating   to  employee   terminations,   lease
terminations and other reorganization costs.  The restructuring charge
is  expected to be substantially expended in the first two quarters of
1994  and management believes that cash provided from operations,  its
revolving  credit facility and its short-term borrowing capacity  will
be sufficient to fund the expenditures.


3.  Construction Receivables
Due  on contracts included $106,665 of retainage at December 31, 1993.
It  is  expected  that  approximately 85% of such  retention  will  be
collected  by December 31, 1994.  At December 31, 1992, retainage  was
$115,911.  Construction receivables include estimated net claims.  The
settlement   of   the  claims  depends  on  individual  circumstances,
accordingly,  the timing of the collection will vary  and  may  extend
beyond  one year.  Those claims, primarily due to owner-caused delays,
incomplete specifications, or similar reasons, amounted to $10,800 and
$7,300 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.


4.  Real Estate
The  company  owns  a  portfolio of real estate,  either  directly  or
through  joint  venture  interests, that  includes  commercial  office
properties,   mixed-use   warehouse/service  properties,   residential
properties,  undeveloped  land,  and  certain  buildings  and  hangars
located  at  an  air  industrial park.   The  properties  are  located
throughout the United States, but primarily in the Southeast and Great
Lakes regions.  Accumulated depreciation at December 31, 1993 and 1992
was $32,710 and $31,050, respectively.

Given the current real estate market, the company has determined  that
its   interests  in  commercial  office,  mixed-use  and   residential
condominium properties, and undeveloped land parcels will be available
for  sale  when they can be sold for prices which the company believes
reflect  the  reasonable  value of the properties  under  more  stable
market conditions.  Management expects to dispose of its interests  in
commercial  office,  mixed-use and residential condominium  properties
for  those  prices  generally within the next two  years.   Given  the
current market for undeveloped land parcels, management anticipates  a
prolonged  period before land values recover.  Due to  the  relatively
low  holding  costs  of the company's undeveloped  land  parcels,  the
company  intends to and has the ability to hold the properties  for  a
longer period of time in order to achieve more reasonable prices  upon
disposition.  The carrying amounts of the company's interests in these
developed  properties were $55,609 and $54,102, and in the undeveloped
land  parcels were $30,498 and $30,964 at December 31, 1993 and  1992,
respectively.  These real estate interests are carried at the lower of
cost  or  estimated  net realizable value.  The net realizable  values
reflect  the  company's  estimates of  the  net  sales  proceeds  less
anticipated  capital expenditures through the estimated date  of  sale
and  disposal  costs, which have not been discounted  to  net  present
value.

The  company  estimates the net realizable values  by  evaluating  and
making  assumptions about future events with respect to the  property,
market  conditions and anticipated investor rates of return.  The  net
realizable  values  reflect each disposition based  on  the  company's
current  intended  holding  period, and do not  represent  liquidation
values.  Judgements regarding future events are not subject to precise
quantification  or verification and may change from time  to  time  as
economic  and  market factors, and the company's  evaluation  of  them
change, and the effects of such changes may be significant.

The  company  actively monitors market conditions and  reviews,  on  a
quarterly  basis,  the  net  realizable  values  of  its  real  estate
interests  and reduces carrying amounts when required.  On a  periodic
basis,  generally not exceeding two to three years,  the  company  has
independent appraisals performed for significant real estate interests
for  the  purpose of assisting management in determining their current
value  and the appropriate timing of disposition.  In connection  with
the  company's  review  of the carrying amounts  of  its  real  estate
interests,  additional write-downs and reserves of $6,018  and  $1,820
were  recorded  for  the  years  ended December  31,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.

Land and Building Mortgages:  Variable rate mortgages bear interest at
rates ranging from prime to prime plus 1 percent and mature in varying
installments  through 1998.  The weighted average  interest  rate  for
1993  and 1992 was approximately 6.64% and 6.87%, respectively.  Fixed
rate  mortgages  bear  interest  at 9.375%  and  are  due  in  varying
installments through 2001.

Revenue Bonds:  Adjustable rate revenue refunding bonds collateralized
by   properties  at  the  air  industrial  park  mature   in   varying
installments  through  2010.  The bonds  bear  interest  at  a  weekly
variable  rate.  The weighted average interest rate for 1993 and  1992
was  approximately  2.46%  and  2.83%, respectively.   The  bonds  are
supported  by a letter of credit for which the company pays 1.50%  per
annum.  The company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  with
a  bank  for a $15,000 notional amount providing for a fixed  interest
rate of 4.13% through December 15, 1996.

Multi-family  facility revenue bonds collateralized by  a  residential
property  were retired in 1993 upon disposition of the property.   The
bonds  bore interest at a weekly variable rate.  The weighted  average
interest  rate  for 1993 and 1992 was approximately 3.32%  and  5.81%,
respectively.

Extinguishment  of  Debt:  In December 1992, the company  restructured
certain  debt  relating to the air industrial  park.   The  previously
outstanding  revenue  bonds, which carried a fixed  interest  rate  of
8.75%  were  redeemed  at 102% of par value.  In addition,  $2,500  of
other  debt was forgiven.  Proceeds for the redemption were  primarily
provided by a series of adjustable rate revenue refunding bonds issued
in  November  1992.   The transaction resulted in a net  extraordinary
gain of $316.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):  This loan was used to fund  the
company's  loan  to  the ESOP and is payable in  varying  installments
through 1999.  Interest is payable quarterly at a variable rate  equal
to  83%  of  the prime rate or a percentage of LIBOR, at the company's
option.  The loan is collateralized by first mortgages on certain real
estate  properties  and  letters  of  credit.   The  loan  allows  for
collateral  substitution and upon disposition of such  properties  may
require additional collateral to maintain loan-to-value relationships.
The weighted average interest rate for 1993 and 1992 was approximately
3.44%  and  4.20%, respectively.  The loan agreement contains  various
covenants,   including  the  maintenance  of  a  minimum   amount   of
stockholders' equity and debt coverage ratio.  At December  31,  1993,
the minimum stockholders' equity required was $50,000 and increases by
$4,000 annually to $74,000 in 1999.

Revolving  Credit  Facility:  The company has an  unsecured  revolving
credit facility totaling $40,000, the proceeds of which are being used
for  general  corporate purposes, which expires in 1996.  The  current
facility  permits the company to choose between various interest  rate
options.   The  weighted average interest rate for 1993 and  1992  was
approximately  5.97%  and 5.49%, respectively.   The  company  pays  a
commitment fee at an annual rate of 1/2 of 1% on the unused portion of
the  facility.   The  facility contains various  covenants,  the  most
restrictive of which is a fixed-charge coverage requirement.

Convertible Debenture:  In July 1992, the company issued a $6,000 8.5%
convertible  debenture which matures in 1997.   The  company  may  not
prepay the principal balance prior to its maturity.  At the option  of
the holder, the debenture is convertible into 6,000 shares of Series D
8  1/2 percent convertible preferred stock of the company.  The holder
must  convert  the full debenture principal balance  at  the  time  of
conversion.  The Series D stock is ultimately convertible into 600,000
shares of the company's common stock and carries terms similar to  the
Series  C stock of the company, except as to the election of directors
(Note 12).

Collateralized  Credit Facility:  The facility was  collateralized  by
mortgages  on  real  estate and matured in 1993.   The  facility  bore
interest  at  prime  plus  1% or LIBOR plus  2.5%,  at  the  company's
election.   The weighted average interest rate for 1993 and  1992  was
approximately 5.70% and 6.34%, respectively.

Other:   This amount includes a bank loan for the purpose of financing
improvements to the company's offices which had an outstanding balance
of $5,000 and $8,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The
principal  is payable in semi-annual installments through  1995.   The
loan  bears  interest  at  LIBOR plus  0.25%.   The  weighted  average
interest rate for 1993 and 1992, including associated letter of credit
fees, was approximately 4.85% and 5.47%, respectively.

The  company maintains overnight credit facilities with various  banks
at  varying  rates.  The company had available $18,000,  of  which  no
amounts  were  outstanding at December 31, 1993.  The  facilities  are
subject  to  periodic  renewal from the banks and  certain  facilities
carry annual commitment fees ranging from .375% to 1%.

Aggregate maturities of notes due are as follows:

  1994   1995   1996   1997   1998    Therea
                                      fter

     0      2                    0         6

Under  the  terms  of the revolving credit facility,  the  company  is
annually required to pay down the facility for five consecutive  days.
Accordingly, any borrowings as of the end of the year are reflected as
due within one year in the above maturity table.

Interest  cost, which approximates amounts paid, for the  years  ended
December  31,  1993,  1992  and 1991 was $7,427,  $8,124  and  $9,872,
respectively.

At December 31, 1993, $87,029 of real estate was pledged as collateral
for notes payable.


7.  Income Taxes
The components of the income tax provision (benefit) are as follows:

The  income  tax provision (benefit) above consists of  the  following
components:

In  the Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31,  1992,
the  extraordinary  gain and the cumulative effect of  the  accounting
change are shown net of the related tax provision.

Deferred  income taxes result from temporary differences  between  the
financial  statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets  and
liabilities.  The source of these differences and tax effect  of  each
at  December  31, 1993 and for the years ended December 31,  1992  and
1991 are as follows:

The  company  has  recorded  $16,788 of  deferred  tax  assets  having
resulted   principally  from  net  operating  loss  and   tax   credit
carryforwards.   Management believes that no  valuation  allowance  is
required  for  those  assets due to available tax planning  strategies
related to the company's defined benefit pension plan and dispositions
of real estate assets.

A  comparison  of  the  Federal  statutory  rate  with  the  company's
effective tax rate is as follows:

Income taxes paid (refunded) were $73, $(3,397) and $(3,495) for 1993,
1992, and 1991, respectively.

For Federal income tax purposes, the company has available at December
31,  1993  a  net  operating loss carryforward  of  $19,551  which  is
available  to  offset  future taxable income  and  expires  from  2004
through  2007,  and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward  of
$2,451 which can be carried forward indefinitely.

The   unrecognized  deferred  tax  liability  related  to   cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were  permanently
reinvested was $227 at December 31, 1993.


8. Incentive Compensation Plans
The  company sponsors two incentive compensation plans.  The Executive
Incentive  Compensation Plan (EICP) authorizes payments of  awards  to
executive  officers and other designated employees of the  company  in
the  form  of  cash  and  common stock of the company,  which  may  be
deferred in part at the election of the recipient.  The committee that
administers the plan determines the particular recipients who  are  to
receive  awards  and  the  amounts of their  respective  awards.   The
amounts  charged  (credited)  to  expense  in  1993,  1992  and   1991
aggregated $39, $1,092 and $(242), respectively.

The  staff  Incentive  Compensation Plan (ICP) authorizes  payment  of
awards  in the form of cash and common stock of the company to certain
salaried  employees  who are not participants in the  company's  EICP.
All awards are deferred for a period of five years and are paid out in
cash  and  common stock over a six-year period thereafter.  Recipients
must  remain  in the continuous employment of the company  up  to  the
distribution date in order to receive the award.  The amounts  charged
to  expense  in  1993, 1992 and 1991 aggregated $116,  $78,  and  $62,
respectively.


9. Stock Options
The  company has incentive stock option plans adopted in 1986 and 1992
which  provide for the granting of options to officers and  designated
employees of the company to purchase shares of the common stock of the
company at a price not less than the market value of the common  stock
on  the  date  the option is granted.  In addition, an incentive  plan
adopted  in 1981 has been terminated and no new options can be granted
under this plan, although unexercised options remain outstanding.

Options are exercisable in whole or in part from one to ten years from
the date of the grant at the discretion of the stock option committee.
Options  granted  under each plan may not exceed 400,000  shares.   No
charges to income arise in connection with the plans.

Option  plan transactions during 1993 and 1992 are summarized  in  the
following table:

10.  Employee Benefit Plans
The  company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan  which
covers  salaried employees who meet minimum age and length of  service
requirements.   Benefits are based on members' years  of  service  and
averaged final salary.

The  projected  unit credit actuarial method is used to determine  the
recognition  of net periodic pension expense and to determine  funding
requirements.  The company will continue to fund the plan as required.

Plan  assets  consist primarily of pooled equity, debt and  short-term
investment funds, a pooled real estate equity fund and 675,000  shares
of the company's common stock.

On  March 31, 1991, the company curtailed its defined benefit  pension
plan  such that benefits do not accrue to plan participants for future
years  of  service.   The curtailment resulted in a  pre-tax  gain  of
$29,862  which  is included in Other income, net for  the  year  ended
December 31, 1991.

Effective  January  1,  1992,  the  company  changed  the  method  for
amortizing  unrecognized pension actuarial gains and  losses  for  the
defined  benefit pension plan, under which the full amount of the  net
actuarial  gain or loss in the year is being amortized over  a  period
not exceeding the average life expectancy of employees.  The effect of
the  change in accounting method for the year ended December 31,  1992
related  to  the 1992 pension expense was to increase  net  income  by
$641, net of tax, or $.12 per share on primary earnings per share  and
$.10  per  share on fully diluted earnings per share.  The  cumulative
effect  of  the  change on prior years was to increase net  income  by
$1,454,  net of tax, or $.29 per share on primary earnings  per  share
and $.25 per share on fully diluted earnings per share.

The  pro  forma  amounts below have been adjusted for  the  effect  of
retroactive application of the change in accounting method as  if  the
change had been adopted effective January 1, 1991.

The  company amortizes unrecognized prior service costs on a straight-
line basis over a period not exceeding the average life expectancy  of
retirees.

Effective January 1, 1994, the company formed a cash balance  plan  to
provide  pension  benefits  to  its employees,  that  were  previously
provided  separately under the curtailed defined benefit pension  plan
and  the defined contribution retirement plan.  Management anticipates
that  the cash balance plan will significantly reduce the net periodic
pension  credit recognized in 1994 and future years, and result  in  a
reduction of the prepaid pension asset.

The  company  also  sponsors a defined contribution  retirement  plan,
effective  April  1, 1991, and a Section 401(k) tax  deferred  savings
plan  which covers salaried employees who meet minimum age and  length
of  service  requirements.  Contributions to the defined  contribution
retirement plan are based on salaries and length of service.  Matching
contributions which began July 1, 1991, to the Section 401(k) plan are
based  on  employee contributions and are limited to one-half  of  the
first 3% of the employee's compensation.  The aggregate amount charged
to  expense  for these plans was $6,933 and $7,542 in 1993  and  1992,
respectively.

Employees  retiring  from the company and eligible  for  an  immediate
benefit  from the retirement plans (generally age 55 with 15 years  of
service)  are  eligible  to continue their current  medical  insurance
coverage into retirement.  The medical benefits continue to be subject
to  the  deductibles,  copayment  provisions  and  other  limitations.
Retirees  pay  for  a  portion  of the total  cost  of  their  medical
insurance and starting with 1993 retirements, the portion of the total
cost  will  be dependent on the individual's total company service  at
retirement.  The medical plans of the company are funded on a  pay  as
you go basis.

Effective  January 1, 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits  Other  Than  Pensions."  The statement mandates  accrual  of
postretirement health benefits during the years that employees  render
service.

The  company  will  amortize to expense, over a  20-year  period,  the
discounted present value of the obligation as of the adoption date.
The  table  below sets forth the funded status of the  plans  and  the
amounts  recognized in the company's financial statements at  December
31, 1993 and for the year then ended.

_________________________________________________________________

The  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was computed  using
an  assumed  weighted average discount rate of 7.5%.   The  healthcare
cost  trend rate was assumed to be 13% in 1993 decreasing by 1% a year
to 6% in 2000 and 5.5% in 2001 and beyond.

In  November  1992,  the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  issued
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  112  "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  This statement mandates  the
accrual of all types of postemployment benefits provided to former  or
inactive employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents  after
employment  but  before  retirement.   The  company  will  adopt  this
standard  effective January 1, 1994.  Management believes  the  impact
when  the standard is adopted will not be material to the consolidated
financial statements.


11.  Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The  company has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)  for
salaried  employees  who  meet  minimum  age  and  length  of  service
requirements.   To  fund  the  ESOP, the company  originally  borrowed
$18,092.   Proceeds of this borrowing were loaned to the  ESOP,  which
purchased 850,000 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock.

Eligible employees are allocated the Series B stock over the  term  of
the ten-year ESOP loan.  The allocated shares vest after five years of
service.
The Series B stock is callable, in whole or in part, at the option  of
the  company  at  any time after July 1, 1994, at a  price  per  share
expressed  as  a  percentage of the issue price  of  $21.29.   At  the
company's option, the call may be satisfied by common shares, cash  or
a  combination thereof.  The call price is 112% in 1994 and  decreases
to  100%  in 1999 and for years thereafter.  The trustee may,  at  any
time,  convert each share of Series B stock into one share  of  common
stock.

Prior  to  the retirement of the ESOP debt, employees can only  redeem
their vested preferred shares upon death or age 70 1/2.  Once the debt
is  retired,  shares  can  be redeemed at retirement,  termination  or
death.  The redemption value is established at the end of each year by
an  independent appraiser.  The latest appraised value dated March 17,
1994  was  $18.00  per  preferred share.   At  the  company's  option,
redemption by an employee may be satisfied by common shares, cash or a
combination thereof.

The preferred stockholders are entitled to identical voting rights  as
the holders of common shares.

The  loan to the ESOP is on the same terms as the company's bank loan.
The  ESOP  will repay the loan (plus interest) with proceeds from  the
quarterly dividends paid on the Series B stock and contributions  from
the company.  All contributions to the ESOP in excess of dividends are
treated as compensation expense.

Compensation expense and interest income for the years ended  December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 were:

                       1993       1992       1991

The interest income earned by the company on the ESOP loan offsets the
interest expense incurred on the original borrowing, with no impact on
the results of operations.


12.  Stockholders' Equity
On  July  20, 1992, the company sold Karl Steiner Holding AG (Steiner)
9,000 shares of Series C 8 1/2 percent convertible preferred stock and
6,000 shares of Series D 8 1/2 percent convertible preferred stock for
a  total  of  $15,000.   On  July 22, 1992, the  Series  D  stock  was
exchanged for an 8 1/2 percent convertible debenture due 1997  in  the
principal amount of $6,000 (Note 6).

The  Series  C  stock is convertible into 1,000,000 shares  of  common
stock  or can be exchanged for 9,000 shares of Series E 8 1/2  percent
convertible preferred stock (which is substantially identical  to  the
Series  C  stock,  except  as  to  transferability  and  election   of
directors).  The debenture is convertible into 6,000 shares of  Series
D  stock,  which is convertible into 600,000 shares of  common  stock.
The Series C stock has, and the Series D and Series E stock will have,
a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and a cumulative dividend
preference of $85 per share per year.  At their option, the holders of
the  Series  C,  Series D and Series E stock will have  the  right  to
convert  either  the full amount or a partial percentage  into  common
stock.

While  the  Series C stockholders own securities constituting  (on  an
after-converted  basis)  more  than  10  percent  of   the   company's
outstanding  common  stock, on a fully diluted  basis,  the  Series  C
stockholders  have  the right to elect, as a class,  between  one  and
three  directors, depending on the percentage of the outstanding stock
owned.   Holders  of Series D and Series E stock, and Series  C  stock
(except  when  they are entitled to elect at least one director  as  a
class),  vote  on  an as-converted basis as though  they  held  common
stock.   Holders of Series C or Series D stock also have the right  to
elect a director if the company is six quarters or more in arrears  in
paying dividends.

In  connection  with  the  purchase of  the  company's  securities  by
Steiner, the company executed an agreement which provided the  company
and  Steiner  with  certain  rights,  obligations  and  options  which
terminates on June 30, 2002, unless extended.

Under  this agreement, Steiner has the right of first refusal in  some
instances  with  regard  to sales by the company  of  more  than  five
percent  of  its stock.  In addition, if the company issues additional
stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, Steiner will have the
option  in some instances to purchase similar securities to the extent
necessary to maintain its percentage ownership.

If  the  company  issues,  in  a  transaction  or  related  series  of
transactions,  common stock or convertible or exchangeable  securities
totaling  at  least  15  percent of the company's  outstanding  common
stock, on a fully diluted basis, the Series C stock will be redeemable
during  a 30-day period at its liquidation preference plus accrued  or
accumulated dividends, unless the holders of two-thirds of the  Series
C stock approve the transaction.

The  company  has  a right of first refusal with regard  to  sales  or
transfers  of  the company's securities owned by Steiner  constituting
more than five percent of the company's outstanding common stock, on a
fully  diluted  basis.  In addition, the company  has  the  option  to
repurchase the company's securities owned by Steiner, upon a change in
control in the ownership of Steiner.

If after December 31, 1994, the price of the company's common stock is
below $7 for at least 20 consecutive trading days (or if the agreement
is  not  extended), Steiner may require the company either to  find  a
buyer (which may be the company) for all of Steiner's holdings (or all
its  holdings  except the debenture or Series D  stock),  or  to  sell
Steiner  additional common stock equal to Steiner's existing  holdings
on  an as-converted basis, at a price selected by Steiner which is not
higher  than  115 percent of the market price of the company's  common
stock.  The company will not decide until it knows the terms on  which
it  is  to  find  a  buyer for Steiner's holdings or to  sell  Steiner
additional common stock, which of the two options it will elect.

13.  Commitments and Contingencies
The  company  (as  lessee) leases office space under operating  leases
having  remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess  of  one  year.
Rental  expense for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992  and  1991
amounted to $9,779, $10,103 and $10,393, respectively.  Future minimum
rental payments are as follows:

  1994   1995   1996   1997   1998 Therea
                                   fter

                                        9

The company (as lessor) has operating leases with tenants that provide
for  fixed  minimum rent and reimbursement of a portion  of  operating
costs.   Additional rents for reimbursements included in rental income
amounted   to  $390,  $447,  and  $506  for  1993,  1992   and   1991,
respectively.

Tenant leases on commercial office and mixed-use properties have terms
of  up  to  ten years, and leases on residential properties  generally
have  terms  of one year or less.  Minimum future rental revenue  from
non-cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 1993 are as follows:

  1994   1995   1996   1997   1998    Therea

In  connection  with the company's investment in a real  estate  joint
venture   to   develop  certain  condominium  properties  in   Boston,
Massachusetts, the company has guaranteed, jointly and severally  with
its joint venture partner, the construction loan provided to the joint
venture in the amount of $13,000.  The loan is primarily secured by  a
mortgage  and  security agreement covering the  property  and  various
other assignment of rights and interests.

The  company  has  jointly and severally guaranteed  completion  of  a
$88,800 construction contract which was entered into by Turner Steiner
International, S.A., in which the company has a 50% interest.

In  connection  with the sale of certain assets and liabilities  of  a
construction  subsidiary, the company agreed to guaranty or  otherwise
indemnify  their surety up to $15,000 in obtaining bonds in excess  of
$45,000.

The  company owns certain buildings, hangars and equipment and is  the
ground  lessee  on  the underlying land located at an  air  industrial
park.   The  company  has leased to a tenant the  buildings,  hangars,
equipment and land with an initial term of 10 years expiring in  1996.
The  tenant  was acquired by a third party in 1989.  As  part  of  the
acquisition,  the  acquirer  agreed  to  assume  the  tenant's   lease
obligations  for the balance of its initial term and  agreed  to  make
joint  efforts with the company to find a replacement tenant  for  the
facility.   Unless  the  company  is  able  to  replace  the   tenant,
expiration  of the lease may adversely affect the company's  earnings.
Rental  income under this lease represented 33% of total rental income
for 1993.

The company is a defendant in various routine litigations incident  to
its  business.   While in some instances the amounts sought  are  very
substantial  and certain parties are withholding amounts  included  in
construction  receivables, pending the outcome of the  litigation,  in
the  opinion of management the resolution of such litigation will  not
have  a  material adverse effect on the financial position and results
of operations of the company.

16.  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of
these amounts.

Marketable Securities:  The fair value of marketable securities is
based on quoted market prices for such investments.  At December 31,
1993 and 1992, the fair value approximates the carrying amount.

Construction Receivables and Construction Payables:  The carrying
amount of construction receivables and construction payables
approximate fair value as these amounts generally are due or payable
within the company's operating cycle.

Notes Payable:  The fair value of notes payable secured by real estate
properties that mature within one year, is estimated based on
management's intent with respect to refinancing.  For those debt
instruments which have been subsequently extinguished, the carrying
amount approximates fair value.  Otherwise, the fair value of such
notes payable is estimated based on the company's risk adjusted
incremental borrowing rate upon refinancing, given the underlying
value of the loan collateral.

The fair value of notes payable secured by real estate properties with
maturities in excess of one year, is estimated based on discounting
the future cash flows at the company's year-end risk adjusted
incremental borrowing rate for a similar debt instrument, given the
underlying value of the loan collateral.

The fair value of unsecured notes payable is estimated based on the
company's year-end incremental borrowing rate for similar liabilities.

The above methodologies for determining the fair value of notes
payable reflect recent agreements entered into and currently under
negotiation by the company.  At  December 31, 1993 and 1992, the fair
value of notes payable was $95,021 and $114,580, respectively.

Convertible Debenture:  The fair value of the convertible debenture is
estimated based on the greater of the company's incremental borrowing
rate for a similar debt instrument, or the value of the debt assuming
conversion at the year-end stock price, which would reflect the
probability of conversion by the debt holder.  At December 31, 1993
and 1992, the fair value was $6,000.

ESOP Loan Receivable:  The fair value of the loan receivable from the
ESOP is estimated based on the fair value of the company's borrowing
to fund the ESOP.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the fair value was
$12,255 and $13,533, respectively.

Interest Rate Swap Agreement:  The fair value of the interest rate
swap agreement on the adjustable rate revenue refunding bonds is
estimated based on the discounted value of the difference between the
fixed payments on the swap and the payments that would be required at
current market fixed rates for a similar financial instrument.  The
fair value of the interest rate swap liability was $286 at December
31, 1993.  The fair value of the interest rate swap was zero at
December 31, 1992.

Responsibilities for Financial Reporting

The  management  of  The Turner Corporation and Subsidiaries  has  the
responsibility  for preparing the accompanying consolidated  financial
statements  and  for their integrity and objectivity.   The  financial
statements  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted
accounting  principles  applied on a  consistent  basis  and  are  not
misstated  due  to material fraud or error.  The financial  statements
include  amounts  that are based on management's  best  estimates  and
judgements.   Management also prepared the other  information  in  the
annual report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with
the financial statements.

The fair presentation of the company's financial position, results  of
operations  and  cash flows are reported on by the independent  public
accountants,  Arthur Andersen & Co. (see Report of Independent  Public
Accountants) for each of the three years in the period ended  December
31,  1993.   Their report emphasizes that the company has  significant
interests in real estate properties, the carrying amounts of which are
based  on  management's present intent to hold these properties  until
market   conditions  improve  to  the  extent  necessary  to   achieve
reasonable prices upon disposition.  Management has made available  to
Arthur  Andersen  &  Co.  all of the company's financial  records  and
related  data, as well as the minutes of stockholders' and  directors'
meetings.   Furthermore, management believes that all  representations
made  to  Arthur  Andersen  & Co. during  its  audit  were  valid  and
appropriate.

To  fulfill the responsibility for the reporting of financial results,
management  maintains  a system of accounting and  internal  controls,
including  a program of internal audits which encompasses operational,
financial and special audits.  Management seeks to assure the  quality
of   financial  reporting  by  careful  selection  and   training   of
supervisory and management personnel, by organization structures  that
provide   an   appropriate   division  of   responsibility,   and   by
communication  of  accounting  and business  policies  and  procedures
throughout  the company.  Management believes the internal  accounting
controls in use provide reasonable assurance that the company's assets
are  safeguarded,  that transactions are executed in  accordance  with
management's  authorizations,  and  that  the  financial  records  are
reliable  for  the  purpose  of preparing  financial  statements.   In
addition, the company has distributed a statement of its policies  for
conducting  business  affairs  in a  lawful  and  ethical  manner  and
receives reports of compliance annually.

The  Board  of  Directors, through the Audit Committee of  the  Board,
meets  separately  and jointly with management, the internal  auditors
and  the independent public accountants on a periodic basis to  assure
itself that each is carrying out its responsibilities.

without the State of Delaware) as may be designated by the Board of

Directors.



      Section 1.3  Notice of Meeting; Record Date; Quorum; Voting. Notice

of every meeting of stockholders shall be given, and a record date for the

meeting shall be established, in accordance with the General Corporation

Law of the State of Delaware.  The presence at any meeting, in person or by

proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the shares then issued and

outstanding and entitled to vote shall be necessary and sufficient to

constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except as otherwise

provided by law.  Directors shall be chosen by a plurality of the votes

cast.  Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of  Incorporation of

the Corporation or by law, all other questions shall be determined by a

majority of the votes cast.

                                ARTICLE II

                            Board of Directors

                                     

      Section 2.1  Number.  The number of Directors which shall constitute

herein provided.



      Section 2.2  Classification, Election and Term of Office.  The Board

of Directors shall be divided into three classes, which shall be as nearly

equal in number as possible.  Directors shall be elected for three year

terms.  Newly created Directorships resulting from an increase in the

number of  Directors or vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors may

be filled by the Board.  Each Director (whether elected at an annual

meeting or to fill a vacancy or otherwise) shall continue in office until

his successor shall have been elected and qualified or until his earlier

death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided.



      Section 2.3  Meetings, Quorum and Manner of Acting.  A meeting

("Organization Meeting") of the Board of Directors shall be held for

organization, for the election of officers and for the transaction of such

other business as may properly come before the meeting, within thirty days

after each annual election of Directors.



      The Board of Directors by resolution may provide for the holding of

regular meetings and may fix the times and places at which such meetings

shall be held.  Notice of regular meetings shall not be required to be

given, provided that whenever the time or place of regular meetings shall

be fixed or changed, notice of the action shall be mailed promptly to each

Director who shall not have been present at the meeting at which the action

was taken, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business.



      Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held upon call by

or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the President or any

Director.  Except as otherwise required by law, notice of each special

meeting shall be mailed to each Director, addressed to him at his residence

or usual place of business, at least two days before the day on which the

meeting is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by telegram,

radio, cable, telex, or telecopier, or telephoned or delivered to him

personally, not later than the day before the day on which the meeting is

to be held.  Such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, but

need not state the purpose therefore, unless otherwise required by law.



      Notice of any meeting need not be given to any Director who shall

attend the meeting in person or who shall waive notice thereof, before or

after the meeting, in writing.  At each meeting of the Board of Directors

the presence of a majority of the whole Board of Directors as constituted

from time to time shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum

for the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of

those present at the time and place of any meeting may adjourn the meeting

from time to time until a quorum shall be present and the meeting may be

held as adjourned without further notice of waiver.  A majority of those

present at any meeting at which a quorum is present may decide any question

brought before such meeting, except as otherwise provided by law, the

Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-Laws.



      Members of the Board of  Directors may participate in a meeting of

the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications

equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can

hear each other, and participation in a meeting in such manner shall

constitute presence in person at the meeting.



      Section 2.4  Action Without a Meeting.  Any action which might have

been taken under these By-Laws by vote of the Directors at a meeting of the

Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all the members of the

Board of Directors consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings

are filed with the minutes of the Board of Directors.



      Section 2.5  Resignation of Directors.  Any Director may resign at

any time by giving written notice of such resignation of the Board of

Directors.  Unless otherwise specified in the notice, the resignation shall

take effect upon receipt thereof by the Board of Directors, and the

acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.



      Section 2.6  Compensation of Directors.  Directors shall receive such

reasonable compensation for their services as such, whether in the form of

salary or a fixed fee for attendance at meetings, with expenses, if any, as

the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.  Nothing herein

Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

                                 ARTICLE II
  
                                 THE CREDITS

  severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in
  this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower from time to
  time prior to the Termination Date; provided that the
  aggregate principal amount of Loans by such Bank at any one
  time outstanding shall not exceed the amount of its
  Commitment.  Each Borrowing hereunder shall be in an aggregate

  Commitments.   Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may
  borrow, repay, or, to the extent permitted by Section 2.10,
  prepay Loans and reborrow at any time prior to the Termination
  Date. 
  
         (b)  The term of this Agreement may be extended, in
  the manner set forth in this subsection (b), on December 30,
  1993 (the "Extension Date") for a period of one year after the

  Agreement on the Extension Date, it shall give written notice
  to that effect to the Agent not less than 60 nor more than 90
  days prior to the Extension Date, whereupon the Agent shall
  notify each of the Banks of such notice.  Each Bank will use
  its best efforts to respond to such request, whether
  affirmatively or negatively, within 30 days after receiving
  notice from the Agent.  If all Banks respond affirmatively,
  then, subject to receipt by the Agent prior to the Extension
  Date of counterparts of an Extension Agreement in
  substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto duly completed and
  signed by all of the parties hereto, the term of this
  Agreement shall be extended, effective on the Extension Date,
  to December 30, 1996.
  
         SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Borrowings.  The Borrower
  shall give the Agent notice (a "Notice of Borrowing") not
  later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the date of
  each Base Rate Borrowing, (y) the second Domestic Business Day
  before each CD Borrowing and (z) the third Euro-Dollar
  Business Day before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:
  
         (i)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a
    Domestic Business Day in the case of a Domestic Borrowing
    or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a
    Euro-Dollar Borrowing,
  
        (ii)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,
  
       (iii)  whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are
    to be CD Loans, Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, and
  
        (iv)  in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the
    duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
    subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest
    Period. 
  
         SECTION 2.03.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. 
  (a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall
  promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
  Bank's ratable share of such Borrowing and such Notice of
  Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. 
  
         (b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time)
  on the date of each Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as
  provided in subsection (c) of this Section) make available its
  ratable share of such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds
  immediately available in New York City, to the Agent at its
  address specified in or pursuant to Section 10.01.  Unless the
  Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in
  Article III has not been satisfied, the Agent will make the
  funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at
  the Agent's aforesaid address. 
  
         (c)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day
  on which the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an
  outstanding Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the
  proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
  amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount
  being borrowed by the Borrower and the amount being repaid
  shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as provided
  in subsection (b) of this Section, or remitted by the Borrower
  to the Agent as provided in Section 2.11, as the case may be. 
  
         (d)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice
  from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank
  will not make available to the Agent such Bank's share of such
  Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
  share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
  accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.03
  and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
  available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. 
  If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made
  such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower
  severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
  corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each
  day from the date such amount is made available to the
  Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at
  (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the
  higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate
  applicable to such Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii)
  in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such
  Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such
  amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in
  such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 2.04.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank
  shall be evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of
  such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in
  an amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
  such Bank's Loans. 
  
         (b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and
  the Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type be
  evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the
  aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such
  Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto
  with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it
  evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference
  in this Agreement to a "Note" or the "Notes" of such Bank
  shall be deemed to refer to and include any or all of such
  Notes, as the context may require. 
  
         (c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
  Section 3.01(b), the Agent shall mail such Note to such Bank. 
  Each Bank shall record the date, amount, type and maturity of
  each Loan made by it and the date and amount of each payment
  of principal made with respect thereto, and prior to any
  transfer of its Note shall endorse on the schedule forming a
  part thereof appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing
  information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding,
  which endorsements shall be, in the absence of manifest error,
  presumptive evidence of the amount of Loans outstanding at the
  time of such transfer; provided that the failure of any Bank
  to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect
  the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes. 
  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so
  to endorse its Notes and to attach to and make a part of any
  Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.
  
         SECTION 2.05.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan
  included in any Borrowing shall mature, and the principal
  amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of
  the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing. 
  
         SECTION 2.06.  Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base Rate

  becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base
  Rate Margin for such day plus the Base Rate for such day. 
  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the
  last day thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any
  Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
  each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
  2.75% plus the Base Rate for such day.  The "Base Rate Margin"
  for any day means:

    prior to such day, the Borrower has delivered all
    financial statements and certificates required to be
    delivered before such day pursuant to Section 5.01(a)
    through (g), and (A) the Fixed Charge Ratio for the most
    recent fiscal quarter with respect to which a certificate

         (b)  Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the
  outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during the
  Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
  to the sum of the CD Margin for such day plus the applicable
  Adjusted CD Rate; provided that if any CD Loan or any portion
  thereof shall, as a result of clause (2)(b) of the definition
  of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than 30
  days, such portion shall bear interest for each day during
  such Interest Period at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans
  for such day.  Such interest shall be payable for each
  Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest
  Period is longer than 90 days, 90 days after the first day
  thereof.  Any overdue principal of or interest on any CD Loan
  shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
  paid at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of
  4.375% plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan and

  exceeding five billion dollars in respect of new non-personal
  time deposits in dollars in New York City having a maturity
  comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount of

  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and
  interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder (except the
  participation fee under Section 2.07(b), which shall be paid
  at such time on the Effective Date as all of the conditions in
  Section 3.01 shall have been satisfied or waived), not later
  than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due, in
  Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City,
  to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.01.  The
  Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share
  of each such payment received by the Agent for the account of
  the Banks.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest
  on, the Domestic Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which
  is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof
  shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business
  Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on,
  the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
  Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall
  be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day
  unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar
  month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the
  next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any
  payment of principal is extended by operation of law or
  otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended
  time. 
  
         (b)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice
  from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is
  due from the Borrower to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower
  will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that
  the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on
  such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
  cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an
  amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the
  extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment,
  each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such
  amount distributed to such Bank together with interest
  thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed
  to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to
  the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
  
         SECTION 2.12.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower
  makes any payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate
  Loan (pursuant to Article VI or VIII or otherwise) on any day
  other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable
  thereto, or the last day of an applicable period fixed
  pursuant to Section 2.06(d), or if the Borrower fails to
  borrow any Fixed Rate Loans after notice has been given to any
  Bank in accordance with Section 2.03(a), the Borrower shall
  reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any
  resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or
  prospective Participant in the related Loan), including
  (without limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining,
  liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
  excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment
  or failure to borrow, provided that such Bank shall have
  delivered to the Borrower a certificate setting forth the
  amount of such loss or expense and, in reasonable detail, the
  calculation thereof, which certificate shall be conclusive in
  the absence of manifest error. 
  
         SECTION 2.13.  Computation of Interest and Fees. 
  Interest based on the Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed
  on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap
  year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
  (including the first day but excluding the last day).  All
  other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a
  year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days
  elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
  
         SECTION 2.14.  Withholding Tax Exemption.  At least
  five Domestic Business Days prior to the first date on which
  interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any
  Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the
  United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it
  will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly
  completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
  Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such Bank is
  entitled to receive payments from the Borrower under this
  Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
  any United States federal income taxes.  Each Bank which so
  delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to
  each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of
  such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that
  such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence
  of any event requiring a change in the most recent form so
  delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or
  renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the
  Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank
  is entitled to receive payments from the Borrower under this
  Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
  any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
  (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or
  regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
  delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such
  forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly
  completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
  such Bank advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not
  capable of receiving such payments without any deduction or
  withholding of United States federal income tax. 
  
          SECTION 2.15.  Foreign Withholding Taxes and Other
  Costs.  (a)  All payments by the Borrower of principal of and
  interest on the Notes and of all other amounts payable by it
  under this Agreement are payable without deduction for or on
  account of any present or future taxes, duties or other
  charges levied or imposed by the government of any
  jurisdiction outside the United States of America or by any
  political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
  through withholding or deduction with respect to any such
  payments.  If any such taxes, duties or other charges are so
  levied or imposed, the Borrower will pay additional interest
  or will make additional payments in such amounts so that every
  net payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and of
  all other amounts payable by it under this Agreement, after
  withholding or deduction for or on account of any such present
  or future taxes, duties or other charges, will not be less
  than the amount provided for herein.  The Borrower shall
  furnish promptly to the Agent official receipts evidencing
  such withholding or deduction. 
  
         (b)  If the cost to any Bank of making or
  maintaining any Loan to the Borrower is increased, or the
  amount of any sum received or receivable by any Bank (or its
  Applicable Lending Office) is reduced by an amount deemed by
  such Bank to be material, by reason of the fact the Borrower
  conducts business in a jurisdiction outside the United States
  of America, the Borrower shall indemnify such Bank for such
  increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by
  such Bank (with a copy to the Agent).  A certificate of such
  Bank claiming compensation under this subsection (b) and
  setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to
  it hereunder and, in reasonable detail, the calculation
  thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
  
         (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and
  the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge that will
  entitle such Bank to additional interest or payments pursuant
  to subsection (b) and will designate a different Applicable
  Lending Office, if, in the judgment of such Bank, such
  designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
  such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to
  such Bank.

  Existing Agreement, shall terminate without any further action
  by any party.
  
         SECTION 3.02.  Borrowings.  The obligation of any
  Bank to make a Loan on the occasion of any Borrowing is

                                 ARTICLE IV
  
               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER
  
  
         The Borrower represents and warrants that:
  
         SECTION 4.01.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The
  Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
  and in good standing under the laws of Delaware, and has all

  authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on
  its business as now conducted. 
  
         SECTION 4.02.  Corporate and Governmental

  have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
  require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
  governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene,

  or regulation or of the respective certificate of
  incorporation or respective by-laws of the Borrower or the
  Guarantor or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order,
  decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or the
  Guarantor or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
  on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  
         SECTION 4.03.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement
  constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and
  the Guarantor, and the Notes, when executed and delivered in
  accordance with this Agreement, will constitute valid and
  binding obligations of the Borrower, and all of such documents
  are or will be enforceable in accordance with their respective

  enforceability hereof or thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
  insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting

  to each of the Banks, fairly present, in conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated
  financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated
  Subsidiaries as of such date and their consolidated results of

  income and retained earnings and cash flows for the nine
  months then ended, set forth in the Borrower's quarterly
  report for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1992 as

  fairly present, in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with the
  financial statements referred to in subsection (a) of this
  Section, the consolidated financial position of the Borrower
  and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
  consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such
  nine-month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments).

  ended, copies of which have been delivered to each of the
  Banks, are the respective consolidating financial statements
  used by the Borrower in preparing the consolidated financial
  statements referred to in subsections (a) and (b) above and
  were prepared on the basis of accounting principles consistent
  with those used in preparing such respective consolidated
  financial statements. 
  
         (d)  Since September 30, 1992 there has been no
  material adverse change in the business, financial position,
  results of operations or prospects of (i) the Guarantor or
  (ii) the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
  considered as a whole. 
  
         SECTION 4.05.  Litigation.  There is no action, suit
  or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the
  Borrower threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any
  of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any
  governmental body, agency or official in which there is a
  reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
  materially adversely affect the business, consolidated
  financial position or consolidated results of operations of
  the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries or which in any
  manner draws into question the validity of this Agreement or
  the Notes. 
  
         SECTION 4.06.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member
  of the ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the
  minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
  Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all
  material respects with the presently applicable provisions of
  ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan.

  Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to make any
  contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or
  in respect of any Benefit Arrangement, or made any amendment
  to any Plan or Benefit Arrangement, which has resulted or
  could result in the imposition of a Lien or the posting of a
  bond or other security under ERISA or the Internal Revenue
  Code or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA
  other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums under Section
  4007 of ERISA. 
  
         SECTION 4.07.  Environmental Matters.  The Borrower
  has reasonably concluded that Environmental Laws are unlikely
  to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
  condition, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower
  and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. 
  
         SECTION 4.08.  Compliance with Laws.  The Borrower
  and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
  laws, ordinances, rules, regulations and requirements of
  governmental authorities except where the necessity of
  compliance therewith is being contested in good faith by
  appropriate proceedings and except where the failures to be in
  compliance therewith, in the aggregate, do not, and are not
  reasonably expected to, have a material adverse effect on the
  business, financial position, results of operations or
  prospects of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, considered as
  a whole. 
  
         SECTION 4.09.  Contractual Arrangements.  Each
  contract or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
  Subsidiaries is a party is a valid and binding obligation of
  each party thereto, the Borrower or the Subsidiary of the
  Borrower that is a party thereto is not in default thereunder,
  and the Borrower has no knowledge of a continuing default
  thereunder by any other party thereto, except to the extent
  that the cumulative effect of any such agreements not being
  valid and binding and of any such defaults does not have a
  material adverse effect on the business, financial position,
  results of operations or prospects of the Borrower and its
  Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. 
  
         SECTION 4.10.  Taxes.  United States Federal income
  tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been
  examined and closed through the fiscal year ended December 31,
  1983.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
  States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax
  returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid
  all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any
  assessment received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary.  The
  charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Borrower
  and its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other governmental
  charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate. 
  
         SECTION 4.11.  Subsidiaries.  Each of the Borrower's
  corporate Subsidiaries that actively engages in business is a
  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
  standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation,
  and has all corporate powers and all material governmental
  licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
  carry on its business as now conducted. 
  
         SECTION 4.12.  Not an Investment Company.  The
  Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning of
  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
  
         SECTION 4.13.  Full Disclosure.  All information
  heretofore furnished by the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank
  for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any
  transaction contemplated hereby is, and all such information
  hereafter furnished by the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank
  will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the
  date as of which such information is stated or certified.  The
  Borrower has disclosed to the Banks in writing any and all
  facts which materially and adversely affect or may affect (to
  the extent the Borrower can now reasonably foresee), the
  business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower
  and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
  ability of the Borrower or the Guarantor to perform its
  obligations under this Agreement. 
  
  
                                  ARTICLE V
  
                                  COVENANTS
  
  
         The Borrower agrees that, so long as any Bank has
  any Commitment hereunder or any amount payable under any Note
  remains unpaid:

    and retained earnings and cash flows for such fiscal
    year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the

  in accordance with good business practice customarily insure
  properties of a similar character against loss by fire and
  from other causes.  In addition, the Borrower will, and will
  cause each Subsidiary to, maintain with financially sound and

  and effect, and will cause each Subsidiary to preserve, renew
  and keep in full force and effect their respective corporate
  existence and their respective rights, privileges and
  franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of
  business; provided that nothing in this Section 5.04 shall
  prohibit (i) mergers and consolidations permitted by
  Section 5.16 or (ii) the termination of the corporate
  existence of any Subsidiary other than the Guarantor if the
  Borrower in good faith determines that such termination is in
  the best interest of the Borrower and is not materially
  disadvantageous to the Banks. 
  
         SECTION 5.05.  Compliance with Laws.  The Borrower
  will comply, and cause each Subsidiary to comply, with all

  limitation, Environmental Laws and ERISA and the rules and
  regulations thereunder) except where the necessity of
  compliance therewith is contested in good faith by appropriate
  proceedings and except where the failures to comply therewith,
  in the aggregate, do not, and are not reasonably expected to,
  have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
  position, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower
  and its Subsidiaries, considered as a whole. 
  
         SECTION 5.06.  Inspection of Property, Books and

  and records and to discuss their respective affairs, finances
  and accounts with their respective officers, employees and
  independent public accountants, all at such reasonable times
  and as often as may reasonably be desired.  Each Bank shall
  hold in confidence all non-public information obtained
  pursuant to this Section 5.06 and marked or otherwise
  identified in writing as being confidential, except to the
  extent that such information (i) becomes generally available
  to the public other than as the result of disclosure by any
  Bank, (ii) was available to any Bank on a non-confidential
  basis prior to its disclosure to any Bank pursuant to this
  Section 5.06, (iii) becomes available to any Bank on a
  non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower
  or any of its Subsidiaries at a time when such source is
  permitted to make such information available to such Bank, or

  any of its Subsidiaries and such Bank; provided that any Bank
  may disclose such information (x) to any other Bank, which
  shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 5.06 with
  respect to such information, (y) at the request of a bank
  regulatory agency or in connection with an examination of such
  Bank by bank examiners and (z) to such Bank's independent
  auditors and legal counsel, it being understood that
  disclosure of such information pursuant to clause (y) or (z)
  of this proviso shall not otherwise limit the applicability of
  this sentence to such information and that, at the time of
  disclosure of such information pursuant to clause (z) of this
  proviso, such Bank shall inform such independent auditor or
  legal counsel that such information is subject to this Section
  5.06; and provided, further, that if any Bank is requested or
  required in connection with any legal process to disclose any
  such information, such Bank will, to the extent it may
  lawfully do so, provide the Borrower with prompt notice of
  such request or requirement; unless the Borrower provides such
  Bank with evidence (including, without limitation, a court
  order) satisfactory to such Bank that it is not compelled to
  disclose such information in connection with such legal
  process, such Bank may, at such time as it is compelled to do

    due, or shall take any corporate action to authorize any
    of the foregoing;
  
         (j)  an involuntary case or other proceeding shall
    be commenced against the Borrower or any Subsidiary
    seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with
    respect to it or its debts under any bankruptcy,
    insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in
    effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
    liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or
    any substantial part of its property, and such
    involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain
    undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 days; or an
    order for relief shall be entered against the Borrower or
    any Subsidiary under the federal bankruptcy laws as now
    or hereafter in effect;
  
         (k)  any member of the ERISA Group shall fail to pay
    when due an amount or amounts aggregating in excess of
    $1,000,000 which it shall have become liable to pay under
    Title IV of ERISA; or notice of intent to terminate a
    Material Plan shall be filed under Title IV of ERISA by
    any member of the ERISA Group, any plan administrator or
    any combination of the foregoing; or the PBGC shall
    institute proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to
    terminate, to impose liability (other than for premiums
    under Section 4007 of ERISA) in respect of, or to cause a
    trustee to be appointed to administer any Material Plan;
    or a condition shall exist by reason of which the PBGC
    would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that
    any Material Plan must be terminated; or there shall
    occur a complete or partial withdrawal from, or a
    default, within the meaning of Section 4219(c)(5) of
    ERISA, with respect to, one or more Multiemployer Plans
    which could cause one or more members of the ERISA Group
    to incur a current payment obligation in excess of
    $1,000,000;
  
         (l)  a judgment or order for the payment of money in
    excess of $1,000,000 shall be rendered against the
    Borrower or any Subsidiary and such judgment or order
    shall continue unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of
    30 days; or
  
         (m)  any person or group of persons (within the
    meaning of Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired beneficial
    ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated
    by the Securities and Exchange Commission under said Act)
    of 22% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock
    of the Borrower; or, during any period of 12 consecutive
    calendar months, individuals who were directors of the
    Borrower on the first day of such period shall cease to
    constitute a majority of the board of directors of the
    Borrower;
  
  then, and in every such event, the Agent shall (i) if
  requested by Banks having more than 50% in aggregate amount of
  the Commitments, by notice to the Borrower terminate the
  Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and (ii) if
  requested by Banks holding Notes evidencing more than 50% in
  aggregate principal amount of the Loans, by notice to the
  Borrower declare the Notes (together with accrued interest
  thereon) to be, and the Notes shall thereupon become,
  immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
  protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
  waived by the Borrower; provided that in the case of any of
  the Events of Default specified in clause (i) or (j) above
  with respect to the Borrower or the Guarantor, without any
  notice to the Borrower or any other act by the Agent or the
  Banks, the Commitments shall thereupon terminate and the Notes
  (together with accrued interest thereon) shall become
  immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
  protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
  waived by the Borrower. 
  
         SECTION 6.02.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall
  give notice to the Borrower under Section 6.01(c) or (d)
  promptly upon being requested to do so by any Bank and shall
  thereupon notify all the Banks thereof. 
  
  
                                 ARTICLE VII
  
                                  THE AGENT
  
  
         SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization.  Each
  Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
  such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
  under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to the
  Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such
  powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. 
  
         SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Morgan
  Guaranty Trust Company of New York shall have the same rights
  and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may
  exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were
  not the Agent, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York
  and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
  and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower
  or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were
  not the Agent hereunder. 
  
         SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations of
  the Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein. 
  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent
  shall not be required to take any action with respect to any
  Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI. 
  
         SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  The Agent
  may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
  Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts
  selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or
  omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
  advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. 
  
         SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither the
  Agent nor any of its affiliates, nor any of their respective
  directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for
  any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith (i)
  with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks or
  (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
  misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates, nor
  any of their respective directors, officers, agents or
  employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to
  ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty
  or representation made in connection with this Agreement or
  any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of
  any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the
  satisfaction of any condition specified in Article III, except
  receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent; or
  (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of this
  Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing
  furnished in connection herewith.  The Agent shall not incur
  any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent,
  certificate, statement, or other writing (which may be a bank
  wire, telex or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine
  or to be signed by the proper party or parties. 
  
         SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall,
  ratably in accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the
  Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors,
  officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed
  by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel
  fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or
  liability (except such as result from such indemnitee's gross
  negligence or willful misconduct) that such indemnitee may
  suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any
  action taken or omitted by such indemnitee hereunder. 
  
         SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank
  acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
  upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
  and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
  credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. 
  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and
  without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
  on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
  at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
  taking or not taking any action under this Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may
  resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the
  Banks and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the
  Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor
  Agent; provided that if such successor Agent is not a Bank,
  such appointment shall be subject to the consent of the
  Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
  Required Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment,
  within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
  resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
  Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial
  bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States
  of America or of any State thereof and having a combined
  capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000; provided that if
  such successor Agent is not a Bank, such appointment shall be
  subject to the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall
  not be unreasonably withheld.  Upon the acceptance of its
  appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
  successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
  with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
  retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
  obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's resignation
  hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure
  to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
  by it while it was Agent. 
  
         SECTION 7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall pay
  to the Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at
  the times previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the
  Agent. 
  
  
                                ARTICLE VIII
  
                           CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
  
  
         SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate
  Inadequate or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any
  Interest Period for any Fixed Rate Borrowing:
  
         (a)  the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks
    that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are
    not being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant
    market for such Interest Period, or
  
         (b)  Banks having 50% or more of the aggregate
    amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that the
    Adjusted CD Rate or the Adjusted London Interbank Offered
    Rate, as the case may be, as determined by the Agent will
    not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks
    of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the
    case may be, for such Interest Period,
  
  the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower
  and the Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower
  that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
  longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make CD Loans or
  Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended. 
  Unless the Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Domestic
  Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for
  which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it
  elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing shall
  instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing. 
  
         SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after the date
  of this Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
  regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the
  interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
  authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
  interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
  Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or
  directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
  authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it
  unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar
  Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar
  Loans to the Borrower and such Bank shall so notify the Agent,
  the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other
  Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the
  Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to
  such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank
  to make Euro-Dollar Loans to the Borrower shall be suspended. 
  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
  Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar
  Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for
  giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank,
  be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.  If such Bank shall
  determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and
  fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to the Borrower
  to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower
  shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding
  principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with
  accrued interest thereon.  Concurrently with prepaying each
  such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate
  Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which
  interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with
  the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such
  Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan. 
  
         SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return. 
  (a)  If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any
  applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or
  any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
  any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
  charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
  compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with
  any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
  law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:
  
          (i)  shall subject any Bank (or its Applicable
    Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with
    respect to its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its
    obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans, or shall change the
    basis of taxation of payments to any Bank (or its
    Applicable Lending Office) of the principal of or
    interest on its Fixed Rate Loans or any other amounts due
    under this Agreement in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans
    or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans (except for
    changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of
    such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by the
    jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive
    office or Applicable Lending Office is located); or
  
         (ii)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
    reserve (including, without limitation, any such
    requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System, but excluding (A) with respect to
    any CD Loan any such requirement included in an
    applicable Domestic Reserve Percentage and (B) with
    respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement
    included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve
    Percentage), special deposit, insurance assessment
    (excluding, with respect to any CD Loan, any such
    requirement reflected in an applicable Assessment Rate)
    or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
    or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank
    (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any
    Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United
    States market for certificates of deposit or the London
    interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed
    Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate
    Loans;
  
  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost
  to such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or
  maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of
  any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Applicable
  Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with
  respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be
  material, then, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with
  a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
  additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
  such increased cost or reduction. 
  
         (b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after
  the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
  regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein,
  or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
  by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
  agency charged with the interpretation or administration
  thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital
  adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
  authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
  have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of
  such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's
  obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
  (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption,
  change, request or directive (taking into consideration its
  policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed
  by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15
  days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the
  Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or
  amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such
  reduction. 
  
         (c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and
  the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
  after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to
  compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
  different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will
  avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
  and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
  disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of any Bank
  claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
  additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall
  be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In
  determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
  averaging and attribution methods. 
  
         SECTION 8.04.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for
  Affected Fixed Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank
  to make Euro-Dollar Loans to the Borrower has been suspended
  pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded
  compensation under Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower shall, by
  at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such
  Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of
  this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until
  such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
  rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer
  apply:
  
         (a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by such
    Bank as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
    be, shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (on which
    interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously
    with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks),
    and
  
         (b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar
    Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid, all payments
    of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay
    such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base
    Rate Loans instead. 
  
  
                                  ARTICLE IX
  
                                   GUARANTY
  
  
         SECTION 9.01.  The Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby
  unconditionally guarantees the full and punctual payment
  (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise)
  of the principal of and interest on each Note issued by the
  Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and the full and punctual
  payment of all other amounts payable by the Borrower under
  this Agreement.  Upon failure by the Borrower to pay
  punctually any such amount, Guarantor shall forthwith on
  demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the
  manner specified in this Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 9.02.  Guaranty Unconditional.  The
  obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional
  and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the
  foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
  affected by:
  
         (i) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise,
    waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the
    Borrower under this Agreement or any Note, by operation
    of law or otherwise;
  
         (ii) any modification or amendment of or supplement
    to this Agreement or any Note;
  
         (iii) any release, non-perfection or invalidity of
    any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the
    Borrower under this Agreement or any Note;
  
         (iv) any change in the corporate existence,
    structure or ownership of the Borrower or the Guarantor,
    or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
    similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets
    or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation
    of the Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Note;
  
         (v) the existence of any claim, set-off or other
    rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against
    the Borrower, the Agent, any Bank or any other Person,
    whether in connection herewith or any unrelated
    transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent
    the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or
    compulsory counterclaim;
  
         (vi) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to
    or against the Borrower for any reason of this Agreement
    or any Note, or any provision of applicable law or
    regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the
    Borrower of the principal of or interest on any Note or
    any other amount payable by the Borrower under this
    Agreement; or
  
         (vii) any other act or omission to act or delay of
    any kind by the Borrower, the Agent, any Bank or any
    other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which
    might, but for the provisions of this paragraph,
    constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
    Guarantor's obligations hereunder. 
  
         SECTION 9.03.  Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full;
  Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances.  The Guarantor's
  obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect
  until the Commitments shall have been terminated and the
  principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts
  payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall have been
  paid in full.  If at any time any payment of the principal of
  or interest on any Note or any other amount payable by the
  Borrower under this Agreement is rescinded or must be
  otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
  or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, the
  Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment
  shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but
  not made at such time. 
  
         SECTION 9.04.  Waiver by the Guarantor.  The
  Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment,
  demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as
  well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken
  by any Person against the Borrower or any other Person. 
  
         SECTION 9.05.  Subrogation.  The Guarantor
  irrevocably waives any and all rights to which it may be
  entitled, by operation of law or otherwise, upon making any
  payment hereunder to be subrogated to the rights of the payee
  against the Borrower with respect to such payment or otherwise
  to be reimbursed, indemnified or exonerated by the Borrower in
  respect thereof. 
  
         SECTION 9.06.  Stay of Acceleration.  If
  acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by
  the Borrower under this Agreement or the Notes is stayed upon
  the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower,
  all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the
  terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the
  Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Agent made at
  the request of the requisite proportion of the Banks specified
  in Article VI of this Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 9.07.  Limit of Liability.  The obligations
  of the Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate
  amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its
  obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548
  of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable
  provisions of any applicable state law. 
  
  
                                  ARTICLE X
  
                                MISCELLANEOUS
  
  
         SECTION 10.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests and
  other communications to any party hereunder shall be in
  writing (including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or
  similar writing) and shall be given to such party:  (x) in the
  case of the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Agent, at its
  address or telex number set forth on the signature pages
  hereof, (y) in the case of any Bank, at its address or telex
  number set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in
  the case of any party, such other address or telex number as
  such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to
  the Agent and the Borrower.  Each such notice, request or
  other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex,
  when such telex is transmitted to the telex number specified
  in this Section and the appropriate answerback is received,
  (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is
  deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
  addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other means,
  when delivered at the address specified in this Section;
  provided that notices to the Agent under Article II or Article
  VIII shall not be effective until received. 
  
         SECTION 10.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by
  the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
  privilege hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a
  waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
  thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
  exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights
  and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
  exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 
  
         SECTION 10.03.  Expenses; Documentary Taxes;
  Indemnification.  (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all
  reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including
  reasonable fees and disbursements of special counsel for the
  Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration
  of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any
  amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder
  and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all reasonable
  out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent and each Bank,
  including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, in
  connection with such Event of Default and collection,
  bankruptcy, insolvency and other enforcement proceedings
  resulting therefrom.  The Borrower shall indemnify each Bank
  against any transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or
  charges made by any governmental authority by reason of the
  execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Note. 
  
         (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and
  each Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective
  directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing
  (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless from
  and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs
  and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the
  reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be
  incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any
  investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether
  or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto)
  brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this
  Agreement or any actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans
  hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the right to
  be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross
  negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
  competent jurisdiction. 
  
         SECTION 10.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank
  agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
  counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of
  the aggregate amount of principal and interest due with
  respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the
  proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the
  aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect to
  any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
  proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
  participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such
  other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that
  all such payments of principal and interest with respect to
  the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro
  rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the
  right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or
  counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to
  such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower
  or the Guarantor, as the case may be, other than its
  indebtedness hereunder.  Each of the Borrower and the
  Guarantor agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do
  so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in
  a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing
  arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim
  and other rights with respect to such participation as fully
  as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of
  the Borrower or the Guarantor in the amount of such
  participation. 
  
         SECTION 10.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any
  provision of this Agreement or the Notes may be amended or
  waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
  and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if
  the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the
  Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall,
  unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the
  Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the
  Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any
  additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of
  interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the
  date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any
  Loan or any fees hereunder or for termination of the
  Commitments, or (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments
  or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or
  the number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or
  any of them to take any action under this Section or any other
  provision of this Agreement; provided, further, that any
  amendment or waiver of any provision of Article IX shall not
  be effective unless also signed by the Guarantor. 
  
         SECTION 10.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The
  provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
  to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
  successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
  assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this
  Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks. 
  
         (b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more
  banks or other institutions (each a "Participant")
  participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its
  Loans.  In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
  participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon
  notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain
  responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder,
  and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely
  and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's
  rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement
  pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating
  interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole
  right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
  Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to
  approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
  of this Agreement; provided that such participation agreement
  may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification,
  amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i),
  (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 10.05 without the consent of
  the Participant.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant
  shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement,
  be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to
  its participating interest.  An assignment or other transfer
  which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be
  given effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent
  of a participating interest granted in accordance with this
  subsection (b). 
  
         (c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more
  banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a
  proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under
  this Agreement and the Notes, and such Assignee shall assume
  such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and
  Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D
  hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank,
  with (and subject to) the subscribed consent of the Borrower,
  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the
  Agent; provided that if an Assignee is an affiliate of such
  transferor Bank or is another Bank, no such consent shall be
  required; and provided, further, that if such assignment is of
  a proportionate part of a Bank's rights and obligations, the
  portion of such Bank's Commitment which is assigned shall be
  not less than $5,000,000.  Upon execution and delivery of such
  instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor
  Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between
  such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be
  a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights
  and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in
  such instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall
  be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding
  extent, and no further consent or action by any party shall be
  required.  Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to
  this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the
  Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if
  required, new Notes are issued to the Assignee.  In connection
  with any such assignment, the transferor Bank shall pay to the
  Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in
  the amount of $2,500.  If the Assignee is not incorporated
  under the laws of the United States of America or a state
  thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest
  or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the
  Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from
  deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
  taxes in accordance with Section 2.14. 
  
         (d)  Any Bank may at any time, without the consent
  of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or any portion of its
  rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal Reserve
  Bank.  No such assignment shall release the transferor Bank
  from its obligations hereunder. 
  
         (e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of
  any Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater
  payment under Section 8.03 than such Bank would have been
  entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
  unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written
  consent or by reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03
  requiring such Bank to designate a different Applicable
  Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when
  the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not
  exist. 
  
         SECTION 10.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks
  represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that it in
  good faith is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined
  in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance
  of the credit provided for in this Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 10.08.  Governing Law.  This Agreement and
  each Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
  with the laws of the State of New York. 
  
         SECTION 10.09.  Counterparts; Integration.  This
  Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of
  which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
  signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 
  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
  understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and
  all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written,
  relating to the subject matter hereof. 
  
         SECTION 10.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE
  BORROWER, THE GUARANTOR, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY
  IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
  LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
  THE NOTES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 
    <PAGE>
         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused
  this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
  authorized officers as of the day and year first above
  written.

         For value received, The Turner Corporation, a
  Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), promises to pay to the
  order of
  
  (the "Bank"), for the account of its Applicable Lending
  Office, the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by the
  Bank to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement referred
  to below on the last day of the Interest Period relating to
  such Loan.  The Borrower promises to pay interest on the
  unpaid principal amount of each such Loan on the dates and at
  the rate or rates provided for in the Credit Agreement.  All
  such payments of principal and interest shall be made in
  lawful money of the United States in Federal or other

         All Loans made by the Bank, the respective types and

  hereof, appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing
  information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding
  shall be endorsed by the Bank on the schedule attached hereto,
  or on a continuation of such schedule attached to and made a
  part hereof, which endorsements shall be, in the absence of
  manifest error, presumptive evidence of the amount of Loans
  outstanding at the time of such transfer; provided that the
  failure of the Bank to make any such recordation or
  endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower
  hereunder or under the Credit Agreement.

                                 OPINION OF
                           COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY
  
  
  
  
  
                                    [Effective Date]
  
  
  To the Banks and the Agent
    Referred to Below
  c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
    of New York, as Agent
  60 Wall Street
  New York, New York  10260
  
  Dear Sirs:
  
  
         We have acted as counsel for The Turner Corporation,
  a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), in connection with
  the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of
  December 30, 1992 among the Borrower, Turner Construction
  Company, a New York corporation, as Guarantor (the
  "Guarantor"), the banks listed on the signature pages thereof
  and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Agent. 
  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as
  therein defined. 
  
         We have examined originals or copies, certified or
  otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents,
  corporate records, certificates of public officials and other
  instruments and have conducted such other investigations of
  fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for
  purposes of this opinion. 
  
         Based upon the foregoing and such examination of law
  as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that:
  
         1.  Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor is a
  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
  standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, and
  has all corporate powers required to carry on its business as
  now conducted. 
  
         2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
  Borrower and the Guarantor of the Credit Agreement and by the
  Borrower of the Notes and are within the Borrower's and the
  Guarantor's respective corporate powers, have been duly
  authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no
  action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental
  body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute
  a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation
  or of the respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws
  of the Borrower and the Guarantor or of any agreement,
  judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument of
  which we are aware binding upon the Borrower or the Guarantor
  or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien under any
  agreement of which we are aware on any asset of the Borrower
  or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  
         3.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and
  binding agreement of the Borrower and the Guarantor, and the
  Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the
  Borrower, in each case enforceable against the Borrower or the
  Guarantor, as the case may be, in accordance with their
  respective terms, except as (i) the enforceability thereof may
  be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or
  similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii)
  rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable
  remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general
  applicability. 
  
         4.  There is no action, suit or proceeding of which
  we are aware pending against, or to the best of our knowledge
  threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its
  Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any
  governmental body, agency or official which in any manner
  draws into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or
  the Notes.

  Dear Sirs:
  
  
         I am General Counsel of The Turner Corporation, a
  Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and Turner Construction
  Company, a New York corporation (the Guarantor"). 
  
         I have examined the Credit Agreement (the "Credit
  Agreement") dated as of December 30, 1992 among the Borrower,
  Guarantor, the banks listed on the signature pages thereof and
  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Agent, as well
  as originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
  my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
  certificates of public officials and other instruments and
  have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I
  have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this
  opinion.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used
  herein as therein defined. 
  
         Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion
  that:
  
         1.  Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor is a
  corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
  standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, and
  has all corporate powers and all material governmental
  licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
  carry on its business as now conducted. 
  
         2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
  Borrower and the Guarantor of the Credit Agreement and by the
  Borrower of the Notes do not contravene, or constitute a
  default under, any provision of any agreement, judgment,
  injunction, order, decree or other instrument of which I am
  aware binding upon the Borrower or the Guarantor or result in
  the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the
  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. 
  
         3.  There is no action, suit or proceeding of which
  I am aware pending against, or to the best of my knowledge
  threatened against or affecting, the Borrower or any of its
  Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any
  governmental body, agency or official, in which there is a
  reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could
  materially adversely affect the business, consolidated
  financial position or consolidated results of operations of
  the Borrower its Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a
  whole or which in any manner draws into question the validity
  of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.

  To the Banks and the Agent
    Referred to Below
  c/o Morgan Guaranty Trust Company
    of New York, as Agent
  60 Wall Street
  New York, New York  10260
  
  Dear Sirs:
  
  
         We have participated in the preparation of the
  Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of December
  30, 1992 among The Turner Corporation, a Delaware corporation
  (the "Borrower"), Turner Construction Company, a New York
  corporation, as Guarantor (the "Guarantor"), the banks listed
  on the signature pages thereof (the "Banks") and Morgan
  Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as Agent (the "Agent"),
  and have acted as special counsel for the Agent for the
  purpose of rendering this opinion pursuant to Section 3.01(d)
  of the Credit Agreement.  Terms defined in the Credit
  Agreement are used herein as therein defined. 
  
         We have examined originals or copies, certified or
  otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents,
  corporate records, certificates of public officials and other
  instruments and have conducted such other investigations of
  fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for
  purposes of this opinion. 
  
         Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the
  opinion that:
  
         1.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
  Borrower and the Guarantor of the Credit Agreement and by the
  Borrower of the Notes are within the Borrower's and the
  Guarantor's respective corporate powers and have been duly
  authorized by all necessary corporate action. 
  
         2.  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and
  binding agreement of the Borrower and the Guarantor, and the
  Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the
  Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with their
  respective terms, except as (i) the validity, binding nature
  or enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
  insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting
  creditors' rights generally and (ii) rights of acceleration
  and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by
  equitable principles of general applicability. 
  
         In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no
  opinion as to the effect (if any) of any law of any
  jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any Bank
  is located which limits the rate of interest that such Bank
  may charge or collect. 
  
                            Very truly yours,

         WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement
  (the "Agreement") relates to the Credit Agreement dated as of
  December 30, 1992 among the Borrower, Turner Construction
  Company, as Guarantor, the Assignor and the other Banks party
  thereto, as Banks, and the Agent (the "Credit Agreement");
  
         WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement, the
  Assignor has a Commitment to make Loans to the Borrower in an
  aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
  exceed $__________;
  
         WHEREAS, Loans made to the Borrower by the Assignor
  under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount
  of $__________ are outstanding at the date hereof; and
  
         WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the
  Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit
  Agreement in respect of a portion of its Commitment thereunder
  in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned Amount"),
  together with a corresponding portion of its outstanding
  Loans, and the Assignee proposes to accept assignment of such
  rights and assume the corresponding obligations from the
  Assignor on such terms;
  
         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
  and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
  agree as follows:
  
         SECTION 1.  Definitions. All capitalized terms not
  otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
  set forth in the Credit Agreement. 
  
         SECTION 2.  Assignment.  The Assignor hereby assigns
  and sells to the Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor
  under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned
  Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment from
  the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the
  Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the
  Assigned Amount, including the purchase from the Assignor of
  the corresponding portion of the principal amount of the Loans
  made by the Assignor outstanding at the date hereof.  Upon the
  execution and delivery hereof by the Assignor, the Assignee,
  the Borrower and the Agent and the payment of the amounts
  specified in Section 3 required to be paid on the date hereof
  (i) the Assignee shall, as of the date hereof, succeed to the
  rights and be obligated to perform the obligations of a Bank
  under the Credit Agreement with a Commitment in an amount
  equal to the Assigned Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the
  Assignor shall, as of the date hereof, be reduced by a like
  amount and the Assignor released from its obligations under
  the Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations have been
  assumed by the Assignee.  The assignment provided for herein
  shall be without recourse to the Assignor. 
  
         SECTION 3.  Payments.  As consideration for the
  assignment and sale contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the
  Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date hereof in
  Federal funds an amount equal to $_________.  It is
  understood that commitment and/or facility fees accrued to the
  date hereof are for the account of the Assignor and such fees
  accruing from and including the date hereof are for the
  account of the Assignee.  Each of the Assignor and the
  Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount under
  the Credit Agreement which is for the account of the other
  party hereto, it shall receive the same for the account of
  such other party to the extent of such other party's interest
  therein and shall promptly pay the same to such other party. 
  
         SECTION 4.  Consent of the Borrower and the
  Agent/Agreement of the Borrower.  This Agreement is
  conditioned upon the consent of the Borrower and the Agent
  pursuant to Section 10.06(c) of the Credit Agreement.  The
  execution of this Agreement by the Borrower and the Agent is
  evidence of this consent.  Pursuant to Section 10.06(c) of the
  Credit Agreement, the Borrower agrees to execute and deliver a
  substitute Note payable to the order of the Assignee to
  evidence the assignment and assumption provided for herein. 
  
         SECTION 5.  Non-Reliance on Assignor.  The Assignor
  makes no representation or warranty in connection with, and
  shall have no responsibility with respect to, the solvency,
  financial condition, or statements of the Borrower, or the
  validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower
  in respect of the Credit Agreement or any Note.  The Assignee
  acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
  on the Assignor, and based on such documents and information
  as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
  decision to enter into this Agreement and will continue to be
  responsible for making its own independent appraisal of the
  business, affairs and financial condition of the Borrower. 
  
         SECTION 6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be
  governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
  State of New York.

shall not otherwise be assignable by the Company.
