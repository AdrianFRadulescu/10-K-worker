ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT or the Trust)  is a
self-administered qualified equity real estate investment trust.  The Trust's
business consists of the ownership of income-producing real estate properties
principally in the Washington, D.C.  metropolitan area.  Upon the purchase of a
property, WRIT begins a program of improving the real estate to increase the
value and to improve the operations with the goals of generating higher rental
income and reducing expenses.

WRIT has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the
Internal Revenue Code.   Accordingly, WRIT is relieved of federal income taxes
provided that its ordinary income and capital gains are distributed to
shareholders in the form of dividends.  Over the last five years dividends paid
per share have been $.92 for 1994, $.89 for 1993, $.84 for 1992, $.79 for 1991
and $.73 for 1990 .  The indicated annualized dividend rate for 1995, based 
upon the March 31, 1995 dividend, is $.96.

The Trust currently owns a diversified portfolio consisting of eleven shopping
centers, thirteen office buildings, five high-rise apartment buildings and
eight business centers.  WRIT's principal objective is to invest in high
quality real estate in prime locations and to monitor closely the management of
these properties, including active leasing and ongoing capital improvement
programs.  The percentage of total real estate rental revenue by property group
for 1994, 1993 and 1992  and the percent leased as of December 31, 1994 were as
follows:

On a combined basis, WRIT's portfolio was 95% occupied in 1994 and 1993 and 93%
in 1992.

Total revenue was $45,511,482 for 1994,  $39,375,282 for 1993 and $34,132,217
for 1992.  In 1992 through 1994 there were acquisitions of seven office
buildings which increased this group's percentage of total revenue.  No single
tenant accounted for more than 2.25% of 1994 revenue.  Various agencies of the
U.S. Government are counted separately and include the Department of Commerce,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice, Social Security
Administration and U.S. Patent Office.  The larger non-federal government
tenants include the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, Pepsi
Cola, Giant Food, Crestar Bank, Evans, CVS, Rite-Aid, and Montgomery
County, Maryland.

Only one property - Montgomery Village Shopping Center described in Item 2
under "Shopping Centers" - accounted for more than 10% of total assets.  In
June 1994, WRIT acquired the Tycon II and Tycon III office buildings in one
transaction.  The aggregate  price for the two buildings represents more than
10% of total assets, however, the individual basis of each building does not.
No single property accounted for more than 10% of 1994 revenues.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS, (continued)

WRIT's properties compete for tenants with other properties throughout the
respective areas in which they are located.  All properties compete for tenants
on the basis of location, quality and rent charged.  Generally, the Trust has
experienced lower vacancy rates than those prevailing in the markets in which
its properties are located.

The actual day-to-day management functions at the properties owned by the Trust
are carried out by an independent management company.  WRIT closely monitors 
the activities of this company to assure the highest quality of services and
cost controls.  No WRIT Trustee or officer is a director or officer, or owns
any interest in the management company.

The Trust has purchased real estate primarily in the Washington Metropolitan
Area because of management's familiarity with the area and the growth and
stability of the Nation's Capital. The Trust believes that the stable
employment base provided by the federal government, supplemented by continuing
business growth in the region, makes the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area an
attractive real estate market.  Of the 37 properties owned by WRIT, 34 are in
the immediate Washington Metropolitan Area.  The three remaining are shopping
centers located in Westminster and Salisbury, Maryland and Dover, Delaware.

The Trust also competes for the opportunity to invest in additional property.
WRIT acquires property which management believes has strong growth potential in
prime locations.  WRIT typically is a cash buyer  for 100% ownership of the
property.  Over the years, properties have also been acquired by trades
involving tax-free exchanges.

Capital improvements are made by WRIT on an ongoing basis to its properties for
the purpose of maintaining and increasing their value.  Major improvements 
and/or renovations to the properties in 1994 and planned for 1995 are discussed 
by property category on pages 6-8.

Further description of the property groups is contained in Item 2, Properties
and in Schedule III.  Reference is also made to Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Trust's shares have been traded on the American Stock Exchange since 1971.
This provides the vehicle which allows shareholders to pool their funds to
share in the ownership of a large, diversified portfolio of income-producing
real estate while maintaining investment liquidity.  The Trust's shares were
split 3-for-1 in March, 1981, 3-for-2 in July, 1985, 3-for-2 in December, 1988
and 3- for-2 in May, 1992.

The number of persons employed by the Trust was 25 as of December 31, 1994.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The following schedule lists the Trust's real estate investment portfolio as of
December 31, 1994.  The Montgomery Village Center, listed as one property,
consists of one shopping center and office/townhouse units named the Village
Quarters.  Therefore, the total number of properties is 37.

As of December 31, 1994 the percent leased is the percentage of net rentable
space for which fully executed leases exist and may include signed leases for
space not yet occupied by the tenant.

Cost information is included in Schedule III of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

SHOPPING CENTERS
In February 1994, WRIT purchased land adjacent to its Wheaton Park
Shopping Center for a total contract purchase price of $173,000 and WRIT plans
to add additional retail and parking space to the center.   On June 30, 1994,
WRIT purchased The Shoppes of Foxchase in Alexandria, Virginia at a contract
purchase price of $8,800,000. The center has approximately 128,000 rentable
square feet. WRIT borrowed $9,000,000 for this acquisition and planned capital
improvements.  In 1994, cosmetic improvements were made to the property and as
of December 31, 1994, the property was 94% leased.   Foxchase renovations
planned for 1995 include re-paving of the rear alley and adding 54 parking 
spaces.

Major capital improvements completed during 1994 included:

         -       A new facade, landscaping, island additions and overall 
                 cosmetic improvements at Westminster Shopping Center

Major capital improvements planned in 1995 for shopping centers include
the completion in spring 1995 of the underground space conversion at Jenifer
One Mall into mezzanine level retail space, the majority of which is leased
to a national retail tenant.  An addition at Wheaton Park Shopping Center to
increase rentable area by 20,000 square feet is planned to commence in late
1995 or early 1996.

In 1994, average shopping center occupancy, excluding Foxchase, was 96%.  For
all shopping centers, the consolidated average occupancy was  97% for 1994,
1993 and 1992.

Most shopping center leases have automatic annual increases based on changes in
the Consumer Price Index.  In addition, these leases contain clauses for
reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and contingent
rentals for additional rents based on a percentage of a tenant's gross sales.

OFFICE BUILDINGS
On June 1, 1994,  WRIT acquired Tycon Plaza in Vienna, Virginia at a contract
purchase price of $21,250,000.  Tycon Plaza consists of two office buildings
containing approximately 293,000 rentable square feet.  WRIT borrowed
$9,000,000 and invested $12,800,000 of its own funds for the purchase and
planned capital improvements.  The Tycon Buildings were 71% occupied on
acquisition in June of 1994, and 90% occupied at December 31, 1994.  In 1994,
major capital improvements to Tycon II and III included HVAC repairs and
replacements (continuing into 1995), landscaping and a new roof at Tycon III.
1995 planned improvements to the Tycon Plaza buildings include new signage,
flagstone repairs and completion of major HVAC improvements that commenced in
1994.

OFFICE BUILDINGS, (CONTINUED)

In 1995, WRIT has major capital improvement plans for three of its office
buildings;  1901 Pennsylvania Avenue, One Metro Square, and 7700 Leesburg Pike.
Improvement plans at 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue include renovations to the main
lobby, common areas , elevator cabs, exterior cosmetic improvements and HVAC
equipment replacements.  At One Metro Square, WRIT plans to replace the roof,
renovate the elevator cabs and repair and replace elevator equipment.  At 7700
Leesburg Pike, WRIT plans to convert 20,000 square feet of existing upper-level
(surface) parking space into 20,000 square feet of enclosed office space.

In 1994, average building occupancy, excluding the Tycon Plaza office
buildings, was 95%.  For all office buildings, the consolidated average
occupancy was  89% for 1992, 94% for 1993 and 93% for 1994.  WRIT expects that
office building occupancy will continue to improve.

Office building leases generally have a three to five year term.  Most leases
have  automatic annual increases based on changes in the Consumer Price Index.

APARTMENT BUILDINGS

WRIT's five high-rise apartment buildings are well located and have a combined
total of approximately 1,200 units consisting of efficiency and one-two-or
three bedroom apartments.  Apartment leases are generally for periods of one
year or less. There is a continuous emphasis on the upgrading of the quality of
management and services to residents.  Improvement programs during 1992, 1993 
and 1994 have included remodeled lobbies, modernized kitchens and bathrooms, and
improved security.  These programs were designed to increase resident retention
and to enhance the appeal in the market.

In 1995, for all apartment properties, WRIT intends to continue its
modernization of kitchens and bathrooms for units not modernized in prior
years, and to modify the elevators and public restrooms in accordance with the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Improvement plans
at Country Club Towers and Wiltshire North include the installation of energy
management systems.  Wiltshire North improvement plans also include major
repairs to the HVAC system.  At Park Adams, major repairs to the swimming pool
and deck, replacement of building windows and improvements to the parking lot
lighting are planned.  For all of the Virginia apartment buildings, WRIT plans
to re-surface and re-stripe the parking lots in 1995.

Four of the apartment buildings are in nearby northern Virginia with convenient
transportation routes to downtown Washington.  Wiltshire North is on
Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C. and these apartments are subject to the
rent control laws of the District of Columbia. The laws provide landlords with
annual rent increases tied to the rate of inflation subject to an annual
maximum of 10% and also afford landlords the opportunity for additional rent
increases as units are re-rented to new tenants.  Occupancy rates for all
apartments were 94% for 1992, 95% for 1993 and 97% for 1994.

BUSINESS CENTERS

WRIT's business centers provide warehousing, distribution, research and
development and service business and office space to tenants as varied as the
U.S. Postal Service, Washington Golf Center, the District of Columbia
Metropolitan Police  Department, Pepsi Cola and the U.S. Department of
Commerce.

The Trust has historically paid dividends on a quarterly basis and there are
currently no restrictions on the Trust's present or future ability to pay such
dividends. Dividends are normally paid based on the Trust's cash flow from
operating activities.  The indicated annual dividend rate was $.96 as of March
1995.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WRIT's fundamental emphasis is on the growth of cash flow from operating
activities.  Dividends to shareholders are based upon these cash flows.  WRIT's
capital improvements, leasing and management, and acquisitions of additional
properties are the major contributors to sustained growth of cash flows.

Occupancy rates have a major impact on rental revenue.  Other factors such as
new or renewal leases at market rates, CPI based annual rental rate increases,
increases in rentable area, new property acquisitions and certain other capital
expenditures also influence rental revenue.

The percentage increase (decrease) in real estate rental revenue from 1992 to
1993 and from 1993 to 1994 by property type was as follows:

<TABLE>

                                                1992/1993                         1993/1994
                                                ---------                         ---------
<S>                                               <C>                               <C>
Office Buildings                                   16%                               34%
Apartments                                          2%                                4%
Shopping Centers                                   40%                                5%
Business Centers                                   (1%)                              17%
</TABLE>

During 1994, WRIT's office building group achieved increases of 34% in revenues
and 36% in operating income, mostly due to the acquisitions of the three
Heritage office buildings in November 1993 and the two Tycon Plaza office
buildings in June of 1994.

The Tycon office buildings were 71% occupied upon acquisition in June of 1994,
90% occupied at December 31, 1994, and are 92% occupied as of February 28,
1995.  The Heritage properties were acquired in November, 1993 and include
three office buildings (the Lexington, Saratoga and Brandywine) and one 
business center (the Charleston).  At December 31, 1993, and 1994, the
Lexington and Brandywine office buildings were 100% leased and the Saratoga was
97% and 96% leased, respectively.

The income growth from office buildings owned all three years in 1992,
1993 and 1994, was due to increases in rental rates and improved occupancy
levels at 7700 Leesburg Pike.  This growth was partially offset by a
substantial increase in vacancy during 1994 at the 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue
property, which lost 3 major tenants resulting in an occupancy level of 52% 
at year end.  The Trust commenced a major capital improvement program at 1901 
Pennsylvania Avenue in 1994 in order to assure the expeditious lease-up of 
this property (refer to Item 2, Office Buildings).

The increase of 16% in real estate rental revenue from 1992 to 1993 for office
buildings was primarily attributable to the June and July 1992 acquisitions of
Arlington Financial Center and 515 King Street, respectively.

During 1994, WRIT's apartment group showed increases of 4% in revenues and 7%
in operating income, due to the combination of a 2% increase in rental rates
and an overall increase in occupancy to 97% in 1994 from 95% in 1993, combined
with an increase in operating expenses of only 1%.





                                      10
<PAGE>   11
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)

During 1994, WRIT's shopping center group showed an increase of 5% in revenues
and 3% in operating income, due to the acquisition of the Shoppes at Foxchase
in June of 1994.

Excluding the Shoppes at Foxchase, shopping center revenue was down 1% and
operating income down 4%.  Major elements of the decrease in operating income
included a 10% increase in overall operating expenses and the vacancy at Jenifer
Mall to accommodate renovations.  (Refer to Item 2, Shopping Centers.)  WRIT 
has a lease with a national retail discount chain for a majority of the
Jenifer Mall vacancy.  This lease is scheduled to commence in May, 1995.

The 40% increase in real estate rental revenue from 1992 to 1993 for
shopping centers was due primarily to the acquisition of Montgomery Village
Shopping Center on December 30, 1992.  Operating income increased 37% from 1992
to 1993 as a result of that acquisition as well.

During 1994, WRIT's business center group showed increases of 17% in
revenues and 15% in operating income, due to the acquisition of the Charleston
business center in November of 1993 and major occupancy increases at the
Fullerton and Port Royal properties, only slightly offset by a vacancy increase
at the V Street property.

For 1994, excluding the Charleston business center, business center revenue was
up 4% and operating income was up 3%.  In 1994, rental rates for these business
centers declined 1% from 1993, but overall occupancy increased to 94% in 1994
from 89% in 1993.

The 1% decrease in business center real estate rental revenue from 1992 to 1993
was the result of a decline in occupancy levels.  Average occupancy in 1992 was
93% and this declined to 89% in 1993.

The average occupancy (for the entire real estate portfolio) of 95% for the
year 1993 remained at 95% for 1994.  This is compared to 93% for 1992.

Real estate operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 31% for 1994 as
compared to 30% for 1993 and 1992.  This increase is primarily attributable to
the fact that operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher for
office building properties than all other property types within the portfolio.
WRIT's percentage of office buildings within its portfolio has increased 
from 38% at December 31, 1993 to 43% of the portfolio as of December
31, 1994.  This 13% increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of
Heritage Business Park (three office buildings) in November, 1993 and Tycon II
and III office buildings in June, 1994.

Other income declined from 1992 to 1993 due to substantial funds previously
invested in marketable securities being utilized for 1993 acquisitions and a
reduction in market interest rates earned on WRIT's marketable investment
securities.





                                      11
<PAGE>   12
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)

In 1994, other income (expense) became an expense/charge to operations in 1994 
as a result of the following:

         a)      A decline in interest income from 1993 to 1994 due to the use
                 of these funds for properties acquired in 1994.

         b)      At March 31, 1994, a marketable investment security was
                 written down to its estimated realizable value, resulting in a
                 charge of $799,571 to operations in the first quarter of 1994.
                 This security was sold in May, 1994 for its March 31, 1994
                 realizable value.

         c)      During 1994, WRIT was audited by a State Unclaimed Property
                 Division resulting in an assessment to WRIT of $270,521. 
                 This amount was charged to operations in the fourth quarter 
                 of 1994.

Interest expense was $614,162 for the year of 1994 as a result of the
$9,000,000 advance on the credit commitment on June 1, 1994 for the
acquisitions of Tycon Plaza and an additional advance of $9,000,000 for the
acquisition of The Shoppes of Foxchase on June 30, 1994.  (See Note F).
Interest  expense for 1993 was $61,462.  This declined significantly from
interest expense of $454,382 for 1992.  In 1992, WRIT prepaid four of its
mortgages, and in April, 1993, WRIT prepaid its only remaining mortgage.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

WRIT has utilized equity share offerings, long-term fixed interest rate debt,
lines of credit and cash flow from operations for its capital needs.  The WRIT
philosophy has been to acquire real estate with strong growth potential and to
improve its real estate holdings through carefully planned additions or
improvements to generate higher rental income, to reduce operating expenses or
both.

In February 1994, WRIT purchased land adjacent to its Wheaton Park shopping
center for a contract purchase price of $173,000.  WRIT plans to add 
additional retail and parking space to the center.  On June 1, 1994 WRIT 
acquired Tycon Plaza in Vienna, Virginia at a contract purchase price of 
$21,250,000.  Tycon Plaza consists of two office buildings containing 
approximately 293,000 rentable square feet.  WRIT borrowed $9,000,000 and 
invested $12,800,000 of its own funds for the purchase.  On June 30, 1994 
WRIT acquired The Shoppes at Foxchase in Alexandria, Virginia at a contract 
purchase price of $8,800,000.  The center has approximately 128,000 rentable 
square feet.  WRIT borrowed $9,000,000 for this acquisition.

Cash and marketable investment securities totaled approximately $2,736,000 at
December 31, 1994.  In addition to the 1994 acquisitions, 1994 capital
improvements were approximately $5,787,000.  Capital improvements to WRIT
properties in 1993 and 1992 were approximately $4,712,000 and $3,410,000,
respectively.

During 1993 and 1992, WRIT paid $1,088,000 and $9,715,000, respectively, in the
retirement of its last five mortgages.





                                      12

<PAGE>   13
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY - (continued)

External sources of capital are available to WRIT from its existing unsecured
credit commitments as described in Notes F and K to the financial statements
and management believes that additional sources of capital are available from
selling additional shares and/or the issuance of debt.

Cash flow from operating activities has been more than adequate to meet
dividend requirements.

Management believes that it has the liquidity and the capital resources
necessary to meet all of its known obligations and to make additional property
acquisitions when appropriate.  WRIT continues to pursue acquisition
opportunities and capital improvement projects to enhance long-term growth.

WRIT is a qualified real estate investment trust (REIT), and is not required to
pay income taxes since it distributes substantially all of its real estate
trust taxable income to shareholders.

                      Report of Independent Accountants



To the Trustees and Shareholders of
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust


In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the index appearing under
item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 14 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust at December 31,
1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Trust's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                    WASHINGTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A: ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT) operates in a manner intended to
enable it to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code").  According to the Code, a trust which distributes at
least 95% of its real estate trust taxable income to its shareholders each year
and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of
its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders.  Accordingly, no
provision for Federal income taxes is required.

Cash equivalents consist of investments readily convertible to known amounts of
cash generally with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally
one year or less, and commercial properties are leased under operating leases
with terms of generally three to five years.  WRIT recognizes rental income
from its residential and commercial leases when earned, which is not materially
different than revenue recognition on a straight line basis.

Buildings and improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives not exceeding 50 and 30 years, respectively.
Depreciation expense for Federal income tax purposes differs from that reported
for financial statement purposes due to the use of different lives and
depreciation methods.  As of December 31, 1994 the net assets as reported in
WRIT's financial statements exceeded the net basis for Federal Income Tax
purposes by 14,571,577 due to a lower basis of certain real estate assets 
acquired by tax free exchanges.

Cash equivalents, marketable investment securities, mortgage note receivable,
rents and other receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts 
payable and other liabilities, tenant security deposits, advance rents and 
line of credit payable are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate 
their fair values.

Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent
information available to WRIT as of December 31, 1994.  Although WRIT is not
aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value
amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of
these financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value
may differ significantly from the carrying amounts.

NOTE B: MARKETABLE INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Marketable investment securities are considered available for sale and at
December 31, 1994 and 1993, the carrying value approximates market.  Marketable
investment securities, including accrued interest, consist of the following:

On June 1, 1994, WRIT acquired Tycon Plaza, two office buildings with
approximately 293,000 square feet in Vienna, Virginia, at a contract purchase
price of $21,250,000.  On June 30, 1994 WRIT acquired The Shoppes of Foxchase,
a shopping center located in Alexandria, Virginia at a contract purchase price
of $8,800,000.  The center has approximately 128,000 rentable square feet.  In
June 1993, WRIT sold its headquarters building for $1,050,000 and recognized a
gain of $741,217.  Proceeds received were $176,000 in cash and $874,000 in a
mortgage note receivable.  The mortgage bears interest at 9% and matures in
June 1996.  Principal payments received in 1993 totaled $74,000.  Interest only 
is payable monthly from December 1993 until June, 1996.  At that time, all
accrued and unpaid interest and principal are due in full.  At December 31,
1994, the fair value of the mortgage note receivable approximates its carrying
amount.

NOTE D: MORTGAGES
During 1993, WRIT paid in full its only remaining  mortgage, which had a
principal balance of $1,115,193 at December 31, 1992.  The mortgage had an
interest rate of 8.5%.  Interest paid on mortgages during the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $61,462 and $454,382, respectively.

NOTE E: SHORT - TERM BANK LOAN
WRIT borrowed $21,000,000 for the purchase of Montgomery Village Shopping
Center on December 29, 1992.  The loan was repaid on January 22, 1993 from the
proceeds of the sale of certain marketable investment securities which had
served collateral for the loan.  The interest income and realized gain from
the sale of the marketable investment securities exceeded the 4.6% fixed
interest paid to the bank for the 25 days the loan was outstanding.

NOTE F:  LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE
On June 1, 1994, WRIT obtained an unsecured interim credit commitment from a
bank in the amount of $20,000,000 for the express purpose of purchasing income
producing property.  On June 1, 1994, WRIT borrowed $9,000,000 on this credit
facility for the acquisition of Tycon Plaza and on June 30, 1994, WRIT borrowed
an additional $9,000,000 for the purchase of The Shoppes of Foxchase.  Interest
only was payable monthly on the unpaid principal balance at the rate of LIBOR
plus 1.10%.  At June 30, 1994 this rate was approximately 5.7%.  On August 26,
1994, the $20,000,000 interim credit commitment was replaced with an unsecured
credit commitment of $25,000,000 and the outstanding advances of $18,000,000
were transferred to this new commitment.  Borrowings of $18,000,000 as of
December 31, 1994 bear interest at the rate of 6.3125% until May 25, 1995.
Interest only is payable monthly, in arrears, on the unpaid principal balance.
All unpaid interest and principal are due August 25, 1995 and can be prepaid
prior to this date without any pre-payment fee.  Any new advances shall bear
interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on WRIT's interest coverage ratio.

NOTE F: LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE - (continued)
This credit agreement provides the option to WRIT to convert any advances or
portions thereof into a term loan at any time after February 26, 1995 and
prior to August 25, 1995.  The principal amount of each term loan, if any,
shall be repaid on August 26, 1998.  Such term loan(s) may be prepaid subject
to a prepayment fee.

The $25,000,000 credit commitment, requires WRIT to pay the lender an unused
commitment fee at the rate of 0.25% per annum, on the amount by which
$25,000,000  exceeds the balance of outstanding advances and term loans.  This
fee is payable monthly beginning September, 1994 until August 25, 1995.  This
commitment also contains certain covenants which WRIT is required to meet
periodically.

NOTE G: SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS
Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The weighted average
shares outstanding were 28,239,420, 28,223,307 and 26,910,046 in 1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

NOTE I: PENSION PLAN
WRIT maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all eligible
employees.  Benefits under the plan are generally based on years of service and
final average pay.  The pension assets include U.S. Government Agency
obligations, U.S. Treasury money market fund and interest-bearing certificates
of deposit.  Pension costs are accrued and funded annually from entry date in
the plan to projected retirement date and include service costs for benefits
earned during the period and interest costs on the projected benefit obligation
less the return on plan assets.  Pension costs were $90,000,  $164,000 and
$293,000 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The actual return (loss) on
plan assets was $27,000,  $(31,000) and $19,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992
respectively.  The assumed long-term rate of return is 8.00%.  Plan obligations
in excess of amounts permitted under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 1982 are accrued as a liability of WRIT and included in total pension
cost.  The funded status of the plan is:
