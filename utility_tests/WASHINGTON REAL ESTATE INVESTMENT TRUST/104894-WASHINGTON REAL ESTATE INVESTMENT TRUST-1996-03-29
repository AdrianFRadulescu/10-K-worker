ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT or the Trust)  is a
self-administered qualified equity real estate investment trust.  The Trust's
business consists of the ownership of income-producing real estate properties
principally in the Greater Washington-Baltimore Region.  The Trust has a
fundamental strategy of regional focus, diversified property type ownership and
conservative financial management.

WRIT has elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the
Internal Revenue Code.   Accordingly, WRIT is relieved of federal income taxes
provided that capital gains and at least 95% of its ordinary income  are
distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.  Over the last five years
dividends paid per share have been $.99 for 1995, $.92 for 1994, $.89 for 1993,
$.84 for 1992 and $.79 for 1991 .  The indicated annualized dividend rate for
1996, based upon the March 29, 1996 dividend, is $1.00.

The Trust has purchased real estate primarily in the Greater
Washington-Baltimore Region because of management's familiarity with the
region, its expected growth and proven stability.  The CMSA (Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area) which includes the Greater Washington-Baltimore
region is the nation's fourth largest with a population exceeding 6.9 million.
The region is ranked #1 in the U.S. in median household income and percentage
of population with education at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.

Total non-farm employment in the Washington area has grown 88% from 1.6 million
jobs in 1970 to 3.1 million jobs in 1995, while the percentage of Federal
Government employment in the region has decreased from 38.3% to 15.6%.  Since
January 1980, seasonally-adjusted unemployment in the Washington area has
averaged 4.1%  with December 1995 unemployment standing at 3.6%.

The Greater Washington-Baltimore region is a leader in the rapidly growing
technology/infocom and biotech/health care industries.  It is the center of the
U.S. Space Commerce/Satellite Industry with Comsat, GTE Spacenet, Intelsat and
NASA all located here.  The region has the nation's second highest
concentration of technology companies and the third highest concentration of
Biotech companies.

This region is also the headquarters for several of the largest U.S. and
international financial institutions including the World Bank, International
Monetary Fund, Inter-American Development Bank, Export-Import Bank, Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp
(Freddie Mac) and the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae).

Federal spending cuts nationally have caused Federal contractors to move closer
to their clients in order to retain business.  As a result, while Federal
spending decreases nationally, it becomes more concentrated and grows in the
Washington area.  Total Federal procurement (outsourcing) decreased 5% 
nationally from 1991 to 1994, but has increased in the Washington area by 
over 23%.  Despite a decrease of 1.7% in national procurement in 1994, 
Washington area procurement grew 11%.  In 1995, Washington area Federal 
procurement grew at 9.2%, about double the national rate.  U.S. Department of 
Defense  procurement, while shrinking nearly 10% nationally, grew 22% from 
1991-1994 in the Washington area.

The Trust currently owns a diversified portfolio consisting of twelve shopping
centers, fourteen office buildings, five high-rise apartment buildings and ten
industrial distribution centers.  WRIT's principal objective is to invest in
high quality real estate in prime locations and to monitor closely the
management of these properties, including active leasing and ongoing capital
improvement programs.  The percentage of total real estate rental revenue by
property group for 1995, 1994 and 1993 and the percent leased as of December
31, 1995 were as follows:

*1901 Pennsylvania Avenue underwent a major renovation in 1995.  See discussion
 on page 9 regarding office building occupancy levels.

On a combined basis, WRIT's portfolio was 93% occupied in 1995 and 95% in 1994
and 1993.

Total revenue was $52,597,497 for 1995, $45,511,482 for 1994 and $39,375,282
for 1993 .  In 1993 through 1995 there were acquisitions of seven office
buildings, two shopping centers and three industrial distribution centers.
These acquisitions were the primary reason for the shifting of each group's
percentage of total revenue.  No single tenant accounted for more than 2.05% of
1995 revenue, 2.25% of 1994 or 2.5% of 1993.  Various agencies of the U.S.
Government are counted separately and include the Department of Commerce,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Postal Service, Social Security
Administration and U.S. Patent Office.  All federal government tenants in the
aggregate accounted for less than 4.25% of WRIT's 1995 total revenue.  The
larger non-federal government tenants include Sprint Communications, T.J. Maxx,
District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, Pepsi Cola, Giant Food,
Crestar Bank, Evans, CVS, Rite-Aid, George Washington University, Montgomery
County, Maryland and the State of Maryland.

As of December 31, 1995, no single property accounted for more than 10% of
total assets or more than 10% of total revenues.

The actual day-to-day property management functions at the properties owned by
the Trust are carried out by an independent management company.  WRIT closely
monitors the activities of this company to assure the highest quality of
service and cost effectiveness.  No WRIT Trustee or officer is a director or
officer of, or owns any interest in the management company.

The Trust expects to continue investing in additional income producing
property.  Philosophically, WRIT management invests only in properties which it
believes will continue to increase in income and value.  WRIT's properties
compete for tenants with other properties throughout the respective areas in
which they are located.  All properties compete for tenants on the basis of
location, quality  and rent charged.

Historically WRIT has acquired 100% ownership in property.  However, in 1995
WRIT formed a subsidiary partnership in which WRIT currently owns substantially
all of the partnership interest. As of December 31, 1995, the WRIT partnership
has acquired two properties for cash contributed by WRIT.

WRIT intends to use the WRIT partnership to offer property owners an
opportunity to contribute properties in exchange for WRIT limited partnership
units.  Such a transaction will enable property owners to diversify their
holdings and to obtain a tax deferred contribution for WRIT limited partnership
units rather than make a taxable cash sale.  To date, no such transactions have
occurred.  The terms of the partnership agreement provide that the
partnership's limited partnership units are entitled to distributions
substantially equivalent to the distributions on WRIT shares.  A holder of
limited partnership units in the WRIT partnership will be entitled to demand
that the partnership redeem the holder's units upon 10 business days notice.

PROPERTY REPOSITIONINGS

Chevy Chase Metro Plaza

In the second quarter of 1995, WRIT completed the renovation and expansion of
Chevy Chase Metro Plaza (formerly known as Jenifer One Center).  To accomplish
this, WRIT negotiated the termination of the below-market lease of the Jenifer
Theater, added 11,700 square feet to the property through the addition of a
floor in the double height portion of the former theater and installed an
escalator between the street level and the newly created floor.

T.J. Maxx has leased this newly created floor and the original lower level
floor at a per square foot rate that is double the Jenifer Theater rate.  TGI
Friday's has leased the former American Cafe space with occupancy expected by
the third quarter of 1996.  The leases for the other tenants in the property
have been extended at substantially increased rental rates. At this time, there
remains only one 934 square foot space vacant in the property.  As a result of
these actions, the property's projected operating income will increase by over
60% from pre-renovation full occupancy.

Prince William Plaza

As of January 1, 1995, Prince William Plaza was 72% leased, but only 33%
occupied as Blockbuster and Rite-Aid had vacated their spaces with years
remaining on their leases.  While Rite-Aid, with below market rent, and
Blockbuster remained liable for their rent, the vacated stores caused
substantial negative impact on the other tenants in the center.

During 1995, WRIT approached Rite-Aid and negotiated an early termination of
the lease, which included Rite-Aid paying a penalty fee.  This former Rite-Aid
space has now been leased to a theater operator at more than 3 times the
previous rent and the Blockbuster space has been leased to another video store.
Additional new leases, along with the remaining in-place tenants has brought
the Center to 96% leased.  Prince William Plaza's pro-forma operating income is
expected to be 34% higher than its 1994/1995 average.

1901 Pennsylvania Avenue

During 1995, WRIT completed a major renovation to the 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue
office building.  Renovations to the main lobby, elevator cabs,  hallways and
restrooms were supplemented by modernizations of the elevator equipment and
mechanical systems and installation of a new roof and solar film on windows.
Asbestos removal in the building is ongoing, concurrent with tenant buildouts.
During 1995, the building was 57% occupied.  With the completion of the
renovations in the third quarter, leasing activity has increased.  As of 
March 15, 1996, the building is 65% leased and negotiations are ongoing 
with additional interested potential tenants.

SHOPPING CENTERS

On August 22, 1995 WRIT acquired Frederick County Square, a shopping center,
containing  approximately 233,000 rentable square feet of retail space located
on U.S. Route 40 in Frederick, Maryland for an acquisition cost of $13,392,000.
WRIT used $5,640,000 of the net proceeds from the July 1995 public offering
(See Capital Resources and Liquidity) and assumed an existing mortgage of
$7,752,000.

SHOPPING CENTERS (continued)

Major improvements during 1995 included:

Chevy Chase Metro Plaza           -        Installation of an additional floor
                                           containing 11,700 square feet of
                                           rentable area and escalators to the
                                           street level
Prince William Plaza              -        Parking lot repaving and cosmetic
                                           renovations including new facia,
                                           canopy lights and painting
The Shoppes of Foxchase*          -        Construction of a retaining wall and
                                           additional parking, repaving and
                                           partial roof replacement

Major improvements planned for 1996 include:

Wheaton Park Shopping Center      -        Construction of a 25,000 square foot
                                           addition
Frederick County Square*          -        Parking lot repairs, lights and
                                           upgraded pylons

* These improvements were projected during acquisition due diligence.

Occupancy rates for the Shopping Center Group averaged 97% in 1993 and 1994 and
94% in 1995.  The primary reasons for the decreased Shopping Center Group
occupancy level in 1995 were vacancy increases  at the Concord and Montgomery
Village Shopping Centers and the property repositionings at Prince William
Plaza and Chevy Chase Metro Plaza.  Concord Shopping Center averaged 92%
occupancy during 1995 vs. 100% in 1994 due to lease expirations.  Montgomery
Village Center averaged 93% in 1995 vs. 97% in 1994, primarily due to the
bankruptcy of So Fro Fabrics.  With the bankruptcy of Evans Jewelers, the
center is 77% leased as of March 15, 1996.  Prince William Plaza and Chevy
Chase Metro Plaza underwent significant capital improvements and releasing
during 1995 and are now 96% and 98% leased, respectively.

Most shopping center leases have automatic annual increases based on changes in
the Consumer Price Index or agreed-upon percentages.  In addition, these leases
generally contain clauses for reimbursement for real estate taxes and common
area maintenance costs, and some leases provide for contingent rents based on a
percentage of the tenant's gross sales.

* These improvements were projected during acquisition due diligence.

Occupancy rates for the Office Building Group overall averaged 94% in 1993, 93%
in 1994 and 89% in 1995.  The primary reason for the decreased Office Building
Group occupancy level in 1995 was the vacancy at 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue
caused by the previously mentioned major renovations during 1995.  However,
excluding 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue, 1995 Office Building Group occupancy
averaged 94%.  As of March 15, 1996, 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue is 65% leased, as
compared to its average 1995 level of 57%.

Office building leases generally have a three to five year term.  Most leases
have  automatic annual increases based on changes in the Consumer Price Index
or agreed-upon percentages and additional pass through reimbursements for
increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses.

APARTMENTS

WRIT's five high-rise apartment buildings are well located and have a combined
total of 1,204 units consisting of efficiency and one, two or three bedroom
apartments.  Apartment leases are generally for periods of one year or less.
There is a continuous emphasis on the upgrading of the units, quality of
management and services to residents with the goal to increase resident
retention and to enhance market place acceptance.

Four of the apartment buildings are in nearby northern Virginia with convenient
transportation routes to downtown Washington.  3801 Connecticut Avenue is in
Washington, D.C. and these apartments are subject to the rent control laws of
the District of Columbia. The laws provide landlords with annual rent increases
tied to the rate of inflation subject to an annual maximum of 10% and also
afford landlords the opportunity for additional rent increases as units are
re-rented to new tenants.

Major improvements during 1995 included:

All Apartments                -   Turnover upgrades (appliances, cabinets,
                                  carpet and wallpaper)
3801 Connecticut Avenue       -   Replacement of the air conditioning lines and
                                  removal of asbestos in the boiler room
Park Adams                    -   Resurfacing of the pool deck and repair of

</TABLE>

During 1995, WRIT's Office Building Group had increases of 22% in revenues and
17.4% in operating income due primarily to the acquisition of the Tycon II and
III office buildings in 1994 and the 6110 Executive Boulevard and 1220 19th
Street office buildings in 1995.  The Tycon buildings were 71% occupied at
acquisition in June of 1994 but averaged 94% occupancy during 1995.   6110
Executive Boulevard was acquired by the Trust January 31,1995 and averaged 94%
occupancy during 1995.  1220 19th Street was acquired by the Trust in November,
1995.  This property was 90% leased at December 31, 1995.

WRIT's Apartment Group had increases of 3% in revenues and 2% in operating
income during 1995.  This increase was the result of a 3% increase in rents
more than offsetting a 3.3% increase in operating expenses and a 1% decrease in
occupancy to 96%.  The major cause of the 3.3% increase in operating expenses
was the adoption of a more conservative capitalization policy regarding
repairs, replacements, and improvements.

During 1995, WRIT's Shopping Center Group had increases of 16% in revenues and
operating income due primarily to the repositioning of Chevy Chase Metro Plaza,
as well as the acquisition of the Shoppes of Foxchase in 1994 and Frederick
County Square in 1995.

During 1995, WRIT's Industrial Distribution Center Group had increases of 20%
in revenues and 23% in operating income.  This was due primarily to significant
occupancy increases at Shirley - 395 and Fullerton, rental rate increases
averaging 3.1% throughout the group, and the 1995 acquisition of Tech 100
Industrial Park.  In December 1995, WRIT acquired Crossroads Distribution
Center, a 100% leased property.   Occupancy rates for the Industrial
Distribution Center group overall averaged 97% in 1995.

REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUE: 1994 VERSUS 1993

Total revenues for 1994 increased $6.1 million to $45.5 million from $39.4
million in 1993.  The percentage increase in real estate rental revenue from
1993 to 1994 by property type was as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)

The increase of 34% in real estate revenue from 1993 to 1994 for office
buildings was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of the three office
buildings in November 1993 and the two office buildings in June of 1994.

During 1994, WRIT's Apartment Group had increases of 4% in revenues and 7% in
operating income, due to the combination of a 2% increase in rental rates and
an overall increase in occupancy to 97% in 1994 from 95% in 1993, combined with
an increase in operating expenses of only 1%.

During 1994, WRIT's Shopping Center Group had an increase of 5% in revenues and
3% in operating income, due to the acquisition of The Shoppes at Foxchase in
June of 1994.

During 1994, WRIT's Industrial Distribution Center Group had increases of 17%
in revenues and 15% in operating income, due to the acquisition of the
Charleston Business Center in November of 1993 and major occupancy increases at
the Fullerton and Port Royal properties, only slightly offset by a vacancy
increase at the V street property.

OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Real estate operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 32% for 1995 as
compared to 31% for 1994 and 30% for 1993.  This increase is  attributable to
the decline  in occupancy levels in 1995 and to the fact that operating
expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher for office building properties
than the other property types within the WRIT portfolio.  WRIT's percentage of
office buildings within its entire real estate portfolio has increased from 43%
at December 31, 1994 to 47% as of December 31, 1995.  This increase is
attributable primarily to the acquisitions of 6110 Executive Boulevard in
January, 1995 and 1220 19th Street in November, 1995.

In 1995, other income (expense) increased from 1994 due to investment earnings
in 1995 on the net proceeds of approximately $48,000,000 from the sale of
3,500,000 shares of beneficial interest.  1995 other income (expense) also
increased as a result of a 1994 charge of $799,571 to other income (expense)
for the sale of a marketable investment security.  Also in 1994, there was a
charge to other income (expense) of $271,000 as the result of an audit
assessment by the State of Maryland unclaimed property division.

1995 interest expense was $1,920,479 due to $18,000,000 of advances outstanding
until July 1995 on the line of credit borrowings from 1994 and $44,000,000 of
advances on the lines of credit to finance 1995 acquisitions.  $36,000,000 of
repayments on the advances from the lines of credit also occurred in 1995.
WRIT incurred $249,322 of interest expense on the mortgage note payable assumed
in August 1995 for the acquisition of Frederick County Square for a total 1995
interest expense of $2,169,801. Interest expense was $614,162 for 1994 as a
result of  advances on the credit commitment for the acquisitions of Tycon
Plaza and The Shoppes of Foxchase.   Interest  expense for 1993 was $61,462 for
a mortgage which was paid in full in that year.

General and administrative expenses were $3,355,199 for 1995 as compared to
$3,260,870 for 1994 and $2,858,035 for 1993.  The majority of the increase for
1995 as compared to 1994 is attributable to personnel additions since June of
1994 and continuing into 1995, partially offset by reduced pension costs and
the completion of severance pay in June, 1995 to WRIT's former Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, B. Franklin Kahn, who retired in March, 1995.  The
majority of the increase for 1994 as compared to 1993 is attributable to
personnel additions and increased shareholder expenses.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
WRIT has utilized the proceeds of share offerings, long-term fixed interest
rate debt, bank lines of credit and cash flow from operations for its capital
needs.  External sources of capital will continue to be available to WRIT from
its existing unsecured credit commitments and management believes that
additional sources of capital are available from selling additional shares
and/or the sale of long-term senior notes.  The funds raised would be used to
pay off any outstanding advances on our lines of credit and for new
acquisitions and capital improvements.

Cash flow from operating activities totaled $30,987,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1995 including net income of $26,103,000 and depreciation of
$5,084,000.  Increases in other assets of $395,000 were due to increases in
rents and other receivables, prepaid real estate taxes and insurance.
Increases in other liabilities was primarily due to increases in tenant
security deposits.  The majority of these increases were due to a larger
property portfolio.  Rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to
pay WRIT's operating expenses, interest expense and dividends to shareholders.
In 1995, WRIT paid dividends totaling $29,712,000.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 1995 was
$59,118,000 including 1995 property acquisitions of $50,994,000 and
improvements to real estate of $8,124,000.

On July 25, 1995 WRIT received $48,842,500 from the issuance and sale of
3,500,000 shares.  WRIT's other underwriting expenses were $232,600 resulting
in net proceeds received by the Trust of $48,609,900.  Approximately
$36,000,000 of the net proceeds were used to repay certain borrowings
outstanding under the Trust's lines of credit resulting from 1994 and 1995
property acquisitions.  $6,994,000 of the net proceeds in addition to financing
was used to acquire Frederick County Square and 1220 Nineteenth Street.  The
balance of the net proceeds was used to  renovate, expand or improve income
producing properties.

WRIT has line of credit commitments in place from commercial banks for up to
$75,000,000.  As of January 1, 1995, WRIT had $18,000,000 of borrowings on its
line of credit, which was used for 1994 acquisitions.  During 1995, WRIT
acquired five properties for a total of acquisition costs of $58,746,000.  WRIT
borrowed $44,000,000 for these acquisitions under its lines of credit, assumed
a mortgage for $7,752,000 and used $6,994,000 of proceeds from its July, 1995
public offering to complete these property acquisitions.  During 1995 WRIT
repaid $36,000,000 of line of credit borrowings ($34,000,000 for property
acquisitions and $2,000,000 for property improvements) leaving $28,000,000 due
with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and $47,000,000 available for
future borrowings.  Line of credit maturities range from July 26, 1996 (subject
to extension until July 25, 1997 at WRIT's option) to January 31, 1999.

Capital improvements of $8,124,000 were completed in 1995, including tenant
improvements.  Improvements to WRIT properties in 1994 and 1993 were
approximately $5,787,000 and $4,712,000, respectively.  WRIT's 1996 planned
capital improvements total $11,470,000, including $3,234,000 for tenant
improvements.

Management believes that it has the liquidity and the capital resources
necessary to meet all of its known obligations and to make additional property
acquisitions and capital improvements when appropriate to enhance long-term
growth.

                       Report of Independent Accountants



To the Trustees and Shareholders of
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust


In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the index appearing under
item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 17 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Washington Real Estate Investment Trust at December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Trust's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                    WASHINGTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE A: NATURE OF BUSINESS
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT or the Trust)  is a
self-administered qualified equity real estate investment trust.  The Trust's
business consists of the ownership of income-producing real estate properties
principally in the Greater Washington-Baltimore Region.  The Trust has a
fundamental strategy of regional focus, diversified property type ownership and
conservative financial management.

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (WRIT) operates in a manner intended to
enable it to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code").  In accordance with the Code, a trust which
distributes its capital gains and at least 95% of its taxable income to its
shareholders each year, and which meets certain other conditions, will not be
taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its
shareholders.  Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

NOTE B: ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of
generally one year or less, and commercial properties are leased under
operating leases with average terms of three  years.  WRIT recognizes rental
income from its residential and commercial leases when earned, which is not
materially different than revenue recognition on a straight-line basis.

Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives
not exceeding 50 years.   Effective January 1, 1995, WRIT revised its estimate
of useful lives for major capital improvements to real estate.  All capital
improvement expenditures associated with replacements, improvements, or major
repairs to real property are depreciated using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years.  All tenant
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over 5 years or the
term of the lease if it differs significantly from 5 years.  Capital
improvements placed in service prior to January 1, 1995 will continue to be
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their previously estimated useful
lives  not exceeding 30 years.  Maintenance and repair costs are charged to
expense as incurred.  Depreciation expense for Federal income tax purposes
differs from that reported for financial statement purposes due to the use of
different lives and depreciation methods.  As of December 31, 1995 the net
assets as reported in WRIT's financial statements exceed the net basis for
Federal Income Tax purposes by $14,571,577 due to a lower basis of certain real
estate assets acquired by tax-free exchanges.

Cash and temporary investments, mortgage note receivable, rents and other
receivables, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and other
liabilities, tenant security deposits, advance rents, mortgage note payable and
lines of credit payable are carried at historical cost which reasonably
approximate their fair values.  Cash  and temporary investments include
investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash generally with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments is based on
information available to WRIT as of December 31, 1995.  Although WRIT is not
aware of any factors that would significantly affect the reasonable fair value
amounts,  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of
these financial statements since that date, and current estimates of fair value
may differ from the carrying amounts.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE B: ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In March 1995, The Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of",  which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amount.  Statement No. 121 also addresses the accounting for
long-lived assets that are expected to be disposed of.  The Company will adopt
Statement No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.  In October 1995, the FASB
issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".  Statement
No. 123 establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for
stock-based employee compensation plans and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995.  The company expects to continue to apply
the accounting provisions of APB opinion 25 in determining its net income.
However, beginning in 1996, additional disclosures will be made about the
estimated compensation expense under the method established by Statement No.
123.  The adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on the
company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE C: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS
WRIT's real estate investment portfolio, at cost,  consists of properties
located in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia and Delaware as follows:

NOTE D: MORTGAGE NOTE RECEIVABLE
In June 1993, WRIT sold its headquarters building for $1,050,000 and recognized
a gain of $741,217.  Proceeds received were $176,000 in cash and $874,000 in a
mortgage note receivable.  Principal payments received in 1993 totaled $74,000.
In February 1996, the mortgage note receivable was modified and the term was
extended for a period of ten years beginning July, 1996.  The mortgage bears
interest at 9% through June, 1996, then 12% thereafter and matures in June,
2006.  Interest only is payable monthly until June, 1996.  Beginning in July,
1996, interest and principal are payable monthly, based upon a thirty year
amortization, until June, 2006.  At that time all accrued and unpaid interest
and principal are due in full.  At December 31, 1995, the fair value of the
mortgage note receivable approximates its carrying amount.

NOTE E: MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE
On August 22, 1995 WRIT assumed a $7,752,000 mortgage note payable as partial
consideration for its acquisition of Frederick County Square.  The mortgage
bears interest at 9%.  Principal and interest are payable monthly until January
1, 2003 at which time all unpaid principal and interest are payable in full.
Annual maturities of principal as of December 31, 1995 are $117,000, $128,000,
$140,000, $153,000, $167,000 and $7,001,000 thereafter.   At December 31, 1995,
the fair value of the mortgage note payable approximates its carrying amount.

NOTE F:  LINES OF CREDIT PAYABLE
On January 26, 1995 WRIT borrowed $16,000,000 on a short-term bank loan at the
bank's then prime rate of 8.5%.  Interest only was payable monthly on the
unpaid principal balance at the bank's corporate base rate.  On March 8, 1995,
the $16,000,000 short-term loan was replaced with an unsecured credit
commitment of $25,000,000 and the outstanding advance of $16,000,000 was
transferred to this new commitment.  This $16,000,000 advance bore interest at
the rate of 6.8% until September 8, 1995, at which time it was paid in full
(See Capital Resources and Liquidity).  Additionally under this commitment,
WRIT borrowed the following amounts:  On May 15, 1995, $7,000,000 for the
acquisition of Tech 100 Industrial Park, on June 28, 1995, $2,000,000 for
capital improvements and major renovations, and on November 2, 1995,
$18,000,000 for the acquisition of 1220 19th Street. The $2,000,000 advance
bore interest at the rate of 6.42% until July 31, 1995 at which time it was
paid in full.  On November 15, 1995 the  initial interest rate of 6.425%
expired for the $7,000,000 advance.  The new rate of 5.99% is effective until
August 12, 1996 at which time it will adjust as described below.  The
$18,000,000 advance bears interest at the rate of 6.11% until August 29, 1996
at which time it will also adjust as further described.  Interest only is
payable monthly, in arrears, on the unpaid principal balance.  All new advances
and interest rate adjustments upon the expiration of WRIT's interest lock-in
dates will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on WRIT's debt service
coverage ratio.  Based on WRIT's current debt service coverage ratio, this
spread is 30 basis points over LIBOR.  All unpaid interest and principal can be
prepaid prior to the expiration of WRIT's interest rate lock-in periods subject
to a yield maintenance obligation and all unpaid principal and interest are due
January 31, 1999.

This $25,000,000 credit commitment  requires WRIT to pay the lender an unused
commitment fee at the rate of 0.15% per annum in the first year, and 0.20% per
annum thereafter, on the amount that the $25,000,000  commitment exceeds the
balance of outstanding advances and term loans.  This fee is payable monthly
beginning March, 1995 until January, 1999.  This commitment also contains
certain financial and legal covenants which WRIT is required to meet
periodically.

On July 27, 1995 WRIT renegotiated its other $25,000,000 unsecured credit
commitment that was scheduled to expire on August 25, 1995 and replaced it with
an unsecured credit commitment of $50,000,000 from the same bank and a
participating bank for the express purpose of purchasing income-producing
property and to make capital improvements to real property.  On December 21,
1995 WRIT borrowed $3,000,000 under this commitment for the acquisition of
Crossroads Distribution Center.  The $3,000,000 advance bears interest at the
rate of 6.15% until July 18, 1996 at which time it will adjust.  Interest only
is payable monthly, in arrears, on the unpaid principal balance.  All unpaid
interest and principal are due July 26, 1996, and can be prepaid prior to this
date without any prepayment fee or yield maintenance obligation.  WRIT has the
option to extend this agreement until July 25, 1997.  At that time, WRIT
intends to exercise this option. Any new advances shall bear interest at LIBOR
plus a spread based on WRIT's interest coverage ratio.  Based on WRIT's current
interest coverage ratio, this spread is 50 basis points over LIBOR.  This
credit agreement provides WRIT the option to convert any advances or portions
thereof into a term loan at any time after January 27, 1996 and prior to July
26, 1996 or July 25, 1997, if extended.  The principal amount of each term
loan, if any, shall be repaid on July 27, 1999.  Such term loan(s) may be
prepaid subject to a prepayment fee.

NOTE F:  LINES OF CREDIT PAYABLE (continued) 
The $50,000,000 credit commitment requires WRIT to pay the lender an unused
commitment fee at the rate of 0.15% per annum on the amount by which
$50,000,000 exceeds the balance of outstanding advances and term loans.  This
fee is payable quarterly in arrears beginning October 1995 until July 26, 1996,
or July 25, 1997 if extended.  This commitment also contains certain covenants
which WRIT is required to meet periodically.

As of December 31, 1995 there were advances outstanding on the above credit
facilities in the amount of $28,000,000.

NOTE G: SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS
Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The weighted average
shares outstanding were 29,786,933, 28,239,420 and 28,223,307 in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

The following is a breakdown of the taxable percentage of WRIT's dividends for

NOTE H: SHARE OPTIONS (continued)
On June 27, 1990, the then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was granted
non-qualified share options for 150,000 shares at $11.71, the per share market
price on that day.  These shares were exercisable 20% at date of grant and 20%
upon each anniversary over a four year period.  Share options of 60,000 in 1991
and 30,000 in 1992 were exercised leaving 60,000 remaining to be exercised.  In
June 1995, 56,375 of qualified share options granted to WRIT's former Chairman,
B. Franklin Kahn became non-qualified share options, three months after his
retirement.  These shares are exercisable 10% per year.  As of December 31,
1995, 24,162 of these options are exercisable.

On December 19, 1995 the President and Chief Executive Officer of WRIT was
granted non-qualified share options for 13,333 at $14.625, the per share market
price that day.  On December 14, 1994, non-qualified share options were granted
for 9,091 shares at the June 1, 1994 market price of $19.25.  All shares are
50% exercisable after the first anniversary date and 100% exercisable after the
second anniversary date.  As of December 31, 1995, 4,546 shares are
exercisable.

NOTE I: PENSION PLAN AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
WRIT maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all eligible
employees through December 31, 1995. At December 31, 1995, all benefit accruals
under the plan were frozen and thus the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and
the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) became equal.  WRIT anticipates
terminating the plan no later than December 31, 1999.  Since there are no
further benefit accruals provided under the plan, WRIT has substantially
reduced its funding obligation and there will be no further increases in the
ABO or PBO.  Benefits under the plan were generally based on years of service 
and final average pay.  Pension costs are accrued and funded annually from plan
entry date in the plan to projected retirement date and include service costs
for benefits earned during the period and interest costs on the projected
benefit obligation less the return on plan assets.  Pension costs were $27,000,
$90,000, and $164,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The actual return
(loss) on plan assets was $10,000,  $27,000, and $(31,000)  for 1995, 1994 and
1993 respectively.  The assumed long-term rate of return is 8.00%.  Plan
obligations in excess of amounts permitted under the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982 are accrued as a liability of WRIT and included in
total pension cost.  The funded status of the plan is:

</TABLE>

The liabilities are calculated using an assumed discount rate of 8.00% for
December 31, 1995 and 1994 and an assumed compensation increase of 5% for 1994.

In 1995, annuity contracts were purchased with plan assets for two participants
who retired during 1995, one being WRIT's former Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer B. Franklin Kahn.  The cost of said annuities was $1,593,000 and the
reduction in the PBO was $1,632,000.

In 1996, WRIT intends to implement a Retirement Savings Plan  (the "Savings
Plan").  It will be established so that participants in the savings plan may
elect to contribute a portion of their earnings to the Savings Plan and WRIT
may, at its discretion, make a voluntary contribution to the Savings Plan.

NOTE I: PENSION PLAN AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS (continued)
Management has adopted a compensation plan for its senior personnel which will
align their compensation growth with shareholders' interests.  Essentially, the
plan limits future salary increases, with an emphasis on cash bonus incentives
and a stock option plan based on performance.  The financial incentives to
management are earned after achieving prescribed growth.  This plan is
effective for the 1996 year and will be reviewed by the Board of Trustees'
compensation Committee each year.

NOTE J: RENTALS UNDER OPERATING LEASES
Noncancelable commercial operating leases provide for minimum rental income
during each of the next five years of approximately $34,921,957, $27,065,221,
$20,109,678, $15,816,407, $9,635,551 and $12,190,221 thereafter.  Apartment
leases are not included as they are generally for one year.  Most of these
commercial rentals increase in future years based on changes in the Consumer
Price Index or agreed-upon percentages.  Contingent rentals from the shopping
centers, based on a percentage of tenants' gross sales, were $496,000, $428,000
and $447,000 in 1995, 1994 and 1993 respectively.

NOTE K: ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
New Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations effective
October 1995, require owners of buildings constructed before 1981 to actively
determine whether their buildings contain asbestos containing material ("ACM").
WRIT, through the services of an environmental consulting firm,  determined
that ACM was located within the ceiling plaster above the ceiling tiles in most
vacant spaces and some occupied spaces at its 1901 Pennsylvania Avenue office
building.  In December 1995, WRIT contracted for the removal of the ACM's at
1901 Pennsylvania Avenue in strict accordance with all applicable Federal,
State and local codes as well as OSHA regulations.  An independent
environmental firm was contracted to monitor and enforce this compliance.

WRIT has retained the services of an environmental consulting firm to test for
asbestos in 29 of its properties built before 1981 which had no previous and/or
current environmental studies performed.  The results of these tests are 
expected to be completed in May, 1996. 

A summary of costs associated with these matters are as follows:

                                                                                           --------

         Estimated Costs Remaining (Environmental Survey)                                  $ 56,000
                                                                                           ======== 
</TABLE>

The management of WRIT anticipates that any additional costs incurred resulting
from the environmental survey will not have a material effect on the financial
position and results of operations of the company.

NOTE L: SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On March 13, 1996 WRIT acquired Walker House Apartments, a 196 unit 8 story
apartment building located in Gaithersburg, Maryland for an acquisition cost of

which restrict Borrower's ability to encumber certain of Borrower's assets)
which prohibits or limits the ability of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any
assets or Capital Stock of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding
any agreement which limits generally the amount of secured Indebtedness which
may be incurred by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), and (c) is not subject

Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any assets or Capital Stock of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or would entitle any Person to the benefit
of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on such assets or Capital Stock upon
the occurrence of any contingency (including, without limitation, pursuant to
an "equal and ratable" clause).  For the purposes of this Agreement, any
Property of a Subsidiary which is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary shall not be
deemed to be unencumbered unless both (i) such Property and (ii) all Capital
Stock of such Subsidiary held by the Borrower is unencumbered.

         "Unfunded Liabilities" means the amount (if any) by which the present
value of all vested nonforfeitable benefits under all Single Employer Plans

Plans.

         "Unmatured Default" means an event which but for the lapse of time or
the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a Default.

         "Unsecured Indebtedness" means all Indebtedness of any Person that is
not secured by a Lien on any income, Capital Stock, Property or any other asset

by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as of such date.

         "Wholly-Owned Subsidiary" of a Person means (i) any Subsidiary all of
the outstanding voting securities of which shall at the time be owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by such Person or one or more Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries of such Person, or by such Person and one or more Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries of such Person, or (ii) any partnership, association, joint
venture or similar business organization 100% of the ownership interests having

                                   THE CREDIT

         2.1.    Commitment.  From and including the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Facility Termination Date, each Lender severally agrees, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Loans to the Borrower
from time to time in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate at any one time
outstanding the amount of its Commitment.  Subject to the terms of this
Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time prior to the
Facility Termination Date.  The Commitments to lend hereunder shall expire on
the Facility Termination Date.

         2.2.    Final Principal Payment.  Any outstanding Advances and all
other unpaid Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Facility
Termination Date.

         2.3.    Ratable Loans.  Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans
made from the several Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their
respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment.  The Advances may be
CBR Advances or LIBOR Advances, or a combination thereof, selected by the
Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.9 and 2.10.  If any Lender shall default
in its obligation to fund all or a portion of its Percentage of any Advance (a
"Defaulting Lender"), then simultaneously with any funding by any of the
remaining Lenders (each, a "Funding Lender") of their respective Percentages of
such Advance (such an Advance is sometimes referred to herein as a "Partial
Advance"), the respective Funded Percentages of each Defaulting Lender and of
each Funding Lender shall automatically be adjusted so that following such
adjustment each Lender's Funded Percentage shall correspond to the aggregate
percentage of all then outstanding Advances (including all Partial Advances)
made by such Lender.  Following any adjustment of each Lender's Funded
Percentage pursuant to the preceding sentence such Lender's Funded Percentage
shall be readjusted only upon the first to occur of (a) a Defaulting Lender
subsequently funding its Percentage of any such Partial Advance, or (b) the
repayment in full (including all interest thereon) to each Funding Lender of
its Percentage of any such Partial Advance.  Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Defaulting Lender be entitled to
receive any repayment of its Percentage of any Advances (or any interest earned
thereon) until such time as the Funding Lenders have received repayment in full
of the amount of any Partial Advance, together with all interest thereon.
Borrower shall have the right to replace a Defaulting Lender in the manner set
forth in Section 3.6 below, and upon the replacement of any Defaulting Lender,
such Defaulting Lender shall refund to Borrower the pro rata share of all
commitment fees paid to such Defaulting Lender which have not been earned by
such Defaulting Lender as of the date of such replacement, determined by
multiplying the amount of all commitment fees paid by Borrower to or for the
benefit of such Defaulting Lender by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of months (it being understood and agreed that for purposes of this
provision a portion of any month shall constitute a complete "month") which
have elapsed in the 48 month Facility term, and the denominator of which is 48.
Solely by way of example, if Borrower has paid aggregate commitment fees of
$75,000 to a Defaulting Lender, and Borrower replaces such Defaulting Lender on
the second anniversary of the Closing Date, then concurrently with such
replacement such Defaulting Lender shall return to Borrower $37,500 of the
$75,000 in commitment fees.

         2.4.    Applicable Margins.  Prior to the Public Debt Rating Date, the
CBR Applicable Margin and the LIBOR Applicable Margin to be used in calculating
the interest rate applicable to the different Types of Advances shall vary from
time to time in accordance with the Loan Year and the Current DSC Ratio, and
shall be adjusted on each Calculation Date (as defined below), as shown in the
following tables based on the then applicable Loan Year and the Current DSC
Ratio at that time:

the account of each Lender a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to
fifteen one hundredths of one percent (0.15%) of the Aggregate Commitment (as
such amount may be changed from time to time pursuant to the terms hereof to an

         2.7.    Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each LIBOR Advance shall be
in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in multiples of $250,000 if in excess
thereof), and each CBR Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000
(and in multiples of $250,000 if in excess thereof), provided, however, that
any CBR Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment.

         2.8.    Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may from time to
time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Advances, or, in a
minimum aggregate amount of $500,000 or any integral multiple of $250,000 in
excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Advances upon two Business Days'
prior notice to the Agent; provided however, that the provisions of Section 3.4
hereof shall be applicable to any prepayment of any LIBOR Advance.

         2.9.    Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New
Advances.  The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of
each LIBOR Advance, the Interest Period applicable to each Advance from time to
time.  The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing
Notice") not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one Business Day
before the Borrowing Date of each CBR Advance and three Business Days before
the Borrowing Date for each LIBOR Advance, specifying:

                   (i)    the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of
                          such Advance,
                  (ii)    the aggregate amount of such Advance,
                 (iii)    the Type of Advance selected, and
                  (iv)    in the case of each LIBOR Advance, the Interest
                          Period applicable thereto.

         Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender
shall make available its Loan or Loans, in funds immediately available in
Chicago to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article VIII.  The
Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the
Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

         No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date and,
unless the Lenders otherwise agree in writing, in no event may there be more
than five (5) different Interest Periods for LIBOR Advances outstanding at any
one time.

         2.10.   Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances.  CBR
Advances shall continue as CBR Advances unless and until such CBR Advances are
converted into LIBOR Advances.  Each LIBOR Advance shall continue as a LIBOR
Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which
time such LIBOR Advance shall be automatically converted into a CBR Advance
unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such LIBOR Advance
continue as an LIBOR Advance for the same or another Interest Period.  Subject
to the terms of Section 2.7, the Borrower may elect from time to time to
convert all or any part of an Advance of any Type into any other Type or Types
of Advances; provided that any conversion of any LIBOR Advance shall be made
on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  The
Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation
Notice") of each conversion of an Advance or continuation of a LIBOR Advance
not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one Business Day, in the case
of a conversion into a CBR Advance, or three Business Days, in the case of a
conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR Advance, prior to the date of the
requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

                   (i)    the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of
                          such conversion or continuation;

                  (ii)    the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is
                          to be converted or continued; and

                 (iii)    the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such
                          Advance is to be converted or continued and, in the
                          case of a conversion into or continuation of a LIBOR
                          Advance, the duration of the Interest Period
                          applicable thereto.

         2.11.   Changes in Interest Rate. Etc.  Each CBR Advance shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a LIBOR Advance
into a CBR Advance pursuant to Section 2.10 to but excluding the date it
becomes due or is converted into a LIBOR Advance pursuant to Section 2.10
hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the CBR Rate for such day.  Changes in the
rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a CBR Advance
will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Corporate Base Rate.
Each LIBOR Advance shall bear interest from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such LIBOR
Advance.

         2.12.   Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 2.9 or 2.10, during the continuance of a
Default or Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by
notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no





                                     - 21 -

<PAGE>   28
Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a LIBOR Advance.  During
the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by
notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that
for the duration of such Default (i) each LIBOR Advance shall bear interest at
the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and
(ii) each CBR Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the CBR
Rate otherwise applicable to the CBR Advance plus 2% per annum.

         2.13.   Method of Payment.  All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Article VIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in
writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due
and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment
delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered
promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent
received at its address specified pursuant to Article VIII or at any Lending
Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender.  The
Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained
with First Chicago for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it
becomes due hereunder.

         2.14.   Notes; Telephonic Notices.  Each Lender is hereby authorized
to record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the
schedule attached to its Note, provided, however, that the failure to so record
shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under such Note.  The Borrower
hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue
Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on
telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in
good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower.  The Borrower
agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such
confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice
signed by an Authorized Officer.  If the written confirmation differs from the
action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the
Lenders shall be presumed (rebuttably) accurate.

         2.15.   Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest
accrued on each CBR Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each LIBOR Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date
on which the LIBOR Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity.  Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual
days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.  Interest shall be payable for the
day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if
payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment.  If any
payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be





                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>   29
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.

         2.16.   Notification of Advances, Interest Rates and Prepayments.
Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of the
contents of each Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and
repayment notice received by it hereunder.  The Agent will notify each Lender
of the interest rate applicable to each LIBOR Advance promptly upon
determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of
each change in the Corporate Base Rate.

         2.17.   Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender for
the benefit of such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written or telex
notice to the Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

         2.18.   Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent.  Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.
If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in the case of
payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

         2.19.   Withholding Tax Exemption.  At least five Business Days prior
to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the
account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver
to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case
that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the
Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes.  Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such
form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires
(currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar year
for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event
requiring a





                                     - 23 -

<PAGE>   30
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
(including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
federal income tax.

         2.20.   Reduction in Aggregate Commitment.  Borrower may from time to
time during the term of this Facility upon prior written notice to Agent, elect
to permanently reduce the amount of the Aggregate Commitment to an amount to be
determined by Borrower; provided, however, that in no event shall Borrower be
entitled to reduce the Aggregate Commitment below $15,000,000 pursuant to this
Section.  Each reduction notice from Borrower as described in the preceding
sentence shall be accompanied by payment of any amounts (including any amounts
payable by Borrower pursuant to Article III hereof) necessary to reduce the
outstanding balance of the Advances to the amount specified in such notice.
Each reduction of the Aggregate Commitment shall reduce each Lender's
Commitment on a pro rata basis.


                                  ARTICLE III

                            CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

         3.1.    Yield Protection.  If any law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance
of any Lender therewith,

                 (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending
                          Installation to any tax, duty, charge or withholding
                          on or from payments due from the Borrower (excluding
                          (i) federal taxation of the net income of any Lender
                          or applicable Lending Installation, (ii) state and
                          local taxation in the jurisdiction where a Lender's
                          home office is situated, (iii) state and local
                          taxation in a jurisdiction other than described in
                          (ii) above to the extent such Lender receives credit
                          on its tax payments in its home jurisdiction for such
                          taxes, and (iv) federal withholding tax imposed on
                          payments due hereunder or under the Notes), or
                          changes the basis of taxation of payments to any
                          Lender in respect of its Loans or other amounts due
                          it hereunder, or





                                     - 24 -

<PAGE>   31
                 (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
                          assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or
                          similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
                          or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
                          Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other
                          than reserves and assessments taken into account in
                          determining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR
                          Advances), or

                 (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of which is to
                          increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable
                          Lending Installation of making, funding or
                          maintaining loans or reduces any amount receivable by
                          any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in
                          connection with loans, or requires any Lender or any
                          applicable Lending Installation to make any payment
                          calculated by reference to the amount of loans held
                          or interest received by it, by an amount deemed
                          material by such Lender,

then, within 30 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or reduction in an
amount received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding
and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.

         3.2.    Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender
reasonably determines the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as
hereinafter defined), then, within 30 days of demand by such Lender, the
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any
shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which
such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its
obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy).  "Change" means (i) any change after the date
of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of
or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any
Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender.  "Risk-Based
Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in
the United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition rules,
and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory
authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the
Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards,"
including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted
prior to the date of this Agreement.

         3.3.    Availability of LIBOR Advances.  If any Lender reasonably
determines that maintenance of any of its LIBOR Loans at a suitable Lending
Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, the Agent





                                     - 25 -

<PAGE>   32
shall suspend the availability of LIBOR Advances and require any LIBOR Advances
to be converted into CBR Advances; or if the Required Lenders reasonably
determine that (i) deposits of a type or maturity appropriate to match fund
LIBOR Advances are not available, the Agent shall suspend the availability of
LIBOR Advances with respect to any Advances made after the date of any such
determination, or (ii) an interest rate applicable to a LIBOR Advance does not
accurately reflect the cost of making a LIBOR Advance, then, if for any reason
whatsoever the provisions of Section 3.1 are inapplicable, the Agent shall
suspend the availability of LIBOR Advances with respect to any Advances made
after the date of any such determination.

         3.4.    Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a LIBOR Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBOR Advance is
not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than
default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or
cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any
loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain
the LIBOR Advance.

         3.5.    Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending
Installation with respect to its LIBOR Loans to reduce any liability of the
Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the
unavailability of a LIBOR Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such
designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a
written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Sections 3
1, 3.2 or 3.4.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be
presumed (rebuttably) correct.  Determination of amounts payable under such
Sections in connection with a LIBOR Loan shall be calculated as though each
Lender funded its LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
LIBOR Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.
Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement
shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of the written
statement.  The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.6     Replacement of Lender by Reason of Change in Circumstances.
In the event that any Lender (a "Recovery Lender") requires Borrower to make
any payment to such Recovery Lender in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 3.1 and/or 3.2 hereof, then upon written notice from Borrower to
Agent, Borrower and Agent shall mutually use their respective best efforts to
find another lender to replace the Recovery Lender.  If a replacement lender is
found then Borrower shall pay to the Recovery Lender all amounts owed to such
Recovery Lender under the Facility, such Recovery Lender shall no longer be a
"Lender" hereunder, and concurrently therewith the remaining parties hereto
shall execute such instruments as shall be necessary to have the replacement
lender become a "Lender" hereunder having a Commitment equal to that of the
Recovery Lender.





                                     - 26 -

<PAGE>   33
         Nothing contained in this Section 3.6 shall be deemed to relieve
Borrower of its obligations to make all payments to any Recovery Lender in the
amounts and at the times required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
during the period of time prior to the replacement of such Recovery Lender.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

Agent, with sufficient copies for the Lenders, the following:

                          governmental officer, for each jurisdiction where the
                          failure to so qualify or be licensed (if required)
                          would have a Material Adverse Effect;

                 (iii)    Copies, certified by an officer of the Borrower, of

                          certificate the Agent and the Lenders shall be
                          entitled to rely until informed of any change in
                          writing by the Borrower;

                 (v)      Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant

                          and that all representations and warranties of the
                          Borrower are true and correct as of the initial

         4.2.    Each Advance.  The Lenders shall not be required to make any
Advance (other than an Advance that, after giving effect thereto and to the
application of the proceeds thereof, does not increase the aggregate amount of
outstanding Advances), unless on the applicable Borrowing Date:

                          Borrowing Date, except to the extent any such
                          representation or warranty is stated to relate solely
                          to an earlier date, in which case such representation
                          or warranty shall be true and correct on and as of
                          such earlier date; and

                 (iii)    All legal matters incident to the making of such

                          Lenders and their counsel and shall impose no burden
                          on the Borrower greater than as set forth in Section
                          4.1 hereof.

<PAGE>   35
         Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions
contained in Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) have been satisfied.  Any Lender may
require a duly completed compliance certificate in substantially the form of
Exhibit C hereto as a condition to making an Advance.


                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

         5.1.    Existence.  Borrower is a real estate investment trust duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the District of Columbia, with
its principal place of business in Kensington, Maryland, and is duly qualified
as a foreign real estate investment trust, properly licensed (if required), in
good standing and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted and in which the failure to be
qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.2.    Authorization and Validity.  The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to
perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have
been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

         5.3.    No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on the Borrower, or the provisions of any indenture,
investment or agreement to which the Borrower is a party or is subject, or by
which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on
the Property of the Borrower pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
instrument or agreement.  No order, consent, approval, license, authorization,
or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by,
any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is
required to authorize, or is required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or
enforceability of, any of the Loan Documents.





                                     - 29 -

<PAGE>   36
         5.4.    Material Adverse Change.  Since December 31, 1994, there has
been no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower which could have a Material

                          retirement benefits, or similar legislation;

                 (iv)     Utility easements, building restrictions and such
                          other encumbrances or charges against real property
                          as are of a nature generally existing with respect to
                          properties of a similar character and which do not in
                          any material way affect the marketability of the same
                          or interfere with the use thereof in the business of
                          the Borrower or its Subsidiaries;

                 (v)      Liens existing on the date hereof and described in

                          permitted hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Borrower
may from time to time encumber its Properties with Liens in addition to those
set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) above, provided that the granting or
existence of such other Liens shall not cause Borrower to be in breach of the
provisions of Section 6.21 hereof.

Liens permitted pursuant to this Section 6.17 shall be deemed to be "Permitted
Liens."

         6.18.   Affiliates.  The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any of
their Subsidiaries to, enter into any transaction (including, without
limitation, the purchase or sale of any Property or service) with, or make any
payment or transfer to, any Affiliate except in the ordinary course of business
and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of the Borrower's or such
Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to
the

Borrower or such Subsidiary than the Borrower or such Subsidiary would obtain
in a comparable arms-length transaction.

         6.19.   Cash Flow to Debt Service Ratio.  The Borrower on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries shall maintain a Cash Flow to Debt
Service Ratio of not less than 2.5.  Such test must be satisfied as of the end
of each fiscal quarter, based on annualized results for the preceding two
fiscal quarters.

         6.20.   Consolidated Tangible Net Worth.  The Borrower on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries shall maintain a Consolidated Tangible
Net Worth of not less than the sum of (i) $125,000,000 plus (ii) fifty percent
(50%) of the aggregate proceeds received by the Borrower (net of actual related
fees and expenses) in connection with any offering of stock in the Borrower
after the Closing Date.

         6.21.   Indebtedness and Cash Flow Covenants.  The Borrower on a
consolidated basis with its Subsidiaries shall not, as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter, permit:

                 (i)      Consolidated Total Indebtedness to exceed forty
                          percent (40%) of Total Tangible Assets;

                 (ii)     Consolidated Secured Indebtedness to exceed fifteen
                          percent (15%) of Total Tangible Assets;

                 (iii)    the Value of Unencumbered Assets to be less than 2.25
                          times the Consolidated Senior Unsecured Indebtedness;

                 (iv)     annualized EBITDA (determined by multiplying (x) the
                          sum of EBITDA for the two most recently ended fiscal
                          quarters, by (y) two) to be less than twenty percent
                          (20%) of Consolidated Total Indebtedness; and

                 (v)      the Value of Unencumbered Assets (excluding Office
                          Building Assets which constitute Unencumbered Assets)
                          to be less than 1.5 times the Consolidated Senior
                          Unsecured Indebtedness.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

         8.1.    Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part
of the Agent or any Lender.  If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders
may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon
the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby
expressly waives.

         If, within 10 days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

         8.2.    Amendments.  Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII,
the Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving
any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement
shall, without the consent of each Lender affected thereby:

                 (i)      Extend the maturity of any Loan or Note or forgive
                          all or any portion of the principal amount thereof,
                          or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
                          interest or fees thereon.

                 (ii)     Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
                          Required Lenders.

                 (iii)    Extend the Facility Termination Date or reduce the
                          amount or extend the payment date for, the mandatory
                          payments required under Section 2.2 (other than as
                          provided for under Section 2.2), or increase the
                          amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or
                          permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this
                          Agreement.

<PAGE>   48
                 (iv)     Amend this Section 8.2.

Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Section 8.2, the Aggregate
Commitment may be increased prior to the Facility Termination Date (up to the
Maximum Aggregate Commitment) solely by the consent of the Borrower and each
Lender whose Commitment is being increased.  No amendment of any provision of
this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be effective without the written
consent of the Agent.

         8.3.    Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders
or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein,
and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the
inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan
shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation
of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall
be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section
8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All
remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative
and all shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations
have been paid in full.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1.    Survival of Representations.  All representations and
warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive delivery
of the Notes and the making of the Loans herein contemplated.

         9.2.    Governmental Regulation.  Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

         9.3.    Taxes.  Any taxes (excluding (i) federal taxation of the net
income of any Lender or applicable Lending Installation, (ii) state and local
taxation in the jurisdiction where a Lender's home office is situated, (iii)
state and local taxation in a jurisdiction other than described in (ii) above
to the extent such Lender receives credit on its tax payments in its home
jurisdiction for such taxes, and (iv) federal withholding tax imposed on
payments due hereunder or under the Notes) or other similar assessments or
charges made by any governmental or revenue authority in respect of the Loan
Documents shall be paid by the Borrower when due (and Agent shall forward to
Borrower copies of any notices of such taxes promptly following Agent's receipt
of any such notices).

<PAGE>   49
         9.4.    Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any
of the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.5.    Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and
supersede all prior commitments, agreements and understandings among the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof.

         9.6.    Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The
respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and
no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to
which the Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
from any of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed
so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

         9.7.    Expenses; Indemnification.  The Borrower shall reimburse the
Agent for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including,
without limitation, all reasonable fees for consultants and reasonable fees and
reasonable expenses for attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be
employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review, amendment, modification,
and administration of the Loan Documents; provided that the provisions of
Section 12.2.1 and 12.3.1 shall govern with respect to payment of the fees and
expenses associated with the sale of participating interests in, and
assignments of, the Loans.  The Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Agent and
the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses
(including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and reasonable expenses for
attorneys for the Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of
the Agent or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent or any Lender in
connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, any workout).  The Borrower further agrees to
indemnify the Agent and each Lender, its directors, officers and employees
against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or
preparation therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party thereto)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Properties, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed
application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder, except that the foregoing
indemnity shall not apply to a Lender to the extent that any losses, claims,
damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses are the result of such
Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

<PAGE>   50
         9.8.    Numbers of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the
Lenders.

         9.9.    Accounting.  Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with GAAP, except that any
calculation or determination which is to be made on a consolidated basis shall
be made for the Borrower and all its Subsidiaries, including those
Subsidiaries, if any, which are unconsolidated on the Borrower's official
financial statements.

         9.10.   Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or
invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.11.   Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the
Borrower, on the one hand, and the Lenders and the Agent, on the other, shall
be solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall
have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower.  Neither the Agent nor any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business
or operations.

         9.12.   CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE
CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE
OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

         9.13.   CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR
ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES

DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT
IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN
SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.  ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING
BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT
OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH
ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

         9.14.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR

WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.


                                   ARTICLE X

                                   THE AGENT

         10.1.   Appointment.  The First National Bank of Chicago is hereby
appointed Agent hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the
Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the agent of such Lender.
The Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions contained in this
Article X.  The Agent shall not have a fiduciary relationship in respect of the
Borrower or any Lender by reason of this Agreement.

         10.2.   Powers.  The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the
terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any
obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action
specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

         10.3.   General Immunity.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or
therewith except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
or (ii) any determination by the Agent that compliance with any law or any
governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, order, policy, guideline
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) requires the Advances and
Commitments hereunder to be classified as being part of a "highly leveraged
transaction."

         10.4.   No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any
borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants
or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except
receipt of items required to be





                                     - 45 -

<PAGE>   52
delivered to the Agent; (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
therewith; or (v) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of
any interest in any collateral security.  The Agent shall have no duty to
disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the
Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the
Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual
capacity).

         10.5.   Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and on all holders
of Notes.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all
liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action.

         10.6.   Employment of Agents and Counsel.  The Agent may execute any
of its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or
through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to
the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.  The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its
duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

         10.7.   Reliance on Documents; Counsel.  The Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in
respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent,
which counsel may be employees of the Agent.

         10.8.   Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders agree
to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the
Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents,
(ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement of the Loan Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith
or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the
terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.  The obligations of the Lenders
under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement.

         10.9.   Rights as a Lender.  In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is
a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity.  The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.  The
Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

         10.10.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

         10.11.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice
of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of
the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.  If the Agent has resigned and
no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties
of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of
the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal
directly with the Lenders.  No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed
hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment.  Any such
successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings
of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
resigning Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the
resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation of an
Agent, the provisions of this Article XI shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

         10.12.  Commitment as a Lender.  First Chicago agrees to provide a
Commitment of at least $10,000,000 so long as First Chicago remains as Agent;
provided, that the foregoing agreement of First Chicago shall not apply to
assignments of all or any portion of First Chicago's Commitment which are made
at any time following a Default by Borrower hereunder and prior to the cure or
waiver of such Default.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                           SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1.   Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if a Default occurs, any and all deposits
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or
not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be
offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender,
whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

         11.2.   Ratable Payments.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff
or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or
such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.


                                  ARTICLE XII

                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATION

         12.1.   Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and
the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may
at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal
Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.  The Agent may treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for





                                     - 48 -

<PAGE>   55
all purposes hereof unless and until such payee complies with Section 12.3 in
the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a
written notice of the transfer is filed with the Agent.  Any assignee or
transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms
and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes
issued in exchange therefor.

         12.2.   Participations.

                 12.2.1  Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may, in
         the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable
         law, at any time sell to one or more financial institutions, pension
         funds, or any other fund or entity that regularly makes or
         participates in real estate loans as part of its business
         ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
         Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or
         any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the
         event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
         Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
         remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such
         Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes under
         the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this
         Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such
         participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue
         to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
         Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
         Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any fees and expenses incurred
         by any Lender in connection with the sale of any participating
         interests in any Loan pursuant to this Section.

                 12.2.2.  Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole
         right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any
         amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan
         Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with
         respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an
         interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the
         interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or
         Commitment, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled
         payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or
         Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases any
         substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Loan.

                 12.2.3.  Benefit of Setoff.  The Borrower agrees each
         Participant (where Borrower has received at least thirty (30) days'
         prior notice of the existence of such Participant) shall be deemed to
         have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its
         participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to
         the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
         owing directly to it as a





                                     - 49 -

<PAGE>   56
         Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall
         retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
         the amount of participating interests sold to each such Participant.
         The Lenders agree to share with each such Participant, and each
         Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section
         12.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant
         to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in
         accordance with Section 11.2 as if each such Participant were a
         Lender.

         12.3.   Assignments.

                 12.3.1.  Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may, in the
         ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
         at any time assign to one or more financial institutions, pension
         funds, or any other fund or entity that regularly makes or
         participates in real estate loans as part of its business
         ("Purchasers") all or any portion (greater than or equal to $5,000,000
         per assignee) of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
         Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto
         or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.  The
         consent of the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
         effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
         Affiliate thereof.  Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
         Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any fees and expenses incurred
         by any Lender in connection with any assignment of any portion of the
         initial $25,000,000 Maximum Aggregate Commitment pursuant to this
         Section; Borrower shall pay all of Agent's reasonable fees and
         expenses in connection with any future assignments of amounts
         representing increases in the Aggregate Commitment above the initial
         $25,000,000 Maximum Aggregate Commitment.

                 12.3.2.  Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the
         Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as
         Exhibit I to Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together
         with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment by the
         assigning party of a $2,500 fee to the Agent for processing such
         assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective
         date specified in such Notice of Assignment.  The Notice of Assignment
         shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that
         none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment
         and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets"
         as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the
         Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets"
         under ERISA.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such
         Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement
         and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all
         the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to
         the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further
         consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be
         required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the
         percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such
         Purchaser.  Upon the





                                     - 50 -

<PAGE>   57
         consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
         12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make
         appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes are issued to such
         transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
         are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts
         reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

         12.4.   Dissemination of Information.  The Borrower authorize each
Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person
acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such
Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

         12.5.   Tax Treatment.  If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.19.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                    NOTICES

         13.1.   Giving Notice.  Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.14
with respect to borrowing notices, all notices and other communications
provided to any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be in writing or by facsimile and addressed or delivered to such party at
its address set forth below its signature hereto or at such other address as
may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties.  Any notice
transmitted by facsimile, shall be deemed given when received according to the
recipient's automatically generated answerback.  Any notice transmitted by
Federal Express or other recognized overnight courier shall be presumed
(rebuttably) given the business day after it is sent.  Any other notice shall
be effective only when actually received.

         13.2.   Change of Address.  The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may
each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to
the other parties hereto.


                                  ARTICLE XIV

                                  COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.  This
Agreement shall be effective when it has





                                     - 51 -

<PAGE>   58
been executed by the Borrower, the Agent and the Lender and each party has
notified the Agent by telex or telephone, that it has taken such action.


                                   ARTICLE XV

                           NO OFFICER, ETC. LIABILITY

         No trustee, officer or agent of the trust shall be held to any
personal liability whatsoever, in tort, contract or otherwise, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower, the Lender and the Agent have
executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

                    WASHINGTON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
                      NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT


         This Nonqualified Stock Option Agreement dated December 19, 1995.

                                  WITNESSETH:

         1.      Washington Real Estate Investment Trust, a real estate
investment trust organized under the laws of the District of Columbia (the
"Trust"), on the date set forth above has granted, and hereby evidences the
grant to Edmund B. Cronin, Jr. residing at 16320 Batchellors Forest Road,
Olney, Maryland 20832  (the "Optionee"), subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, of the right and option to purchase from the Trust an
aggregate of 13,333 shares of beneficial interest of the Trust ("Shares") at
the purchase price of $14.625 per share, such option to be exercisable as
hereinafter provided.

         2.      The above-referenced option is exercisable as follows:  fifty
percent (50%) of such Shares may be purchased from the Trust in whole at any
time or in part from time-to-time after the first anniversary date hereof, and
one hundred percent (100%) may be so purchased after the second anniversary of
such date.

         Notwithstanding the above, the above-referenced option shall become
exercisable in full as to the total number of Shares hereinabove referred to in
the event of Optionee's termination of employment from the Trust (i) due to
death or (ii) due to the incurrence of a total and permanent disability.

         The option is cumulative; any portion of the option not exercised at
the time it first becomes exercisable may be exercised at any time thereafter
prior to the expiration of the term hereof.

         The Shares may be purchased by giving the Trust written notice to
exercise by written notice specifying the number of Shares to be purchased and
the date on which the purchase will be completed.  Such notice shall contain a
statement by the Optionee that the Optionee has represented to the Trust that
it is his present intention to acquire the Shares being purchased for
investment and not with a view to resale or distribution.  The certificates
representing the Shares shall be legended appropriately to reflect the fact
that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and
that no sale or other distribution of such Shares may be made except pursuant
to an effective registration statement under said Act or in a transaction
exempt from such registration requirements.  Upon the date of purchase so
specified, Optionee shall deliver to the Trust the purchase price of the Shares
to be purchased against delivery thereof to Optionee.  The purchase price shall
be paid in the form of cash, personal check and/or Shares of the Trust (at the
current fair market value of such Shares).  The Trust shall deliver such Shares
on such date of purchase or within a reasonable period of time thereafter,
provided, however, that if any law, regulation, or agreement requires the Trust
to take any action with respect to such Shares before the issuance thereof,
then the date of delivery of such Shares shall be extended for the period
necessary to take such actions.

         Prior to delivery of such Shares, the Optionee shall pay to the Trust
such amount as the Trust determines is necessary to enable the Trust to meet
any Federal and state tax withholding obligations

attributable to the exercise of the option or make appropriate arrangements
with the Trust to effectuate such Federal and state tax withholding
obligations.

         3.      Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraphs,
it is understood and agreed that this Agreement and the option evidenced hereby
are subject to the following conditions:

                 (a)      The option shall not in any event be exercisable
after the close of business on the day ("Expiration Date") which is ten (10)
years after the date hereof;

                 (b)      the option shall not be assignable or transferable by
the Optionee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and during
the lifetime of the Optionee shall be exercisable only by the Optionee or the
Optionee's guardian or legal representative.  Upon any attempt to transfer,
assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the option or any of the
rights of the Optionee hereunder (other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution), the option shall immediately become null and void and the rights
and privileges of the Optionee hereunder shall immediately terminate;

                 (c)      upon the death or total and permanent disability of
the Optionee, the then exercisable portion of the option shall terminate one
year after the date of such event but in no event later than the Expiration
Date of the option.  During this period of time, the option may be exercised by
the Optionee, or the Optionee's guardian or legal representative, or in the
event of the Optionee's death, the Optionee's estate, personal representative
or beneficiary who acquires the option by will or by the laws of descent and
distribution;

                 (d)      if the Optionee ceases to be employed by the Trust
due to termination of his employment without cause by the Trust, or expiration
of the Optionee's Employment Agreement with the Trust without continuation of
employment by the Trust, the then non-exercisable portion of the option shall
terminate immediately and the then exercisable portion of the option shall
terminate one year after the date of such termination of employment;

                 (e)      if the Optionee ceases to be employed by the Trust
due to termination of his employment for cause or voluntary termination by the
Optionee, the then non-exercisable portion of the option shall terminate
immediately and the then exercisable portion of the option shall terminate
ninety (90) days after the date of such termination of employment;

                 (f)      if the Optionee ceases to be employed by the Trust
due to retirement at or after age 65, the option shall continue in accordance
with its terms and shall expire on its Expiration Date unless previously
exercised;

                 (g)      the Optionee shall have none of the rights or
privileges of a shareholder with respect to the Shares issuable upon the
exercise of the option until certificates representing such Shares shall have
been issued and delivered to him upon the exercise of his Option;

         4.      The number and price of the Shares subject to this option
shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect, as deemed equitable and
appropriate by the Trust, any stock dividends, stock split or share combination
of the Shares or recapitalization of the Trust or any new equity underwriting
of the Trust.  To the extent deemed equitable and appropriate by the Trust,
subject to any required





                                     - 2 -

action by shareholders, in any merger, consolidation, reorganization,
liquidation or dissolution, this option shall pertain to the securities and
other property to which a holder of the number of Shares covered by the option
would have been entitled to receive in connection with such event.

         Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Trust, this option shall
terminate; but the Optionee shall have the right, immediately prior to such
dissolution or liquidation, to exercise this option in full to the extent not
theretofore exercised regardless of any provision in this Agreement providing
for the deferment of the exercise thereof.

         5.      Neither the execution and delivery hereof, the granting of the
option evidenced hereby, nor the Trust's obligation to deliver Shares upon the
exercise of the option evidenced hereby shall constitute or be evidence of any
agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Trust to
employ the Optionee for any specific period.

         6.      Any notice required to be given hereunder to the Trust shall
be addressed to the Trust as follows:  Washington Real Estate Investment Trust,
10400 Connecticut Avenue, Concourse Level, Kensington, MD  20895 and any notice
required to be given hereunder to the Optionee shall be addressed to him at his
address shown hereinabove, or to such other address as either party shall
furnish in writing to the other.

         7.      The Optionee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
hereof.

         8.      This Agreement may be amended at any time by the written
consent of both parties hereto, but shall not be amended so as to increase the
number of Shares purchasable hereunder or decrease the purchase price thereof
without the approval by vote of Shareholders owning a majority of the Trust's
outstanding Shares.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Trust, by its duly authorized officer, and the
Optionee have executed this agreement in duplicate as of the day and year first
above written.
