                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS.

     UtiliCorp United Inc. (the company) is an electric and natural gas utility
company with total assets of more than $2.8 billion.  The company was formed in
1985 from Missouri Public Service Company.  Today it operates utilities in eight
states through seven divisions, and in one Canadian province through a
subsidiary.  At December 31, 1993, the company had approximately 1,158,000
utility customers and 4,700 employees.

     The operating divisions of UtiliCorp are Missouri Public Service,
WestPlains Energy, Peoples Natural Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities, West Virginia
Power, Northern Minnesota Utilities and Kansas Public Service.  West Kootenay
Power operates as a Canadian subsidiary.  In addition to these utility
operations, the company is active in non-regulated areas of the utility industry
through two subsidiaries, Aquila Energy Corporation (Aquila) and UtilCo Group.
The company also markets natural gas in the United Kingdom through several joint
ventures and owns joint venture interests in electric distribution operations in
New Zealand.

     Aquila was originally purchased as part of Peoples Natural Gas.  It was
made a wholly-owned subsidiary of UtiliCorp in 1986 to take advantage of the
many marketing and transportation opportunities created by deregulation of the
natural gas industry.  See page I-4 for further discussion.

     Formed in 1986, UtilCo Group held ownership interests in 15 independent
power projects in six states at December 31, 1993.  These projects have an
aggregate capacity of 732 MW.  UtilCo Group's ownership interests range from 15%
to 50%, and its share of project assets at the end of 1993 totaled $363.1
million.

     United Gas, the company's natural gas marketing venture in the United
Kingdom (U.K.), became a contributor to earnings in 1993 due to continued
efforts to further develop markets in areas of the U.K. where it supplies gas.
The company and six regional electric distribution utilities in the U.K. have
entered into joint venture agreements to supply gas to large volume customers in
the electric utilities' service areas via facilities owned by British Gas.

     In July 1993, the company finalized a joint venture arrangement with the
Waikato Electricity Authority in New Zealand.  Under the arrangement, UtiliCorp
agreed to purchase a 33% interest in Waikato-based WEL Energy Group Ltd. (WEL),
for approximately $21 million to be paid over time.  The company paid $2.7
million at closing and will make additional investments in the future based on
the capital requirements of WEL.

     The business of the company is seasonal only to the extent that weather
patterns may have an effect on revenues.  The electric revenues of the company's
Missouri Public Service and WestPlains Energy divisions peak during the summer
months while the electric revenues of its West Virginia Power division and the
West Kootenay Power subsidiary peak during the winter months.  The company's gas
and energy related businesses revenues peak during the winter months.

     The company's strategy is to balance its services by business segment,
region, climate, and regulatory jurisdiction, and to be in the forefront of
utility deregulation.  In pursuit of these goals, the company actively seeks
expansion opportunities in both the regulated and non-regulated segments of the
industry.

     Additional information related to key events in 1993 and the general
development of the company can be found under "Key Events of 1993" on page 17
and in Note 2 on page 37 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.
Such information is incorporated by reference herein.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

     Segment information for the three years ended December 31, 1993 appears in
Note 12 on page 47 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such
information is incorporated by reference herein.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

                               ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

     Through three of its divisions, Missouri Public Service ("MPS"), WestPlains
Energy ("WPE") and West Virginia Power ("WVP"), and one subsidiary, West
Kootenay Power, Ltd. ("WKP"), the company serves approximately 418,000 electric
customers in four states and British Columbia.

     Over each of the last three years, the largest customer class has been
residential sales which have accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 39% of
Megawatt hour ("MWH") sales during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and 43%,
42% and 46% of total electric revenues during the same period.  A summary of the
company's electric revenues, MWH sales, and customers, by class is set forth
under "Electric Operations" on page 54 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to
Shareholders.  Such information is incorporated by reference herein.

     The electric segment has generated an average of 62% of its energy
requirements over the past three years while purchasing the remainder through
firm contracts and spot market purchases.  The following table shows the overall
fuel and purchased power mix for the past three years:

</TABLE>

   A divisional summary of generation capability, firm purchased power contracts
and cost of energy is set forth in Exhibit 99(a) to this Annual Report on Form
10-K and is incorporated by reference herein.

     As part of the acquisition of WPE in 1991, the company entered into a long-
term operating lease of an 8% interest in the Jeffrey Energy Center ("Jeffrey"),
a 2,070-megawatt coal-fired generating station.  (See the related discussion
under "Commitments and Contingencies" on page 45 of the company's 1993 Annual
Report to Shareholders.  Such information is incorporated by reference herein.)
The company through its MPS division also has an 8% ownership interest in
Jeffrey.

     In late 1992 and early 1993, the company renegotiated its major coal supply
and rail contracts, all at favorable prices.  These contracts supply a
substantial portion of the company's coal requirements. The company also
purchases coal in the spot market when market conditions dictate.

     A summary of the electric operations is set forth on pages 18 and 19 of the
company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information is incorporated
by reference herein.

Competition

     The company believes that competition possible as a result of open
transmission legislation now being considered by Congress may benefit the
electric industry.  The company is confident that its electric utilities will be
able to compete effectively with outside producers in providing electric service
to existing and new customers.

                                 GAS OPERATIONS

     The company serves approximately 740,000 customers in eight states through
its Peoples Natural Gas ("PNG"), Michigan Gas Utilities ("MGU"), Northern
Minnesota Utilities ("NMU"), Kansas Public Service ("KPS"), WVP and MPS
divisions.

     Residential sales have accounted for approximately 55%, 54% and 52% of gas
revenues during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and approximately 51%, 50%
and 47% of thousand cubic feet ("MCF") tariff gas volumes sold during 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively.  Gas volumes delivered for third parties have averaged
approximately 47% of total MCF deliveries over the past three years due
primarily to the deregulation within the natural gas industry.  A summary of the
company's gas revenues, MCF sales and customers, by class, for the past three
years is set forth under "Gas Operations" on page 54 of the company's 1993
Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information is incorporated by reference
herein.

     In 1993, the company's gas divisions purchased approximately 71% of their
gas supply requirements through spot market purchases.  A divisional summary of
information on contract and spot market purchases and gas costs is set forth in
Exhibit 99(b) to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is incorporated by
reference herein.

Recent Acquisition

     On February 1, 1993, the company purchased the Nebraska gas distribution
system of Arkla, Inc.'s ("Arkla") Minnegasco division ("Nebraska System") for
approximately $99 million, including $21 million in working capital.  The
Nebraska System serves about 124,000 gas customers in 63 eastern Nebraska
communities, including the city of Lincoln.  The Nebraska System is being
operated as part of PNG.

Pending Acquisitions

     On May 7, 1993, the company signed an acquisition agreement with Arkla to
purchase its Kansas gas distribution and transmission systems ("Kansas Systems")
for approximately $25 million.  The Kansas Systems serve about 22,000 customers
in Wichita and several surrounding communities.

     The company expects to complete the acquisition of the Kansas Systems in
the first half of 1994.  The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory
approval.  Upon completion, the Kansas Systems will be operated as part of PNG.

     On February 15, 1994, the company announced the signing of a definitive
agreement for the purchase of a Missouri intrastate natural gas pipeline system
owned by Edisto Resources Corporation.  The $75 million purchase price includes
the gas distribution system at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri along with a pipeline
that crosses the Mississippi river north of St. Louis.  The transaction requires
regulatory approval and is expected to close later in 1994.

     A summary of the gas operations is set forth on pages 20 and 21 of the
company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information is incorporated
by reference herein.

                                       I-3

Competition

     The company's gas divisions are subject to competition in the industrial
sector from fuel oil, propane, coal and waste wood.  The company has been able
to maintain its customer base through flexible tariff rates, attractive storage
pricing and transportation services.  The company believes it can continue to
retain industrial customers through such mechanisms in the future.

     Residential customer competition comes primarily from electric utility
incentives and low-cost financing offers.  The company has been able to maintain
its customer base through similar programs of its own.

                            ENERGY RELATED BUSINESSES

     Aquila formed three business units in 1989 to focus on various segments of
its operations:  Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation, Aquila Energy Resources
Corporation and Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation (formerly Aquila Gas Systems
Corporation).  In October 1993, Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation (AGP) completed
an initial public offering of 5.4 million shares of common stock, representing
about 18% of the outstanding stock of AGP.

     Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation (AEM) has a marketing, supply and
transportation network consisting of relationships with more than 1,700 gas
producers and 800 local distribution companies and end-users throughout the
United States, Mexico and Canada.  Through more than 350 transportation
agreements, it has over 13,000 gas receiving and delivery points available on a
network of 33 pipelines.

     Aquila Energy Resources Corporation (AER) acquires proved gas and oil
reserves and operates onshore and offshore production facilities.  Supplementary
information on gas and oil-producing activities appears in Note 13 on pages 48
and 49 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information is
incorporated by reference herein.

     In 1991, the company, through Aquila, purchased the remaining 51%
partnership interest in Aquila-Clajon Limited Holdings, L.P. and Aquila-Clajon
General Holdings, L.P. (collectively, the "Clajon Partnerships").  The Clajon
Partnerships were renamed Aquila Southwest which is now a primary component of
the operations of AGP.

     AGP owns and operates a 2,300-mile intrastate gas transmission and
gathering network, four processing plants that extract and sell natural gas
liquids and a subsidiary that markets natural gas.

     AER's net gas and oil production, average gross sales price per MCF of gas
and per barrel of oil, and average production costs of gas and oil stated on an
MCF equivalent basis are reflected below:

     AEM has entered into numerous long-term gas supply contracts at fixed
prices.  At December 31, 1993, AEM had minimum fixed price sales obligations of
29.0, 15.2, 15.2, 15.2 and 15.2 BCF for deliveries in the year 1994 to 1998,
respectively, at prices that range from $1.73 to $3.41 per MCF.

     During 1993, Aquila continued its review of its long-term strategy which
began in mid-1992.  Upon completion of this planning process, the company
recorded an after tax restructuring charge of $45 million.  For additional
information regarding the operations of Aquila, the initial public offering of
AGP, the revised long-term strategy and the restructuring charge, please refer
to pages 23, 24 and 25 of the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders and Notes 3 and
4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included therein.  Such information
is incorporated by reference herein.

     In June 1992, the company and Aquila filed a lawsuit in a Houston, Texas
federal court against two former officers of AER, as well as the wife of one of
them, seeking to recover actual and punitive damages for improper payments
related to the acquisition of gas and oil reserves.  The company is also
pursuing action to recover part of the loss through insurance coverage.  (See
related discussion under Item 3 Legal Proceedings beginning on Page I-10.)

     Competition

     Aquila has various competitors for the markets it serves, including other
marketing companies, gas pipelines, distribution companies, major oil and gas
companies and alternative fuels.  Aquila's ability to compete successfully and
grow in this environment is contingent upon performance, price and the stability
of the gas markets.

     The competition Aquila encounters in acquiring assets typically comes from
pipeline and production companies.  The primary focus of all groups is to find
strategically located reserves to support their individual markets.

(1)  All capacity, volume and mileage information is approximate.  Capacity
     figures are management's estimates based on existing facilities without
     regard to the present availability of natural gas.  Volumes presented above
     are for residue gas, which is gas that has been processed for the removal
     of natural gas liquids.
(2)  AGP has entered into a joint venture whereby AGP receives 50% of the
     earnings of the pipeline.  The average daily volume of gas shown above is
     AGP's 50% share.
</TABLE>

     AGP owns and operates four natural gas processing and treating plants.  One
is located in southwest Oklahoma and had a rated capacity and average
utilization of 115,000 MCF and 73,000 MCF, respectively, in 1993.  AGP operates
three plants in southeast Texas having rated capacities of 230,000 MCF, 25,000
MCF and 3,000 MCF.  Average utilization was 212,000 MCF, 26,000 MCF and 1,000
MCF, respectively, for these plants in 1993.

     The availability of natural gas reserves to AGP depends on their
development in the area served by its pipelines and on AGP's ability to purchase
gas currently sold to or transported through other pipelines.  The development
of additional gas reserves will be affected by many factors including the prices
of natural gas and crude oil, exploration and development costs and the presence
of natural gas reserves in the areas served by AGP's systems.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On June 17, 1992, a class action suit was filed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Missouri by a stockholder against the
Company and certain unnamed employees of the Company and/or its subsidiary,
Aquila Energy Corporation.  The case caption is WILLIAM ALPERN V. UTILICORP
UNITED INC., ET AL.  In this case, plaintiff alleges that the Company violated
various securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
both by making misrepresentations and omitting to state material facts in
connection with public disclosures.  The plaintiff also alleges a claim under
Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Among other relief,
plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages.  Discovery in the case is now
underway.

     On June 17, 1992, UtiliCorp commenced a civil suit against Vincent Marquez
and Richard Stegall, former employees of Aquila Energy Resources Corporation,
and Mr. Stegall's former wife, Corre Stegall.  Aquila Energy Resources
Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquila Energy Corporation which, in
turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UtiliCorp.  This case was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston,
alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty, committed fraud,
embezzled plaintiffs' money and converted plaintiffs' funds for defendants' own
use or use of others.  Mrs. Stegall filed an answer denying knowledge of any of
the matters alleged.  Marquez and Stegall filed a joint answer and counterclaim,
admitting that funds were received by them or other third parties as alleged in
the complaint but denying any wrongdoing on their part and contending that all
such payments were done under the direction and approval of plaintiffs.  In
their counterclaim, Marquez and Stegall have alleged five separate claims:  (1)
fraud; (2) misrepresentation; (3) fraudulent inducement; (4) tortious
interference; and (5) libel and slander.  All of these claims are premised on
the basic factual contentions that UtiliCorp and Aquila authorized and approved
the use of the brokers and the middlemen on the transactions in question,
authorized and approved the payments to the brokers and middlemen on the
transactions in question, and further authorized and approved payments to
Stegall on the transactions in question as extra bonus compensation.  Marquez
and Stegall allege that their damages are undetermined, but suggest they have
been damaged in the approximate amount of $7,500,000.  Marquez and Stegall have
also filed a third-party complaint against the former president of Aquila,
claiming that he personally authorized and approved all of their conduct which
is the subject matter of plaintiffs' complaint.  On April 30, 1993, UtiliCorp
and Aquila amended their complaint, seeking damages of approximately $15
million, and adding 32 additional defendants, consisting of individuals and
corporations who either participated with defendants Marquez and Stegall in the
misappropriation or who received a portion of the misappropriated funds.
UtiliCorp and Aquila also sought injunctive relief against all defendants with
respect to their bank accounts containing these funds.  The court granted a
temporary restraining order, but on May 7, dissolved the injunction, except as
to the Marquez Ranch, where the court appointed a Receiver.  The court has
denied several motions for summary judgment filed by various defendants who were
added by the amended complaint.  The court has granted one motion for summary
judgment, by defendants PK Investments and its principals, Charlene Poulos and
John Keys, but the court has refused to make such judgment final.  Ten of the
defendants have all filed counterclaims, sounding in abuse of process, bad
faith, slander, libel and tortious interference, all relating to their joinder
in the lawsuit and the action taken to obtain the temporary restraining order.

                                      I-10

<PAGE>

     Four defendants have filed additional counterclaims for breach of contract
and fraud relating to the transactions which are the subject of the UtiliCorp
and Aquila claims and are similar to the counterclaims originally asserted by
defendants Marquez and Stegall.  The case will be tried in late September or
early October 1994.

     On August 13, 1992, a class action suit was filed in the United States
District Court of the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against the
Company, Aquila Energy Corporation, Aquila Energy Resources Corporation, Richard
C. Green, Jr., Marc L. Petersen, Richard D. Stegall and Vincent F. Marquez.  The
case is captioned MARTIN AND SELMA KAPLAN V. UTILICORP UNITED INC., ET AL.   In
this case plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated various securities
laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and allege
common law fraud and deceit, alleging misrepresentations and omissions of
material facts in connection with public disclosures.  Plaintiffs sought
unspecified compensatory damages.  On November 10, 1992, the District Court
dismissed all counts in the KAPLAN case as to all defendants.  The dismissal was
affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals to the Fifth Circuit, and no
further appeals were taken.

                                     PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

     The company's common stock is listed on the New York, Pacific and Toronto
stock exchanges under the symbol UCU.  At December 31, 1993, the company had
33,902 common shareholders of record.  Information relating to market prices of
Common Stock and cash dividends on Common Stock is set forth in Note 14 on page
50 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such information is
incorporated by reference herein.

     Cash dividends on the Common Stock of the company and its predecessor have
been paid each year since 1939.

     Cash dividends on and acquisition of the company's capital stock are
restricted by provisions of the company's first mortgage indentures and by the
Preference Stock provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.  Under the most
restrictive of these provisions, contained in the MGU Indenture, the company may
not declare or pay any dividend (other than a dividend payable in shares of its
capital stock), whether in cash, stock or otherwise, or make any other
distribution, on or with respect to any class of its capital stock, or purchase
or otherwise acquire any shares of, any class of its capital stock if, after
giving effect thereto, the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of all dividends
declared and all other distributions made (other than dividends declared or
distributions made in shares of its capital stock) on shares of its capital
stock, of any class, subsequent to December 31, 1984, plus (ii) the excess, if
any, of the amount applied to or set apart for the purchase or other acquisition
of any shares of its capital stock, of any class, subsequent to December 31,
1984, over such amounts as shall have been received by the company as the net
cash proceeds of sales of shares of its capital stock, of any class, subsequent
to December 31, 1984, would exceed the sum of the net income of the company
since January 1, 1985, plus $50 million.  In addition, the company may not
declare such dividends unless it maintains a tangible net worth of at least $250
million and the aggregate principal amount of its outstanding indebtedness does
not exceed 70% of its capitalization.  None of the company's retained earnings
was restricted as to payment of cash dividends on its capital stock as of
December 31, 1993.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     Information regarding the five-year selected financial data is set forth on

on page 39 of the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Such

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

     The financial statements, together with the report thereon of Arthur
Andersen & Co. dated January 31, 1994, are set forth on pages 32 through 51 of
the company's 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 1991, were audited by Price Waterhouse and their report
is set forth on page IV-4 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Such information
is incorporated by reference herein.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

     On May 5, 1992, the company dismissed Price Waterhouse as its independent
accountants.

     The report of Price Waterhouse on the financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 1991 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion
and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principle.

     The company's Audit Committee and Board of Directors approved the decision
to change independent accountants.

     In connection with its audit for the year ended December 31, 1991 and
through May 5, 1992, there had been no disagreements with Price Waterhouse on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved
to the satisfaction of Price Waterhouse would have caused them to make reference
thereto in their report on the financial statements for such year.

     During the year ended December 31, 1991 and through May 5, 1992, there were
no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(v)).

     The company requested that Price Waterhouse furnish it with a letter
addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements.
A copy of such letter, dated May 5, 1992, was filed as Exhibit 16 to the
company's current report on Form 8-K, dated May 5, 1992.

     The company engaged Arthur Andersen & Co. as its new independent
accountants as of May 5, 1992 and since that date, there have been no
disagreements with Arthur Andersen & Co. on accounting and financial
disclosures.

                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES


To the Board of Directors
of UtiliCorp United Inc.

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements for 1993 and 1992 described on page 51 of
UtiliCorp United Inc.'s Annual Report to the Board of Directors and Shareholders
incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon
dated January 31, 1994.  Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on those statements taken as a whole.  The Financial Statement Schedules
listed in Item 14(a)2 are presented for the purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects
the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors
of UtiliCorp United Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of
capitalization and the related consolidated statement of income, of common
shareholders' equity and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1991
(appearing on pages 32 through 35 of the 1993 Annual Report to Shareholders of
UtiliCorp United Inc. which has been incorporated by reference in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of UtiliCorp United Inc. and its
subsidiaries for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.  We have not audited the
consolidated financial statements of UtiliCorp United Inc. for any period
subsequent to December 31, 1991.

In 1992, the company gave retroactive effect to a change in the method of
accounting for gas and oil properties.

of UtiliCorp United Inc.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements referred to in our report,
appearing on page IV-4 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K also included an audit
of the Financial Statement Schedules for the year ended December 31, 1991 listed
in Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K.  In our opinion, these Financial Statement
Schedules present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth

statements.

accounting for gas and oil properties.

confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1
hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Contract Borrowing,

to be made by such Lender as part of such Contract Borrowing when such Contract
Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

          (d)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior
to the date of any Contract Borrowing that such Lender will not make available
to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Contract Borrowing, the Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the
date of such Contract Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that
such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent,
such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day

amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest
rate applicable at the time to Contract Advances made in connection with such
Contract Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.
If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount
so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Contract Advance as part of such
Contract Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

by it as part of any Contract Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Contract Advance on the date of
such Contract Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to make the Contract Advance to be made by such other Lender on
the date of any Contract Borrowing.

          (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
more than eight Contract Borrowings may be outstanding at any time.

          SECTION 2.03.  THE AUCTION ADVANCES.  (a) Each Lender severally agrees
that the Borrower may request Auction Borrowings under this Section 2.03 from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until
the date occurring 30 days prior to the Termination Date in the manner set forth
below; PROVIDED that, following the making of each Auction Borrowing, the
aggregate amount of the Advances then outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Commitments of the Lenders (computed without regard to any Auction
Reduction).

          (i)  The Borrower may request an Auction Borrowing by delivering to
     the Agent (A) by telecopier, telex or cable, confirmed immediately in
     writing, a notice of an Auction Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF AN

                                                                              16

     AUCTION BORROWING"), in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto,
     specifying the date and aggregate amount of the proposed Auction Borrowing,
     the maturity date for repayment of each Auction Advance to be made as part
     of such Auction Borrowing (which maturity date may not be earlier than the
     date occurring 30 days after the date of such Auction Borrowing or later
     than the day prior to the Termination Date), the interest payment date or
     dates relating thereto (which shall occur at least every 90 days), and any
     other terms to be applicable to such Auction Borrowing, not later than
     10:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one Business Day prior to the date
     of the proposed Auction Borrowing and (B) payment in full to the Agent of
     the aggregate auction administration fee specified in Section 2.04(c)
     hereof.  The Agent shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of each
     request for an Auction Borrowing received by it from the Borrower by
     sending such Lender on such Business Day a copy of the related Notice of an
     Auction Borrowing.

          (ii) Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so,
     irrevocably offer to make one or more Auction Advances to the Borrower as
     part of such proposed Auction Borrowing at a rate or rates of interest
     specified by such Lender in its sole discretion, by notifying the Agent
     (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower), before 10:00 A.M.
     (New York City time) on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing of the
     minimum amount and maximum amount of each Auction Advance that such Lender
     would be willing to make as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing (which
     amounts may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section
     2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the rate or rates of interest
     therefor, the interest period relating thereto (which interest period may
     not exceed 90 days) and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with
     respect to such Auction Advance; PROVIDED that if the Agent in its capacity
     as a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer, it
     shall notify the Borrower of such offer before 9:00 A.M. (New York City
     time) on the date on which notice of such election is to be given to the
     Agent by the other Lenders.  If any Lender shall elect not to make such an
     offer, such Lender shall so notify the Agent, before 10:00 A.M. (New York
     City time) on the date on which notice of such election is to be given to
     the Agent by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be obligated to,
     and shall not, make any Auction Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing;
     PROVIDED that the failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not cause
     such Lender to be obligated to make any Auction Advance as part of such
     proposed Auction Borrowing.

          (iii)     The Borrower shall, in turn, before 11:00 A.M. (New York
     City time) on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing, either

               (A)  cancel such Auction Borrowing by giving the Agent notice to
          that effect, or

               (B)  irrevocably accept one or more of the offers made by any
          Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole
          discretion, subject only to the provisions of this paragraph (iii), by
          giving notice to the Agent of the amount of each Auction Advance
          (which amount shall be equal to or greater than the minimum amount,
          and equal to or less than the maximum amount, notified to the Borrower
          by the Agent on behalf of such Lender for such Auction Advance
          pursuant to paragraph (ii) above) to be made by each Lender as part of
          such Auction Borrowing, and reject any remaining offers made by
          Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above by giving the Agent notice to
          that effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) the Borrower shall not accept
          an offer made pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, at any Yield if the
          Borrower shall have, or shall be deemed to have, rejected any other
          offer made pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, at a lower Yield, (y) if
          the Borrower declines to accept, or is otherwise restricted by the
          provisions of this Agreement from accepting, the maximum aggregate
          principal amount of Auction Borrowings offered at the same Yield
          pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, then the Borrower shall accept a PRO
          RATA portion of each offer made at such Yield, based as nearly as
          possible on the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of such offers
          to be accepted by the Borrower to the maximum aggregate principal
          amount of such offers made pursuant to paragraph (ii) above (rounding
          up or down to the next higher or lower multiple of $1,000,000), and
          (z) no offer made pursuant to paragraph (ii) above shall be accepted
          unless the Auction Borrowing in respect of such offer is in an
          integral multiple of $1,000,000 and the aggregate amount of such
          offers accepted by the Borrower is equal to at least $10,000,000.

     Any offer or offers made pursuant to paragraph (ii) above not expressly
     accepted or rejected by the Borrower in accordance with this paragraph
     (iii) shall be deemed to have been rejected by the Borrower.

          (iv) If the Borrower notifies the Agent that such Auction Borrowing is
     canceled pursuant to clause (A) of paragraph (iii) above, the Agent shall
     give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders and such Auction Borrowing shall
     not be made.

          (v)  If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers made by any
     Lender or Lenders pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (iii) above,

<PAGE>

                                                                              18

     the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Lender that has made an
     offer as described in paragraph (ii) above, of the date and aggregate
     amount of such Auction Borrowing and whether or not any offer or offers
     made by such Lender pursuant to paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by
     the Borrower, (B) each Lender that is to make an Auction Advance as part of
     such Auction Borrowing of the amount of each Auction Advance to be made by
     such Lender as part of such Auction Borrowing, and (C) each Lender that is
     to make an Auction Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing, upon receipt,
     that the Agent has received forms of documents appearing to fulfill the
     applicable conditions set forth in Article III.  Each Lender that is to
     make an Auction Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing shall, before
     12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such Auction Borrowing
     specified in the notice received from the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of
     the preceding sentence or any later time when such Lender shall have
     received notice from the Agent pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding
     sentence, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
     to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02 such Lender's
     portion of such Auction Borrowing, in same day funds.  Upon fulfillment of
     the applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after receipt by the
     Agent of such funds, the Agent will make such funds available to the
     Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.  Promptly after each Auction
     Borrowing the Agent will notify each Lender of the amount of the Auction
     Borrowing, the consequent Auction Reduction and the dates upon which such
     Auction Reduction commenced and will terminate.

          (b)  Each Auction Advance shall be in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and,
following the making of each Auction Borrowing, the Borrower shall be in
compliance with the limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of
subsection (a) above.

          (c)  Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section
2.03, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.03, repay
or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section
2.03, PROVIDED that an Auction Borrowing shall not be made within three Business
Days of the date of any other Auction Borrowing.

          (d)  The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender that has made an Auction Advance, or each other holder of an Auction
Note, on the maturity date of each Auction Advance (such maturity date being
that specified by the Borrower for repayment of such Auction Advance in the
related Notice of an Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above and provided in the Auction Note evidencing such Auction

<PAGE>

                                                                              19

Advance), the then unpaid principal amount of such Auction Advance.  The
Borrower shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any Auction
Advance unless, and then only on the terms, specified by the Borrower for such
Auction Advance in the related Notice of an Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant
to subsection (a)(i) above and set forth in the Auction Note evidencing such
Auction Advance.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
in any Auction Note, each Auction Advance shall be due and payable no later than
360 days following the date of such Auction Advance.

          (e)  The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Auction Advance from the date of such Auction Advance to the date the
principal amount of such Auction Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of
interest for such Auction Advance specified by the Lender making such Auction
Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection
(a)(ii) above, payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by the
Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related Notice of an Auction Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the Auction Note
evidencing such Auction Advance.

          (f)  The indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each Auction
Advance made to the Borrower as part of an Auction Borrowing shall be evidenced
by a separate Auction Note of the Borrower payable to the order of the Lender
making such Auction Advance.

     SECTION 2.04.  FEES.  (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of
such Lender's Commitment (after giving effect to any Auction Reduction) from the
date hereof in the case of each Bank and from the effective date specified in
the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case
of each other Lender until the earlier to occur of the Termination Date and, in
the case of the termination in whole of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to
Section 2.05, the date of such termination, payable on the last day of each
March, June, September and December during such period (commencing December 31,
1993) and on the earlier to occur of the Termination Date and, in the case of
the termination in whole of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to Section 2.05, the
date of such termination, at the rate of 0.1875% PER ANNUM; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such rate shall be increased (on a non-cumulative basis) by (i) 0.0125% PER
ANNUM in the event that, and at all times during which, either the Moody's
Rating shall be lower than A3 or the S&P Rating shall be lower than A-, (ii)
0.0625% PER ANNUM in the event that, and at all times during which, either the
Moody's Rating shall be lower than Baa2 or the S&P Rating shall be lower than

                                                                              20

the S&P Rating shall be lower than BBB- or (B) the Borrower's senior unsecured
indebtedness shall be unrated by both Moody's and S&P.

          (b)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender an auction facility fee on the average daily aggregate principal amount
of Auction Advances outstanding during the period from the date hereof in the
case of each Bank and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender
until the earlier to occur of the Termination Date and, in the case of the
termination in whole of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to Section 2.05, the date
of such termination, payable on the last day of each March, June, September and
December during such period (commencing December 31, 1993) and on the earlier to
occur of the Termination Date and, in the case of the termination in whole of a
Lender's Commitment pursuant to Section 2.05, the date of such termination, at
the rate of 0.1875% PER ANNUM.

          (c)  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for its own account an
auction administration fee in the amount of $3,500 in respect of each Auction
Borrowing requested by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03(a)(i), payable on
the date of such request.

          SECTION 2.05.  REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS.  (a) AT BORROWER'S
OPTION.  The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least two Business Days'
notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused
portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, PROVIDED that the
aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an
amount that is less than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then
outstanding and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that each partial reduction shall be in the
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof.

          (b)  MANDATORY.  The respective Commitments of the Lenders shall
automatically reduce ratably upon each disposition of assets or capital stock in
excess of the 7.5% and 51% thresholds, respectively, described in Section
5.02(c) by an amount equal, in the aggregate, to the amount of consideration (as
defined in Section 5.02(c)) received by the Borrower in respect of such assets
or capital stock, as the case may be, but only to the extent that the
disposition of such assets or capital stock, as the case may be, exceeds such
thresholds; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no reduction in the Commitments shall occur
as a result of any such disposition if on the date thereof, and after giving
effect thereto, the total assets of the Borrower are equal to or greater than
the total assets of the Borrower as of September 30, 1993, in each case as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistent with those applied in the preparation of the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.01(e); and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that each such
Commitment reduction shall be made

<PAGE>

                                                                              21

PRO RATA among the Commitments hereunder and the "Commitments" under the 360-Day
Credit Agreement, if any.

          (c)  AT LENDER'S OPTION.  The Borrower shall give the Agent and each
Lender at least twenty Business Days' notice (a "PROPOSAL NOTICE") of its
intention to use the proceeds of any Borrowing hereunder directly or indirectly
in connection with (i) the acquisition of in excess of 5% of any class of equity
security that is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, (ii) any
transaction subject to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act or
(iii) any transaction subject to the requirements of Section 14 of the Exchange
Act with respect to which proxies, consents or authorizations, as the case may
be, are being sought by any person (as defined in the Exchange Act) other than
the majority of the board of directors of the issuer of the securities in
respect of which such proxies, consents or authorizations are being sought.  Any
Lender may, within fifteen Business Days after receipt of such Proposal Notice
from the Borrower, give notice (a "TERMINATION NOTICE") to the Agent and the
Borrower that such Lender has made a good faith determination that the use of
proceeds described in such Proposal Notice, if funded by such Lender, would
create a conflict of interest for such Lender (based upon the existence of
commitments by such Lender to other parties in interest to such transaction,
confidential information held by such Lender relating to such transaction or any
other party in interest to such transaction or other similar circumstances that
would reasonably prevent or prohibit a commercial financial institution from
extending credit to the Borrower under such circumstances) or would otherwise
violate a commercial lending policy of such Lender because of an existing
customer relationship of such Lender or any of its Affiliates with the issuer of
any such securities, and that, accordingly, such Lender elects to terminate its
Commitment if the proceeds of such Borrowing will be used in such a manner.  If
no Termination Notice is received by the Borrower within fifteen Business Days
after receipt by the Lenders of a Proposal Notice, the Borrower may apply the
proceeds of the affected Borrowing in accordance with such Proposal Notice.  If
the Borrower receives a Termination Notice from any Lender within such fifteen
Business Day period, the Borrower shall promptly thereafter notify the Agent and
each of the Lenders (an "INTENTION NOTICE") whether it will use the proceeds of
the affected Borrowing for the purposes specified in such Proposal Notice, and,
if the proceeds will be used for such purposes, the Commitment of each Lender
that delivered a Termination Notice shall terminate immediately upon receipt by
such Lender of such Intention Notice.  Upon such termination, the Borrower shall
(i) immediately repay all of such Lender's outstanding Base Rate Advances,
together with accrued interest thereon, (ii) repay all of such Lender's
outstanding Adjusted CD Rate Advances and Eurodollar Rate Advances, together
with accrued interest thereon, at the end of the respective Interest Periods
applicable thereto and (iii) repay all of such Lender's outstanding Auction
Advances, together with accrued interest thereon, at the respective

<PAGE>

                                                                              22

maturity dates therefor.  All accrued fees with respect to such Lender's
Commitment shall be payable on the date of receipt of the applicable Intention
Notice.

          SECTION 2.06.  REPAYMENT OF CONTRACT ADVANCES.  The Borrower shall
repay the principal amount of each Contract Advance made by each Lender in
accordance with the Contract Note to the order of such Lender.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or in any Contract Note, each Contract
Advance shall be due and payable no later than 360 days following the date of
such Contract Advance.

          SECTION 2.07.   INTEREST ON CONTRACT ADVANCES.  The Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Contract Advance made by each
Lender from the date of such Contract Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates PER ANNUM:

          (a)  BASE RATE ADVANCES.  If such Contract Advance is a Base Rate
     Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the sum of the Base Rate in
     effect from time to time PLUS the Applicable Margin for such Base Rate in
     effect from time to time, payable quarterly on the last day of each March,
     June, September and December during such periods and on the date such Base
     Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

          (b)  ADJUSTED CD RATE ADVANCES.  If such Contract Advance is an
     Adjusted CD Rate Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times during each
     Interest Period for such Contract Advance to the sum of the Adjusted CD
     Rate for such Interest Period PLUS the Applicable Margin for such Adjusted
     CD Rate in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of each
     Interest Period for such Adjusted CD Rate Advance and on the date such
     Adjusted CD Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

          (c)  EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES.  Subject to Section 2.08, if such
     Contract Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal at
     all times during each Interest Period for such Contract Advance to the sum
     of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period PLUS the Applicable Margin
     for such Eurodollar Rate Advance in effect from time to time, payable on
     the last day of each Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advance and
     on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in
     full.

          SECTION 2.08.  ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON CONTRACT ADVANCES.  The Borrower
shall pay to each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required under
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to

<PAGE>

                                                                              23

maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such
Contract Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest
rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i)
the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period for such Contract Advance from (ii)
the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100%
minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest
Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Contract
Advance.  Such additional interest shall be determined by such Lender and
notified to the Borrower through the Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.09.  INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION.  (a) Each Reference Bank
agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining
each Adjusted CD Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as applicable.  If any one or more of
the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for
the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine
such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining
Reference Banks.

          (b)  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of
Section 2.07(a), (b) or (c), and the applicable rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.07(b) or (c).

          (c)  If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to
the Agent for determining the Adjusted CD Rate for any Adjusted CD Rate
Advances, or the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

          (i)  the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the Lenders
     that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Adjusted CD Rate
     Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be,

          (ii) each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
     existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if
     such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
     Advance), and

          (iii)     the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
     Contract Advances into, Adjusted CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate
     Advances, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the Agent shall

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

     notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist.

          (d)  If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority
Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for
such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of
making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon

          (i)  each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
     of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
     Advance, and

          (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Contract
     Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent
     shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing
     such suspension no longer exist.

          (e)  If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Adjusted CD Rate Advances or any Eurodollar Rate Advances in
accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period"
in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders
and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

          (f)  On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Contract Advances made in connection with any Contract Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such
Contract Advances shall, if they are Advances of a Type other than Base Rate
Advances, automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances, and on and after such
date the right of the Borrower to Convert such Contract Advances into Advances
of a Type other than Base Rate Advances shall terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if and so long as each such Contract Advance shall be of the same Type and have
the same Interest Period as Contract Advances made in connection with another
Contract Borrowing or other Contract Borrowings, and the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all such Contract Advances shall equal or exceed
$10,000,000, the Borrower shall have the right to continue all such Contract
Advances as, or to Convert all such Contract Advances into, Advances of such
Type having such Interest Period.

          SECTION 2.10.  VOLUNTARY CONVERSION OF CONTRACT ADVANCES. The Borrower
may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00

                                                                              25

date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.09
and 2.13, Convert all Contract Advances of one Type made in connection with the
same Contract Borrowing into Advances of another Type; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
any Conversion of, or with respect to, any Adjusted CD Rate Advances or
Eurodollar Rate Advances into Advances of another Type shall be made on, and
only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Adjusted CD Rate Advances
or Eurodollar Rate Advances, unless the Borrower shall also reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(b) on the date of such
Conversion; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if, on the date of any proposed
Conversion, any Event of Default or event that would constitute an Event of
Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both
shall have occurred and be continuing, all Contract Advances subject to such
proposed Conversion shall, on such date, automatically Convert into, or remain
as, as the case may be, Base Rate Advances.  Each such notice of a Conversion
shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
Conversion, (ii) the Contract Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is into, or with respect to, Adjusted CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for each such Contract
Advance.

          SECTION 2.11.  PREPAYMENTS.  (a)  OPTIONAL.  The Borrower may, upon at
least two Business Days' notice to the Agent stating the proposed date and
aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the
Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances made as
part of the same Contract Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) in the case of any such
prepayment of an Adjusted CD Advance or Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower
shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.04(b) on the date of such prepayment.

          (b)  MANDATORY.  Upon each disposition of assets or capital stock
described in Section 5.02(c), the Agent shall apply amounts received from the
Borrower pursuant to clause (B) of Section 5.02(c) to the prepayment of Advances
outstanding hereunder in the following order of priority:

          FIRST, to the prepayment in whole or ratably in part of the principal
amount of all outstanding Contract Advances together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, and

          SECOND, to the prepayment in whole or ratably in part of the principal
amount of outstanding Auction Advances together with accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, in the order of their
maturities.

          SECTION 2.12.  INCREASED COSTS.  (a)  If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Adjusted CD Rate Advances,
included in the Adjusted CD Rate Reserve Percentage or, in the case of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in
or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Adjusted CD Rate Advances, Eurodollar Rate Advances or any other Advances, then
the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost.
A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower
and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

          (b)  If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment
to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type or the Advances, then, upon
demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower
shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to
time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the
extent that such Lender determines such increase in capital to be allocable to
the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder or the Advances made
by such Lender.  A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and
the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.13.  ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it
unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its
obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make,
or to Convert Contract Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (ii) the Borrower
shall forthwith

<PAGE>

                                                                              27

prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Advances of all Lenders then outstanding,
together with interest accrued thereon, unless the Borrower, within five
Business Days of notice from the Agent, Converts all Eurodollar Rate Advances of
all Lenders then outstanding into Advances of another Type in accordance with
Section 2.10.

          SECTION 2.14.  PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.  (a)  The Borrower shall
make each payment hereunder and under the Notes not later than 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 in same day funds.  The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or commitment and auction facility fees ratably (other
than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.03, 2.08, 2.12, 2.15 or
8.04(b)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending
Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to
any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon
its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after
the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall
make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such
Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

          (b)  The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent
payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under any Note
held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

          (c)  All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made
by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
all computations of interest based on the Adjusted CD Rate, the Eurodollar Rate
or the Federal Funds Rate and of commitment fees, auction facility fees and
interest payable on Auction Advances shall be made by the Agent, and all
computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.08 shall be made by a Lender, on
the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest or commitment fees are payable.  Each determination by the
Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.08, by a Lender) of an interest rate
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

          (d)  Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated
to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the
case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

          (e)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays
such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          (f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note that is not paid when
due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall (to the
fullest extent permitted by law) bear interest from the date when due until paid
in full at a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the Base Rate plus 2%, payable
upon demand.

          SECTION 2.15.  TAXES.  (a)  Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder or under the Contract Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.14, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, EXCLUDING, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES").
If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all

<PAGE>

                                                                              29

required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.15) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b)  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes or
from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

          (c)  The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
2.15) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted.  This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

          (d)  Prior to the date of the initial Borrowing in the case of each
Bank, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter if requested by the Borrower or the Agent, each Lender organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide the
Agent and the Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
of the United States certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States
withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender
hereunder and under the Notes.  If for any reason during the term of this
Agreement, any Lender becomes unable to submit the forms referred to above or
the information or representations contained therein are no longer accurate in
any material respect, such Lender shall notify the Agent and the Borrower in
writing to that effect.  Unless the Borrower and the Agent have received forms
or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or
under any Note are not subject to United States withholding tax, the Borrower or
the Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory
rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States.

          (e)  Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.15 shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its

<PAGE>

                                                                              30

Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts which may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (f)  If the Borrower makes any additional payment to any Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.15 in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes, and such
Lender determines that it has received (i) a refund of such Taxes or Other Taxes
or (ii) a credit against or relief or remission for, or a reduction in the
amount of, any tax or other governmental charge solely as a result of any
deduction or credit for any Taxes or Other Taxes with respect to which it has
received payments under this Section 2.15, such Lender shall, to the extent that
it can do so without prejudice to the retention of such refund, credit, relief,
remission or reduction, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender shall
have determined to be attributable to the deduction or withholding of such Taxes
of Other Taxes.  If such Lender later determines that it was not entitled to
such refund, credit, relief, remission or reduction to the full extent of any
payment made pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.15(f), the
Borrower shall upon demand of such Lender promptly repay the amount of such
overpayment.  Any determination made by such Lender pursuant to this Section
2.15(f) shall in the absence of bad faith or manifest error be conclusive, and
nothing in this Section 2.15(f) shall be construed as requiring any Lender to
conduct its business or to arrange or alter in any respect its tax or financial
affairs so that it is entitled to receive such a refund, credit or reduction or
as allowing any Person to inspect any records, including tax returns, of any
Lender.

          (g)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder and under the Notes.

          SECTION 2.16.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  If any Lender shall obtain
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Contract Advances made by it (other
than pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.08, 2.12, 2.15 or 8.04(b)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the Contract Advances obtained by all
the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Contract Advances made by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of

<PAGE>

                                                                              31

such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

          SECTION 2.17.  EXTENSION OF TERMINATION DATE.  At least 90 but not
more than 120 days prior to the then-scheduled Termination Date, the Borrower
may (on no more than two such occasions) request the Lenders, by written notice
to the Agent, to consent to a one-year extension of the Termination Date.  Each
Lender shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether to consent to such
request and shall notify the Agent of its determination within 60 days of such
Lender's receipt of notice of such request.  If such request shall have been
consented to by all the Lenders, the Agent shall notify the Borrower in writing
of such consent, and such extension shall become effective upon the delivery by
the Borrower to the Agent and each Lender, on or prior to the then-scheduled
Termination Date, of (i) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the
Borrower, dated such date, as to the accuracy, both before and after giving
effect to such proposed extension, of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.01 and as to the absence, both before and after giving effect
to such proposed extension, of any Event of Default or event that with the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute an Event of
Default and (ii) an opinion of counsel to the Borrower as to the extension of
the Termination Date and such other matters as any Lender, through the Agent,
may reasonably request.

          SECTION 3.03.  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO EACH AUCTION BORROWING.  The

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


          SECTION 4.01.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER.  The

     corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified to do
     business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature
     of the business conducted or the property owned, operated or leased by it

     materially adversely affect its condition (financial or otherwise),
     operations, business, properties, or prospects.

          (b)  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
     Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have
     been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not

     $10,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its
     Significant Subsidiaries and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have
     been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there
     shall be any period of 10 consecutive days during which a stay of
     enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
     otherwise, shall not be in effect; or

     of such ERISA Plan's vested benefits exceeds the then-current value of

     $10,000,000 (or in the case of an ERISA Termination Event involving the
     withdrawal of a "substantial employer" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(2) of
     ERISA), the withdrawing employer's proportionate share of such excess shall
     exceed such amount);

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with the

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which
exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement
or applicable law.  The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of
each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.02.  AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.  Neither the Agent nor any of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:  (i) may treat
the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives and accepts
an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of
such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts;
(iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations
(whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement;
(iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or
observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the
part of the Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and
records) of the Borrower; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by
acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing
(which may be by telecopier, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

          SECTION 7.03.  CITIBANK AND AFFILIATES.  With respect to its
Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, Citibank shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its
individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind
of business with, the Borrower, any of its subsidiaries and any Person who may
do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such subsidiary, all
as

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

          SECTION 7.04.  LENDER CREDIT DECISION.  Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender
and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01(e) and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

          SECTION 7.05.  INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the
respective principal amounts of the Contract Notes then held by each of them (or
if no Contract Notes are at the time outstanding or if any Contract Notes are
held by Persons which are not Lenders, ratably according to the respective
amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this
Agreement, PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that such expenses are
reimbursable by the Borrower but for which the Agent is not reimbursed by the
Borrower.

          SECTION 7.06.  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed
at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders.  Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf

<PAGE>

                                                                              46

of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
described in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of "Eligible Assignee" and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement.
After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Event of Default, and no event that with
the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event
of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing, then no successor Agent shall
be appointed under this Section 7.06 without the prior written consent of the
Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


          SECTION 8.01.  AMENDMENTS, ETC.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Contract Notes, nor consent to any departure
by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders (other than any Lender
that is the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower), do any of the following:
(a) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.03,
(b) increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any
additional obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the
Contract Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Contract Notes
or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (e) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Contract Notes,
or the number of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them
to take any action hereunder or (f) amend this Section 8.01; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any
Note.

                                                                              47

          SECTION 8.02.  NOTICES, ETC.  All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier, telegraphic,
telex or cable communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed,
cabled or delivered, if to the Borrower, at its address at 3000 Commerce Tower,
911 Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105, Attention: Vice President,
Finance; if to any Bank, at its Domestic Lending Office specified opposite its
name on Schedule I hereto; if to any other Lender, at its Domestic Lending
Office specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a
Lender; and if to the Agent, at its address at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New
York 10043, Attention: Utilities Department, North American Finance Group; or,
as to each party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in
a written notice to the other parties.  All such notices and communications
shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed or cabled, be effective
when deposited in the mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph company,
confirmed by telex answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively,
except that notices and communications to the Agent pursuant to Article II or
VII shall not be effective until received by the Agent.

          SECTION 8.03.  NO WAIVER; REMEDIES.  No failure on the part of any
Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

          SECTION 8.04.  COSTS AND EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.  (a) Except to the
extent limited by written agreement between the Borrower and the Agent on or
prior to the date hereof, the Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, syndication, administration, modification and amendment of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the
Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement.  The Borrower
further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses, if any (including,
without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of outside counsel and
of internal counsel), incurred by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with
the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a).

          (b)  If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Adjusted CD
Rate Advance or Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on

<PAGE>

                                                                              48

the last day of the Interest Period for such Contract Advance, as a result of a
payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09(f), 2.10 or 2.13 or acceleration
of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason,
or any payment of principal of any Auction Advance is made other than on the
maturity date thereto, the Borrower shall, upon demand by any Lender (with a
copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such
Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses,
costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or
Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or
maintain such Contract Advance or Auction Advance, as the case may be.

          (c)  The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each Lender, the
Agent and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees and professional advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") harmless
from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of
outside counsel and of internal counsel, whether or not such Indemnified Person
is named as a party to any proceeding or is otherwise subjected to judicial or
legal process arising from any such proceeding) that any of them may incur or
which may be claimed against any of them by any Person by reason of or in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
Notes or any transaction contemplated thereby, or the use by the Borrower or any
of its subsidiaries of the proceeds of any Advance.  The Borrower's obligations
under this Section 8.04(c) shall survive the repayment of all amounts owing to
the Lenders and the Agent under this Agreement and the Notes and the termination
of the Commitments.  If and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 8.04(c) are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower agrees
to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction thereof which
is permissible under applicable law.

          SECTION 8.05.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  Upon (i) the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or
the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender,
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured.  Each

                                                                              49

Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights of
each Lender under this Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lender may
have.

          SECTION 8.06.  BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the
Agent shall have been notified by each Bank that such Bank has executed it and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that
the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any
interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

          SECTION 8.07.  ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.  (a) Each Lender may
assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment, the Contract Advances owing to it and the Contract
Note or Notes held by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and
obligations under this Agreement (other than any Auction Advances or Auction
Notes), (ii) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned
pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$5,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any
Contract Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $2,500.  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time assign all or any portion of the Advances owing to it
to any Affiliate of such

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

Lender.  No such assignment, other than to an Eligible Assignee, shall release
the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

          (b)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01(e) and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi)
such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

          (c)  The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Contract Advances owing to, each
Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER").  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

<PAGE>

                                                                              51

          (d)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee,
together with any Contract Note or Contract Notes subject to such assignment,
the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and
(iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.  Within five Business Days
after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall
execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Contract Note
or Notes a new Contract Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount
equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance
and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Contract
Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment
retained by it hereunder.  Such new Contract Note or Notes shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such
surrendered Contract Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such
Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of
Exhibit A-1 hereto.

          (e)  Each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities any
Auction Note or Notes held by it.

          (f)  Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment,
the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder
of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, and (iv) the Borrower, the
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.

          (g)  Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrower; PROVIDED that, prior to any such disclosure,
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the
Borrower received by it from such Lender.

                                                                              52

          (h)  If any Lender shall make any demand for payment under Section
2.12(b), then within 30 days after any such demand (if, but only if, such
demanded payment has been made by the Borrower to such Lender), the Borrower
may, with the approval of the Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and provided that no Event of Default or event that would constitute
an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse
or both shall then have occurred and be continuing, demand that such Lender
assign in accordance with this Section 8.07 to one or more Eligible Assignees
designated by the Borrower all (but not less than all) of such Lender's
Commitment and the Advances owing to it within the period ending on the later to
occur of such 30th day and the last day of the longest of the then current
Interest Periods, if any, for such Advances.  If any such Eligible Assignee
designated by the Borrower shall fail to consummate such assignment on terms
acceptable to such Lender, or if the Borrower shall fail to designate any such
Eligible Assignees for all or part of such Lender's Commitment or Advances, then
such demand by the Borrower shall become ineffective; it being understood for
purposes of this subsection (h) that such assignment shall be conclusively
deemed to be on terms acceptable to such Lender, and such Lender shall be
compelled to consummate such assignment to an Eligible Assignee designated by
the Borrower, if such Eligible Assignee (i) shall agree to such assignment by
entering into an Assignment and Acceptance with such Lender and (ii) shall offer
compensation to such Lender in an amount equal to all amounts then owing by the
Borrower to such Lender hereunder and under the Note made by the Borrower to
such Lender, whether for principal, interest, fees, costs or expenses (other
than the demanded payment referred to above and payable by the Borrower as a
condition to the Borrower's right to demand such assignment), or otherwise.

          (i)  Anything in this Section 8.07 to the contrary notwithstanding,
any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Commitment and the
Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve
Bank.  No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its
obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 8.08.  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION  Each of the Borrower, the
Lenders and the Agent (i) irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any New York State court or Federal court sitting in New York City in any
action arising out of this Agreement or the Notes, (ii) agrees that all claims
in such action may be decided in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest
extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum and (iv)
consents to the service of process by mail.  A final judgment in any such action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions.  Nothing herein

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any manner
permitted by law or affect its right to bring any action in any other court.

     SECTION 8.09.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE
LENDERS EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
NOTE, OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER.

          SECTION 8.10.  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

          SECTION 8.11.  EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

the Lenders shall be deemed used from time to time to the extent of the
aggregate amount of the Auction Advances then outstanding and such deemed use of
the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be applied to the Lenders ratably
according to their respective Commitments (such deemed use of the aggregate
amount of the Commitments being an "AUCTION REDUCTION"). Each Contract Borrowing

specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Contract Borrowing, (ii) Type
of Contract Advances to be made in connection with such Contract Borrowing,
(iii) aggregate amount of such Contract Borrowing, and (iv) in the case of a

<PAGE>

                                                                              14

of such Contract Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02, in same
day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Contract Borrowing. After the
Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such funds available to the
Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

         (b)   Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Borrower may not select Adjusted CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate
Advances for any Contract Borrowing if the Advance to be made by any Lender as
part of such Contract Borrowing is less than $1,000,000.

         (c)   Each Notice of a Contract Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower. In the case of any Contract Borrowing that the related
Notice of a Contract Borrowing specifies is to comprise Adjusted CD Rate
Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any
failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of a Contract
Borrowing for such Contract Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Contract Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Contract Borrowing
when such Contract Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such
date.

         (d)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior
to the date of any Contract Borrowing that such Lender will not make available
to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Contract Borrowing, the Agent
may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the
date of such Contract Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that
such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent,
such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest
rate applicable at the time to Contract Advances made in connection with such
Contract Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.
If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount
so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Contract Advance as part of such
Contract Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

         (e)   The failure of any Lender to make the Contract Advance to be made
by it as part of any Contract Borrowing shall not relieve any other

more than eight Contract Borrowings may be outstanding at any time.

         BORROWING"), in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto,
         specifying the date and aggregate amount of the proposed Auction
         Borrowing, the maturity date for repayment of each Auction Advance to

         such Business Day a copy of the related Notice of an Auction Borrowing.

              (ii)   Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to
         do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more Auction Advances to the
         Borrower as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing at a rate or rates
         of interest specified by such Lender in its sole discretion, by
         notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the

               each Lender that is to make an Auction Advance as part of such
               Auction Borrowing of the amount of each Auction Advance to be
               made by such Lender as part of such Auction Borrowing, and (C)
               each Lender that is to make an Auction Advance as part of such
               Auction Borrowing, upon receipt, that the Agent has received
               forms of documents appearing to fulfill the applicable conditions
               set forth in Article III. Each Lender that is to make an Auction
               Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing shall, before 12:00
               noon (New York City time) on the date of such Auction Borrowing
               specified in the notice received from the Agent pursuant to
               clause (A) of the preceding sentence or any later time when such
               Lender shall have received notice from the Agent pursuant to
               clause (C) of the preceding sentence, make available for the
               account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its
               address referred to in Section 8.02 such Lender's portion of such
               Auction Borrowing, in same day funds. Upon fulfillment of the
               applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after receipt

               available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.
               Promptly after each Auction Borrowing the Agent will notify each
               Lender of the amount of the Auction Borrowing, the consequent
               Auction Reduction and the dates upon which such Auction Reduction
               commenced and will terminate.

         (b)   Each Auction Advance shall be in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and,
following the making of each Auction Borrowing, the Borrower shall be in
compliance with

the limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of subsection (a)
above.

         (c) Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section
2.03, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.03, repay
or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section

Days of the date of any other Auction Borrowing.

         (d) The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender that has made an Auction Advance, or each other holder of an Auction
Note, on the maturity date of each Auction Advance (such maturity date being
that specified by the Borrower for repayment of such Auction Advance in the
related Notice of an Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above and provided in the Auction Note evidencing such Auction Advance), the
then unpaid principal amount of such Auction Advance. The Borrower shall have no
right to prepay any principal amount of any Auction Advance unless, and then
only on the terms, specified by the Borrower for such Auction Advance in the
related Notice of an Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above and set forth in the Auction Note evidencing such Auction Advance.

         (e) The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Auction Advance from the date of such Auction Advance to the date the
principal amount of such Auction Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of
interest for such Auction Advance specified by the Lender making such Auction
Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection
(a)(ii) above, payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by the
Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related Notice of an Auction Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the Auction Note
evidencing such Auction Advance.

         (f) The indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each Auction
Advance made to the Borrower as part of an Auction Borrowing shall be evidenced
by a separate Auction Note of the Borrower payable to the order of the Lender
making such Auction Advance.

times during which, either the Moody's Rating shall be lower than A3 or the S&P
Rating shall be lower than A-, (ii) 0.075% PER ANNUM in the event that, and at
all times during which, either the Moody's Rating shall be lower than Baa2 or

senior unsecured indebtedness shall be unrated by both Moody's and S&P.

         (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each
Lender an auction facility fee on the average daily aggregate principal amount
of Auction Advances outstanding during the period from the date hereof in the
case of each Bank and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender
until the earlier to occur of the Termination Date and, in the case of the

the date of such request.

         SECTION 2.05. REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS. (a) AT BORROWER'S OPTION.
The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least two Business Days' notice to
the Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions
of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, PROVIDED that the aggregate amount
of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less
than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount
of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof.

         (b) MANDATORY. The respective Commitments of the Lenders shall
automatically reduce ratably upon each disposition of assets or capital stock in
excess of the 7.5% and 51% thresholds, respectively, described in Section
5.02(c) by an amount equal, in the aggregate, to the amount of consideration (as
defined in Section 5.02(c)) received by the Borrower in respect of such assets
or capital stock, as the case may be, but only to the extent that the
disposition of

<PAGE>

                                                                              20

such assets or capital stock, as the case may be, exceeds such thresholds;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no reduction in the Commitments shall occur as a result
of any such disposition if on the date thereof, and after giving effect thereto,
the total assets of the Borrower are equal to or greater than the total assets
of the Borrower as of September 30, 1993, in each case as determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistent with those
applied in the preparation of the financial statements referred to in Section
4.01(e); and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that each such Commitment reduction
shall be made PRO RATA among the Commitments hereunder and the "Commitments"
under the Three-Year Credit Agreement.

         (c) AT LENDER'S OPTION. The Borrower shall give the Agent and each
Lender at least twenty Business Days' notice (a "PROPOSAL NOTICE") of its
intention to use the proceeds of any Borrowing hereunder directly or indirectly
in connection with (i) the acquisition of in excess of 5% of any class of equity
security that is registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, (ii) any
transaction subject to the requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act or
(iii) any transaction subject to the requirements of Section 14 of the Exchange
Act with respect to which proxies, consents or authorizations, as the case may
be, are being sought by any person (as defined in the Exchange Act) other than
the majority of the board of directors of the issuer of the securities in
respect of which such proxies, consents or authorizations are being sought. Any
Lender may, within fifteen Business Days after receipt of such Proposal Notice
from the Borrower, give notice (a "TERMINATION NOTICE") to the Agent and the
Borrower that such Lender has made a good faith determination that the use of
proceeds described in such Proposal Notice, if funded by such Lender, would
create a conflict of interest for such Lender (based upon the existence of
commitments by such Lender to other parties in interest to such transaction,
confidential information held by such Lender relating to such transaction or any
other party in interest to such transaction or other similar circumstances that
would reasonably prevent or prohibit a commercial financial institution from
extending credit to the Borrower under such circumstances) or would otherwise
violate a commercial lending policy of such Lender because of an existing
customer relationship of such Lender or any of its Affiliates with the issuer of
any such securities, and that, accordingly, such Lender elects to terminate its
Commitment if the proceeds of such Borrowing will be used in such a manner. If
no Termination Notice is received by the Borrower within fifteen Business Days
after receipt by the Lenders of a Proposal Notice, the Borrower may apply the
proceeds of the affected Borrowing in accordance with such Proposal Notice. If
the Borrower receives a Termination Notice from any Lender within such fifteen
Business Day period, the Borrower shall promptly thereafter notify the Agent and
each of the Lenders (an "INTENTION NOTICE") whether it will use the proceeds of
the affected Borrowing for the purposes specified in such Proposal Notice, and,
if the proceeds will be used for such purposes, the Commitment of each Lender
that delivered a Termination Notice shall terminate immediately upon receipt by
such Lender of such Intention Notice. Upon such termination, the

<PAGE>

                                                                              21

Borrower shall (i) immediately repay all of such Lender's outstanding Base Rate
Advances, together with accrued interest thereon, (ii) repay all of such
Lender's outstanding Adjusted CD Rate Advances and Eurodollar Rate Advances,
together with accrued interest thereon, at the end of the respective Interest
Periods applicable thereto and (iii) repay all of such Lender's outstanding
Auction Advances, together with accrued interest thereon, at the respective
maturity dates therefor. All accrued fees with respect to such Lender's
Commitment shall be payable on the date of receipt of the applicable Intention
Notice.

         SECTION 2.06. REPAYMENT OF CONTRACT ADVANCES. The Borrower shall repay
the principal amount of each Contract Advance made by each Lender in accordance
with the Contract Note to the order of such Lender.

         SECTION 2.07. INTEREST ON CONTRACT ADVANCES. The Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Contract Advance made by each
Lender from the date of such Contract Advance until such principal amount shall
be paid in full, at the following rates PER ANNUM:

         (a)     BASE RATE ADVANCES. If such Contract Advance is a Base Rate
         Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the sum of the Base
         Rate in effect from time to time PLUS the Applicable Margin for such
         Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable quarterly on the last
         day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and
         on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

         (b)      ADJUSTED CD RATE ADVANCES. If such Contract Advance is an
         Adjusted CD Rate Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times during
         each Interest Period for such Contract Advance to the sum of the
         Adjusted CD Rate for such Interest Period PLUS the Applicable Margin
         for such Adjusted CD Rate in effect from time to time, payable on the
         last day of each Interest Period for such Adjusted CD Rate Advance and
         on the date such Adjusted CD Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in
         full.

         (c)      EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES. Subject to Section 2.08, if such
         Contract Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate PER ANNUM equal
         at all times during each Interest Period for such Contract Advance to
         the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period PLUS the
         Applicable Margin for such Eurodollar Rate Advance in effect from time
         to time, payable on the last day of each Interest Period for such
         Eurodollar Rate Advance and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance
         shall be Converted or paid in full.

         SECTION 2.08. ADDITIONAL INTEREST ON CONTRACT ADVANCES. The Borrower
shall pay to each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required

<PAGE>

                                                                              22

under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such
Contract Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest
rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i)
the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period for such Contract Advance from (ii)
the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100%
minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such Interest
Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Contract
Advance. Such additional interest shall be determined by such Lender and
notified to the Borrower through the Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.09. INTEREST RATE DETERMINATION. (a) Each Reference Bank
agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining
each Adjusted CD Rate or Eurodollar Rate, as applicable. If any one or more of
the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for
the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine
such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining
Reference Banks.

         (b)   The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of
Section 2.07(a), (b) or (c), and the applicable rate, if any, furnished by each
Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.07(b) or (c).

         (c)    If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to
the Agent for determining the Adjusted CD Rate for any Adjusted CD Rate
Advances, or the Eurodollar Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

              (i)    the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower and the
         Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such Adjusted
         CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the case may be,

              (ii)    each such Advance will automatically, on the last day of
         the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
         Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue
         as a Base Rate Advance), and

              (iii)    the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
         Contract Advances into, Adjusted CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate
         Advances, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the Agent shall

<PAGE>

                                                                              23

         notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
         suspension no longer exist.

         (d) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority
Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for
such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of
making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon

              (i)    each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
         last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a
         Base Rate Advance, and

              (ii)   the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
         Contract Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended
         until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
         circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

         (e) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Adjusted CD Rate Advances or any Eurodollar Rate Advances in
accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period"
in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders
and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

         (f) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
Contract Advances made in connection with any Contract Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $10,000,000, such
Contract Advances shall, if they are Advances of a Type other than Base Rate
Advances, automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances, and on and after such
date the right of the Borrower to Convert such Contract Advances into Advances
of a Type other than Base Rate Advances shall terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if and so long as each such Contract Advance shall be of the same Type and have
the same Interest Period as Contract Advances made in connection with another
Contract Borrowing or other Contract Borrowings, and the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all such Contract Advances shall equal or exceed
$10,000,000, the Borrower shall have the right to continue all such Contract
Advances as, or to Convert all such Contract Advances into, Advances of such
Type having such Interest Period.

         SECTION 2.10. VOLUNTARY CONVERSION OF CONTRACT ADVANCES. The Borrower
may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00
A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.09 and 2.13,
Convert all Contract Advances of one Type made in connection with

<PAGE>

                                                                              24

the same Contract Borrowing into Advances of another Type; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that any Conversion of, or with respect to, any Adjusted CD Rate Advances or
Eurodollar Rate Advances into Advances of another Type shall be made on, and
only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Adjusted CD Rate Advances
or Eurodollar Rate Advances, unless the Borrower shall also reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(b) on the date of such
Conversion; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if, on the date of any proposed
Conversion, any Event of Default or event that would constitute an Event of
Default but for the requirement that notice be given or time elapse or both
shall have occurred and be continuing, all Contract Advances subject to such
proposed Conversion shall, on such date, automatically Convert into, or remain
as, as the case may be, Base Rate Advances. Each such notice of a Conversion
shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
Conversion, (ii) the Contract Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is into, or with respect to, Adjusted CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the duration of the Interest Period for each such Contract
Advance.

         SECTION 2.11. PREPAYMENTS. (a) OPTIONAL. The Borrower may, upon at
least two Business Days' notice to the Agent stating the proposed date and
aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the
Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances made as
part of the same Contract Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) in the case of any such
prepayment of an Adjusted CD Advance or Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower
shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.04(b) on the date of such prepayment.

         (b)    MANDATORY. Upon each disposition of assets or capital stock
described in Section 5.02(c), the Agent shall apply amounts received from the
Borrower pursuant to clause (B) of Section 5.02(c) to the prepayment of Advances
outstanding hereunder in the following order of priority:

            FIRST, to the prepayment in whole or ratably in part of the
principal amount of all outstanding Contract Advances together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, and

            SECOND, to the prepayment in whole or ratably in part of the
principal amount of outstanding Auction Advances together with accrued interest
to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid, in the order of
their maturities.

            SECTION 2.12.  INCREASED COSTS.  (a)  If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Adjusted CD Rate Advances,

<PAGE>

                                                                              25

included in the Adjusted CD Rate Reserve Percentage or, in the case of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in
or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Adjusted CD Rate Advances, Eurodollar Rate Advances or any other Advances, then
the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost.
A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower
and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

            (b)   If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment
to lend hereunder and other commitments of this type or the Advances, then, upon
demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower
shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to
time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the
extent that such Lender determines such increase in capital to be allocable to
the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder or the Advances made
by such Lender. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and
the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.13.  ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it
unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its
obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make,
or to Convert Contract Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (ii) the Borrower
shall forthwith prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Advances of all Lenders then
outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, unless the Borrower, within
five Business Days of notice from the Agent, Converts all Eurodollar Rate
Advances of all Lenders then outstanding into Advances of another Type in
accordance with Section 2.10.

                                                                              26

            SECTION 2.14.  PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS.  (a)  The Borrower shall
make each payment hereunder and under the Notes not later than 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 in same day funds. The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or commitment and auction facility fees ratably (other
than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.03, 2.08, 2.12, 2.15 or
8.04(b)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending
Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to
any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after
the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall
make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such
Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

            (b)   The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under any
Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to time against any or all of the
Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due.

            (c)   All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be
made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and all computations of interest based on the Adjusted CD Rate, the Eurodollar
Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of commitment fees, auction facility fees and
interest payable on Auction Advances shall be made by the Agent, and all
computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.08 shall be made by a Lender, on
the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest or commitment fees are payable. Each determination by the
Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.08, by a Lender) of an interest rate
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

            (d)   Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as
the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

            (e)   Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays
such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            (f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under any Note that is not paid when
due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall (to the
fullest extent permitted by law) bear interest from the date when due until paid
in full at a rate PER ANNUM equal at all times to the Base Rate plus 2%, payable
upon demand.

            SECTION 2.15.  TAXES.  (a)  Any and all payments by the Borrower
hereunder or under the Contract Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.14, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, EXCLUDING, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
under the laws of which such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is
organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender,
taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES").
If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Agent, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.15) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b)   In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER
TAXES").

            (c)   The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section
2.15) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

            (d)   Prior to the date of the initial Borrowing in the case of each
Bank, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter if requested by the Borrower or the Agent, each Lender organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide the
Agent and the Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service
of the United States certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States
withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender
hereunder and under the Notes. If for any reason during the term of this
Agreement, any Lender becomes unable to submit the forms referred to above or
the information or representations contained therein are no longer accurate in
any material respect, such Lender shall notify the Agent and the Borrower in
writing to that effect. Unless the Borrower and the Agent have received forms or
other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or under
any Note are not subject to United States withholding tax, the Borrower or the
Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate
in the case of payments to or for any Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States.

            (e)   Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.15 shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts which may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

            (f)   If the Borrower makes any additional payment to any Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.15 in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes, and such
Lender determines that it has received (i) a refund of such Taxes or Other Taxes
or (ii) a credit against or relief or remission for, or a reduction in the
amount of, any tax or other governmental charge solely as a result of any
deduction or credit for any Taxes or Other Taxes with respect to which it has
received payments under this Section 2.15, such Lender shall, to the extent that

<PAGE>

                                                                              29

it can do so without prejudice to the retention of such refund, credit, relief,
remission or reduction, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender shall
have determined to be attributable to the deduction or withholding of such Taxes
of Other Taxes. If such Lender later determines that it was not entitled to such
refund, credit, relief, remission or reduction to the full extent of any payment
made pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.15(f), the Borrower shall
upon demand of such Lender promptly repay the amount of such overpayment. Any
determination made by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15(f) shall in the
absence of bad faith or manifest error be conclusive, and nothing in this
Section 2.15(f) shall be construed as requiring any Lender to conduct its
business or to arrange or alter in any respect its tax or financial affairs so
that it is entitled to receive such a refund, credit or reduction or as allowing
any Person to inspect any records, including tax returns, of any Lender.

            (g)   Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder and under the Notes.

            SECTION 2.16.  SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  If any Lender shall obtain
any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Contract Advances made by it (other
than pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.08, 2.12, 2.15 or 8.04(b)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the Contract Advances obtained by all
the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Contract Advances made by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender
shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of
such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect
to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            SECTION 2.17.  EXTENSION OF TERMINATION DATE.  At least 90 but not
more than 120 days prior to the then-scheduled Termination Date, the Borrower
may (on no more than two such occasions) request the Lenders, by written notice
to the Agent, to consent to a 360-day extension of the Termination Date. Each
Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine whether to consent to

<PAGE>

                                                                              30

such request and may by a revocable notice (a "CONSENT NOTICE") to the Agent
given within 60 days after such Lender's receipt of such request (such 60-day
period being the "CONSENT PERIOD") notify the Agent of its determination.
Failure by any Lender to respond within the Consent Period shall be deemed to be
a denial of the Borrower's request by such Lender. Any Lender may revoke its
Consent Notice at any time on or prior to the day immediately preceding the
Termination Date then in effect (without giving effect to the extension
requested by the Borrower); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any Consent Notice not
revoked by means of a written notice of revocation delivered by such Lender to
the Agent on or prior to such day shall become irrevocable on the Termination
Date then in effect. If all of the Lenders shall have delivered Consent Notices
and such Consent Notices shall have become irrevocable in accordance with the
foregoing, then the Termination Date shall be so extended (and the Agent shall
so notify the Borrower and the Lenders), such extension to be effective as of
the Termination Date theretofore in effect upon the delivery by the Borrower to
the Agent and each Lender, on or prior to such date, of (i) a certificate of a
duly authorized officer of the Borrower, dated such date, as to the accuracy,
both before and after giving effect to such proposed extension, of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.01 and as to the absence,
both before and after giving effect to such proposed extension, of any Event of
Default or event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both
would constitute an Event of Default and (ii) an opinion of counsel to the
Borrower as to the extension of the Termination Date and such other matters as
any Lender, through the Agent, may reasonably request.

            SECTION 3.03.  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO EACH AUCTION BORROWING. The

                       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


            SECTION 4.01.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWER.
The Borrower represents and warrants as follows:

            (a)   Each of the Borrower and each of its subsidiaries is a
         corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
         the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified
         to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
         the nature of the business conducted or the property owned, operated or
         leased by it requires such qualification, except where failure to so
         qualify would not materially adversely affect its condition (financial
         or otherwise), operations, business, properties, or prospects.

            (b)   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
         this Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate
         powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
         and do not contravene (i) the Borrower's charter or by-laws, (ii) law
         or (iii) any contractual or legal restriction binding on or affecting
         the Borrower or its properties.

            (c)   No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice
         to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is
         required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the
         Borrower of this Agreement or the Notes.

            (d)   This Agreement is, and the Notes when delivered hereunder will
         be, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable

         balance sheet and statements of income for the nine-month period ended
         September 30, 1993, to year-end adjustments) the financial condition of
         the Borrower and its subsidiaries as at such dates and the results of
         the operations of the Borrower and its subsidiaries for the periods
         ended on such dates, all in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles consistently applied, and since December 31,
         1992, there has been no material adverse change in the condition
         (financial or otherwise), operations, business, properties or prospects
         of the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries as reflected in such
         financial statements.

            (f)   There is no pending or threatened action or proceeding
         affecting the Borrower or any of its Significant Subsidiaries before
         any  court, governmental agency or arbitrator that could reasonably be
         expected to materially adversely affect the condition (financial or
         otherwise), operations, business, properties or prospects of the
         Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or that purports to affect the
         legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement
         or any Note.

            (g)   No proceeds of any Advance have been or will be used directly
         or indirectly in connection with (i) the acquisition of in excess of 5%
         of any class of equity securities that is registered pursuant to
         Section 12 of the Exchange Act, (ii) any transaction subject to the
         requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act or (iii) any transaction

            (h)   The Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending
         credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within
         the meaning of Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of the
         Federal Reserve System), and, except as contemplated by Section
         2.05(c), no proceeds of any Advance will be used to purchase or carry
         any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of
         purchasing or carrying any margin stock. Not more than 25% of the value
         of the assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries is, on the date
         hereof, represented by margin stock.

            (i)   The Borrower (i) is not a "public utility holding company"

         expect to occur, with respect to any ERISA Plan that may

         materially and adversely affect the condition (financial or otherwise),
         operations, business, properties or prospects of the Borrower and its
         subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            (k)   No proceeds of any Advance have been or will be used directly
         or indirectly for any purpose that entails a violation of, or that is
         inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation G, T, U, or X of the
         Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

            SECTION 5.01.  AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.  So long as any Note or any

                                    THE AGENT


            SECTION 7.01.  AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION.  Each Lender hereby
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders
of Notes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Agent shall not be required to take any
action which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to
this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt
notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 7.02.  AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC.  Neither the Agent nor any of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this

Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (i) may treat
the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent receives and accepts
an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of
such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii)
makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible
to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written
or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any

the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Borrower
or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower;
(v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi)shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by

sent by the proper party or parties.

            SECTION 7.03.  CITIBANK AND AFFILIATES.  With respect to its
Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, Citibank shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Citibank in its
individual capacity. Citibank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind
of business with, the Borrower, any of its subsidiaries and any Person who may
do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such subsidiary, all
as if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to
the Lenders.

            SECTION 7.04.  LENDER CREDIT DECISION.  Each Lender acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01(e) and
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

            SECTION 7.05.  INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the
respective principal amounts of the Contract Notes then held by each of them (or
if no Contract Notes are at the time outstanding or if any Contract Notes are
held by Persons which are not Lenders, ratably according to the respective
amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this
Agreement, PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or
wilful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Agent
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that such expenses are

                                                                              44

reimbursable by the Borrower but for which the Agent is not reimbursed by the
Borrower.

            SECTION 7.06.  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed
at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a
successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank described
in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of "Eligible Assignee" and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no
Event of Default, and no event that with the giving of notice or the passage of
time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be
continuing, then no successor Agent shall be appointed under this Section 7.06
without the prior written consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.


                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                 MISCELLANEOUS


            SECTION 8.01.  AMENDMENTS, ETC.  No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Contract Notes, nor consent to any departure
by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders (other than any Lender
that is the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower), do any of the following:
(a) waive any of the conditions specified in Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.03, (b)
increase the Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional
obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Contract Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any date

<PAGE>

                                                                              45

fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Contract Notes or any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (e) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Contract Notes,
or the number of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them
to take any action hereunder or (f) amend this Section 8.01; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by the Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any
Note.

   SECTION 8.02.    NOTICES, ETC.    All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telecopier, telegraphic,
telex or cable communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed,
cabled or delivered, if to the Borrower, at its address at 3000 Commerce Tower,
911 Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105, Attention: Vice President,
Finance; if to any Bank, at its Domestic Lending Office specified opposite its
name on Schedule I hereto; if to any other Lender, at its Domestic Lending
Office specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a
Lender; and if to the Agent, at its address at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New
York 10043, Attention: Utilities Department, North American Finance Group; or,
as to each party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in
a written notice to the other parties. All such notices and communications
shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed, telexed or cabled, be effective
when deposited in the mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph company,
confirmed by telex answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively,
except that notices and communications to the Agent pursuant to Article II or
VII shall not be effective until received by the Agent.

            SECTION 8.03.  NO WAIVER; REMEDIES.  No failure on the part of any
Lender or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

            SECTION 8.04.  COSTS AND EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.  (a) Except to
the extent limited by written agreement between the Borrower and the Agent on or
prior to the date hereof, the Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, syndication, administration, modification and amendment of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising the
Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. The Borrower
further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses, if any (including,
without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of outside counsel and
of

<PAGE>

                                                                              46

internal counsel), incurred by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses in
connection with the enforcement of rights under this Section 8.04(a).

            (b)   If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Adjusted
CD Rate Advance or Eurodollar Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of
the Interest Period for such Contract Advance, as a result of a payment or
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09(f), 2.10 or 2.13 or acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or any
payment of principal of any Auction Advance is made other than on the maturity
date thereof, the Borrower shall, upon demand by any Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any
amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs or
expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or
Conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or
maintain such Contract Advance or Auction Advance, as the case may be.

            (c)   The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each Lender,
the Agent and their respective Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and professional advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON")
harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
expenses of outside counsel and of internal counsel, whether or not such
Indemnified Person is named as a party to any proceeding or is otherwise
subjected to judicial or legal process arising from any such proceeding) that
any of them may incur or which may be claimed against any of them by any Person
by reason of or in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement, the Notes or any transaction contemplated thereby, or the use by
the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of the proceeds of any Advance. The
Borrower's obligations under this Section 8.04(c) shall survive the repayment of
all amounts owing to the Lenders and the Agent under this Agreement and the
Notes and the termination of the Commitments. If and to the extent that the
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 8.04(c) are unenforceable for any
reason, the Borrower agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and
satisfaction thereof which is permissible under applicable law.

            SECTION 8.05.  RIGHT OF SET-OFF.  Upon (i) the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or
the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.01,
each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general

<PAGE>

                                                                              47

or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender,
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made by
such Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Lender may have.

            SECTION 8.06.  BINDING EFFECT.  This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and
when the Agent shall have been notified by each Bank that such Bank has executed
it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns,
except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder
or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

            SECTION 8.07.  ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.  (a) Each Lender may
assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment, the Contract Advances owing to it and the Contract
Note or Notes held by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and
obligations under this Agreement (other than any Auction Advances or Auction
Notes), (ii) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned
pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$5,000,000 and shall be an integral multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together with any
Contract Note or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $2,500. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under

<PAGE>

                                                                              48

this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time
assign all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Affiliate of such
Lender. No such assignment, other than to an Eligible Assignee, shall release
the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

            (b)   By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01(e) and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi)
such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

            (c)   The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Contract Advances owing to, each
Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                                                                              49

            (d)   Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, together with any Contract Note or Contract Notes subject to such
assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been
completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the
Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. Within five
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own
expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered
Contract Note or Notes a new Contract Note to the order of such Eligible
Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment
hereunder, a new Contract Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount
equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Contract Note or
Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of such surrendered Contract Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective
date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially
the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto.

            (e)   Each Lender may assign to one or more banks or other entities
any Auction Note or Notes held by it.

            (f)   Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it);
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall
remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, and (iv)
the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.

            (g)   Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrower; PROVIDED that, prior to any such disclosure,
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the
Borrower received by it from such Lender.

           (h)   If any Lender shall make any demand for payment under Section
2.12(b), then within 30 days after any such demand (if, but only if, such
demanded payment has been made by the Borrower to such Lender), the

<PAGE>

                                                                              50

Borrower may, with the approval of the Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) and provided that no Event of Default or event that would
constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given or
time elapse or both shall then have occurred and be continuing, demand that such
Lender assign in accordance with this Section 8.07 to one or more Eligible
Assignees designated by the Borrower all (but not less than all) of such
Lender's Commitment and the Advances owing to it within the period ending on the
later to occur of such 30th day and the last day of the longest of the then
current Interest Periods, if any, for such Advances. If any such Eligible
Assignee designated by the Borrower shall fail to consummate such assignment on
terms acceptable to such Lender, or if the Borrower shall fail to designate any
such Eligible Assignees for all or part of such Lender's Commitment or Advances,
then such demand by the Borrower shall become ineffective; it being understood
for purposes of this subsection (h) that such assignment shall be conclusively
deemed to be on terms acceptable to such Lender, and such Lender shall be
compelled to consummate such assignment to an Eligible Assignee designated by
the Borrower, if such Eligible Assignee (i) shall agree to such assignment by
entering into an Assignment and Acceptance with such Lender and (ii) shall offer
compensation to such Lender in an amount equal to all amounts then owing by the
Borrower to such Lender hereunder and under the Note made by the Borrower to
such Lender, whether for principal, interest, fees, costs or expenses (other
than the demanded payment referred to above and payable by the Borrower as a
condition to the Borrower's right to demand such assignment), or otherwise.

            (i)   Anything in this Section 8.07 to the contrary notwithstanding,
any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Commitment and the
Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank (and its transferees) as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve
Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations
hereunder.

            SECTION 8.08.  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  Each of the Borrower,
the Lenders and the Agent (i) irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court sitting in New York
City in any action arising out of this Agreement or the Notes, (ii) agrees that
all claims in such action may be decided in such court, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum
and (iv) consents to the service of process by mail. A final judgment in any
such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions.
Nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
manner permitted by law or affect its right to bring any action in any other
court.

                                                                              51

            SECTION 8.09.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND
THE LENDERS EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY NOTE, OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED HEREUNDER OR
THEREUNDER.

            SECTION 8.10.  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

            SECTION 8.11.  EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to

                               THRIVING ON CHANGE

For most of a decade, UtiliCorp has been at the forefront of change in the
utility industry. As a result, today the company is uniquely positioned to
succeed in a deregulated energy market. UtiliCorp has launched a variety of
service businesses since the early 1980s. It has been active in acquisitions and
mergers since 1984. The company has run major, non-regulated power and energy
businesses since 1986, and has operated internationally since 1987. The
experience and flexibility gained through these early starts will be invaluable
as the rate of change in the industry continues to accelerate.
     The illustrations in this annual report, painted by Brian Cronin, capture a
few of the ways that UtiliCorp adapts to the forces of change that are
constantly reshaping its business environment.

<PAGE>

                            DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:

A year ago I said in the annual report, "I expect UtiliCorp's financial
performance to show marked improvement in 1993." Your company's performance DID
improve.
     Earnings for the year were $1.95 per common share, up from $1.32 the year
before. We would have earned $2.05 per share if the Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 had not raised our tax rate. The higher taxes cost us $.10 per share.
     Most of our businesses performed very well. Revenues were up 21 percent.
Income from operations before non-recurring charges increased 19 percent.
     We had our first income from a Nebraska gas distribution system that we
acquired in early 1993. Electric and gas rate increases also helped earnings.
Rates were raised $16.7 million per year in 1992, and another $10.6 million per
year in 1993. Even with the increases, our utilities remain very competitive in
their markets.

DIVIDEND INCREASE. In recognition of the improved results, your board of
directors increased the common dividend rate by 5 percent in the 1993 fourth
quarter. The annualized dividend is now $1.68 per share, up from the $1.60 rate
set two years earlier. Since 1985 the annualized rate has doubled, ranking
UtiliCorp among the leaders of our industry in cash dividend growth.

REALIZING STRATEGIC VALUE. In October 1993, we achieved a higher market
valuation for our energy related businesses segment. This was done through an
initial public offering of common shares in Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation, a
unit of UtiliCorp's Aquila Energy subsidiary. Aquila Gas Pipeline owns and
operates gas gathering and intrastate pipelines and natural gas processing
plants. It is now a separate company owned 82 percent by Aquila Energy and 18
percent by the public.
     The book value of that 18 percent was $28 million, but its recognized
market value through the offering was nearly $76 million, a gain of $48 million.
At the end of 1993,



                                                                               1

                            EMBRACING NEW MARKETS
     MEANS MOVING WITH SPEED TO KEEP A COMPETIVITE EDGE WHILE BRINGING OUT
     WELL CONCEIVED, TIMELY AND THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

<PAGE>

the market-to-book-value ratio of Aquila Gas Pipeline was 2.67, compared to 1.57
for UtiliCorp. This confirms the benefit of listing the pipeline company's
shares separately so that its assets can be valued more fully in the
marketplace.
     The gain from the offering provided an opportunity to implement a new
strategic plan at Aquila Energy without adversely affecting 1993 earnings. As
part of this strategic redirection, we elected to take steps that resulted in a
$45 million after-tax charge for non-strategic gas marketing contracts and the
writedown of certain pipeline assets and other investments. The net effect of
the gain from the stock offering and the charge for restructuring added about $3
million to net income.

CHANGES AT AQUILA. By taking a series of strong steps, we have set a new course
for Aquila Energy. It is now a very different company, with a new management
team, revised strategy and restructured financial base. These changes were
prompted in part by the challenges we faced at Aquila in 1992. Apparent improper
payments at an Aquila subsidiary resulted in after-tax charges in 1992 totaling
$11.3 million. Our lawsuit seeking damages from two former officers of that unit
is expected to go to trial in federal court later in 1994.
     Aquila is now poised to move ahead profitably. The new strategy is designed
to reduce its business risk and potential volatility while preserving its
strengths. Aquila's net income of $10.7 million in 1993 was a major improvement
over its $10.2 million net loss in 1992. Aquila Gas Pipeline had record earnings
as a result of increasing sales volumes and relatively stable prices for natural
gas and gas liquids. The revised strategy and restructuring helped Aquila's gas
marketing business show a profit in the fourth quarter of 1993. It is positioned
for further improvement in 1994. The gas and oil resources business was not
profitable in 1993 because of production delays and high depletion rates.
Working on improving its performance in 1994, we are encouraged by opportunities
to invest profitably in reserves and by improving gas prices. Although Aquila
has greatly reduced the volatility of its earnings caused by gas and oil price
fluctuations, the movement of natural gas liquids prices will continue to affect
results.

INTERNATIONAL GROWTH. About 7 percent of UtiliCorp's 1993 net income came from
international activities. This includes the results of West Kootenay Power, a
Canadian subsidiary since 1987. We expect that our foreign interests will
increase over time as privatizing and consolidating of utilities continues in
many countries.



                                                                               3

     Our joint ventures to market natural gas in the United Kingdom contributed
their first, modest earnings in 1993. They are positioned to make a greater
contribution this year. The British government has asked that the U.K.
residential gas market be opened to competition. Upon approval by Parliament,
this step will add considerably to our future delivery volumes.
     In July 1993, UtiliCorp acquired a 33 percent interest in the WEL Energy
Group Ltd., a joint venture with New Zealand's Waikato Electricity Authority,
for $20.8 million. The company has paid an initial $2.7 million and will pay the
remainder over time as needed by WEL Energy for specific utility investments.

THE NEW ENVIRONMENT. Major deregulation of the U.S. natural gas industry was
completed in late 1993. Gas companies have been learning a new way of life
operating under Order 636 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Order 636
has shifted more of the risk and responsibility for the supply of natural gas
from pipeline companies to distribution utilities like the divisions of
UtiliCorp.
     In response, we have created a gas supply center in Omaha to serve all our
gas utilities in eight states. Bringing together our experts from several parts
of the country combines extensive knowledge of this market, strategic location
providing broad access to pipeline systems, and the clout of more than half a
billion dollars in annual gas purchasing. This helps us remain a competitive,
low cost energy supplier.
     The electric side of our industry is only part way down the road to
deregulation. Our experience dealing with changes in the gas business has
prepared us well for what is likely to come in the market for electricity. The
open access provision of the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 is gradually
turning the nation's transmission grid into a competitive common carrier system
that will operate much like interstate gas pipelines do. It also is becoming a
reality that electric and gas customers, large or small, will get to choose
their suppliers of energy. Their choices will be based on both cost and service.
     The electric generation business has also changed. Independent producers
have achieved a permanent niche in this market. Our UtilCo Group subsidiary
holds interests in 15 power projects and contributed $3.2 million to net income
in 1993.

THE VALUE OF SERVICE. Building on our relationships with customers is becoming
more and more important as we challenge competing sources of energy and
introduce a

<PAGE>

range of new services. Our goal is to become a total energy supply and services
provider offering the best possible solutions to each customer's energy needs.
     The employee-shareholders of your company are already demonstrating they
can do this successfully. They are proposing innovative ways to serve our
customers and helping to reduce our operating costs. They are also starting up
new UtiliCorp businesses like coal brokering and customized industrial and
commercial gas services. The resulting array of new enterprises are enhancing
our ability to provide energy solutions.
     Independent research shows that our utilities consistently rank among the
best in the country in customer satisfaction. Again, the commitment of our
employee-owners is making a difference. More than 90 percent of our employees
own UtiliCorp common stock and as a group they are the largest bloc among our
retail holders. The caring attitude fostered by ownership is evident as our
people take up new challenges and responsibilities with enthusiasm.

MANAGEMENT CHANGES. In 1993 we formed a managing council of senior officers to
guide the further evolution of UtiliCorp's strategy. Those joining me on the
council are managing executive vice president Bob Green and managing senior vice
presidents Joe Colosimo and Bob Howell.
     Other officer level changes shifted some responsibilities and added depth
to our corporate staff, particularly in the areas of marketing, strategic
planning and gas supply. Two vice presidents are new to the company. We welcome
their knowledge of the deregulation process gained through many years in the
telecommunications industry. Leo Morton, formerly a vice president of AT&T
Microelectronics, directs performance measurement and process improvement. Bill
Burgess, who was a vice president at Bell Atlantic, is developing a new
company-wide marketing strategy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. Bob Green was named to the board of directors in November
1993, increasing its membership to nine. Bob oversees all of the company's
utility operations. He maintains a keen focus on our goals of continually
improving customer service and being a low cost, competitive provider of energy
solutions.

THE ROAD AHEAD. I have never been more excited about UtiliCorp's future than I
am today. Faced with the challenge of a rapidly changing industry, we must
update our strategy more often, adapt to changing markets more quickly, and
impart our vision of



                                                                               5

the future with greater clarity. We expect to improve earnings further as we add
utility customers and gain new markets. One of the ways we are meeting the
challenge of increased competition is to reduce operating costs. We are
achieving annualized savings of about $20 million, primarily by lowering costs
for fuel used in generation and for purchased power capacity.
     We are capable of again doubling the size of your company as suitable
opportunities arise to merge or acquire. We will not expand just to be bigger.
To be worthwhile, our future growth must help us be of greater service to our
customers. It must also enable us to become more efficient, more competitive and
more profitable.
     The changes taking place in our industry are in many ways similar to those
                       experienced earlier in transportation, telecommunications
                       and financial services. The companies that thrive and
                       create value in those industries today combine size with
                       agility. They find ways to use emerging technologies to
 [PHOTO]               their advantage in both operations and marketing. They
                       know the art of entering and seizing new markets. They
                       are able to compete on cost. And they build strong
                       relationships with customers by providing a broad range
                       of valuable services that extends far beyond their basic
                       product lines.
     UtiliCorp has become that kind of company because to succeed, the new model
of utility must do all of those things.
     Over the past ten years, our shareholders have earned an average total
return of more than 20 percent a year. That is a record we want to maintain.
Your role in making UtiliCorp's past and future progress possible is greatly
appreciated.

                              QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


WITH THE INDUSTRY FACING INCREASED COMPETITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND SOME
INDUSTRY ANALYSTS HAVE VOICED PESSIMISM ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR UTILITIES. DO YOU
FEEL THAT VIEW IS WARRANTED?
We are very optimistic, not pessimistic, about the future. We believe that
deregulation will produce a lot more opportunities than risks, at least for
UtiliCorp.
   In the future, we will increasingly be selling services, particularly those
related to the acquisition, transportation and management of energy. If the
company remains solely a provider of gas and electricity as commodities, margins
will get smaller as competition increases. Being a comprehensive energy and
services provider holds the greatest promise for continued profitability and
growth.

HOW WILL COMPETITION AFFECT YOUR PLANS TO SEEK ELECTRIC AND GAS RATE INCREASES
IN THE FUTURE?
Competition will very definitely influence the tactics and strategy employed in
seeking future rate increases.
   In late 1993, our West Kootenay Power subsidiary in Canada filed a request
for rate increases in 1994 and 1995 totaling approximately $11 million. But
first, West Kootenay Power took several steps to cut its operating costs. These
included refinancing several million dollars in high coupon debt and preference
stock, and the sale-leaseback of a new headquarters.
   Last year, our Missouri Public Service division received approval for a new
rate tariff that allows higher rates during the summer when demand is highest
and higher-cost generating facilities must be used. Lower rates are applied
during the remainder of the year when lower-cost generation is used. This
approach helped us hold down the overall increase in rates.
   In the future, we also plan to ask regulators to approve higher authorized
returns on equity. We believe that higher returns are justified over the long
term because of the increased competitive risks faced by utilities today.

DO YOU FORESEE A RECURRENCE OF THE SUPPLY PROBLEMS THAT HURT THE NATURAL GAS
INDUSTRY IN THE 1970S?
While supply and demand for natural gas are coming into balance, we do not
believe there will be a recurrence of the gas shortages that hurt the industry
in the 1970s.
   Although the average prices of natural gas increased during the 1993-94
heating season, we had no difficulty in securing supplies for any of the
customers in our eight-state service area. Some of the required volume is
actually purchased on a day-to-day basis while some is purchased under contracts
of several months' duration.
   We believe the trend of higher prices this year reflects a closer balance of
supply and demand. For many years, the gas industry has dealt with a prolonged
period of oversupply, commonly known as the "gas bubble." This situation kept
natural gas prices very low. High demand brought on by periods of extremely cold
weather this winter in the Upper Midwest, Northeast and East and a general
increase in demand from new markets have contributed to the increased prices
brought on by a balance of supply with demand.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AND THEIR
POSSIBLE EFFECT ON PEOPLE?
Some of our customers have expressed concerns about the presence of electric and
magnetic fields (EMF) in their homes or workplaces. In those instances,
representatives from our electric utilities offer to measure the strengths of
magnetic fields in those areas that may be of concern. We also distribute
information to customers about the latest findings in ongoing EMF research.
   In an effort to help speed the progress of that research, UtiliCorp has made
a $900,000 commitment over three years to fund construction of an EMF human
exposure test facility at Kansas City-based Midwest Research Institute. That
organization is conducting EMF research in cooperation with the U.S. Department
of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New York

State Department of Health and the utility industry's Electric Power Research
Institute.

WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN TO HAVE ONLY MINORITY INTERESTS IN YOUR VENTURES IN THE
UNITED KINGDOM AND NEW ZEALAND?
The partnership arrangements are part of our strategy of taking measured steps
in entering foreign markets. This approach enables us to earn attractive market
returns without incurring inappropriate political or currency risks.
   The strategy is proving successful. Although we don't have majority ownership
in our New Zealand or U.K. ventures, we have established business relationships
with our partners that allow us to spread our risks across many investments and
reap appropriate returns.
   In the U.K., our partners are six regional electric utilities with
substantial service territories. Their name recognition has enabled the gas
marketing ventures to achieve rapid growth in the business of selling gas to
large volume users. Our partner relationships will continue to be important as
competition is opened in other sectors of the U.K. natural gas market.
   In New Zealand, we expect to have additional investment opportunities as a
result of our 33 percent ownership of WEL Energy Group Ltd.

HOW DOES UTILICORP INTEND TO CAPITALIZE ON TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE UTILITY
INDUSTRY?
UtiliCorp has made a modest investment in research and development of advanced
energy technologies that will give us access to leading edge knowledge and
products. We have invested $3.1 million in a venture capital fund that provides
start-up funding and management expertise for more than 40 companies that are
developing and marketing technologies and services with potential applications
in the utility industry.
   Utech Venture Capital Funds holds a portfolio of companies that specialize in
technologies like photovoltaics, fuel cells, superconductors and artificial
intelligence. Other companies supported by Utech specialize in services like
demand-side management and automation of utility operations such as maintenance
of overhead electric distribution and transmission lines.
   Our partnership with Utech gives us a close-up view of how some of these
technologies will transform our business and also provides us opportunities to
participate in the testing of some of these products and processes. We also have
the opportunity to take a direct ownership position in any company that we
believe would complement our core business.

WAS UTILICORP ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOW INTEREST RATES DURING THE PAST YEAR?
During 1993 we refinanced approximately $96.5 million in high coupon debt,
replacing it with lower interest debt. This resulted in an annualized savings in
interest expense of approximately $3.5 million. These refinancings will increase
primary earnings per common share by $.05 per share based on shares outstanding
at December 31, 1993.

WHY DID YOU RECENTLY CALL THE ENTIRE SERIES OF UTILICORP'S $1.775 CONVERTIBLE
PREFERENCE STOCK FOR REDEMPTION?
Redemption of this series of relatively high coupon preference stock in May 1994
will result in an annual savings of at least $5.1 million in preference dividend
payments. However, we expect that most of the holders of Preference Series
$1.775 will exercise their option to convert their shares to UtiliCorp common
stock. After considering the additional common shares that are expected to be
issued, primary earnings per common share would not be significantly affected.
   UtiliCorp presently has about 2.8 million shares of Series $1.775 Preference
Stock outstanding. On February 2, 1994, the UtiliCorp Board of Directors
approved a resolution authorizing the company to redeem all of those shares on
May 26, 1994 at a price of $21.60 per share plus accrued dividends. Those who
choose the conversion option will receive .9682 shares of common for each share
of $1.775 preference.

HOW SOON WILL IT BECOME NECESSARY FOR YOUR ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO BUILD ANY NEW
POWER PLANTS?
We expect that new peaking and intermediate-load generating plants will need to
be in service before the year 2000 at Missouri Public Service and WestPlains
Energy.
   At WestPlains, we are planning to build a new 125-megawatt power facility to
serve the division's Colorado customers. Under present conditions, a gas-fired,
combined-cycle plant is the lowest-cost option for new capacity in the
southeastern Colorado energy market.
   At Missouri Public Service, about 400 megawatts of new and repowered capacity
is likely to be needed by the end of the decade. That would meet growing demand
in the division's service area and offset the expiration of existing, long-term
power purchase agreements with other utilities. The Missouri Public Service
resource plan also includes various energy conservation or demand-side
management programs and other purchased power agreements.



                                                                              13

                                    OF CHANGE


SUCCESSFUL UTILITIES OF THE FUTURE WILL BE THOSE THAT ADAPT TO
THE DYNAMICS OF CHANGE AND SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN ANY COMPETITORS.
BUT WHAT ARE THE CUSTOMERS' REAL NEEDS? HOW DO WE GO ABOUT MEETING THEM BETTER
THAN ANYONE ELSE?
   AT UTILICORP, WE BELIEVE THAT GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS
REQUIRES PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MUST PROVIDE EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE
FOCUSED ON HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND ULTIMATE SUCCESS.
   HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW WE ARE DOING JUST THAT.

                        GAS SUPPLY - THE NEW BATTLE ZONE

It's 2 p.m. and Trent Cozad has a dilemma.

   Cozad, a gas buyer for UtiliCorp Gas Supply Services, is agonizing over
whether he should lock in a price of $2.05 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for a
quantity of gas destined for a large volume customer. Normally he would wait
until the next day before making this commitment.
   But worrisome pricing signals are occurring. It's late January and natural
gas prices for February on the futures market of the New York Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) have shot up to a high of $2.55 per MCF.
   "It would appear that today the NYMEX reflects market conditions in the East
and Northeast and ignores what's happening in the Midwest," observes Dan
Warnock, team leader for the Omaha-based gas supply group. "Adequate supplies
are available."
   Nevertheless, that $2.05 price is looking very attractive. The revised
weather forecast predicts colder weather in the service territory and the cash
market is likely to begin trending up. After consulting with colleagues in the
Gas Supply Services trading room and reviewing alternatives with the customer,
Cozad finally places an order.
   "Timing is everything," Warnock says. "It's hard on the nerves to be buying
gas at $2.05 when we were getting it at $1.90 or less a month ago. But from
numerous conversations with suppliers throughout the U.S. and Canada, it's clear
that the market is trending up."
   Such is the world of gas supply today. It's a world ruled by the law of
supply and demand.
   Dozens of natural gas producers vie with each other to sell their commodity.
Meanwhile, utilities, marketers, and even large industrial users are perfecting
strategies to buy their gas at the most economical costs possible.
   These competitive forces were effectively unleashed in November 1993 upon
implementation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 636. The
order was the last of several by the FERC that have deregulated the natural gas
industry.
   The widespread geography of UtiliCorp's service area is proving to be a
critical strategic advantage in this increasingly dynamic marketplace.
   In mid-January 1994, when bitterly cold temperatures settled in for an
extended stay across the Upper Midwest, UtiliCorp's Michigan Gas Utilities
division experienced a record surge in demand from its 132,000 customers. The
options were not favorable. The division could pay steep financial charges for
the additional gas needed during the period of peak demand. Or, it could curtail
service to some of its largest volume users.
   UtiliCorp's geographic diversity provided a third alternative.
   The Gas Supply Services team made arrangements to move supplies to Michigan
Gas from the storage account of UtiliCorp's Northern Minnesota Utilities
division. The gas was being stored on a pipeline system that had access to the
northern reaches of the interstate system serving Michigan Gas. Due to differing
weather conditions, the gas was not needed by Northern Minnesota Utilities.
   The maneuver allowed Michigan Gas to avoid potential financial charges
ranging up to $300,000 and to keep its customers on line.
   During an earlier cold snap in December 1993, a similar innovative maneuver
allowed Peoples Natural Gas to avoid customer service interruptions or financial
penal-

ties. Peoples had received notice from its main interstate pipeline transporter
that some large interruptible customers in Dubuque, Iowa would have to be
curtailed because the pipeline's capacity would be fully utilized by its firm
customers.
   The Gas Supply team stepped forward with a plan to swap gas that had been
bought and stored by Michigan Gas Utilities for gas on the interstate pipeline
system. The arrangement enabled the pipeline to deliver all the gas needed by
Peoples' Dubuque customers in exchange for storage gas delivered to a pipeline
receiving point beyond the constrained area.
   Success in a competitive environment will depend on actions such as these.
Managing energy costs for customers, as well as keeping the customers on line,
will be a springboard for building a base of new business.
   "There are tremendous opportunities to increase our market share," says Jon
Empson, UtiliCorp vice president responsible for gas supply. "It all hinges on
building a successful track record in the markets we serve."

                         PARTNERING, NOT JUST MARKETING

It was a problem most small business owners love to have. A boom in demand for
the multi-layer circuit boards produced by Colt Technology Corporation, based in
Lenexa, Kansas, was creating a critical need for more manufacturing space.
   Bob Lynn, owner of privately-held Colt Technology, early in 1992 began
searching for a site for another manufacturing plant. Not surprisingly, the
company was inundated with proposals.
   One of them came from Missouri Public Service. UtiliCorp's largest electric
utility submitted a proposal that included the sale to Colt of a company-owned
site in Lee's Summit, Missouri and a comprehensive package of design and
engineering services for construction of the new facility.
   "We essentially proposed to become a partner with them in all phases of their
project," says Randy Lennan, Director, Major Accounts for Missouri Public
Service.
   The partnership approach worked. Colt purchased the Missouri Public Service
site in Lee's Summit, a growing community of about 50,000 located on the eastern
edge of metropolitan Kansas City.
   The strength of the partnership was quickly tested. The company's small size
created difficulties in obtaining the financing necessary to begin construction
of the 140,000-square-foot manufacturing plant. Missouri Public Service and the
city of Lee's Summit stepped forward with a package of financial and tax
incentives that helped persuade lenders that the project was viable.
   Then, another hurdle loomed. The company needed a cost-effective, high
efficiency heating and cooling system to keep temperature and humidity inside
the manufacturing facility within a narrow band year-round. A controlled
environment was critical if the company hoped to maintain its reputation for
manufacturing high quality components for computers and telecommunications
equipment.
   Missouri Public Service stepped forward again with a design for a closed-loop
electric heat pump system. The design uses a high efficiency water loop heat
pump to move the heat produced by equipment in manufacturing areas to exterior
walls of the building while maintaining improved levels of comfort. Installation
and ongoing energy and maintenance costs of this computer-controlled,
all-electric system are lower than comparable natural gas systems.
   When assistance was needed in soliciting and evaluating bids from suppliers
of heating, cooling and lighting equipment for the new facility, Missouri Public
Service again stepped forward. Lennan evaluated bid specifications, sent out
requests for proposals, tabulated results and finally delivered his
recommendations.
   "In evaluating the customer's needs, we felt that the all-electric system
represented the best option for keeping their business as competitive as
possible with the best technology available," Lennan says. "We demonstrated that
the electric system we designed for them would be the most cost-effective and
efficient energy system option.
   "If we hadn't been able to do that, we would have recommended they go with a
gas system. We want them to be our customers for a long time to come."
   Over the next five years, the new Colt Technology facility is expected to
result in $1 million in electric sales. The company expects to employ about 200
people at the new facility when it is fully operational.
   "This was a huge step for them. They were tripling the size of their
business, which is not an easy jump for any company," Lennan says. "We knew that
if they were going to be successful, we had to be as committed to their success
as they were."

                               KEY EVENTS OF 1993

- - Consolidated net income in 1993 was $86.4 million, or $1.95 per common share,
a major improvement over 1992 results of $52.9 million net income or $1.32 per
share.

- - In November 1993, the board of directors increased the quarterly common
dividend rate by 5%, to $.42 per share. The annualized dividend rate is now
$1.68.

- - The Nebraska gas distribution system acquired in February 1993 contributed
revenues of $97.9 million for the year and made a significant contribution to
the company's improved financial results.

- - UtiliCorp realized a gain of $47.8 million in October from an initial public
offering of 18% of the common shares of Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation, a unit
of the company's Aquila Energy subsidiary.

- - Also in the fourth quarter, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
$69.8 million ($45 million after tax) related to a revised strategy for Aquila
Energy. The net effect of the gain from the stock offering and the charge for
restructuring added about $3 million to net income.

- - Earnings reflected the full-year effect of electric and gas rate increases
totaling $16.7 million per year implemented during 1992 as well as increases
totaling $10.6 million per year implemented in 1993.

- - Higher tax rates resulting from the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 reduced
earnings by $.10 per share.

- - In response to further deregulation of the natural gas industry brought about
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 636, UtiliCorp established a
gas supply center in Omaha to serve all the company's gas utility operations in
eight states.

- - In early 1993, UtiliCorp issued 5.3 million new common shares in a public
offering. The net proceeds of $144.7 million were used to reduce short-term debt
incurred for construction and acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.

EXCEPT WHERE NOTED, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REFERS TO THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY,
UTILICORP UNITED INC., INCLUDING ITS THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: ELECTRIC
OPERATIONS, GAS OPERATIONS AND ENERGY RELATED BUSINESSES. THE LATTER INCLUDES
THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS OF AQUILA ENERGY CORPORATION (AQUILA), A
WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND TRENDS ARE PRESENTED WHICH HAVE
HAD AN EFFECT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993. ALSO PRESENTED ARE FACTORS WHICH MAY AFFECT FUTURE
OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY. THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE
READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
ACCOMPANYING NOTES.

1993 FOCUS. The company in 1993 focused on its growth strategy and the
improvement of earnings. Successful electric and gas rate cases and more normal
winter and summer weather allowed the company to achieve the expected
improvements. Additionally, the company changed the strategic direction of its
Aquila subsidiary. This action included an initial public offering of common
shares of an Aquila subsidiary and the recording of a restructuring charge,
which together resulted in a one-time net gain of about $3 million, net of tax.

                               SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS

With the acquisition of WestPlains Energy in September 1991, electric revenues
and income from operations have increased 44% and 24%, respectively, over the
past three years. In 1993 electric revenues increased 8% compared to 1992 and
income from operations increased 9%.

                                    REVENUES

Electric revenues are based on rates authorized by various regulatory
jurisdictions which result in differing rate designs and margins. Electric
revenues have increased most significantly during the past three years as a
result of the acquisition of WestPlains Energy. This division contributed
revenues of $45.1 million in the fourth quarter of 1991, $176.3 million in 1992
and $180.5 in 1993.
   Total electric revenues increased each year due to the growth in the number
of customers and rate increases implemented during the three-year period.
Favorable weather affected revenues positively in 1991, while unseasonably cool
summer weather reduced electric revenues in 1992. Summer weather returned to
near normal in 1993.
   In June 1993 a rate increase of $4.9 million per year and a new rate design
became effective at Missouri Public Service. The rate increase primarily
reflects the investment in a conversion to low-sulfur coal to meet clean air
standards and the final costs of renovating the Sibley Generating Station. The
new rate design increased rates during the summer when demand is highest and
lowered rates in the winter.
   West Kootenay Power received annual rate increases of $2.9 million per year
effective in January 1991 and $5.6 million effective in June 1993. The latter
increase replaces interim rate changes of $3.2 million and $3.7 million which
had been in effect since January 1992 and January 1993, respectively. These
increases were needed primarily to recover higher costs associated with facility
improvements, costs of purchased power and inflation. West Kootenay Power
anticipates modest rate relief during the next five years, primarily to recover
costs related to purchased power and ongoing improvements and additions to
facilities.
   Under settlement agreements related to its acquisition, WestPlains Energy was
precluded from requesting an increase in Kansas retail rates for implementation
prior to October 1, 1993. Similarly, it will not request an increase in Colorado
retail or wholesale rates to be effective before October 1, 1994. Recovery of
fuel and purchased power

<PAGE>

cost will continue to be permitted through mechanisms in place prior to the
acquisition.

                                    EXPENSES

Since 1991, operating expenditures for fuel and purchased power have increased
primarily as a result of the WestPlains Energy acquisition and growth in the
number of customers unrelated to acquisitions. During this period, fuel prices
were relatively stable and purchased power was available at a reasonable cost.
In 1991 the increase in these costs was partially offset by purchasing spot
market coal and renegotiating coal supply and rail contracts, both at favorable
prices. These savings continued into 1992 and 1993. In 1993 significant
additional savings were achieved by renegotiating another major coal supply
contract.
   Other segment expenses have increased over the three-year period reflecting
primarily the WestPlains acquisition, inflation and greater depreciation expense
due to additional plant placed in service during the period.

                              CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

The company's largest capital project over the past several years has been
rebuilding the 491-megawatt (MW) Sibley Generating Station. Begun in 1986, the
$70 million project was completed in 1992, adding another 20 years to the
economic life of the facility. The renovation cost only about 7% of what it
would have cost to construct a new coal-fired plant of similar capacity. During
1993, the company completed its three-year, $45 million project converting the
Sibley plant to low-sulfur coal.
   The 1994 capital budget provides $90 million for electric operations.
Electric construction expenditures through 1998 are expected to average $109
million per year.

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Completion of the Sibley coal conversion project has enabled the company to
comply with all environmental standards established by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 without installing costly scrubbers. The company has secured
multiple contracts of varying lengths for low-sulfur western coal and related
transportation. Successful test burns of low-sulfur coal were conducted during
early 1993, and the conversion was completed later in the year. The change in
coal supply has not increased Sibley's fuel costs.

                                     OUTLOOK

The open access provision of the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 is gradually
increasing competition in the supply of electricity. While such change brings
uncertainty, it also brings opportunity. In order to take advantage of this a
utility must maintain high levels of customer service and be competitive in
terms of cost. The company's electric divisions have ranked high in customer
satisfaction surveys and its efforts to increase the efficiency of its electric
operations are ongoing.
   The company expects the current level of growth in the number of electric
customers and demand for power to continue over the next few years. Additional
generating capacity is likely to be needed toward the end of this decade.
Long-term capacity plans, including a combination of purchased power,
conservation and load management, and construction of additional capacity, are
frequently updated. These combined alternatives are expected to be adequate to
meet future capacity requirements. West Kootenay Power is currently considering
several hydroelectric developments to meet future load growth.

</TABLE>


                               SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Largely reflecting the acquisition of the Nebraska gas system of Arkla, Inc.
during the first quarter of 1993, gas revenues increased 38% and income from
operations increased 56% over the past three years. In 1993 gas revenues
increased 33% compared to 1992 and income from operations increased 58% during
the same period.


                                    REVENUES

Gas revenues are based on rates authorized by various regulatory jurisdictions,
which result in differing rate designs and margins. The Nebraska acquisition,
now operated as a part of Peoples Natural Gas, contributed revenues of $97.9
million in 1993. Rate increases at a number of the company's gas divisions
during the last three years and customer growth unrelated to acquisitions also
increased revenues. Customer usage and revenues are also affected by
year-to-year changes in weather. Both 1991 and 1992 had mild winters. Winter
weather throughout the company's service territory returned to near normal
during 1993. The loss of a large industrial customer and reduced irrigation
sales due to wet weather lowered revenues in both 1992 and 1993.
   Revenues are affected by variations in the cost of purchased gas and are
reduced by customers switching from tariff sales to transportation sales.
However, these factors have had no significant effect on income from operations.
   The amounts and effective dates of annual rate increases that have been
granted are as follows: Missouri Public Service, $1.9 million in September 1993;
Michigan Gas Utilities, $2.4 million in May 1991 and $1.1 million in December
1992; West Virginia Power, $1.4 million in November 1991; Kansas Public Service,
$1.1 million in January 1991 and $.6 million in June 1992; and Peoples Natural
Gas, in Nebraska, $1.0 million in October 1991; in Kansas, $2.9 million in
November 1992; in Iowa, $3.3 million in August 1992; in Minnesota, $5.1 million
in June 1992; and in Colorado, $.8 million in October 1992.
   The new rates were requested primarily to recover the cost of ongoing
pipeline replacement programs, extension of service to new areas and increases
in other operating costs. Additional rate requests are likely as these programs
and other facility improvements continue.


                                    EXPENSES

The segment's principal operating expense is gas purchased for resale.
Variations in this expense result from the same factors that affect gas
revenues, discussed previously. Other gas segment expenses have increased since



20


<PAGE>

1991, reflecting primarily the 1993 Nebraska acquisition and the increase in
depreciation expense due to additional gas plant placed in service over the
three-year period.


                              CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

In the past five years, the company has spent about $38 million to replace older
pipe. This program to improve system safety and reliability will continue
through the 1990s. The expenditures are expected to be recoverable through
rates.
   During the last three years, the company has spent approximately $24 million
to install piping and extend service to several towns in Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri and Kansas. The company will continue to extend service to new
locations as economic opportunities arise.
   The 1994 capital budget provides $50 million for gas operations, including
pipe replacement and system extensions. Construction expenditures through 1998
are expected to average $45 million per year.


                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The company is in the process of investigating and testing various manufactured
gas sites either currently or previously owned by the company. These are
discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


                                     OUTLOOK

A new era of increased competition for the purchase and sale of natural gas
began in late 1993 with implementation of Order 636 of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. This order has shifted a significant portion of the risk
and responsibility for the supply of gas from pipeline companies to distribution
utilities like the divisions of UtiliCorp.
   To respond to this increase in competition, the company has created a gas
supply center based in Omaha to consolidate its natural gas procurement. This
strategy provides broader access to pipeline systems and takes advantage of
economies of scale in the company's purchase of natural gas. While the full
impact of Order 636 cannot yet be gauged, the company believes that it is well
positioned to maintain access to a competitive supply of gas and would recover
in rates any additional costs charged by its pipeline suppliers in implementing
Order 636.
   UtiliCorp's gas utilities will continue programs to upgrade their systems and
increase the overall efficiencies of their operations. These programs benefit
customers and enable gas operations to grow in a competitive environment.
   In May 1993, the company signed an agreement to purchase Arkla's Kansas gas
distribution and transmission systems for approximately $25 million. This
transaction is expected to close in the first half of 1994. The systems serve
about 22,000 customers in Wichita and several surrounding communities. Their
annual gas distribution revenues are about $15 million. Plans call for this
system to be operated as part of the Peoples Natural Gas division.

</TABLE>


                               SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS

In 1993, Aquila reported net income of $10.7 million. Aquila's net income (loss)
was $(10.2) million in 1992 and $19.5 million in 1991. The 1992 amount includes
after-tax charges of $11.3 million related to apparent improper payments by
former employees of an Aquila subsidiary, Aquila Energy Resources.
   Earnings are based on an assigned debt/equity ratio of about 80/20 for
reserve assets and about 60/40 for pipeline assets. In 1993, this segment
contributed 21% of consolidated revenues. In October 1993, Aquila Gas Pipeline
Corporation (AGP), an Aquila subsidiary, completed an initial public offering of
5.4 million shares of common stock, representing approximately 18% of the stock
of AGP. This resulted in a $47.8 million gain.


                                    REVENUES

In September 1991, Aquila exercised its option to purchase the remaining 51%
partnership interest in Aquila Southwest Energy for approximately $39 million
and began to consolidate its operations for financial reporting purposes. Prior
to September 1991, Aquila used the equity method of accounting for its initial
49% ownership in Aquila Southwest. The operations of this subsidiary are now a
primary component of the operations of AGP. AGP owns gas processing plants and
over 2,300 miles of pipeline in Texas and Oklahoma.
   During 1993, AGP throughput was 120 BCF, compared with 104 BCF in 1992 and 87
BCF in 1991. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) of 491 million gallons were extracted in
1993, up from 368 and 230 million gallons


                                                                             23


<PAGE>


in 1992 and 1991, respectively. The volume increases in 1993 are due primarily
to third-party drilling and subsequent well connections to AGP's pipelines. NGL
prices remained relatively stable through the summer of 1993. In the fall of
1993, prices began to decline but this was more than offset by the increased
volumes of NGLs processed during 1993. A portion of AGP's revenues are subject
to price risk because of the absence of financial instruments for certain NGL
products.
   In 1992 gas marketing volumes increased compared to 1991. However, marketing
revenues were reduced due to lower margins on spot market transactions and
significant margin reductions on fixed price supply contracts when gas prices
rose sharply. Marketing margins again declined in 1993, primarily due to fixed
price supply contracts. As a result, Aquila has revised its business strategy as
discussed more fully under the Outlook section. Gas and oil production volumes
decreased during 1993 to 30 BCF, compared to 33 BCF in 1992. This decrease was
more than offset by an increase in the average sales price of gas during the
year.


                                    EXPENSES

Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased during the last three years
because of the expansion of the AGP pipeline systems and the higher depletion
rates of gas and oil reserves. Gas purchases and operations and maintenance
expenses have increased annually due to the growth in Aquila's businesses,
primarily the expansion of AGP.
   In December 1993, the company announced the completion of a revised business
strategy at Aquila. In connection with this revised business strategy a pretax
restructuring charge of $69.8 million was recorded. The charge reflects
estimated costs of $43.0 million attributable to the anticipated disposition of
certain non-strategic long-term sales and firm transportation contracts. The
fixed price sales contracts extend from 1994 to 2008 and obligate Aquila to sell
approximately 67 BCF of gas over that period. In order to minimize further
losses, the company entered into various hedging transactions, resulting in
embedded contract losses. The company is negotiating the sale of these
contracts. Also recorded was a $16.6 million impairment reserve for
non-strategic offshore pipeline assets, which were previously being depreciated
over a four year period. Another $6.5 million charge relates to the cost of
implementing other programs made necessary by the strategy revision.
Additionally, certain investments owned by the company on behalf of Aquila,
totaling $3.7 million, were deemed to be non-strategic and were included as part
of the total restructuring recognized by the company. These charges will result
in a future cash outlay of approximately $45 million during 1994 and 1995 which
will be funded from operations and other working capital sources.
   The $17.7 million loss provision shown as an unusual item in 1992 relates to
apparent improper payments by former employees of Aquila Energy Resources
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquila. Recovery is being vigorously
pursued through litigation and insurance. See Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

                          ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

Since 1989 Aquila has invested $420 million in acquiring and expanding its
pipeline and gathering systems. This amount includes the acquisition of Aquila
Southwest in 1991. Since 1987 Aquila has invested a total of $368 million in
acquiring and developing gas and oil reserves.


                                     OUTLOOK

Aquila's new strategy began taking shape in early 1993 with the arrival of
Aquila's new president and other new members of his management team. Aquila is
now focusing on three distinct business activities-gas marketing, gas and oil
development and production, and gas gathering and processing. The gathering and
processing activities are managed by San Antonio-based AGP.
   The company will now rely more heavily on long-term sales contracts and less
on the spot market for profits in its gas marketing activities. More emphasis
will be given to serving customers in the Upper Midwest and Eastern Seaboard
regions. Aquila can readily serve those areas with supplies from producing
basins in Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast. Natural gas sales and purchase
commitments are frequently based upon fixed prices. Aquila's results can be
affected by natural gas market price volatility if fixed price commitments are
not fully balanced. To mitigate the natural gas pricing risk on fixed price
commitments, Aquila uses various hedging techniques to balance its portfolio.
Management believes the company has sufficient proved reserves and access to
markets to meet contractual volumes.
   Aquila's gas and oil production is dedicated to supporting the marketing
strategy. At year end, Aquila's gas reserves totaled 104 BCF. Emphasis will be
given to exploratory and development drilling of owned reserves. Acquisitions of
additional reserves will be pursued. AGP will work to increase the volume of gas
it gathers and processes at facilities connected to pipeline systems in Texas
and Oklahoma. AGP has achieved success in connecting a significant percentage of
new wells in the commercially active Giddings Field. It also will seek to
acquire strategically placed pipelines and processing facilities in proven gas
and oil basins.

</TABLE>




UtilCo Group contributed net income of $3.2 million in 1993. It reported net
income of $5.3 million in 1992 and $1.8 million in 1991. These results are based
on an assigned debt/equity ratio of 75/25. The improvement in 1992 reflected an
increased number of projects and the higher operating performance normally
achieved after each plant's two-year start-up phase. The reduction in net income
for 1993 was due primarily to the effect of the increase in the corporate tax
rate included in the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.
   Since 1986 UtilCo Group has acquired ownership interests in 15 independent
power projects, all of which are in commercial operation. Investments in
additional projects are expected to be made over the next five years.


                                                                             25

<PAGE>




   Consistent with UtiliCorp's strategy of spreading risks, UtilCo Group has
invested in generating projects located in six states. Each project uses
traditional fuels and proven technologies, and is a competitive, low-cost
producer of wholesale power. The projects sell their electric output under
long-term contracts with terms ranging from 15 to 40 years.
   UtilCo Group acquired interests in two additional projects in 1992. In March
1992, it became a 15% limited partner in a 168.8 MW gas-fired power plant near
Buffalo, New York that began commercial operations in December 1992. In
September 1992, UtilCo Group acquired a 50% ownership interest in a 120 MW
gas-fired cogeneration facility in Orlando, Florida. Commercial operations began
in September 1993.
   At the end of 1993, UtilCo Group's projects had a total capacity of 732 MW.
UtilCo Group's ownership interests range from 15% to 50%, and its share of
project assets at the end of 1993 totaled $363.1 million. No new investments
were made in 1993. UtilCo Group's share of project assets at year end was $346.5
million in 1992 and $280.3 million in 1991.
   UtiliCorp's balance sheet at December 31, 1993 includes $110.9 million in
non-regulated property, representing UtilCo Group's investments in partnerships
and leveraged leases.


                                  OTHER INCOME

Several of the company's utilities have undertaken various non-regulated
businesses in recent years. These are also reported as other income. Most of
these businesses have required minimal capital investment. The activities
include consumer appliance protection programs, gas and coal brokering, propane
distribution, meter reading and billing services, and water and wastewater
management for municipalities and other utilities in or near the company's
service areas.


                                     FINANCE

UtiliCorp United was formed from Missouri Public Service Company in 1985 to
pursue a focused strategy to broaden the company's business base within the
energy industry. The benefits of implementing this strategy have included the
spreading of inherent business risks, reduced cost of capital, improved
operating efficiencies and economies of scale.


                                    DIVIDENDS

Since formation of the company in May 1985, the cash dividend rate on common
stock has doubled to an annualized rate of $1.68. Based upon the improved
earnings results experienced in 1993, in November 1993 the company's board of
directors increased the common dividend by 5% to the current $1.68 level. Future
dividend action will continue to reflect the board of directors' assessment of
financial results, including the outlook for future earnings.


                                  ASSET GROWTH

Utility acquisitions, non-regulated investments and ongoing facility
improvements are the primary components to the company's growth strategy. During
1993, the company completed a utility acquisition totaling $99 million,
including $21 million in working capital. Additionally, $140.5 million in
construction expenditures was invested to improve existing facilities and expand
utility service territories.
   Aquila's investments during 1993 in gas and oil producing, gathering and
transmission properties totaled $94.5 million.
   The company plans to continue making acquisitions and investments that
further its strategy.


                         LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the past three years, UtiliCorp's most significant capital requirements
have been a direct result of its growth strategy. Acquisitions and investments
have been initially financed with short-term debt, and permanently funded with
various long-term securities when financial markets were favorable. The company
intends to maintain its strong balance sheet by using both debt and equity to
finance future growth.
   During the three years ended December 31, 1993, $545 million in net long-term
capital was secured: $329 million through various issues of stock and $216
million through long-term debt. Common shareholders' equity at the end of 1993
increased to about 44% of total permanent capitalization while the level of
short-term indebtedness has declined. Short-term indebtedness will fluctuate to
accommodate the interim financing of acquisitions and other investments.
   The company has commercial paper programs aggregating $200 million. To
support these programs, the company has two revolving credit agreements
(Agreements) with a consortium of banks aggregating $400 million.

The Agreements, which expire in December 1994 and December 1996, also allow the
issuance of notes which bear interest at rates based on the prime rate or
various money market rates. As of December 31, 1993, there were no outstanding
borrowings under these Agreements. The company also has accounts receivable sale
programs. The level of funding available from these programs varies depending on
the level of eligible accounts receivable, which fluctuates seasonally. Under
these programs up to $175 million is available to reduce short-term debt. At
December 31, 1993, $139.1 million was sold under these programs.


                                CASH REQUIREMENTS

Cash requirements include utility plant additions, dividends, and required
redemptions of long-term securities.
   Taken as a whole, cash provided from operating activities funded all of the
company's cash requirements during the three years ended December 31, 1993.
External financing was required during that period to fund acquisitions and
investments.
   Over the next five years cash provided from operating activities is expected
to meet anticipated cash requirements for that period, excluding acquisitions
and debt retirements scheduled for 1995.
   In February and April 1993, the company issued 4.8 million and .5 million
shares of common stock, respectively. The combined net proceeds of $144.7
million were used to reduce short-term debt incurred for construction and
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.
   In March 1993, the company issued $125 million of 8.0% Senior Notes due in
2023. Net proceeds of $123.3 million were used to reduce short-term debt
incurred for construction and acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.
   In April 1993, the company issued $70 million of 6.0% Senior Notes due in
1998. The company used the majority of the proceeds to fund a trust that assumed
$63.5 million of 9.875% General Mortgage Bonds. In October 1993, the General
Mortgage Bonds were redeemed by the trust.
   In mid-1993, the company purchased and retired approximately $33.0 million of
First Mortgage Bonds. These bonds were purchased at a premium and replaced with
short-term debt.
   During 1993, West Kootenay Power issued 8.8% secured debentures having a face
value of approximately $18.8 million. The proceeds were used to reduce
short-term debt and redeem preference stock, and for other general purposes.

                          ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

On September 30, 1991, the company purchased the electric utility properties of
Centel Corporation and renamed them WestPlains Energy. The company paid $209.2
million in cash, assumed liabilities of $26.0 million and executed a long-term
operating lease with a third party for an 8% undivided ownership interest in the
Jeffrey Energy Center.
   On February 1, 1993, the company completed its $99 million acquisition of a
Nebraska gas distribution system from Arkla, Inc. The Nebraska system serves
about 124,000 gas customers in 63 eastern Nebraska communities, including the
city of Lincoln. Gas revenues in 1993 for the Nebraska system, operated as a
part of the Peoples Natural Gas division, were approximately $97.9 million.
   On May 7, 1993, the company signed an agreement to purchase Arkla's Kansas
gas distribution and transmission systems for $25 million. The Kansas systems
serve about 22,000 customers in Wichita and several surrounding communities. Gas
distribution revenues for the Kansas system during 1993 were approximately $15
million. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 1994. The
system will be operated as a part of Peoples Natural Gas.
   On February 14, 1994, the company signed a definitive agreement to purchase a
218-mile, Missouri intrastate natural gas pipeline system from Edisto Resources
Corporation. The $75 million sales price includes the gas distribution system at
Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and a pipeline that crosses the Mississippi River
north of St. Louis. The transaction requires regulatory approval and is expected
to close later in 1994.
   The company believes it is well positioned to take advantage of the
opportunities presented by domestic deregulation of the gas and electric
businesses. Additionally, the company has found ways to enter international
markets where privatization of utilities is starting to take place.
   UtiliCorp U.K., Inc. owns a 75% interest in United Gas, the company's natural
gas marketing venture in the United Kingdom (U.K.). United Gas became a
contributor to earnings in 1993 due to continued efforts to develop new markets
in areas of the U.K. where it supplies gas. UtiliCorp U.K., Inc. and six
regional electric distribution utilities in the U.K. have entered into joint
venture agreements to supply gas to large volume customers in the electric
utilities' service areas via facilities owned by British Gas. The results of
operations of the U.K. ventures are reported as other income.
   In July 1993, the company finalized a joint venture arrangement with the
Waikato Electricity Authority in New Zealand. Under the arrangement, UtiliCorp
agreed to purchase a 33% interest in Waikato-based WEL Energy Group Ltd. (WEL)
for approximately $21 million to be paid over time. The company paid $2.7
million at closing and will make additional investments in the future based on
the capital requirements of WEL.


                                  INCOME TAXES

The level of income tax expense during the three-year period fluctuated
generally with the level of pretax accounting income. The effective tax rate for
1993 is substantially less than the statutory rate due to the $47.8 million gain
from the sale of subsidiary stock, which is not taxable according to U.S. tax
law.
   In August 1993, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was enacted. An
adjustment was made in the third quarter to retroactively reflect the increase
in the corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%, effective January 1, 1993. The rise
in the tax rate increased 1993 income tax expense approximately $4.0 million, or
$.10 per average common share. This included $2.7 million related to a non-cash
adjustment to increase deferred income tax liabilities of non-regulated
operations as of January 1, 1993. Deferred income tax liabilities of regulated
operations were also increased. However, because these additional taxes are
expected to be recovered through rates, a regulatory asset was established and
included in Deferred Charges and Other Assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.


                                REGULATED RETURNS

The company strives to earn optimal returns in all regulatory jurisdictions.
Recent years have been especially challenging because of the statutory lag
required to achieve rate relief and a general trend by regulatory commissions
toward reduced rates of return as a result of lower interest rates.
   Rate relief was obtained in several jurisdictions during 1992. In 1993, the
most significant activity was


                                                                             29

at Missouri Public Service (electric and gas) and West Kootenay Power
(electric). The company intends to be the low cost provider of energy in its
service territories. However, as new capital is invested in facilities, some
further rate filings may become necessary over the next five years to provide an
opportunity to earn fair returns.


                              EFFECTS OF INFLATION

In the next few years, the company anticipates that the level of inflation, if
moderate, will not have a significant effect on operations or acquisition
activity.

                            NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discuss the new
accounting standards relating to income taxes and post-retirement benefits other
than pensions.
   In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 112 (SFAS No. 112), "Employers' Accounting
for Post-Employment Benefits." The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 112 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


                                     NOTE 1:

                   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The consolidated financial statements of UtiliCorp United Inc. (the company)
include all operating divisions and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
energy related businesses segment reflects the operations of Aquila Energy
Corporation (Aquila). The results of operations of UtilCo Group Inc. (UtilCo
Group), UtiliCorp U.K., Inc. and the non-regulated activities of utility
divisions are included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statement of
Income.

MINORITY INTERESTS. Minority interests represent the minority stockholders'
proportionate share of the stockholders' equity and net income of Aquila Gas
Pipeline Corporation (AGP), a subsidiary of Aquila, and United Gas Company
Limited (United Gas), an indirect subsidiary of the company. Following the
initial public offering of a portion of AGP stock, Aquila held an approximately
82% interest in AGP at December 31, 1993 (see Note 4). The company owns a 75%
interest in United Gas, a gas marketing company in the United Kingdom.

REGULATION. The company's utility operations are subject to regulation by
various regulatory authorities. While there are rate proceedings pending, there
are no material amounts of revenues being collected subject to refund.

UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION. Utility plant is stated at original cost. Costs
of repair and maintenance of utility plant are charged to income as incurred.
When property is replaced, removed, or abandoned, its cost, together with the
costs of removal less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.
   For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated lives of depreciable property by applying composite
average annual rates, ranging from 3.0% to 4.6%, as approved by regulatory
authorities.

GAS AND OIL PROPERTIES. Gas and oil properties are accounted for using the full
cost method. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with gas and oil
property acquisition, exploration and development, including non-productive
costs, are capitalized. No gains or losses are recognized on the sale or
disposition of gas and oil properties, except for significant transactions. The
provision for depreciation, depletion and amortization is determined using the
units of production method over the estimated lives of the producing properties
based on estimated quantities of proved reserves. Amortization per MCF
equivalent averaged $1.28, $1.18 and $1.10 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
The unamortized cost of gas and oil properties may not exceed the future value
of recoverable gas and oil reserves at current or contractual prices, discounted
at 10%.
   Gathering, processing and other energy related property is depreciated using
a composite average annual rate of 4%.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. Utility revenues are recognized when services are
delivered. Gas marketing revenues are recorded based on the margin differential
between the amount billed to the customer, the related transportation cost and
the price paid to the gas supplier on gas volumes purchased and delivered during
the period.
   Aquila uses various gas and oil hedging techniques to mitigate the effects of
changes in market prices. Settlements related to these transactions designated
as hedges are included in revenues in the period the products are produced and
sold to customers.

PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT AND ENERGY ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES. The majority of the
company's revenues are subject to adjustment clauses. Changes in the cost of
purchased gas, fuel used for generation and purchased power to be recovered are
charged to expense during the period in which the recovery of costs is included
in revenues.

INCOME TAXES. The company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by
applying tax regulations existing at the end of a reporting period to the
cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
   Investment tax credits have been deferred and are being amortized over the
lives of the related properties.
   No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of a
wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary ($42.2 million at December 31, 1993) because it
is management's intention to reinvest such earnings in Canadian operations.
Consolidated income before income taxes for

the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 included $10.7, $13.8 and
$14.2 million, respectively, from Canadian operations.

CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents are defined as temporary cash investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE. Primary earnings per common share are computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
   Fully diluted earnings per common share assume conversion of convertible
subordinated debentures and convertible preference stock for the periods they
were outstanding and dilutive.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. Financial statements of foreign operations have
been translated into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Resulting
translation adjustments increase or decrease common shareholders' equity.

                                  ACQUISITIONS



UTILITY. The excess of total acquisition costs over the aggregate regulated
value of net assets acquired to date is included in Utility Plant ($134.4
million, net of $21.1 million in accumulated amortization at December 31, 1993)
and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to
35 years. The results of operations of acquired entities have been included in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to
their acquisition.
   On February 1, 1993, the company paid $99 million to acquire a Nebraska gas
distribution system from Arkla, Inc., including $21 million in working capital.
The Nebraska system serves 124,000 customers and is now operated as a part of
the Peoples Natural Gas division.
   On May 7, 1993, the company signed an acquisition agreement to purchase
Arkla's Kansas gas distribution and transmission systems for approximately $25
million. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is anticipated
to be completed in the first half of 1994.
   On September 30, 1991, the company purchased the electric utility properties
of Centel Corporation and renamed them WestPlains Energy. The company paid
$209.2 million in cash, assumed liabilities of $26.0 million and executed a
long-term operating lease with a third party for an 8% undivided ownership
interest in the Jeffrey Energy Center (see Note 10).

ENERGY RELATED. In September 1991, the company purchased the remaining 51%
partnership interest in Aquila Southwest Energy (Aquila Southwest) for
approximately $39 million. This transaction increased the company's ownership to
100% and resulted in the consolidation of Aquila Southwest for financial
reporting purposes.

PRO FORMA RESULTS. Pro forma unaudited results of operations assuming the
acquisitions of WestPlains Energy and Aquila Southwest had occurred as of
January 1, 1991 are as follows:

                            AQUILA STRATEGY REVISION

In October 1993, AGP completed an initial public offering and sale of 5.4
million shares of common stock, representing approximately 18% of the stock of
AGP. Net proceeds of the $15 per share offering were approximately $74.6 million
and were used to reduce short-term debt incurred for working capital purposes.
This transaction resulted in a gain of $47.8 million, recorded as non-operating
income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Consistent with U.S. tax laws,
no income tax expense was recorded related to this transaction.
   The gain was partially offset by a restructuring charge of $69.8 million ($45
million after tax) related to the completion of a revised business strategy at
Aquila. The restructuring charge, after tax, includes an estimated $27 million
for disposition of certain unfavorably priced gas sales contracts, approximately
$14 million to provide an impairment reserve for certain offshore assets and
investments determined to be inconsistent with Aquila's revised strategy, and
$4 million for other programs made necessary by the strategy revision.


                                     NOTE 5:

                                 SHORT-TERM DEBT

At December 31, 1993, $70 million of short-term debt was outstanding, comprised
of notes issued under bank lines. Such borrowings had a weighted average
interest rate of 3.51%.
   The company has commercial paper programs aggregating $200 million. To
support these programs and to provide for additional short-term borrowing
capacity, the company has two revolving credit agreements (Agreements) with a
consortium of banks aggregating $400 million. The Agreements, which expire in
December 1994 and December 1996, also allow the issuance of notes which bear
interest at rates based on the prime rate or various money market rates. The
Agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and the company pays an
average annual commitment fee of .225% on the unused portion of the Agreements.
As of December 31, 1993, there were no outstanding borrowings under these
Agreements.


                                     NOTE 6:

                                 LONG-TERM DEBT

The amount of long-term debt maturing in each of the next five years, including
sinking fund provisions, is as follows (in millions): 1994-$1.8; 1995-$139.2;
1996-$14.5; 1997-$22.4; and 1998-$84.6.
   In March 1993, the company issued $125 million of 8.0% Senior Notes due in
2023. Net proceeds from this offering were $123.3 million and were used to
reduce short-term debt incurred for construction and acquisitions, and for
general corporate purposes. In April 1993, the company issued $70 million of
6.0% Senior Notes due in 1998. The company used the majority of the proceeds to
fund a trust that assumed $63.5 million of 9.875% General Mortgage Bonds. In
October 1993, the General Mortgage Bonds were redeemed by the trust.
   In 1993, the company purchased and retired approximately $33.0 million of
First Mortgage Bonds. These bonds were purchased at a premium and replaced
with short-term debt.

   During 1993, West Kootenay Power issued 8.8% secured debentures having a
face value of approximately $18.8 million. The proceeds from this offering were
used to reduce short-term debt, redeem preference stock and for other general
purposes.
   Substantially all of the domestic utility plant owned by the company is
subject to the lien of various mortgage indentures. The company cannot issue
additional mortgage bonds as long as any of its 9.0%, 8.2%, 8.0% or 6.0% senior
notes are outstanding.
   The company executed an Indenture in 1990 (Indenture), for the issuance of
senior notes. Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture will be unsecured
obligations of the company and will rank on a parity with all other unsecured
and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. The Indenture does not limit the
aggregate principal amount of senior notes which may be issued under it.
   At December 31, 1993, 6.625% convertible subordinated debentures totaling
$14.3 million remained outstanding. The debentures can be converted into
approximately 600,000 shares of common stock, based on a conversion price of
$23.68, subject to an annual maximum limitation. The debentures are subordinate
to the prior payment, when due, of the principal and premium, if any, and
interest on all the company's debt outstanding, except debt that by its terms is
not senior in right of payment to the debentures.

                                  CAPITAL STOCK

In 1992, the company's stockholders approved an amendment to the company's
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 50 million to 100 million shares. As of December 31, 1993, the
company was not restricted as to payment of cash dividends.
   The Board of Directors of the company (the Board) is authorized to approve
the issuance of up to 20 million shares of Class A common stock, $1.00 par
value. No shares of Class A common stock are issued or outstanding.
   In February 1993 and in April 1993, the company issued 4.8 million and .5
million shares of common stock, respectively. The combined net proceeds were
$144.7 million and were used to reduce short-term debt incurred for construction
and an acquisition and for general corporate purposes.
   At December 31, 1993, there were 4,428,990 shares reserved for issuance under
a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, a Non-Employee Director Plan,
and various employee benefit and other plans.

STOCK AWARDS AND STOCK OPTIONS. The company's Stock Incentive Plan provides for
the granting of common shares to employees of the company as restricted stock
awards and as stock options.
   Shares issued as restricted stock awards are held by the company until
certain restrictions lapse, generally on the third award anniversary. The market
value of the stock, when awarded, is amortized to compensation expense over the
three-year period.
   Stock options granted under the Plan allow the purchase of common shares at a
price not less than fair market value at the date of grant. Options are
generally exercisable commencing with the first anniversary of the grant and
expire after 10 years from the date of grant.
   The Board approved the establishment of an Employee Stock Option Plan in
1991. This Plan provides for the granting of up to 1 million stock options to
full-time employees other than those eligible to receive options under the Stock
Incentive Plan. Stock options granted under the Employee Stock Option Plan carry
the same provisions as those issued under the Stock Incentive Plan. During 1992,
options for 742,900 shares were granted to company employees. The exercise price
of these options is $27.3125. No options were issued under this Plan in 1993.
   Restricted stock awards and stock options become exercisable for the purchase
or transfer of 249,983 shares in 1994; 31,169 in 1995 and 16,610 in 1996.

     In the first quarter of 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS No. 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS
No. 109 requires that deferred tax liabilities be established for income tax
benefits associated with temporary differences including those previously passed
through to ratepayers. Since such deferred tax liabilities will be collected in
rates from customers, a regulatory asset was established. The company's net SFAS
No. 109 regulatory assets were approximately $66 million at December 31, 1993.
   In August 1993, passage of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act)
increased the statutory federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%. This tax rate
change increased income tax expense by approximately $4.0 million, of which $2.7
million represented a non-cash adjustment to increase deferred tax liabilities
as of January 1, 1993.
   The principal components of the company's deferred tax liability consist of
the following:

   The company has pension plans covering substantially all qualified union and
non-union employees. The benefit formulas vary and are based either on years of
service multiplied by a percentage of salary, or a flat benefit based upon years
of service.
   The company's policy is to fund, at a minimum, an amount sufficient to meet
all ERISA funding requirements. In certain of its jurisdictions, the company has
recorded pension expense equal to its funding contribution, consistent with the
rate treatment allowed for this cost.

OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS. The company provides post-retirement health care
and life insurance benefits to certain employees. A majority of such retirees
pay a portion of the cost of these benefits.
   Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," for its U.S.
operations, which requires accrual of post-retirement benefits during the years
employees provide services. The company has elected to amortize the estimated
unfunded accumulated obligation at January 1, 1993, approximately $43 million,
over 20 years. Additionally, during 1993 expense of approximately $.6 million
was recognized for the service cost of benefits accrued and $3.4 million for
interest accrued on the accumulated projected benefit obligation. Prior to 1993,
the company expensed these benefits as they were paid. In 1991 and 1992 these
costs were not significant.
   The following table summarizes the status of the company's post-retirement
plans for financial statement purposes and the related amount included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1993:

   For measurement purposes, an annual health care cost growth rate of 14.0% was
assumed for 1994, decreasing to 8.25% by 1997 and 6% thereafter. The rate of
change in health care cost has a significant effect on the projected benefit
obligation. Increasing the rate by 1% each year would have increased the present
value of the accumulated projected benefit obligation by $2.4 million and the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components by $.3 million in 1993.
The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was discounted at a weighted
average rate of 7.75%.
   Pursuant to regulatory orders or precedents, certain regulated divisions of
the company have deferred as a regulatory asset the incremental costs associated
with SFAS No. 106. At December 31, 1993, the amount deferred was not
significant.

                                    NOTE 10:

                          COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


COMMITMENTS. The company is engaged in utility construction programs that are
expected to require estimated capital expenditures of $770 million over the next
five years. Estimated utility expenditures for 1994 and 1995 total $139 and $150
million, respectively.
   In 1991, concurrent with the WestPlains acquisition, the company entered into
an operating lease of an 8% interest in the Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) for an
initial term of 27 years. JEC consists of three coal-fired, 680-megawatt (MW)
generating units which are operated by a third party. Lease and other operating
expenses related to this interest are included in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. The lease includes certain fixed price and fair market value purchase
and renewal options. The company's Missouri Public Service (MPS) division also
owns an 8% interest in JEC. The MPS interest is included in electric utility
plant and its portion of operating expenses are also included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
   Future minimum lease payments under long-term non-cancelable leases,
primarily related to the JEC interest, peaking turbines, coal cars, and office
space, are (in millions): 1994-$25.6; 1995-$24.9; 1996-$23.1; 1997-$19.9;
1998-$20.3; and thereafter-$242.1. Annual rent expense for the years 1993, 1992
and 1991 was (in millions): $25.7, $24.7, and $14.5 respectively.
   The company has contractual commitments to purchase power for its electric
operating divisions through 2017. For 1994 through 1998, these commitments are
scheduled to provide 718; 699; 707; 702; and 677 MW, respectively. Aggregate
minimum annual costs for these commitments are expected to approximate (in
millions): $51.2, $54.4, $56.2, $54.4 and $51.7 during the five years ending
1998. One of these contracts is scheduled to provide approximately 7% of the
company's system requirements through 1998.
   At December 31, 1993, Aquila had minimum fixed price sales obligations of
29.0, 15.2, 15.2, 15.2 and 15.2 BCF for deliveries in the year 1994 to 1998,
respectively, at prices that range from $1.73 to $3.41 per MCF.
   During 1993, the company finalized a joint venture agreement with the Waikato
Electricity Authority in New Zealand for the purchase of a one-third interest in
WEL Energy Group Ltd. (WEL). The company paid $2.7 million at closing and has
agreed to pay approximately $21 million over time, as needed for specific
investments, upon call of the WEL Board of Directors.
   The company has agreements with financial institutions to sell, on a
continuing basis, up to $175 million of eligible accounts receivable on a
limited recourse basis. At December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, the amounts of
receivables sold under these agreements were $139.1 million, $150.0 million and
$140.0 million, respectively. Fees associated with these sales were
approximately (in millions) $5.4 in 1993, $5.7 in 1992 and $6.9 in 1991.

ENVIRONMENTAL. The company is subject to various environmental laws, including
regulations governing air and water quality and the storage and disposal of
hazardous or toxic wastes.
   The company owns or previously operated 28 former manufactured gas plants
(MGPs) which may, or may not, require some form of environmental remediation.
The company has contacted appropriate federal and state agencies and is in the
process of determining what, if any, specific cleanup activities may be needed
at these sites.
   In 1993, the company spent approximately $100,000 investigating an MGP site,
and in 1994 plans to spend about $100,000 to remediate this site after which the
state regulatory agency is expected to order no further remediation. Through
1993, the company spent $1.1 million investigating another MGP site, and it
estimates it will spend an additional $2.3 million for its 30% share of
remediation costs. The company estimates that at least $5.4 million of costs
will be incurred over the next several years at its remaining MGP sites. These
amounts could change materially based upon further investigations and the
actions of environmental agencies. Based on prior experience, available facts
and existing law, the company has recorded an obligation for the minimum amount
of environmental costs currently expected to be incurred.
   The estimated environmental obligation and substantially all costs incurred
to date have been recorded as a regulatory asset. The company has received
favorable rate orders for recovery of its environmental cleanup costs in several
of its jurisdictions. In other jurisdictions, favorable regulatory precedent
exists for the recovery of these costs. The company is also pursuing recovery
from insurance carriers and other potentially responsible parties.



                                                                             45

<PAGE>


   It is management's opinion that the ultimate resolution of these
environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact upon the financial
position or results of operations of the company.

AQUILA-UNUSUAL LOSS PROVISION. In 1992, the company recognized a $17.7 million
pretax charge against earnings ($11.3 million after tax). This charge related to
apparent improper payments by former employees of Aquila Energy Resources, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquila, during the course of transactions to acquire
certain natural gas and oil properties.
   The company has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Houston seeking
recovery of damages and is also pursuing action to recover part of the loss
through insurance coverage. Several of the defendants have filed counterclaims.
The company believes that the counterclaims are without merit.
   Two class action suits seeking unspecified damages were filed against the
company by stockholders alleging violations of various securities laws following
the charge related to apparent improper payments at Aquila Energy Resources. One
of these cases was dismissed by the U.S. District Court in Houston, and the
dismissal was affirmed by the appellate court. The other suit is now pending in
the U.S. District Court in Kansas City. Management denies the allegations in the
suit and is vigorously defending the action. Management does not believe the
ultimate resolution of the suit will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company.

OTHER. The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which
arise in the ordinary course of business operations. In the opinion of
management, the amount of liability, if any, with respect to these actions would
not materially affect the consolidated financial position of the company or its
results of operations.


                                    NOTE 11:

                       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt are carried at cost which
approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term debt and redeemable
preference stock is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues or on the current rates offered for instruments of the same
remaining maturities.
   The estimated fair value of the company's financial instruments at December
31, 1993 and 1992 is shown below. Because a substantial portion of the company's
operations are regulated, the company believes that any gains or losses related
to the retirement of debt or redemption of preference stock would not have a
material effect on the company's financial position or results of operations.

RESERVE QUANTITY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED). The following reserve quantity
estimates (all located in the United States) as well as information regarding
future production and cash flows were based primarily on reserve studies
prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. for 1993 and 1992 and on
internal estimates made by the company for 1991. Such estimates are inherently
imprecise and may be subject to revision.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES THEREIN
(UNAUDITED). Future pretax net cash flows have been estimated by applying prices
and costs in effect at the end of the years indicated, except where contractual
arrangements exist, to the estimated future production of proved reserves.
Aquila has assigned approximately 64% of the company's future gas production
through 2008 to certain of its long-term fixed price contracts through a
contractual swap arrangement at prices ranging from $2.83 to $7.29 per MCF.
Future income tax expenses were computed by applying statutory tax rates
adjusted for permanent differences and tax credits to estimated net future
pretax cash flows.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT


The management of UtiliCorp United Inc. is responsible for the information that

consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition to selecting appropriate accounting

necessary for management to make estimates based on currently available
information and judgments of current conditions and circumstances.
  Through well-developed systems of internal control, management seeks to assure
the integrity and objectivity of the consolidated financial information
contained herein. These systems of internal control are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the assets of the company are safeguarded and that the
transactions are executed to management's authorizations, and are recorded in
accordance with the appropriate accounting principles.

process through its Audit Committee, which selects the independent accountants
and reviews, along with management, the company's financial reporting and

and Chief Executive Officer


                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



       TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UTILICORP UNITED INC.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of
capitalization of UtiliCorp United Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, common
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. The consolidated financial statements of UtiliCorp United Inc. and
subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 1991 were audited by other auditors
whose report dated February 7, 1992 (except with respect to the change in
accounting for gas and oil properties, as to which date is November 6, 1992),
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements and included an explanatory
paragraph that described the retroactive change in accounting for gas and oil
properties.
   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the 1993 and 1992 financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
UtiliCorp United Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
   As explained in Notes 8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993 the company changed its methods of accounting for
income taxes and post-retirement benefits other than pensions.

                              CORPORATE INFORMATION


                                 ANNUAL MEETING
The 1994 annual meeting of shareholders will be held at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday,
May 4 in Bartle Hall's Grand Hall, Kansas City Convention Center, 301 West 13th
Street, Kansas City, Missouri. Parking will be provided in the Civic Center
garage. A videotape will be available for shareholders unable to attend.
   The company will again beam its annual meeting live via satellite to cities
in several states with a large number of UtiliCorp shareholders-Colorado, Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and Michigan. Invitations will be mailed in April to
holders in those states.

                                 STOCK LISTINGS

The common and preference shares of UtiliCorp United Inc. are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange. The common shares are also listed on the Pacific and
Toronto stock exchanges. The company's trading symbol is UCU.
   At the end of 1993, UtiliCorp had approximately 85,000 common shareholders
with 42 million outstanding shares. There was also a total of about 3.9 million
shares held in two series of preference stock.
   The common shares of Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation began trading on the New
York Stock Exchange in October 1993. The trading symbol is AQP. As a result of
this initial public offering of 5.4 million shares, approximately 18 percent of
Aquila Gas Pipeline is held by the public. UtiliCorp's wholly-owned Aquila
Energy subsidiary holds the remaining 82 percent.


                              DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT

Under UtiliCorp's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, direct
shareholders can instruct the company to automatically buy more shares with
their dividend proceeds. Shares are purchased under the program at 5% less than
the market rate with no brokerage commissions.
   Plan participants may also make cash purchases of shares, up to $10,000 per
quarter, at market price without commission and with no minimum purchase
requirement.


                             DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICE

In December 1993 UtiliCorp introduced direct deposit of dividends for its direct
shareholders. If you choose this service, quarterly dividend payments are
electronically credited to your checking or savings account. The dividend
deposit occurs on the normal dividend payment date, providing immediate access
to the funds deposited. Direct deposit eliminates the need to deposit dividend
checks as well as the possibility of mail delays and lost or stolen dividend
checks. There is no charge for this service.


                              SHAREHOLDER INQUIRIES

Questions about your account, including dividend payments, the Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, direct deposit service or the transfer of
shares, are handled by utility specialists at the company's transfer agent,
