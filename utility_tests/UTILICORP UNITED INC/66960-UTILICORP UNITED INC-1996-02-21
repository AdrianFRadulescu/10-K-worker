PROPOSED MERGER WITH KANSAS CITY POWER &AND LIGHT COMPANY (KCPL)

    On January 19,  1996, the company,  KCPL and KC  United Corp. (KCU)  entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) which provides for a
strategic  business combination of the company  and KCPL in a "merger-of-equals"
transaction (the Transaction). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the company and
KCPL will merge with and into KCU (which may be renamed at the discretion of the
company and KCPL),  a corporation  formed for  the purpose  of the  Transaction.
Under  the terms  of the  Merger Agreement, each  share of  the company's common
stock will be

                                       3
<PAGE>
exchanged for 1.096 shares  of KCU common  stock and each  share of KCPL  common
stock  will be exchanged for one share of  KCU common stock. Based on the number
of shares of the company's common  stock and KCPL's common stock outstanding  on
the  date  of the  Merger  Agreement, the  company'  s common  shareholders will
receive about 45%  of the common  equity of KCU  and KCPL's common  shareholders
will receive about 55%.

    The  Transaction  is  designed to  qualify  as  a pooling  of  interests for
accounting and financial  reporting purposes. Under  this method of  accounting,
the  recorded assets and  liabilities of the  company and KCPL  would be carried
forward to  the  consolidated financial  statements  of KCU  at  their  recorded
amounts.  The income of KCU would include the combined income of the company and
KCPL as  though the  Transaction occurred  at the  beginning of  the  accounting
period. The Prior periods would be combined and presented as those of KCU.

    The Transaction will create a diversified energy company with total combined
sales  of over $3.5 billion and over $6.5 billion in total assets, serving about
2.5 million customers  in the  United States,  Canada, the  United Kingdom,  New
Zealand,  Australia, China and  Jamaica. The business  of the combined companies
will consist of electric utility operations, gas utility operations and  various
non-utility enterprises including independent power projects, and gas marketing,
gathering and processing operations.

    The  Transaction is subject to approval from each company's shareholders and
a number of regulatory authorities. The regulatory approvals process is expected
to take  about  12 to  18  months.  The Merger  Agreement  includes  termination
provisions  which may require  certain payments to the  party to the Transaction
under  certain  circumstances,  including  a  payment  of  $58  million  if  the
Transaction is terminated by a party and within two and one-half years following
such  termination,  the terminating  party agrees  to consummate  or consummates
certains business combination transactions.

ENERGYONE BRAND/STRATEGY

    In May 1995, the company officially launched the EnergyOne brand.  EnergyOne
is  a unifying  name for  the products  and services  provided to  the company's
customers. Prior  to  the  EnergyOne  brand launch,  the  company  marketed  its
products  and  services  using  the  local  utility  division  name  or separate
subsidiary name.  Now most  company products  and services  carry the  EnergyOne
brand.  EnergyOne is an integral  part of the company's  strategy to bring brand
awareness and value added services to the industry and thereby create a platform
for customer  growth outside  existing service  territories. A  sample of  these
value added services is shown below:

ENVIRONMENTAL

    The  company is subject  to various environmental  regulations including air
quality standards and emission limitations,  clean water criteria pertaining  to
certain  facilities  and  the  handling and  disposal  of  hazardous substances.
Compliance with existing regulations, and those which may be promulgated in  the
future,  can  result  in  considerable capital  expenditures  and  operation and
maintenance expense. A discussion  of the environmental  matters of the  company
follows.

MANUFACTURED GAS PLANTS:

    The  company owns or once operated  29 former manufactured gas plants (MGPs)
which may,  or may  not, require  some form  of environmental  remediation.  The
company  has  contacted appropriate  federal and  state agencies  and is  in the
process of determining what, if any,  specific cleanup activities may be  needed
at these sites.

    As  of December 31,  1995, the company has  spent approximately $7.0 million
for investigating and remediating its MGP sites. The company currently estimates
that it will spend a minimum of approximately $6.2 million over the next several
years on  the  company's  identified  MGP  sites.  These  amounts  could  change
materially  based  upon  further investigations,  the  actions  of environmental
agencies and the financial viability of other responsible parties. Additionally,
the ultimate liability  may be  significantly affected  if the  company is  held
responsible for parties not financially able to contribute to these costs. Based
on  prior experience, available facts and existing law, the company has recorded
a liability  of  $6.2  million  representing  its  estimate  of  the  amount  of
environmental costs currently expected to be incurred.

                                       5

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

    The  company utilizes certain  types of fixed-price  contracts in connection
with its natural gas, natural gas liquids, and power marketing businesses. These
contracts include contracts that commit the company to purchase or sell  natural
gas  and  other commodities  at fixed  prices in  the future  (i.e., fixed-price
forward purchase and sales contracts),  futures and options contracts traded  on
the  NYMEX and  swaps and  other types  of financial  instruments traded  in the
over-the counter financial markets.

    The availability and use  of these types of  contracts allow the company  to
manage  and hedge  its fixed-price  purchase and  sales commitments,  to provide
fixed-price commitments as a service to its customers and suppliers (i.e., price
risk intermediation services), to reduce its exposure relative to the volatility
of cash  market  prices,  to  take advantage  of  carefully  selected  arbitrage
opportunities  through open positions  and to protect  its investment in storage
inventories. In addition,  by utilizing exchange  for physical transactions,  or
EFP's,  allowed by the NYMEX,  which enable the company  to take delivery of, or
sell, a physical quantity of natural gas in exchange for a futures position, the
company is able to secure additional sources of physical natural gas supply,  or
create  additional markets for  existing supply, through the  use of natural gas
futures contracts. The  company's domestic  natural gas  trading activities  are
referred  to herein as price risk management activities and are reflected in the
accompanying financial statements using the mark-to-market method of accounting.
The company's  foreign  gas marketing,  domestic  non-trading gas,  natural  gas
liquids and power marketing businesses are accounted for on the accrual method.

    Although  the company generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical
and financial purchase and sales contracts in terms of contract volumes and  the
timing  of performance and delivery obligations,  net open positions often exist
or are established due  to the origination of  new transactions and the  company
assessment  of, and response  to, changing market  conditions. Additionally, the
company will at times create a net open position or allow a net open position to
continue when it believes,  based upon competitive  information gained from  its
energy marketing activities, that future price movements will be consistent with
its  net open position. To the extent that  the company has a net open position,
company is exposed  to the  risk that  fluctuating market  prices may  adversely
impact its financial position or results of operations.

    In addition to the risk associated with price movements, credit risk is also
inherent in the company's risk management activities. Credit risk relates to the
risk  of  loss  resulting  from  the nonperformance  of  a  counterparty  of its
contractual obligations. The  company maintains credit  policies with regard  to
its  counterparties  that the  company  believes significantly  minimize overall
credit  risk.  These   policies  include  the   thorough  review  of   potential
counterparties'  financial  condition,  collateral  requirements  under  certain
circumstances, monitoring of net  exposure to each counterparty  and the use  of
standardized  agreements which  allow for the  netting of  positive and negative
exposures associated with each counterparty.

COMPETITION

DOMESTIC UTILITY OPERATIONS:

    ELECTRIC

    The electric industry  has increasingly become  more competitive as  federal
and  state regulators and legislators continue taking steps toward deregulation.
The anticipation of reduced regulation  triggered some dramatic events in  1995.
Five   major  utility  mergers  were  announced,  including  three  that  affect
competitors close  to  or  next  to the  company's  service  territories.  Other
utilities have implemented cost reduction programs and organizational changes in
preparation  for greater competition. The company began looking at its strengths
and opportunities in respect to future increased competition two years ago  when
the company brought together approximately 100 employees from around the company
to  work on  a strategic  plan that  would be  the foundation  to reposition and

                                       6
<PAGE>
reshape the company.  In 1995  the company began  centralizing business  support
functions  that previously were performed  separately in the operating divisions
and building  its resources  and  capacity to  take advantage  of  opportunities
brought about as competition increases.

    The  company currently  accounts for the  economic effects  of regulation in
accordance with the  provisions of Statement  of Financial Accounting  Standards
(SFAS)  No. 71 "Accounting for the Effects  of Certain Types of Regulation," and
accordingly has recorded  certain costs  as regulatory assets  in the  financial
statements.  The company  expects that  its rates will  continue to  be based on
historical costs  for  the  foreseeable  future.  If  the  company  discontinued
applying  SFAS No. 71, it  would be required to  make adjustment to the carrying
value of certain assets.

    GAS

    The competitive forces affecting the company's electric operations are  also
affecting  the  company's gas  operations.  In addition,  as  competing electric
utilities reduce costs it becomes more difficult to obtain new customers through
fuel switching opportunities and in certain cases the increased competition  may
result in customer losses. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order
636  shifted  gas  supply  responsibilities  from  traditional  pipeline company
sources to distribution utilities and  allows customers to bypass the  company's
system  by directly  connecting to  a transportation  pipeline. The  company has
addressed increased competition and industry changes in several ways. First, the
company's natural  gas  is  priced competitively  in  the  company's  respective
service  territories relative to alternative energy sources. Second, the company
established in  1993  a  central  gas  procurement  function  designed  to  take
advantage  of opportunities created by FERC Order 636. Besides offering low cost
natural gas, the company offers its  customers a wide range of energy  solutions
to meet customer demands.

ENERGY RELATED:

    Energy related businesses consist of the two business units of Aquila Energy
Corporation (AEC). AEC has many competitors in the markets its serves, including
other marketing companies, gas pipelines, distribution companies and alternative
fuels.  AEC's ability  to compete successfully  and grow in  this environment is
contingent upon performance and pricing of the natural gas markets.

SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF BUSINESS

    The company's utility and independent  power project businesses are  weather
sensitive.  The company  has both  summer and  winter peaking  utility assets to
reduce dependence on a single peak season. The table below shows peak times  for
its consolidated utility businesses.

III.  ENERGY RELATED OPERATING STATISTICS

    A description of AEC's segments is presented below.

    A.  WHOLESALE ENERGY MARKETING

    AEC's wholesale energy marketing business is conducted through Aquila Energy
Marketing and Aquila Gas Pipeline Corporation (AGP), collectively referred to as
Energy  Marketing. Energy Marketing is a gas marketing company with a marketing,
supply and transportation network consisting  of relations with more than  1,000
gas  producers and 500 local distribution companies and end-users throughout the
United States and  in Mexico and  Canada. Through more  than 350  transportation
agreements,  it has over 17,500 gas receiving and delivery points available on a
network of 33 pipelines.  For the five  years in the  period ended December  31,
1995,  Energy Marketing had marketing volumes  of 1,427, 1,002, 1,381, 1,589 and
1,003 MMcf/d, respectively.

    In 1995, Energy Marketing began  selling electricity to wholesale and  other
end  users  similarly  to how  it  markets  natural gas.  AEC  expects  that the
electricity marketing  industry  will  expand  rapidly  as  electricity  futures
trading  is  developed  and  the  infrastructure  of  this  industry  segment is
established. In  1995  its  wholesale  power sales  totaled  more  than  135,000
megawatt hours, ranking it among the nation's 10 largest power marketers.

(1)  All capacity  and volume information  is approximate.  Capacity figures are
    management's estimates based  on existing facilities  without regard to  the
    present availability of natural gas.

(2) Volumes from joint venture have been included at the AGP ownership interest.

(3)  This  plant is  owned and  operated by  a  third party  from which  the AGP
    receives a portion of  the NGLs produced  from gas the  AGP delivers to  the
    plant.

    The availability of natural gas reserves to AGP depends on their development
in  the  area served  by  its pipelines  and on  AGP's  ability to  purchase gas
currently sold to  or transported  through other pipelines.  The development  of
additional gas reserves will be affected by many factors including the prices of
natural gas and crude oil, exploration and development costs and the presence of
natural gas reserves in the areas served by AGP's systems.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

    On June  17, 1992,  a  class action  suit was  filed  in the  United  States
District Court for the Western District of Missouri by a stockholder against the
Company  and certain  unnamed employees  of the  Company and/or  its subsidiary,
Aquila Energy Corporation. Plaintiff  subsequently dismissed its claims  against
all  defendants  except the  Company.  The case  caption  is WILLIAM  ALPERN VS.
UTILICORP UNITED INC.. In this case, plaintiff alleges that the Company violated
various securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange  Act
of  1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5  of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
both by  making  misrepresentations and  omitting  to state  material  facts  in
connection with public disclosures. Plaintiff also alleges a claim under Section
11  of the  Securities Act  of 1933, as  amended. Among  other relief, plaintiff
seeks unspecified compensatory  damages. The  District Court  has dismissed  the
case  by granting summary  judgment to UtiliCorp. The  plaintiffs have asked the
District Court to reconsider that decision and they have appealed that  decision
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

    Cash  dividends on the common stock of  the company and its predecessor have
been paid each year since 1939.

    Cash dividends  on  and  acquisition  of the  company's  capital  stock  are
restricted  by  provisions of  the  MGU Indenture  and  by the  Preference Stock
provisions of the Certificate  of Incorporation. Under  the most restrictive  of
these provisions, contained in the MGU Indenture, the company may not declare or
pay any dividend (other than a dividend payable in shares of its capital stock),
whether  in cash, stock or otherwise, or make any other distribution, on or with
respect to any class of its capital stock, or purchase or otherwise acquire  any
shares  of, any class of its capital  stock if, after giving effect thereto, the
sum of  (i)  the  aggregate amount  of  all  dividends declared  and  all  other
distributions  made  (other than  dividends  declared or  distributions  made in
shares of its  capital stock)  on shares  of its  capital stock,  of any  class,
subsequent  to December 31,  1984, plus (ii)  the excess, if  any, of the amount
applied to or set apart for the  purchase or other acquisition of any shares  of
its  capital stock,  of any  class, subsequent to  December 31,  1984, over such
amounts as shall have been received by  the company as the net cash proceeds  of
sales  of shares of its capital stock,  of any class, subsequent to December 31,
1984, would exceed the  sum of the  net income of the  company since January  1,
1985,  plus $50 million. In addition, the company may not declare such dividends
unless it  maintains a  tangible net  worth of  at least  $250 million  and  the
aggregate  principal amount of its outstanding  indebtedness does not exceed 70%
of its capitalization. None of the company's retained earnings was restricted as
to payment of cash dividends on its capital stock as of December 31, 1995.

    In addition, cash  dividends on,  and acquisition of,  the company's  common
stock  will be restricted by provisions of the Indenture of the company dated as
of June 1, 1995 relating to  its 8 7/8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable  Interest
Debentures,  Series  A, due  2025.  In the  event  the company  elects  to defer
interest on such Debentures then the company may not declare any dividend on  or
acquire any shares of its capital stock during such deferral period.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATION.

KEY EVENTS OF 1995

    - In  May 1995 the company launched a national marketing campaign to promote
      EnergyOne, the industry's first nationwide  brand for energy products  and
      services.

    - In  May 1995  UtiliCorp and  its UtilCo  Group subsidiary  purchased a $59
      million, 50% ownership interest in a partnership that owns and operates  a
      cogeneration facility in Alabama.

    - In  September  1995 the  company acquired  a  49.9% ownership  interest in
      United  Energy,   an  Australian   electric  distribution   utility,   for
      approximately $257.9 million. The company manages the utility which serves
      approximately 520,000 customers in metropolitan Melbourne.

    - In  September 1995 UtiliCorp  and Novell, Inc.  announced a partnership to
      jointly develop smart networking technologies to better manage energy  use
      by communicating over power lines.

    - In  September 1995 the company  sold substantially all of  its oil and gas
      production assets  for  approximately $205  million  cash, or  about  book
      value.

    - In the fourth quarter of 1995, the company recorded a $34.6 million pretax
      provision  for  asset impairments  and adopted  a new  accounting standard
      regarding long-lived assets.

                                       18
<PAGE>
    - In late 1995  the company changed  its accounting method  for natural  gas
      trading  activities  to the  mark-to-market  method, effective  January 1,
      1995. This change increased 1995 net  income by $18.3 million and  primary
      earnings per share by $.41.

    - In  January 1996 UtiliCorp and Kansas City  Power & Light Company signed a
      definitive agreement to merge into a new company. The merger will create a
      diversified energy company with sales of  more $3.5 billion and over  $6.5
      billion in total assets.

OVERVIEW

    Except  where  noted, the  following discussion  refers to  the consolidated
entity, UtiliCorp United Inc., including its three principal operating segments:
electric operations, gas operations and energy related businesses (Aquila Energy
Corporation [Aquila]). The company  has other operations  that effect sales  and
income  from operations which  are discussed in the  Other Businesses and Equity
Investments section. Significant events and trends are presented which have  had
an  effect on the operations  of the company during  the three-year period ended
December 31, 1995. Also presented are  factors that may affect future  operating
results,  financial position  and liquidity. This  discussion should  be read in
conjunction  with   the   company's  consolidated   financial   statements   and
accompanying notes.

1995 RESULTS

    UtiliCorp's  1995 earnings available for common shares were $77.7 million or
15% below earnings available in 1994.  The 1995 financial results were  affected
by certain adjustments recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 1995. First,
financial  results  were favorably  affected by  a  change in  accounting method
related to price risk management activities. This change increased net income by
$18.3 million and  income from  operations by $29.8  million. Second,  financial
results  were reduced  by a provision  for asset impairments  that decreased net
income by $19.6 million and income from operations by $34.6 million. And  third,
financial  results were  affected negatively  by an  $11 million  pretax reserve
established for financial guarantees provided by  the company and to certain  of
its  partners  in  United Kingdom  gas  marketing ventures.  The  reserve became
necessary due to a sharp decline  in British natural gas prices. Also  impacting
the  1995 financial  results was  higher interest  expense than  in 1994  due to
acquisition opportunities primarily financed through long- and short-term  debt.
The  company also  absorbed approximately  $11.5 million  (pretax) of  costs for
restructuring,  including   early  retirements,   severance,  recruitments   and
relocations.

</TABLE>

SALES

    Electric sales in 1995 increased $20.7 million or 4% compared to 1994 due to
more favorable weather,  continued growth in  the number of  customers, and  new
rates  at West  Kootenay Power effective  January 1, 1995.  Extremely hot summer
temperatures in 1995 benefited the  company's domestic electric operations.  The
electric  operations in Missouri, Colorado and  Kansas, which represent over 80%
of total electric sales,  peak during the summer  months. Sales increased  $10.1
million or 2% in 1994 compared to 1993 primarily due to additional customers.

COST OF SALES

    Fuel  and  purchased power  expenses, collectively  referred  to as  cost of
sales, increased $2.4 million or 1% in  1995 compared to 1994. The increase  was
primarily  due  to favorable  weather and  increased customers  discussed above,
offset by reduced  fuel costs.  Cost of  sales decreased  significantly in  1994
compared  to 1993  due to lower-priced  contracts for purchased  power, coal and
rail transportation.

EXPENSES

    Operating expenses increased $15.0 million or  15% in 1995 compared to  1994
due  to additional sales staff expenses and costs of repositioning and reshaping
the businesses.  In  1995,  the  company  began  centralizing  business  support
functions  such as human resources, accounting and information technology, among
others, which  previously  were located  in  the company's  individual  business
units.  This centralization process combined with building a sales force are the
main causes of  the increase.  The company  expects that  its repositioning  and
reshaping  activities will  continue in 1996.  The increase  in depreciation and
amortization expense  for  all  periods  shown  is  due  to  additional  capital
improvements made to utility assets.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    The  company has been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at five
PCB disposal facilities. The company's combined clean-up expenditures have  been
less  than $1  million to  date and it  anticipates that  future expenditures on
these sites will not  be significant. The company  is in compliance with  sulfur
dioxide  emission requirements  established by the  Clean Air  Act Amendments of
1990.  The  company's  environment  related  expenditures  generally  are  being
recovered or deferred pending expected recovery through rates.

COMPETITION

    The  electric industry has  increasingly become more  competitive as federal
and state regulators and legislators continue taking steps toward  deregulation.
The  anticipation of reduced regulation triggered  some dramatic events in 1995.
Five  major  utility  mergers  were  announced,  including  three  that   affect
competitors  close  to  or  next to  the  company's  service  territories. Other
utilities have implemented cost reduction programs and organizational changes in
preparation for greater competition.

    The company began looking at its  strengths and opportunities in respect  to
future  increased competition  two years ago  when the  company brought together
approximately 100 employees from around the company to work on a strategic  plan
that  would be the foundation to reposition and reshape the company. In 1995 the
company began  centralizing  business  support functions  that  previously  were
performed  separately in the operating divisions  and building its resources and
capacity to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  brought  about  as  competition
increases.

    The  company currently  accounts for the  economic effects  of regulation in
accordance with the  provisions of Statement  of Financial Accounting  Standards
No.  71  (SFAS  No.  71),  "Accounting  for  the  Effects  of  Certain  Types of
Regulation," and accordingly has recorded certain costs as regulatory assets  in
the financial statements. The company expects that its rates will continue to be
based   on  historical  costs  for  the   foreseeable  future.  If  the  company
discontinued applying SFAS No. 71, it  would be required to make adjustments  to
the carrying value of certain assets.

</TABLE>

SALES

    Sales  in 1995  declined by $2.0  million compared to  1994. Several factors
significantly affected sales  in 1995  compared to  1994. Lower  gas prices  and
customers  switching to transportation services decreased sales by approximately
$33.8 million. This was offset by  favorable weather, a full year of  operations
at  the Kansas gas property acquired in September 1994 and the Missouri pipeline
system acquired in January 1995, and additional customers throughout the service
territories. Sales in 1994 compared to 1993  were lower by $67.5 million or  10%
due  to  unfavorable  weather,  lower  gas  prices  and  customer  switching  to
transportation services. Customer switching does not effect net income.

COST OF SALES

    The cost of sales changes generally  with sales, since all of the  company's
gas operations contain gas cost adjustment mechanisms that pass through gas cost
changes periodically to customers.

EXPENSES

    Operating  expenses increased $15.9 million or 14% in 1995 compared to 1994.
This is primarily due to additional sales and repositioning and reshaping  costs
discussed  in the  electric expenses  section on page  20. In  addition the 1995
expenses reflect the full year activities of the Kansas gas system and  Missouri
pipeline  acquisitions.  Taxes  and  depreciation increased  in  1995  over 1994
primarily due  to the  addition  of acquired  assets and  capital  improvements.
Expenses in 1994 were about the same as in 1993.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    The  company owns or  once operated 29 former  manufactured gas plants which
may or  may  not require  some  form  of environmental  remediation.  These  are
discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION AND OUTLOOK

    The  competitive forces affecting the company's electric operations are also
affecting the  company's  gas operations.  In  addition, as  competing  electric
utilities reduce costs it becomes more difficult to obtain new customers through
fuel switching opportunities and in certain cases may result in customer losses.
The  Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC)  Order 636  shifted gas supply
responsibilities from  traditional  pipeline  company  sources  to  distribution
utilities  and  allows  customers to  bypass  the company's  system  by directly
connecting to a transportation pipeline.

    The company  has addressed  increased competition  and industry  changes  in
several  ways. First, its natural gas  is priced competitively in our respective
service territories relative to alternative energy sources. Second, the  company
established  in 1993  a central gas  procurement function  designed, among other
reasons, to take advantage of opportunities  created by FERC Order 636.  Besides
offering  low cost natural gas, the company offers its customers a wide range of
energy solutions to meet  customer demands and in  some ways raise the  standard
for its potential competitors.

SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS

    For the years ended  December 31, 1995, 1994  and 1993, Aquila reported  net
income  of  $24.0 million,  $9.3 million  and  $10.7 million,  respectively. Net
income in  1995 as  compared to  1994 and  1993 was  158% and  124% higher.  The
increase  in 1995 reflects significant increases in operating results, favorable
impact  of  a  change  in  accounting  principle  and  a  provision  for   asset
impairments. Significant items affecting the comparability of Aquila's financial
results are described below.

    CHANGE  IN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE.   Effective January  1, 1995,  the company
changed its method of accounting for its domestic natural gas trading activities
to the mark-to-market method.  Under this method, changes  in the fair value  of
Aquila's  physical  and financial  transactions are  reflected currently  in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.  Aquila's prior method  recognized gains  and
losses  when  the  underlying  physical  commodity  was  sold  or  produced. The
accounting change increased Aquila's  1995 sales and  income from operations  by
$29.8  million and net income by $18.3 million. The cumulative effect on periods
prior to 1995 was not material.

    PROVISION FOR ASSET  IMPAIRMENTS.  In  1995, AGP completed  a review of  the
carrying  value of its assets, including  the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for  Long-Lived  Assets  to be  Disposed  Of"  (SFAS 121),  and  recorded  a
non-cash, pretax charge of $13.2 million.

    SALE  OF ASSETS.   In  September 1995, Aquila  sold all  of its  oil and gas
production assets  and reserves  for  approximately $205  million. Oil  and  gas
production activities had a loss of $5.0 million in 1995.

    RESTRUCTURING  AND SETTLEMENTS.  In 1993,  Aquila implemented a new business
strategy and recorded a  $69.8 million restructuring  charge against income  for
the disposal of certain natural gas contracts, impairment of offshore assets and
other  restructuring costs. In 1995 and 1994 Aquila's income from operations was
favorably affected by $5.0 million and $5.4 million related to settling  certain
loss  contracts  more favorably  than originally  anticipated  in 1993  when the
contracts were included in the restructuring charge.

    In 1993, AGP completed  an initial public offering  and sale of 5.4  million
shares of its common stock, resulting in a tax-free gain of $47.8 million.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS

    Sales  and  cost  of  sales increased  $235.2  million  and  $205.2 million,
respectively, in  1995 compared  to 1994  due  to a  39% increase  in  marketing
volumes  and a  34% increase in  gas pipeline throughput.  Gas marketing volumes
increased due to the acquisition in  January 1995 of Tristar Gas Company,  which
had  volumes  of  approximately 42  million  cubic  feet per  day  in  1995. Gas
marketing volumes also increased due to further implementation of a new strategy
developed in 1994.  Sales from  net trading  activities added  $29.8 million  to
sales  and income from operations in 1995.  See Price Risk Management section on
page 32 for further discussion. Gas  marketing sales decreased in 1994  compared
to 1993 primarily due to a strategic change at Aquila that was the result of and
followed  the restructuring charge in 1993.  Gas throughput volumes increased in
1995 due to expanded drilling in AGP's gathering region. In 1995 AGP constructed
a new pipeline  to increase  volumes that can  be processed  from its  gathering
system.  Sales and cost of  sales are directly affected  by the price of natural
gas and natural gas liquids.

    Sales from oil and gas production activities decreased primarily due to  the
sale  of all production  assets, which also  lowered depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense in 1995. The sale resulted in no gain or loss for financial
reporting purposes.

OUTLOOK

    The company has  adopted a  plan to provide  both natural  gas and  electric
power commodity services to its wholesale customers from an integrated wholesale
marketing  staff.  This  will allow  the  company  to fully  meet  the  needs of
customers who  will have  an ever-increasing  portfolio of  energy options  from
which  to choose in the future. A number of recent mergers and consolidations of
entities in  the natural  gas marketing  industry have  increased the  focus  on
controlling marketing share

                                       25
<PAGE>
on  a  volumetric  basis. The  company  expects  the gas  marketing  industry to
consolidate into a few mega-marketing  companies. Electric power marketing  will
be  impacted  by the  regulatory environment  of the  industry. It  is currently
unclear as to when the various regulatory agencies will open access to all power
customers, including  retail  users.  These  regulatory  decisions  may  have  a
significant impact on the future economics of the power marketing sector.

    The  gas processing and gathering business will be influenced by natural gas
and oil  commodity  prices  and  the drilling  activity  surrounding  its  major
pipeline asset in Southeast Texas. Continued exploration success in this area by
oil and gas companies will bolster this unit's future. Many pipeline acquisition
opportunities also exist in this operational area.

(a) Includes both the company and UtilCo  Group's ownership interest in a  power
    project.

(b) Includes a $15.4 million non-cash charge against income for an impairment of
    a project investment.

    UtilCo  Group had a net loss of $.2 million in 1995 after recording a pretax
$15.4 million non-cash  charge relating to  an impairment of  a project.  UtilCo
Group  reported net  income of $6.4  million in  1994 and $3.2  million in 1993.
Equity in earnings from partnerships increased $2.7 million or 14%. The increase
was due primarily to earnings from a project acquired in May 1995, offset by  an
unplanned  curtailment of a project due to availability of excess hydro power in
the region. The increase in 1994 net income compared to 1993 is due to increased
sales at  two projects  that operated  near  capacity. Net  income in  1993  was
reduced due to the increase in the corporate tax rate.

    UtilCo  Group  has  equity  ownership  interests  in  17  independent  power
projects, 16 of which are in commercial operation. In May 1995, the company  and
UtilCo  Group purchased a 50%  ownership interest in an  81 MW chemical recovery
and cogeneration  facility at  the James  River Corporation's  Naheola pulp  and
paper  mill in Pennington,  Alabama. The plant, which  began operations in 1993,
suppplies the Naheola mill  with all its black  liquor solids processing,  steam
and compressed air needs, as well as approximately 60% of the mill's electricity
needs.  In October 1994, UtilCo Group agreed  to acquire an equity interest in a
60-megawatt electric generating project now being built in Kingston, Jamaica. It
is scheduled to begin  commercial operation in 1996.  The $138 million  facility
will  sell its  electric capacity and  output to Jamaica  Public Service Company
under a 20-year contract.  The company will  hold a 22  percent interest in  the
project and expects to contribute approximately $11.6 million in equity.

    In  October 1995, UtilCo  Group entered into a  joint venture agreement with
Air Products  and  Chemicals,  Inc.  to develop,  own,  and  operate  generation
projects. The projects will consist of gas-fired combustion turbine applications
throughout the Midwest.

                                       26
<PAGE>
    Consistent  with UtiliCorp's strategy  of spreading risks,  UtilCo Group has
invested in generating projects located in seven states and one foreign country.
Each  project  uses  traditional  fuels  and  proven  technologies,  and  is   a
competitive,  low-cost  producer of  wholesale  power. The  projects  sell their
electric output  under long-term  contracts with  terms ranging  from 15  to  40
years.

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY INVESTMENTS

    AUSTRALIA

    On  September 6, 1995, Power Partnership Limited (PPL), of which the company
owns  49.9%,  acquired  United  Energy  Limited  (UE),  an  Australian  electric
distribution  utility,  from  the  State  of  Victoria  for  approximately $1.15
billion. The company's ownership interest cost approximately $257.9 million  and
was   financed  primarily  with  Australian  denominated  bank  debt  through  a
consortium of banks. UtiliCorp Australia Holdings Limited (UAHL), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company, manages  UE on behalf of  PPL. In 1995 the  company's
Australian investments contributed $2.9 million to the company's net income.

    NEW ZEALAND

    On  November 30,  1995, UtiliCorp N.Z.  Inc. (UNZ),  a 79%-owned subsidiary,
completed a transaction that resulted in UNZ owning approximately 27.5% of Power
New Zealand Limited (PNZ). PNZ is an electric utility distribution company  that
provides  service to approximately 214,000 customers. Prior to this transaction,
UNZ owned approximately 7.5% of PNZ.

    In late February 1995,  UNZ paid $16.1 million  to WEL Energy Group  Limited
(WEL)  to satisfy its capital  commitment to WEL. UNZ  now participates in WEL's
earnings to the full  extent of its ownership.  Before paying the final  capital
commitment,  UNZ's participation in  WEL's earnings was limited  to 5%. UNZ held
39% of WEL at the end of  1995. WEL is an electric distribution utility  serving
approximately 65,000 customers.

    The  company's  New  Zealand  investments contributed  $.7  million  to 1995
consolidated net income. For 1994 and 1993 the results from New Zealand were not
material.

    UNITED KINGDOM

    Net income  (loss) from  the United  Kingdom businesses  for the  three-year
period  ended  December  31, 1995  were  $(2.5)  million, $2.4  million  and $.5
million, respectively. The company has  several business ventures in the  United
Kingdom  that market natural  gas to wholesale  and industrial customers. United
Gas Limited (UGL) is the company's primary  subsidiary. At the end of 1995,  UGL
had approximately 27,000 gas marketing customers.

    In  addition  to UGL,  the  company has  five  gas marketing  joint ventures
(collectively referred to as Regional  Gas Companies or RGCs)  in which it is  a
25%  equity partner. The decline  in 1995 results compared  to 1994 is primarily
due to the decline in spot market prices and its effects on margins at the  RGCs
and  certain commitments the company or  subsidiaries have with its partners. In
the fourth  quarter  1995,  the  company reserved  $11.0  million  (pretax)  for
probable  funding  requirements  the  company expects  to  make  to  support its
investments in RGCs and recognized $1.6 million as its share of RGC net  losses.
Results  in 1995 were favorably affected by a gain on the sale of one of its RGC
investments and  by  a  favorable  gas  settlement.  See  Note  14  for  further
discussion on financial commitments.

OTHER

    NOVELL PARTNERSHIP

    On  September 13,  1995, the company  and Novell, Inc.  (Novell) announced a
partnership to  jointly  develop certain  technologies  and products  to  better
manage  energy consumption in home and business environments. Under the terms of
this alliance the company and Novell will co-develop, co-own and jointly  market
applications  that allow customers to optimize their use of energy on a 24-hour,
real-time basis. In October an initial cash  payment was made by the company  to
Novell for related license

                                       27
<PAGE>
rights.  The  two companies  also  announced the  founding  of the  Smart Energy
Network Alliance, an open  industry consortium that  will provide leadership  in
defining  the standards for future energy programs, network management and other
smart energy network solutions.

                        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The company's cash  requirements arise primarily  from its growth  strategy,
electric  and  gas utility  construction  programs and  non-regulated investment
opportunities. UtiliCorp's ability to attract the necessary financial capital at
reasonable terms is  critical to  the company's overall  plan. Acquisitions  and
investments  have  been  initially  financed  with  short-term  debt  and  later
permanently funded  with various  long-term debt  securities or  common  equity,
depending on market conditions.

    OPERATING CASH FLOWS

    Cash flows from operating activities were $261.2 million, $229.3 million and
$289.3  million for the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, respectively.
Cash flow from  operating activities  increased $31.9 million  between 1995  and
1994.  This increase was  primarily due to  a net favorable  increase in working
capital and other changes  in assets and  liabilities. Working capital  accounts
were  significantly affected by  volume increases and  higher natural gas prices
compared to  the  prior  year. Taken  together,  accounts  receivable  including
accrued revenues less accounts payable reduced working capital by $73.5 million,
primarily  due to cash being used to  pay energy cost related obligations before
cash is collected  from customers.  Partially offsetting  this use  of cash  was
increased  net  borrowings  from  the  company's  accounts  receivable financing
program which  provided $50.8  million of  additional operating  cash flow.  The
change  to  the  mark-to-market  method  of  accounting  for  certain  financial
instruments (more  fully explained  on  page 32)  and  the provision  for  asset
impairments did not affect cash flows.

    Cash flow from operating activities decreased $60.0 million between 1994 and
1993  due  to  unfavorable  changes  in  working  capital.  As  discussed above,
operating cash flows are  affected by the timing  of cash payments and  accounts
receivable collections.

    CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

    The company's utility expenditures are  primarily made to extend service  to
new  customers, upgrade existing distribution systems and pipe and make periodic
improvements to  generation assets.  Gas transmission  and processing  additions
consists  of expenditures from  AGP. The increase  in 1995 compared  to 1994 and
1993 is  primarily due  to construction  in mid-1995  of a  30-inch pipeline  to
connect AGP's gathering system to a processing plant.

    BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

    In  May 1995, the company and UtilCo Group paid $59 million to acquire a 50%
ownership interest in a partnership that  owns and operates a chemical  recovery
and  cogeneration  facility in  Alabama. This  is  the company's  largest single
investment in  an independent  power project  to date.  The facility  sells  its
electric output to a pulp and paper mill.

    In  January  1995,  the  company completed  its  acquisition  of  a 218-mile
intrastate gas pipeline  and gas  distribution system for  $78.0 million.  These
businesses now operate as UtiliCorp Pipeline Systems, Inc. (UPL), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company. UPL had sales of $14.3 million in 1995.

    In  January 1995, the company acquired Broad Street Oil & Gas Company, a gas
marketing company based in Ohio, and  AGP acquired Tristar Gas Company, a  Texas
gas   processing,  gathering  and  marketing  firm.   Broad  Street  Oil  &  Gas
concentrates on  marketing  natural  gas  to small  to  medium  size  commercial
businesses  through  a network  of contract  sales representatives.  Tristar Gas
Company sold approximately  156 million  cubic feet per  day of  natural gas  in
1995.  Tristar focuses  its marketing  efforts on  Texas intrastate  natural gas
markets.

    In September 1994, the  company spent $22.1 million  cash to acquire  Kansas
gas  distribution and selected  transmission assets from  NorAm Energy Corp. The
Kansas  system  serves  about  22,000  customers  in  Wichita  and   surrounding
communities.  In February 1993, the company  spent $99.0 million cash to acquire
NorAm's Nebraska gas distribution system serving approximately 124,000 customers
in 63 eastern Nebraska communities.

    See page 27  for discussion  of the company's  international investments  in
Australia and New Zealand and page 25 for disposition of oil and gas properties.

    The company's operating cash flow provided approximately 41%, 66% and 98% of
the needed funds for the three years ended December 31, 1995, applying operating
cash flows to investing activities first. Additional cash needs are derived from
various financing activities discussed below.

</TABLE>

    To supplement the company's internally generated cash flows, the company has
various short-term  credit programs.  A primary  source of  cash has  been  bank
borrowing  from  uncommitted  bank lines.  In  addition, the  company  can issue
commercial paper  aggregating  $150 million.  To  support the  commercial  paper
program,  the company  has a $250  million committed  revolving credit agreement
with a consortium of  banks. The credit agreement  expires in December 2000  and
allows the issuance of notes that bear interest at rates based on the prime rate
or various money market rates.

    The  company also  has two accounts  receivable sale programs.  The level of
funding available from these programs varies depending on the level of  eligible
accounts  receivable,  which fluctuates  seasonally.  Under these  programs, the
company may borrow another $37 million.

    On December 8,  1995, the company  obtained an extended  grace period for  a
long-term  debt to capitalization ratio covenant  from its creditor on its 9.21%
senior notes. The grace period extends to June 30, 1996. The company  classified
this  debt as long-term as  management believes it is  probable that the company
will meet  the  covenant ratio  by  June 30,  1996  and for  foreseeable  future
periods.

    FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS

    Future  cash requirements  include utility  plant additions,  dividends, and
required redemptions of long-term securities and acquisition opportunities.

PENDING MERGER WITH KANSAS CITY POWER & LIGHT COMPANY (KCPL)

    On  January 19, 1996,  the company, KCPL  and KC United  Corp. (KCU) entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) which provides for a
strategic business combination of the  company and KCPL in a  "merger-of-equals"
transaction (the Transaction). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the company and
KCPL will merge with and into KCU (which may be renamed at the discretion of the
company  and KCPL),  a corporation  formed for  the purpose  of the Transaction.
Under the terms  of the  Merger Agreement, each  share of  the company's  common
stock  will be exchanged for 1.096 shares of  KCU common stock and each share of
KCPL common stock will be exchanged for one share of KCU common stock. Based  on
the  number of  shares of  the company's  common stock  and KCPL's  common stock
outstanding on  the  date  of  the  Merger  Agreement,  the  company'  s  common
shareholders  will receive  about 45%  of the  common equity  of KCU  and KCPL's
common shareholders will receive about 55%.

    The Transaction  is  designed to  qualify  as  a pooling  of  interests  for
accounting  and financial reporting  purposes. Under this  method of accounting,
the recorded assets  and liabilities of  the company and  KCPL would be  carried
forward  to  the  consolidated financial  statements  of KCU  at  their recorded
amounts. The income of KCU would include the combined income of the company  and
KCPL  as  though the  Transaction occurred  at the  beginning of  the accounting
period. The Prior periods would be combined and presented as those of KCU.

    The Transaction will create a diversified energy company with total combined
sales of over $3.5 billion and over $6.5 billion in total assets, serving  about
2.5  million customers  in the  United States,  Canada, the  United Kingdom, New
Zealand, Australia, China and  Jamaica. The business  of the combined  companies
will  consist of electric utility operations, gas utility operations and various
non-utility enterprises including independent power projects, and gas marketing,
gathering and processing operations.

    The Transaction is subject to approval from each company's shareholders  and
a number of regulatory authorities. The regulatory approvals process is expected
to  take  about  12 to  18  months.  The Merger  Agreement  includes termination
provisions which may require  certain payments to the  party to the  Transaction
under  certain  circumstances,  including  a  payment  of  $58  million  if  the
Transaction is terminated by a party and within two and one-half years following
such termination,  the terminating  party agrees  to consummate  or  consummates
certains business combination transactions.

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT

    Effective  January 1, 1995, the company adopted the mark-to-market method of
accounting (MTM) for its  non-price regulated gas  trading business. Under  MTM,
natural  gas forwards, futures,  swaps, options and  other financial instruments
are recorded at  fair value,  net of future  servicing costs  and reserves,  and
recognized  as revenue upon contract execution in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. The resulting  unrealized gains and  losses are recorded  as Price  Risk
Management  Assets  and  Liabilities in  the  accompanying  Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The change  to MTM resulted  in an  increase in pretax  income of  $29.8
million  ($18.3  million after  tax) for  the  year ended  December 31,  1995 as
compared to  the  results under  the  previous accounting  method.  The  company
previously  accounted for this activity by the accrual method of accounting. The
company has not  shown the  pro forma  effect of the  adoption of  MTM on  prior
periods since the cumulative impact on prior period earnings was immaterial.

    The  impact in the current year primarily results from the effect of certain
contractual sales commitments which had been  designated as hedges of a  portion
of  the company's natural gas reserves. As discussed in Note 4, the company sold
its oil and gas reserves in September  1995. The resulting open position of  the
commitments   created  a  change  in  the   price  risk  management  assets  and
liabilities.

    Current period changes in  the assets and  liabilities from risk  management
activities  are recognized as revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The changes in the assets and liabilities primarily result from newly originated
transactions, changes in  the price of  natural gas, the  timing of  settlements
related  to these contracts and changes in the various risk reserves. The market
prices used to value  these transactions reflect  management's best estimate  of
market  prices  considering  various  factors,  including  closing  exchange and
over-the-counter quotations. The reserves are established for a number of  risks
and costs associated with the company's future commitments, including the credit
risks  of its counterparties, the time value of money, the impact of liquidating
the portfolio  in an  orderly manner  over  a reasonable  period of  time  under
present market conditions, and other identifiable contingencies.

    The  company  generally attempts  to  balance its  fixed-price  physical and
financial purchase  and sales  contracts  both volumetrically  and in  terms  of
future timing of the commitments. However, net open positions often exist or are
established  due  to  the  origination of  new  transactions  and  the company's
assessment, based upon information gained from its gas marketing activities,  of
future  price movements. As a result, the  company is to some extent affected by
fluctuating market prices. At  December 31, 1995, a  price movement of $.10  per
MCF  for natural gas would have impacted income from operations by approximately
$1.7 million.

    The change in accounting method does not impact the company's gas  marketing
activities  in the U.K. or its financial instruments associated with its natural
gas liquids hedging or electricity  brokering. The company enters into  futures,
forwards,  swaps and options  in order to hedge  purchase and sales commitments,
inventories and anticipated production of these products. Changes in the  market
value  of such transactions are deferred until the gain or loss is recognized on
the hedged commitment.

INCOME TAXES

    The level  of income  tax expense  during the  three-year period  fluctuated
generally  with  the level  of pretax  accounting income,  except for  1993. The
effective tax rate in 1993 was significantly affected by the non-taxable gain on
the sale of subsidiary stock and the passage of the Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 (the Act.)

    As a result of the Act, the company made a retroactive adjustment to reflect
the increase in the  corporate tax rate  from 34% to  35%, effective January  1,
1993.  The rise in the tax rate  increased 1993 income tax expense approximately
$4.0 million, or $.10 per average common share. Deferred income tax  liabilities
from   regulated  operations  were  also   increased.  However,  because  it  is
anticipated these

                                       32
<PAGE>
additional taxes  would  be recovered  through  rates, a  regulatory  asset  was
established  and included in deferred charges in the accompanying balance sheet.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

    The company has available approximately  $88 million of alternative  minimum
tax (AMT) credits. AMT credits have an indefinite life.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD

    In  October 1995, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards   No.  123,  "Accounting  for   Stock-based
Compensation"  (SFAS  123).  SFAS 123  requires  companies to  either  record or
disclose pro forma information on the fair value of certain stock-based programs
including stock options and employee stock purchase plans. The company currently
provides stock options to certain employees  and has an employee stock  purchase
program  whereby employees may purchase company  common stock at a 15% discount.
Under SFAS 123, these  plans will require either  the recording of  compensation
expense  or pro forma disclosures  of net income and  earnings per share had the
company elected  to  record  compensation  expense.  The  company  has  not  yet
evaluated  the accounting  and reporting implications  of SFAS 123  and does not
have an estimate  of additional  compensation expense  associated with  affected
plans.  SFAS  123 is  required to  be  adopted in  fiscal years  beginning after
December 15, 1995.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

    In the next few years, the company anticipates that the level of  inflation,
if  moderate, will  not have a  significant effect on  operations or acquisition
activity.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

    This report contains  forward-looking information.  Such statements  involve
risks and uncertainties and there are certain important factors that could cause
actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  anticipated.  Some  of the
important factors which  could cause  actual results to  differ materially  from
those  anticipated include, but are not limited to, future national and regional
economic  and  competition  conditions,  inflation  rates,  regulatory  changes,
weather conditions, financial market conditions, interest rates, future business
decisions,  and other uncertainties,  all of which are  difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond the control of the company.

               NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The consolidated financial statements of UtiliCorp United Inc. (the company,
a  Delaware corporation) include all  operating divisions and all majority-owned
subsidiaries. The company's  principal lines  of business are  electric and  gas
utility   operations,  gas  marketing,  gas  processing  and  independent  power
generation. The North American  utility businesses operate  in eight states  and
one  province of Canada. Natural gas is  marketed in 45 states and the company's
gas processing operations  are in Texas  and Oklahoma. In  addition to U.S.  and
Canadian  businesses,  the company  has  various investments  in  Australia, the
United Kingdom, New Zealand and  Jamaica. All significant intercompany  accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

    The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported amounts  of  assets and  liabilities and
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities  at the date  of the  financial
statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.  The
company's   accounting  policies   conform  to   generally  accepted  accounting
principles which, in the case of the company's utility operations, consider  the
impact of rate regulation.

    MINORITY INTERESTS.  Minority interests represent the minority stockholders'
proportionate share of the stockholders' equity and net income, primarily Aquila
Gas Pipeline Corporation (AGP). The company also owns majority interest in a gas
marketing  company in the  United Kingdom and  in a company  that invests in New
Zealand electric utilities.

    REGULATION.  The company's utility  operations are subject to regulation  by
various   regulatory  authorities.  The  company  currently  applies  accounting
standards  that  recognize  the  economic   effects  of  rate  regulation   and,
accordingly,  has  recorded regulatory  assets related  to the  company's energy
generation, transmission and distribution  operations. The table below  presents
the  amount of regulatory assets  recorded at December 31,  1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

</TABLE>

    UTILITY PLANT AND DEPRECIATION.  Utility  plant is stated at original  cost.
Repair  and  maintenance  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  When  property is
replaced, removed or  abandoned, its cost,  together with the  costs of  removal
less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.

    For   financial   statement  purposes,   depreciation   is  provided   on  a
straight-line basis over the estimated lives of depreciable property by applying
composite average  annual rates,  ranging  from 3.0%  to  4.6%, as  approved  by
regulatory authorities.

    The  excess of total acquisition costs over the aggregate regulated value of
net assets acquired to date is included in utility plant ($164.7 million, net of
$32.0 million in  accumulated amortization at  December 31, 1995)  and is  being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years.

                                       38
<PAGE>
    OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.  Oil and gas properties were accounted for using the
full  cost method. Under the full cost method, all costs associated with gas and
oil property acquisition, exploration and development, including  non-productive
costs,  were capitalized. See Note 4 for discussion of the sale of substantially
all of the company's oil and gas production assets.

    The provision for  depreciation, depletion and  amortization was  determined
using  the units of production method over  the estimated lives of the producing
properties based on  estimated quantities of  proved reserves. Amortization  per
MCF  equivalent  averaged  $1.27,  $1.44  and  $1.27  in  1995,  1994  and 1993,
respectively.  Gathering,  processing  and  other  energy  related  property  is
depreciated using a composite average annual rate of 5.0%.

    SALES   RECOGNITION,  PURCHASED   GAS  ADJUSTMENTS   AND  ENERGY  ADJUSTMENT
CLAUSES.   Sales are  generally recognized  when the  products or  services  are
delivered,  except price  risk management activities.  See below  for price risk
management policy. Gas sales and the company's electric utility sales in  Kansas
and West Virginia are subject to adjustment clauses. Differences between amounts
collected and allowable costs are recorded as over- or under-recovered gas costs
and fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the ratemaking policies of
regulatory authorities.

    Beginning  with the 1995  annual financial statements,  the company began to
present gas marketing sales  and cost of gas  separately. Previously net  margin
was  included in sales.  The effect of  this change is  reflected in all periods
presented. A comparison of previously reported amounts to 1995's presentation is
presented below:

</TABLE>

    Effective January 1, 1995, the company adopted the mark-to-market method  of
accounting   for  its  domestic  natural  gas  trading  activities,  principally
conducted by  Aquila  Energy  Corporation,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the
company.  Under mark-to-market  accounting, the  company's domestic  natural gas
trading  contracts,   including  both   physical  transactions   and   financial
instruments,  are  recorded at  fair value,  net of  future servicing  costs and
reserves, and recognized as sales or expense upon contract execution. Changes in
the market  value of  this contract  portfolio (resulting  primarily from  newly
originated  transactions and  the impact of  price movements)  are recognized as
gains or losses  in the  period of change.  The resulting  unrealized gains  and
losses are recorded as price risk management assets and liabilities.

    The  company's prior method recognized gains  and losses when the underlying
physical commodity was  sold. The  change was made  to more  fairly present  the
current  results of  the company's  operations related  to this  business and to
recognize that value is created and  the earnings process is completed when  the
contractual  commitments are finalized. The effect of this change was immaterial
for prior periods and increased 1995  sales and income from operations by  $29.8
million ($18.3 million after tax).

    The  impact in the current year primarily results from the effect of certain
contractual sales commitments which had been  designated as hedges of a  portion
of  the company's natural gas reserves. As discussed in Note 4, the company sold
its oil and gas reserves in September  1995. The resulting open position of  the
commitments   created  a  change  in  the   price  risk  management  assets  and
liabilities.

                                       39
<PAGE>
    ACCOUNTING FOR  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS.   As  indicated above,  the  company
accounts  for  financial instruments  associated with  its domestic  natural gas
trading activities using the mark-to-market method.

    Activities for non-trading purposes consist of transactions entered into  by
the  company's other  businesses to hedge  the impact of  market fluctuations on
assets, liabilities, or  other contractual  commitments. Changes  in the  market
value  of these transactions are  deferred until the gain  or loss on the hedged
item is recognized.

    INCOME TAXES.   The company accounts  for income taxes  using the  liability
method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by
applying  tax  regulations existing  at the  end  of a  reporting period  to the
cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred investment  tax
credits  are amortized over the lives of the related properties. No provision is
made  for  U.S.  income  taxes  on  undistributed  earnings  of  the   company's
international  businesses  ($9.5 million  at December  31,  1995) because  it is
management's  intention  to  reinvest  such  earnings  in  those   international
operations. Consolidated income before income taxes for the years ended December
31,  1995, 1994 and 1993, included  $11.2, $9.1 and $10.7 million, respectively,
from international operations.

    CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOW INFORMATION.  Cash equivalents are defined as
temporary cash  investments with  a maturity  of  three months  or less.  As  of
December  31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the  company had cash of $77.5 million, $58.5
million and $52.2 million, respectively, held in foreign countries.

    Cash payments for interest and taxes and supplemental disclosure relating to
acquisition activities are presented below:

</TABLE>

    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE.  Primary  earnings per common share are  computed
on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

    Fully  diluted earnings  per common  share assume  conversion of convertible
subordinated debentures and  convertible preference stock  for the periods  they
were outstanding and dilutive.

    CONCENTRATION    OF    FOREIGN   OPERATIONS    AND    CURRENCY   TRANSLATION
ADJUSTMENTS.  As of  December 31, 1995,  1994 and 1993,  the company had  18.5%,
9.5%  and 10.0%, respectively, of its  assets denominated in foreign currencies.
Management believes the economies in which its international businesses  operate
are  stable. Changes in the  value of these foreign  currencies affect asset and
liability value, and income and loss contributions.

    The financial statements  of foreign  operations have  been translated  into
U.S.  dollars using  the weighted  average exchange  rates for  income statement
items and  year-end  exchange  rates  for balance  sheet  items.  The  resulting
translation adjustments increase or decrease common shareowners' equity.

    RECLASSIFICATIONS.  Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial
statements  have  been  reclassified  where necessary  to  conform  to  the 1995
presentation.

                        NOTE 2: MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS

PROPOSED MERGER -- KANSAS CITY POWER & LIGHT COMPANY (KCPL)

    On January 19,  1996, the company,  KCPL and KC  United Corp. (KCU)  entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) which provides for a
strategic  business combination of the company  and KCPL in a "merger-of-equals"
transaction (the Transaction). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the company and
KCPL will merge with and into KCU (which may be renamed at the discretion of the
company and KCPL),  a corporation  formed for  the purpose  of the  Transaction.
Under  the terms  of the  Merger Agreement, each  share of  the company's common
stock will be exchanged for 1.096 shares  of KCU common stock and each share  of
KCPL  common stock will be exchanged for one share of KCU common stock. Based on
the number  of shares  of the  company's common  stock and  KCPL's common  stock
outstanding   on  the  date  of  the  Merger  Agreement,  the  company's  common
shareholders will  receive about  45% of  the common  equity of  KCU and  KCPL's
common shareholders will receive about 55%.

    The  Transaction  is  designed to  qualify  as  a pooling  of  interests for
accounting and financial  reporting purposes.  Under this  method, the  recorded
assets  and liabilities of the company and  KCPL would be carried forward to the
consolidated financial statements of KCU  at their recorded amounts. The  income
of  KCU would include the combined income of  the company and KCPL as though the
merger occurred  at  the  beginning  of  the  accounting  period.  Prior  period
financial statements would be combined and presented as KCU.

    The Transaction will create a diversified energy company with total combined
sales  of over  $3.5 billion, over  $6.5 billion  in total assets  and about 2.5
million customers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand,
Australia, China  and  Jamaica. The  business  of the  combined  companies  will
consist  of electric utility operations, gas utility operations and various non-
utility enterprises  including independent  power  projects and  gas  marketing,
gathering and processing operations.

    The  Transaction is subject to approval from each company's shareholders and
a number of regulatory authorities. The regulatory approvals process is expected
to take  about  12 to  18  months.  The Merger  Agreement  includes  termination
provisions  which may require  certain payments to the  party to the Transaction
under  certain  circumstances,  including  a  payment  of  $58  million  if  the
Transaction is terminated by a party and within two and one-half years following
such  termination,  the terminating  party agrees  to consummate  or consummates
certains business combination transactions.

INTEREST IN AUSTRALIAN ELECTRIC UTILITY

    On September 6,  1995, Power  Partnership Pty  Limited (PPL),  of which  the
company owns 49.9 %, acquired United Energy Limited (UE), an Australian electric
distribution utility, from the State of Victoria. The company paid approximately
$257.9 million for its 49.9 % ownership interest in PPL. The company manages the
operations  of  UE  on behalf  of  PPL  and receives  an  annual  management fee
consisting of a base amount indexed to  the consumer price index and a  variable
amount based on UE's financial performance. The management agreement extends for
10 years from date of acquisition.

    The  company financed its ownership interest primarily through two five-year
Australian-dollar-based revolving  credit  facilities.  See  Note  10  for  more
information  regarding financing arrangements  and interest rate  swaps used for
risk management purposes.

    The acquisition was recorded as a  purchase and PPL's results are  accounted
for  using the  equity method  of accounting.  The purchase  price was allocated
based on estimated fair  values at the  date of the  acquisition. The excess  of
purchase  price over  the fair  value of  assets was  approximately $634 million
including approximately $450 million related to a license fee, and is  reflected
as  various intangible assets on PPL's  financial records. The equity investment
is included in Investments in Subsidiaries and Partnerships on the  Consolidated
Balance  Sheet. See  Note 8 for  more information  regarding year-end investment
balance and equity in  earnings. Pro forma unaudited  results of operations  for
the  company, assuming the acquisition occurred  at the beginning of the period,
are shown below. For the

1994 period, the pro forma results include UE's results for the 12 months  ended
June  30,  1995. UE  began  operations on  July 1,  1994,  and the  1995 amounts
represent the most comparable figures for the pro forma table.

INTEREST IN NEW ZEALAND ELECTRIC UTILITIES

    On November  30, 1995,  UtiliCorp  N.Z., Inc.  (UNZ),  a subsidiary  of  the
company,  acquired 20.0% of the common stock of Power New Zealand Limited (PNZ),
a  New  Zealand  electric  distribution  utility,  from  Todd  Corporation   for
approximately  $69.4  million.  This  acquisition  was  financed  through  a New
Zealand-dollar-denominated credit facility. PNZ is New Zealand's second  largest
electric  distribution  utility,  serving approximately  214,000  customers. UNZ
owned 7.5% of PNZ prior to completing the transaction with Todd Corporation  and
owned  approximately 27.5% of PNZ as of December 31, 1995. Todd Corporation is a
21% shareholder in UNZ.

    In February 1995, UNZ paid $16.1  million to WEL Energy Group Limited  (WEL)
to satisfy its capital commitment. UNZ now participates in WEL's earnings to the
full  extent of  its ownership.  Prior to the  payment of  the remaining capital
commitment, UNZ's participation in WEL's earnings  was limited to 5%. WEL is  an
electric distribution utility serving approximately 65,000 customers.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS

    On  May 22, 1995,  the company and UtilCo  Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
acquired a  50% interest  in an  independent power  project in  Alabama for  $59
million. The project sells its generation output to a paper processing plant.

    On  January 5, 1995, the company purchased a 218-mile intrastate natural gas
pipeline system in Missouri from Edisto Resources Corporation for $78 million.

    On January 17, 1995,  the company acquired Broad  Street Oil and Gas  (Broad
Street),  a gas marketing company, for  $7.0 million. Broad Street sells natural
gas to approximately 10,000 commercial customers in nine states.

    On January 17, 1995, AGP acquired  Tristar Gas Company for $16.3 million  in
cash.  Based in Texas,  Tristar gathers, processes, and  markets natural gas and
natural gas liquids.

    In September  1994, the  company acquired  the Kansas  gas distribution  and
selected  pipeline properties of  NorAm Energy Corp.  (NorAm) for $23.0 million.
The Kansas system serves approximately 22,000 customers.

    In February 1993, the  company acquired a  Nebraska gas distribution  system
from  NorAm  for $106  million, including  $21 million  in working  capital. The
Nebraska system serves approximately 124,000 customers.

                         NOTE 3: PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT

    PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.  The company offers price risk  management
services primarily for the commodity of natural gas. These services are provided
through a variety of financial

                                       42
<PAGE>
instruments, including forward contracts which commit the company to purchase or
sell  natural gas in the future; swap  agreements, which require payments to (or
receipt of payments from) counterparties  based on the differential between  two
prices  for the commodity  specified by the swap;  futures and options contracts
traded on  the  New York  Mercantile  Exchange (NYMEX);  and  other  contractual
arrangements.

    The  availablity and use  of these types  of contracts allow  the company to
manage and hedge its  contractual commitments, reduce  its exposure relative  to
the  volatility  of cash  market prices,  take  advantage of  selected arbitrage
opportunities  via  open  positions  and  protect  its  investment  in   storage
inventories.  The company is also able  to secure additional sources of physical
natural gas supply or create additional markets for existing supply through  the
use of exchange for physical (EFP) transactions allowed by NYMEX. The management
of  these types of transactions  is referred to herein  as price risk management
activities.

    MARKET RISK.    The  company's  price  risk  management  activities  involve
offering fixed price commitments into the future. At December 31, 1995, the term
of  the natural gas  portfolio extended to  the year 2008.  Although the company
generally attempts  to balance  its  physical and  financial purchase  and  sale
contracts  in terms of  quantities and contract  performance, net open positions
often exist or are  established due to the  origination of new transactions  and
the  company's assessment of,  and response to,  changing market conditions. The
company will at times create a net open position or allow a net open position to
continue when it believes, based upon competitive information acquired from  its
energy marketing activities, that future price movements will be consistent with
its  net open position. To the extent that  the company has an open position, it
is exposed to the risk that  fluctuating market prices may adversely impact  its
financial  position  or results  from  operations. The  company  has established
trading policies and exposure  limits that are monitored  and reviewed. A  price
movement  of  $.10 per  MCF  for natural  gas at  December  31, 1995  would have
impacted income from operations by approximately $1.7 million.

    MARKET VALUATION.    The market  prices  used to  value  these  transactions
reflect  management's best estimate of market prices considering various factors
including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value of  money
and price volatility factors underlying the commitments. These market prices are
adjusted  to reflect the potential impact  of liquidating the company's position
in an  orderly manner  over a  reasonable period  of time  under present  market
conditions.

    The  company has considered a number of  risks and costs associated with the
future commitments that are included in the market valuation of the natural  gas
portfolio,  including credit  risks associated  with the  financial condition of
counterparties, product  location (basis)  differentials and  other risks  which
management  policy dictates. A  calculation of the  time value of  money is also
applied to all  contracts. The  company continuously monitors  the valuation  of
identified risks and adjusts them based on present market conditions.

    The counterparties in the company's portfolio consist primarily of financial
institutions,  oil  and  gas  companies  and  independent  power  producers. The
creditworthiness of the company's counterparties may impact its overall exposure
to   credit   risk,    either   positively   or    negatively.   However,    the

                                       43
<PAGE>
company  maintains  credit  policies  with  regard  to  its  counterparties that
management believes minimizes overall credit risk. The following table  displays
the mark-to-market results of the company's natural gas transactions at December
31, 1995 and the average value for the year ended December 31, 1995:

    Three independent power producers comprise the majority of the Company's net
price  risk management assets. The  concentration of customers, which fluctuates
with changes in market conditions, may impact the company's overall exposure  to
credit  risk,  either positively  or negatively,  in that  the customers  may be
similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

                             NOTE 4: RESTRUCTURINGS

AQUILA RESTRUCTURING

    In the fourth quarter  of 1993, the Aquila  Energy subsidiary implemented  a
new  business strategy and  recorded a $69.8 million  charge against income ($45
million after tax) for disposal of  selected gas sales contracts, impairment  of
certain  offshore assets, and other restructuring  costs. Since then, Aquila has
been settling various contracts and reducing this reserve. In the first  quarter
of  1995, Aquila completed its restructuring  plan. The net contract settlements
were more favorable  than originally anticipated  in 1993, resulting  in a  $5.0
million  and $5.4 million positive adjustment  to income from operations for the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.

AGP PUBLIC OFFERING

    In October 1993, AGP  completed an initial public  offering and sale of  5.4
million  shares of  common stock,  representing approximately  18% of  its total
shares outstanding. Net proceeds  of the offering were  about $74.6 million  and
were  used to reduce short-term debt incurred for working capital purposes. This
transaction resulted  in a  gain  of $47.8  million, recorded  as  non-operating
income  in the Consolidated Statement of  Income. Consistent with U.S. tax laws,
no income tax expense was recorded related to this gain.

SALE OF OIL AND GAS ASSETS

    On September 27, 1995,  the company sold assets  of Aquila Energy  Resources
Corporation,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aquila Energy, for approximately $205
million in  cash,  which approximated  their  carrying value.  The  assets  sold
consisted of substantially all of the company's oil and gas reserves.

    The  impairment loss related to UtilCo Group's investment in a power project
was primarily caused  by a change  in the  projected cash flows  of the  project
after  considering updated projections of future energy prices. This resulted in
the write-off of the remaining investment balance.

    The impairment loss  relating to AGP's  gas gathering systems  stems from  a
review of cash flows on a system-by-system basis. Prior to adoption of SFAS 121,
AGP  assessed  asset realization  at  a cash  flow  level higher  than  SFAS 121
requires. In preparing  cash flow  projections related to  AGP's assets  certain
assumptions  were  used.  The  more  significant  assumptions  included constant
throughput flow based on 1994 actual throughput for an estimated remaining  life
of  20 years. Cash flows were discounted based on AGP's weighted average cost of
capital.

    The impairment loss  relating to gas  processing plants relate  to a  review
conducted after the sale of Aquila's oil and gas properties. These company-owned
plants were managed as part of Aquila's properties, but were not part of Aquila.
In  assessing these plants separately under the principles of SFAS 121, the cash
flows from these assets were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
plants.

              NOTE 8: INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND PARTNERSHIPS

*Weighted average interest rate.

    The amount  of long-term  debt maturing  in  each of  the next  five  years,
including  sinking fund provisions, is as  follows (in millions): 1996 -- $15.1;
1997 -- $25.8; 1998 -- $147.7; 1999 -- $165.9; and 2000 -- $270.1.

    In June 1995, the company issued $100 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due  in
2005.  Net proceeds of  $99.3 million were  used to reduce  short-term debt. The
Notes are the initial securities issued under a $200 million shelf  registration
of debt securities.

    In  November 1994, the company issued $100 million of 8.45% Senior Notes due
in 1999. The net proceeds of $99.5  million were used to reduce short-term  debt
incurred for construction and acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.

    In  June 1995, UtiliCorp  Capital L.P. (UC), a  limited partnership of which
the company is the general partner, issued 4,000,000 shares of 8.875% Cumulative
Monthly Income Preferred  Securities, Series  A, for $100  million. The  limited
partnership  interests represented by the preferred securities are redeemable at
the option  of UC,  after June  12, 2000,  at $25  per preferred  security  plus
accrued interest and unpaid dividends. Holders of the securities are entitled to
receive  dividends at  an annual  rate of  8.875% of  the liquidation preference
value of $25. Dividends are payable monthly and in substance are tax  deductible
by  the  company.  The  securities are  shown  as  Company-Obligated Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities  of a  Partnership on  the Consolidated  Balance
Sheet. The net proceeds were used to reduce short-term debt.

    UtiliCorp   South   Pacific,   Inc.   (USP)   has   a   $135   million   New
Zealand-dollar-denominated credit facility with a  consortium of banks that  was
utilized  to finance a portion of the  investment made by UNZ. The interest rate
floats with changes  in the New  Zealand bank  bill rate. The  interest rate  at
December  31, 1995, was 8.98% and matures February 28, 1998. A commitment fee of
 .20% applies to the unused portion of the credit facility.

    UAHL has  two  5-year  credit  facilities ($225  million  and  $100  million
[Australian])  with  a consortium  of banks  that were  utilized to  finance the
ownership interest  in  UE.  The  interest  rate  floats  with  changes  in  the
Australian  bank bill rate.  The weighted average interest  rate at December 31,
1995 was 7.91%. A commitment  fee of .20% applies to  the unused portion of  the
credit facility. Borrowings from this facility are considered long-term as it is
the  company's intention to  repay borrowed funds  over periods extending beyond
one year.

                                       48

    On November 6, 1995, UAHL entered into an interest rate swap agreement  with
Deutsche Bank with a contractual amount of $100 million (Australian) whereby the
company exchanges variable Australian debt interest for fixed rate interest. The
fixed interest rate is 7.77% for a period extending to September 7, 1998.

    On  December 8, 1995,  the company obtained  an extended grace  period for a
long-term debt to capitalization ratio covenant  from its creditor on its  9.21%
senior  notes. The grace period extends to June 30, 1996. The debt obligation is
classified as long-term debt  in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet, as  management
believes  it is probable that  the company will meet  the covenant ratio by June
30, 1996 and for the foreseeable future periods.

    Substantially all of  the domestic  utility plant  owned by  the company  is
subject  to the  lien of various  mortgage indentures. The  company cannot issue
additional mortgage  bonds  under  these mortgage  indentures  without  directly
securing  the 6.0%, 8.45%, 8.2%,  9.0%, 8.0% and 6.375%  Senior Notes equally as
any mortgage bond issue.  Currently the company has  no plans to issue  mortgage
bonds.

    The  company executed an  Indenture in 1990 (Indenture)  for the issuance of
senior  notes.  Notes  issued  pursuant  to  the  Indenture  will  be  unsecured
obligations  of the company and  will rank on a  parity with all other unsecured
and subordinate indebtedness of the company.

    At December 31,  1995, 6.625% convertible  subordinated debentures  totaling
$8.0  million  remained  outstanding.  The  debentures  can  be  converted  into
approximately 340,000 shares  of common stock,  based on a  conversion price  of
$23.68,  subject to an annual maximum limitation. The debentures are subordinate
to the  prior payment,  when due,  of the  principal and  premium, if  any,  and
interest on all the company's debt outstanding, except debt that by its terms is
not senior in right of payment to the debentures.

                             NOTE 11: CAPITAL STOCK

    As  of December 31,  1995, the company  was not restricted  as to payment of
cash dividends.

    The Board of Directors of the  company (the Board) is authorized to  approve
the  issuance of  up to  20 million shares  of Class  A common  stock, $1.00 par
value. No shares of Class A common stock are issued or outstanding.

    DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND COMMON STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  On February 16, 1995,
the company  registered 3  million shares  of  common stock  to initiate  a  new
Dividend  Reinvestment  and Common  Stock Purchase  Plan  (New Plan).  Under the
provisions of this New Plan, current and potential shareholders can purchase  up
to  $10,000 per month of the company's common stock at a five-day average market
price and without  sales commissions. The  New Plan allows  members to  reinvest
dividends into additional common stock at a 5% discount. The New Plan amends the
previous  plan and all members in the previous plan automatically became members
in the New Plan.

    EMPLOYEE STOCK  PURCHASE PLAN.   Participants  have the  opportunity to  buy
shares  of the company's common stock at a reduced price through regular payroll
deductions and/or lump sum deposits of up to 20% of the employee's base  salary.
Contributions  are credited  to the  participant's account  throughout an option
period. At the end of the option period, the participant's total account balance
is applied to  the purchase  of common  shares of  the company.  The shares  are
purchased  at 85% of the lower of the market  price on the first day or the last
day of the option period.  Participants must be enrolled in  the Plan as of  the
first day of an option period in order to participate in that option period.

    RESTATED  SAVINGS PLAN.   A defined contribution  plan, the Restated Savings
Plan (Savings Plan) covers all full-time and eligible part-time employees of the
company. Participants may generally elect

                                       49
<PAGE>
to contribute up  to 12% of  their annual pay  on a before-  or after-tax  basis
subject  to certain limitations. The  company generally matches contributions up
to  6%.  Participants  may  direct  their  contributions  into  five   different
investment  options.  All company  matching contributions  are in  the company's
common stock. In addition, the Savings  Plan also includes a stock  contribution
fund  whereby the company can contribute  an additional amount of company common
stock to participants.

    STOCK AWARDS AND STOCK OPTIONS.  The company's Stock Incentive Plan provides
for the  granting of  common shares  to certain  employees as  restricted  stock
awards and as stock options.

    Shares  issued  as restricted  stock awards  are held  by the  company until
certain restrictions lapse, generally on the third award anniversary. The market
value of the stock, when awarded, is amortized to compensation expense over  the
three-year period.

    Stock  options granted under the Plan allow the purchase of common shares at
a price  not less  than fair  market value  at the  date of  grant. Options  are
generally  exercisable commencing  with the first  anniversary of  the grant and
expire after 10 years from the date of grant.

    Subject to regulatory and  shareholder approval, on  September 8, 1995,  the
company  granted up to 619,325  shares of the company's  common stock to certain
key individuals at an exercise price of $27.25 per share.

    The Board approved  the establishment of  an Employee Stock  Option Plan  in
1991.  This Plan provides for  the granting of up to  1 million stock options to
full-time employees other than those eligible to receive options under the Stock
Incentive Plan. Stock options granted under the Employee Stock Option Plan carry
the same provisions as those issued under the Stock Incentive Plan. During 1992,
options for 742,900  shares were  granted to  employees. The  exercise price  of
these  options is $27.3125.  No options have  been issued under  this Plan since
1992.

    At December 31, 1995, restricted stock  awards and stock options which  were
exercisable totaled 165,735 shares.

    Stock options as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are summarized below:

    MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE STOCK.  In February 1994, the
Board authorized the redemption of all  outstanding shares of the $1.775  Series
Convertible  Preference  Stock.  During  the  1994  first  and  second quarters,
approximately 1.3  million and  1.5  million shares  of  the $1.775  stock  were
converted  into approximately 2.7 million shares  of common stock. The remaining
approximately 100,000 shares were redeemed on May 26, 1994 at a price of  $21.60
per share plus accrued dividends.

    In  August 1993, passage of the Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act)
increased the statutory federal income tax rate  from 34% to 35%. This tax  rate
change increased income tax expense by approximately $4.0 million, of which $2.7
million  represented a non-cash adjustment  to increase deferred tax liabilities
as of January 1, 1993.

    The  company  has  an  alternative   minimum  tax  credit  carryforward   of
approximately  $88 million at December 31, 1995. Alternative minimum tax credits
can be carried forward indefinitely and the company has not recorded a valuation
allowance against its tax credit carryforwards.

    The principal components of the  company's deferred income taxes consist  of

    The company has pension plans covering substantially all qualified union and
non-union  employees. The benefit formulas vary and are based either on years of
service multiplied by a percentage of salary, or a flat benefit based upon years
of service.

    The company's policy is to fund, at a minimum, an amount sufficient to  meet
all ERISA funding requirements. In certain of its jurisdictions, the company has
recorded  pension expense equal to its funding contribution, consistent with the
rate treatment allowed for this cost.

    In 1995 the company changed its long-term view on pension fund asset returns
and increased its estimated return on domestic plan assets to 10%.

    OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS.  The company provides post-retirement health
care and  life insurance  benefits  to certain  employees.  A majority  of  such
retirees pay a portion of the cost of the benefits.

    The  following table summarizes the  status of the company's post-retirement
plans for financial statement  purposes and the related  amount included in  the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993:

Health care cost trend rate.................................................    10%-6%      12.5%-6%      14%-6%
</TABLE>

    The rate  of change  in health  care cost  has an  effect on  the  projected
benefit obligation. Increasing the rate by 1% each year would have increased the
present  value of the  accumulated projected benefit  obligation by $2.4 million
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components by $.3 million  in
1995.

    Pursuant  to regulatory orders or precedents, certain regulated divisions of
the company have deferred as a regulatory asset the incremental costs associated
with SFAS No. 106. At December 31, 1995, the amount deferred was $8.5 million.

1993 was (in millions) $25.9, $26.4 and $25.7, respectively.

    Purchased power obligations for 1996  through 2000 are estimated to  provide
916; 921; 896; 856; and 628 MW, respectively.

    FINANCIAL  GUARANTEES AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.  At December 31, 1995, UtilCo
Group had unconditional capital commitments to fund partnership capital in  1996
aggregating $11.6 million.

    UtiliCorp  U.K. Limited  (a subsidiary of  UtiliCorp U.K., Inc.,  which is a
75%-owned subsidiary of  the company) is  a 25% equity  partner in Midlands  Gas
Limited  (MGL), a gas  marketing joint venture with  Midlands Electricity Plc (a
United Kingdom electric  utility). On  behalf of MGL,  Midlands Electricity  Plc
provided  three financial performance guarantees to producers, each supported by
financial guarantees by the company for its 25% share of the contracts.

    UtiliCorp U.K.  Limited is  also  a 25%  equity  partner in  Caledonian  Gas
Limited  (CGL), a gas  marketing company, with Scottish  Power, a United Kingdom
electric utility. As part of the  agreement with Scottish Power, UtiliCorp  U.K.
Limited  is  required to  provide  funds to  CGL  proportional to  its ownership
interest, up  to 2.5  million British  pounds (approximately  $3.9 million).  No
capital calls have been made pursuant to this agreement.

    Both  of these joint ventures are  anticipated to require additional funding
due to commitments to purchase gas under long-term contracts at prices which are
currently above market. The company is in discussion with its partners in  these
two  joint ventures regarding  these matters. Although the  company has not paid
any amounts to date, the company accrued a reserve of $11.0 million in  December
1995.  Based on current views of the market and the plans of the joint ventures,
the company believes that  the resolution of these  matters will not  materially
effect the financial position or results of operations of the company.

    The  company or its subsidiaries have  other financial guarantees related to
business activities in  the United Kingdom,  but management believes  it is  not
probable that such guarantees will be called.

    ENVIRONMENTAL.    The  company  is subject  to  various  environmental laws,
including regulations  governing  air and  water  quality and  the  storage  and
disposal  of  hazardous or  toxic wastes.  The company  assesses, on  an ongoing
basis, measures  to  ensure compliance  with  laws and  regulations  related  to
hazardous materials and hazardous waste compliance and remediation activities.

                                       54

    The  company owns or  previously operated 29  former manufactured gas plants
(MGPs) which may, or  may not, require some  form of environmental  remediation.
The  company has contacted appropriate federal and  state agencies and is in the
process of determining what, if any,  specific cleanup activities may be  needed
at these sites.

    As  of December 31,  1995, the company has  spent approximately $7.0 million
for investigating and remediating its MGP sites. The company currently estimates
that it will spend a minimum of approximately $6.2 million over the next several
years on  the  company's  identified  MGP  sites.  These  amounts  could  change
materially  based  upon  further investigations,  the  actions  of environmental
agencies and the financial viability of other responsible parties. Additionally,
the ultimate liability  may be  significantly affected  if the  company is  held
responsible for parties not financially able to contribute to these costs. Based
on  prior experience, available facts and existing law, the company has recorded
a liability  of  $6.2  million  representing  its  estimate  of  the  amount  of
environmental costs currently expected to be incurred.

    The  company  has  received  favorable  rate  orders  for  recovery  of  its
environmental cleanup costs  in certain jurisdictions.  In other  jurisdictions,
favorable  regulatory  precedent exists  for the  recovery  of these  costs. The
company is also pursuing recovery from insurance carriers and other  potentially
responsible parties.

    It   is  management's  opinion   that  the  ultimate   resolution  of  these
environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact upon the financial
position or results of operations of the company.

    OTHER.  The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which
arise in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  operations.  In  the  opinion  of
management, the amount of liability, if any, with respect to these actions would
not  materially affect the consolidated financial position of the company or its
results of operations.

              NOTE 15: FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

    Cash and cash  equivalents and  short-term debt  are carried  at cost  which
approximates  fair  value.  The  fair value  of  long-term  debt  and redeemable
preference stock is  estimated based  on quoted market  prices for  the same  or
similar  issues or  on the  current rates  offered for  instruments of  the same
remaining maturities.

    Because a substantial portion of the company's operations are regulated, the
company believes that any gains or losses  related to the retirement of debt  or
redemption of preference stock would not have a material effect on the company's
financial position or results of operations.

(b)  The sum of  the quarterly primary  earnings per share  amounts differs from
    that reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income due to the weighting
    of common shares outstanding during each of the respective periods.

(c) The sum of  the quarterly fully diluted  earnings per share amounts  differs
    from  that reflected  in the Consolidated  Statements of  Income because the
    company's convertible  securities were  anti-dilutive in  certain  quarterly

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

    The  management of UtiliCorp United Inc.  is responsible for the information
that appears in  this annual  report, including its  accuracy. The  accompanying
Consolidated  Financial Statements  were prepared  in accordance  with generally
accepted accounting principles. In addition to selecting appropriate  accounting
principles, management is responsible for the manner of presentation and for the
reliability  of  the  information.  In  fulfilling  this  responsibility,  it is
necessary  for  management  to  make  estimates  based  on  currently  available
information and judgments of current conditions and circumstances.

    Through  well-developed  systems of  internal  control, management  seeks to
assure the integrity and objectivity  of the consolidated financial  information
contained  herein. These  systems of  internal control  are designed  to provide
reasonable assurance that the assets of the company are safeguarded and that the
transactions are executed  to management's authorizations,  and are recorded  in
accordance with the appropriate accounting principles.

    The  Board of Directors participates  in the financial information reporting
process through its Audit Committee,  which selects the independent  accountants
and  reviews,  along  with  management, the  company's  financial  reporting and
internal accounting controls, policies, and practices.

                                          Richard C. Green, Jr.
                                          Chairman of the Board and

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
      TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF UTILICORP UNITED INC.:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and  statements
of  preferred and preference stock of  UtiliCorp United Inc. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 1995,  1994 and  1993 and  the related  consolidated statements  of
income,  common shareowners'  equity, and  cash flows  for the  three years then
ended. These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of  the  company's
management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also included
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all  material respects,  the  consolidated financial  position  of UtiliCorp
United Inc.  and subsidiaries  at December  31,  1995, 1994  and 1993,  and  the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    As  explained in Note 3 to  the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1995,  the company changed  its method of  accounting for price  risk
management  activities. As  explained in  Note 7  to the  consolidated financial
statements, in 1995 the company changed  its method of assessing the  impairment
of long-lived assets.

                          FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

    We  have audited in  accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements for 1995, 1994 and 1993 described on  page
59  of UtiliCorp United Inc.'s  Annual Report on Form  10-K, and have issued our
report thereon dated February 6, 1996. Our  audits were made for the purpose  of
forming  an  opinion  on  those  statements  taken  as  a  whole.  The Financial
Statements Schedule  listed in  Item 14(a)2  is presented  for the  purposes  of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the  basic  financial  statements and,  in  our  opinion, fairly  states  in all
material respects  the  financial data  required  to  be set  forth  therein  in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

any provision of this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee an

SECTION 103.  FORM OF DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO TRUSTEE.

            In any case where several matters are required to be certified by,
or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all
such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

            Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be
based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of,
or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations

applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and
form one instrument.


SECTION 104.  ACTS OF HOLDERS.

waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by
Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of
substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in Person or by agent duly
appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such
action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered
to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company.

            Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and
evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders
signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of
the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless otherwise
established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or set forth or determined in
an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental
hereto, pursuant to Section 301, a Holder, including a Depository that is a
Holder of a Global Debenture, may make, give or take, by a proxy, or proxies,
duly appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided in this Indenture to be made,
given or taken by Holders, and a Depository that is a Holder of a Global
Debenture may provide its proxy or proxies to the beneficial owners of interests
in any such Global Debenture through such Depository's standing instructions and
customary practices.

            (b)  The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument, writing or proxy may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by
law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument, writing or proxy acknowledged to him the execution thereof.
Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his
individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute
sufficient proof of his authority.  The fact and date of the execution of any
such instrument, writing or proxy, or the authority of the Person executing the
same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

            (c)  The ownership of Debentures shall be proved by the Debenture
Register.

            (d)  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Debenture shall bind every future
Holder of the same Debenture and the Holder of every Debenture issued upon the
registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon
such Debenture.

            (e)   If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of any series
any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination
of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no
obligation to do so.  If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given
before or after the record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of
business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of
determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of outstanding
Debentures of that series have authorized or agreed


                                        10
<PAGE>



or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action, and for that purpose the outstanding Debentures of that
series shall be computed as of the record date; provided that no such
authorization, agreement or consent by such Holders on the record date shall be
deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of
this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.


SECTION 105.  NOTICES, ETC., TO TRUSTEE AND COMPANY.

            Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

            (1)  the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
      for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing
      to or with the Trustee upon receipt at its Corporate Trust Office, or

            (2)  the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
      for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
      if in writing and mailed, first-class mail postage prepaid, to the Company
      addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the
      first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously
      furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.


SECTION 106.  NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER.

            Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event,
such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly
provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder
affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Debenture Register,
not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date,
prescribed for the giving of such notice.  In any case where notice to Holders
is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Holders.  Where this Indenture provides for notice
in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with
the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity
of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

            In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by
reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable


                                        11
<PAGE>



to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the
approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every
purpose hereunder.


SECTION 107.  CONFLICT WITH TRUST INDENTURE ACT.

            If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits,
qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by Sections 310 to 317,
inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act, such imposed duties shall control.


SECTION 108.  EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.

            The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents
are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.


SECTION 109.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

            All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall
bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.


SECTION 110.  SEPARABILITY CLAUSE.

            In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Debentures shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.


SECTION 111.  BENEFITS OF INDENTURE.

            Nothing in this Indenture or in the Debentures, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors
hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under this Indenture.


SECTION 112.  GOVERNING LAW.

            This Indenture and the Debentures shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 113.  LEGAL HOLIDAYS.

            In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or
Stated Maturity of any Debenture shall not be a Business Day, then
(notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Debentures)
payment of interest, if any, or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made
on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place
of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment
Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest
shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date,
Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be except that, if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made
on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on such date.

indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions,
omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by
this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of

required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may,
consistently herewith, be determined by the officer or officers executing such
Debentures, as evidenced by the officer's or officers' execution of the
Debentures.  If the form of Debentures of any series is established by action
taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such

Company, or any other authorized officer of the Company, and delivered to the
Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section
303 for the authentication and delivery of such Debentures.

            The Trustee's certificates of authentication shall be in
substantially the form set forth in this Article.

            The definitive Debentures shall be printed, lithographed or engraved
on steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as
determined by the officer or officers executing such Debentures, as evidenced by
the officer's or officers' execution of such Debentures.

      and except for any Debentures which, pursuant to Section 303, are deemed
      never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder);

            (3)  the Person to whom any interest on a Debenture of the series
      shall be payable, if other than the Person in whose name the Debenture (or
      one or more Predecessor Debentures) is registered at the close of business
      on the regular Record Date for such interest;

            (4)   the date or dates on which the principal of the Debentures of
      the series is payable;

            (5)   the rate or rates at which the Debentures of the series shall

      Payment Date;

            (6)   the right, if any, to extend the interest payment periods and
      the duration of such extension;

      which and the terms and conditions upon which Debentures of the series may
      be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company;


            (9)   the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem or purchase
      Debentures of the series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous
      provisions or at the option of a Holder thereof, and the period or periods
      within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions
      upon which Debentures of the series shall be redeemed or purchased, in
      whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;

            (10)  the form of the Debentures of the series including the form of

      principal amount of Debentures of the series which shall be payable upon
      declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section
      502;

            (13)  if other than such coin or currency of the United States of
      America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public or
      private debts, the coin or currency, including composite currencies such

      shall be payable;

            (14)  if the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any,
      on the Debentures of the series are to be payable, at the election of the

      within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such election may
      be made;

            (15)  if the amount of payments of principal of and premium, if any,
      or interest, if any, on the Debentures of the series may be determined
      with reference to an index based on a coin or currency other than that in
      which the Debentures are stated to be payable, the manner in which such
      amounts shall be determined;



                                        15
<PAGE>



            (16)  any provisions permitted by this Indenture relating to Events
      of Default or covenants of the Company with respect to such series of
      Debentures; and

            (17)  if the Debentures of the series shall be issued in whole or in
      part in the form of one or more Global Debentures, (i) whether beneficial
      owners of interests in any such Global Debenture may exchange such
      interests for Debentures of such series of like tenor and of authorized
      form and denomination and the circumstances under which any such changes
      may occur, if other than in the manner provided in Section 305 and (ii)
      the Depository for such Global Debenture or Debentures; and

            (18)  any and all other terms of the series (which terms shall not
      be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture).

            All Debentures of any one series shall be substantially identical
except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant
to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth
in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture
supplemental hereto.

            If any of the terms of the series, including the form of Debenture
of such series, are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution,
a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or other authorized officer of the Company,
and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order
contemplated by Section 303 for the authentication and delivery of such series
of Debentures.


SECTION 302.  DENOMINATIONS.

            The Debentures of each series shall be issuable in registered form
without coupons, except as otherwise expressly provided in a supplemental
indenture hereto, in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by
Section 301.  In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the
Debentures of any series, the Debentures of such series shall be issuable in
denominations of $25 or in integral multiples thereof.


SECTION 303.  EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING.

            The Debentures shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its
Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its
corporate seal reproduced thereon, and which need not be attested.  The
Debentures of any series shall be executed by such additional officer, if any,
as shall be


                                        16
<PAGE>



specified pursuant to Section 301.  The signature of any of these officers on
the Debentures may be manual or facsimile.

            Debentures bearing the manual or facsimile signature of any
individual who was at any time the proper officer of the Company shall bind the
Company, notwithstanding that such individual has ceased to hold such office
prior to the authentication and delivery of such Debentures or did not hold such
office at the date of authentication of such Debentures.

            At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery
of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debentures of any series executed by
the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for
the authentication and delivery of such Debentures, and the Trustee in
accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Debentures.  If the form or terms of the Debentures of the series have been
established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by
Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Debentures, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debentures,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,

            (a)  if the form of such Debentures has been established by or
      pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form
      has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

            (b)  if the terms of such Debentures have been established by or
      pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms
      have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
      and

            (c)  that such Debentures, when authenticated and delivered by the
      Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any
      conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and
      legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with
      their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
      laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
      creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Debentures if the issue of such Debentures
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties,
protections or immunities under the Debentures and this Indenture or otherwise
in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

            Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding
paragraph, if all Debentures of a series are not to


                                        17
<PAGE>



be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the
Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company
Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding
paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Debenture of such
series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the time of authentication
upon original issuance of the first Debenture of such series to be issued.

            Each Debenture shall be dated the date of its authentication.

            No Debenture shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture
or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Debenture
a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any
Debenture shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Debenture has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Debenture
shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold
by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Debenture to the Trustee for
cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which
need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of
Counsel) stating that such Debenture has never been issued and sold by the
Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Debenture shall be deemed never
to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture.


SECTION 304.  TEMPORARY DEBENTURES.

            Pending the preparation of definitive Debentures of any series, the
Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, temporary Debentures which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Debentures in lieu of which they
are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and
other variations as the officer or officers executing such Debentures may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Debentures.

            If temporary Debentures of any series are issued, the Company will
cause definitive Debentures of that series to be prepared without unreasonable
delay.  After the preparation of definitive Debentures of such series, the
temporary Debentures of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive
Debentures of such series upon surrender of the temporary Debentures of such
series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that
series, without charge to the Holder.  Upon


                                        18
<PAGE>



surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debentures of any series
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Debentures of the same
series and of like tenor of authorized denominations.  Until so exchanged the
temporary Debentures of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debentures of such series.


SECTION 305.      REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.

            The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other
office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes
collectively referred to as the "Debenture Register") in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the
registration of Debentures and of transfers of Debentures.  The Trustee is
hereby appointed "Debenture Registrar" for the purpose of registering Debentures
and transfers of Debentures as herein provided.

            Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Debenture of any
series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Debentures of
the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and tenor.

            At the option of the Holder, any Debenture or Debentures of any
series, other than a Global Debenture may be exchanged for other Debentures of
the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Debentures to be exchanged at
such office or agency.  Whenever any Debentures are so surrendered for exchange,
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the
Debentures which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

            All Debentures issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange
of Debentures shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debentures
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, a Global Debenture of any series shall be
exchangeable pursuant to this Section for Debentures registered in the names of
Persons other than the Depository with respect to such series or its nominee
only as provided in this paragraph.  A Global Debenture shall be


                                        19
<PAGE>



exchangeable pursuant to this Section if (x) such Depository notifies the
Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such series
or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a successor Depository for such series is
not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such
notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, (y) the Company
executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate providing that
such Global Debenture shall be so exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred
and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures of such
series.  Debentures so issued in exchange for a Global Debenture shall be of the
same series, of like tenor, in authorized denominations and in the aggregate
having the same principal amount as the Global Debenture to be exchanged, and
shall be registered in such names as the Depository for such Global Debenture
shall direct.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Global
Debenture may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a
nominee of such Depository or by a nominee of such Depository to such Depository
or another nominee of such Depository or by such Depository or any nominee to a
successor of such Depository or a nominee of such successor.

            Every Debenture presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be
duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Debenture Registrar duly executed, by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

            No service charge shall be made to the Holder for any registration
of transfer or exchange of Debentures, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures, other
than exchanges pursuant to Sections 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer,
including any penalty for failure to provide requested tax information.

            The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the
transfer of or exchange Debentures of any series during a period beginning at
the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of
redemption of Debentures of that series selected for redemption under Section
1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to
register the transfer of or exchange any Debenture so selected for redemption in
whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Debenture being redeemed
in part.

SECTION 306.      MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN DEBENTURES.

            If any mutilated Debenture is surrendered to the Trustee, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a new Debenture of the same series and of like tenor and principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

            If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Debenture and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save
each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Debenture has been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen
Debenture, a new Debenture of the same series and of like tenor and principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

            In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture has
become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Debenture, pay such Debenture.

            Upon the issuance of any new Debenture under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

            Every new Debenture of any series issued pursuant to this Section in
lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed,
lost or stolen Debenture shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall
be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately
with any and all other Debentures of that series duly issued hereunder.

            The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures.


SECTION 307.      PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED.

            Interest on any Debenture which is payable, and is punctually paid
or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person
in whose name that Debenture (or one or more Predecessor Debentures) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest.

            Any interest on any Debenture of any series which is payable, but is
not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and
such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

            (1)  The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest
      to the Persons in whose names the Debentures of such series (or their
      respective Predecessor Debentures) are registered at the close of business
      on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
      shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Company shall notify the
      Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid
      on each Debenture of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and
      at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
      money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such
      Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
      for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money
      when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
      to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided.   Thereupon the
      Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
      Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days
      prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after
      the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.  The
      Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and,
      in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
      proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date
      therefor to be mailed, first-class mail postage prepaid, to each Holder of
      Debentures of such series at his address as it appears in the Debenture
      Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice
      of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record
      Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid
      to the Persons in whose names the Debentures of such series (or their
      respective Predecessor Debentures) are registered at the close of business
      on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the
      following Clause (2).

            (2)  The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
      Debentures of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
      the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Debentures may
      be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
      after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
      pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed
      practicable by the Trustee.

            Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debenture
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Debenture shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debenture.


SECTION 308.  PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS.

            Prior to due presentment of a Debenture for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such Debenture is registered in the Debenture
Register maintained by the Trustee as the owner of such Debenture for the
purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject
to Section 307) interest, if any, on such Debenture and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Debenture be overdue, and neither the Company,
the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.  All such payments so made to any such Person, or upon
such Person's order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sums so paid,
effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any
such Debenture.

            No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Debenture held on
its behalf by a Depository shall have any rights under this Indenture with
respect to such Global Debenture, and such Depository may be treated by the
Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee as the
owner of such Global Debenture for all purposes whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall impair, as between a Depository and such holders
of beneficial interests, the operation of customary practices governing the
exercise of the rights of the Depository as holder of any Debenture.


SECTION 309.  CANCELLATION.

            All Debentures surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of
transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee
and shall be promptly cancelled by it.  The Company may at any time deliver to
the Trustee for cancellation any Debentures previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and all Debentures so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee.  No Debentures shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any
Debentures cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted
by this Indenture.  All cancelled Debentures held by the Trustee shall be
disposed of as directed by a Company Order and in accordance with Securities and
Exchange Commission or other applicable regulation pertaining to retention of
cancelled securities.

SECTION 310.      COMPUTATION OF INTEREST.

            Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Debentures of any series, interest, if any, on the Debentures of each series
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

            (1)  either (A) all Debentures theretofore authenticated and
      delivered (other than (i) Debentures which have been destroyed, lost or
      stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and

      trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid
      to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003)
      have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

            (B) all such Debentures not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
      cancellation

                    (i)  have become due and payable, or

                   (ii)  will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity

            Company, or

                  (iv)  are deemed paid and discharged pursuant to Section 403,

      or (iii) above and (except as provided in an indenture supplemental


                                        24

      hereto) if no Debentures of any series Outstanding are subject to
      repurchase at the option of Holders (I) U.S. Government Obligations
      (denominated in the same currency or units of currency in which such
      Debentures are payable) which through the payment of interest and
      principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide
      not later than one day before the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as
      the case may be, money in an amount, or (II) a combination of money or
      U.S. Government Obligations as provided in (I) above, in each case,
      sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Debentures
      not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal
      (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, to the date of such deposit
      (in the case of Debentures which have become due and payable) or to the
      Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;

            (2)  the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
      payable hereunder by the Company; and

            (3)  the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
      Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
      precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge
      of this Indenture have been complied with.

            Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture,
the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations
of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall
have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of
this Section or if money or U.S. Government Obligations shall have been
deposited with or received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 403, the
obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section
1003 shall survive.


SECTION 402.  APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY.

            (a)  Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section
1003, all money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee
pursuant to Section 401, 403 or 1008 and all money received by the Trustee in
respect of U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to
Section 401, 403 or 1008, shall be held in trust and applied by it, in

principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, for whose payment such
money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee or to make mandatory

provided in Section 401, 403 or 1008 which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are then in excess of
the amount thereof which then would have been required to be deposited for the
purpose for which such U.S. Government Obligations or money was deposited or
received.  This provision shall not authorize the sale by the Trustee of any
U.S. Government Obligations held under this Indenture.


SECTION 403.  SATISFACTION, DISCHARGE AND DEFEASANCE OF
                DEBENTURES OF ANY SERIES.

such series, shall no longer be in effect (and the Trustee, at the expense of
the Company, shall at Company Request execute proper instruments acknowledging
the same), except as to:

      security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of the
      Debentures of such series, (i) money, in the currency or units of currency
      in which such Debentures are payable, in an amount, or (ii) (except as

      or units of currency in which such Debentures are payable) which through
      the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance
      with their terms will provide not later than one day before the due date
      of any payment referred to in clause (x) or (y) of this subparagraph (e)

      the Company in furtherance of any such action; or


            (7)   so long as any series of Debentures issued in connection with
      the application of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of a series of

SECTION 502.      ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT.

            If an Event of Default with respect to Debentures of any series at
the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Debentures of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if
any of the Debentures of that series are Original Issue Discount Debentures,
such portion of the principal amount of such Debentures as may be specified in
the terms thereof) of all of the Debentures of that series to be due and payable
immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given
by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified
amount) shall become immediately due and payable.

            At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Debentures of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Debentures of that series, by written notice to the Company and


                                        30
<PAGE>



the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if

            (1)   the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
      sufficient to pay

                  (A)   all overdue interest, if any, on all Debentures of that
            series,

                  (B)   the principal of and premium, if any, on any Debentures
            of that series which have become due otherwise than by such
            declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or
            rates prescribed therefor in such Debentures,

                  (C)   to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
            interest upon any overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed
            therefor in such Debentures, and

                  (D)   all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and
            the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
            the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and

            (2)   all Events of Default with respect to Debentures of that
      series, other than the non-payment of the principal of and accrued
      interest on Debentures of that series which have become due solely by such
      declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in
      Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.


            For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal
of any Original Issue Discount Debentures shall have been accelerated and
declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after
such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the
principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Debentures shall be deemed, for
all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be
due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of
the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such
acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts
owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue
Discount Debentures.

SECTION 503.      COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY
                  TRUSTEE.

            The Company covenants that if

            (1)   default is made in the payment of any interest on any
      Debenture when such interest becomes due and payable, or in any payment
      required by any sinking fund with respect to that series, and such default
      continues for a period of 10 days, or

            (2)   default is made in the payment of the principal of or premium,
      if any, on any Debenture at the Maturity, upon redemption, by declaration
      or otherwise, thereof,

the Company will, upon written demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit
of the Holders of such Debentures, the whole amount then due and payable on such
Debentures for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and, to the
extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on
any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the
rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Debentures, and, in addition thereto,
such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

            If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,
the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon such Debentures and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of
the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Debentures, wherever
situated.

            If any Event of Default with respect to Debentures of any series
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect
and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debentures of such
series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights.


SECTION 504.  TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

            In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Debentures or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of


                                        32
<PAGE>



the Debentures shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made
any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise,

                  (i)   to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
            principal (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in
            respect of the Debentures and to file such other papers or documents
            as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
            Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
            expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
            counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and

                  (ii)  to collect and receive any moneys or other property
            payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
            same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to
pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

            Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debentures
or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.


SECTION 505.      TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF DEBENTURES.

            All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Debentures may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession
of any of the Debentures or the production thereof in any proceeding relating
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in
its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall,
after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders of the Debentures in respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.

presentation of the Debentures and the notation thereon of the payment if only
partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

            FIRST:  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section

      of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to
      the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee and to the
      extent permitted by law) upon the overdue installments of interest at the
      rate prescribed therefor in such Debentures, such payments to be made
      ratably to the Persons entitled thereto, without discrimination or
      preference;

            THIRD:  In case the principal or premium, if any, of the Debentures
      of such series in respect of which moneys have been collected shall have
      become and shall be then due and payable, to the payment of the whole
      amount then owing and unpaid upon all the Debentures of such series for
      principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, with interest upon
      the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such
      interest has been collected by the Trustee and to the extent permitted by
      law) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate prescribed therefor
      in the Debentures of such series; and in case such moneys shall be
      insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon the
      Debentures of such series, then to the payment of such principal and any
      premium and interest, without preference or priority of principal over
      interest, or of interest over principal or premium, or of any installment
      of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Debenture of
      such series over any other Debenture of such series, ratably to the
      aggregate of such principal and any premium and accrued and unpaid
      interest; and

            FOURTH:  To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or
      any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.

SECTION 507.  LIMITATION ON SUITS.

            No Holder of any Debenture of any series shall have any right to
institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture,
or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless

            (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee
      of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Debentures of that
      series;

            (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
      Outstanding Debentures of that series shall have made written request to
      the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default
      in its own name as Trustee hereunder;

            (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
      indemnity agreeable to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and
      liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

            (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
      request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
      proceeding; and

            (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
      given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
      majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such
Holders.


SECTION 508.      UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM
                  AND INTEREST.

            Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Debenture shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to
Section 307) interest, if any, on such Debenture on the Stated Maturity or
Maturities expressed in such Debenture (or, in the case of redemption, on the
Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment,
and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

<PAGE>



SECTION 509.  RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

            If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any
determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue
as though no such proceeding had been instituted.


SECTION 510.  RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

            Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures in the last paragraph
of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the
Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or
remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or
employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 511.  DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER.

            No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Debentures to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Default or Event of
Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by
this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from
time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Holders, as the case may be.


SECTION 512.  CONTROL BY HOLDERS.

            The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Debentures of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the
Debentures of such series, PROVIDED that

            (1)  such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
      with this Indenture, and



                                        36
<PAGE>



            (2)  the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
      Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.


SECTION 513.  WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.

            The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Debentures of any series affected thereby may on
behalf of the Holders of all the Debentures of such series waive any past
default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a
default

            (1)  in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or
      interest, if any, on any Debenture of such series, or

            (2)  in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under
      Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
      Holder of each Outstanding Debenture of such series affected.

            Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon.


SECTION 514.  UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS.

            All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any
Debenture by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any
court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any
right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any
action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in
such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court
may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits
and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the
provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in
the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures of
any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the
payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any
Debenture on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such
Debenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 515.      WAIVER OF STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS.

            The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so)
that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever
claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law
and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.


                                  ARTICLE SIX

                                  THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 601.      CERTAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

            (a)  Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with
respect to the Debentures of any series,

            (1)  the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such
      duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied
      covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the
      Trustee; and

            (2)  in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
      conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
      of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished
      to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but
      in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision
      hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the
      Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or
      not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

            (b)   In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

            (c)   No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve
the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that

            (1)   this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of
      Subsection (a) of this Section;



                                        38
<PAGE>



            (2)   the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
      in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the
      Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

            (3)   the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
      taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
      direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
      Outstanding Debentures of any series, determined as provided in Section
      512, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
      for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
      conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the
      Debentures of such series; and

            (4)   no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to
      expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
      the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any
      of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing
      that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or
      liability is not reasonably assured to it.

            (d)   Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision
of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section.


SECTION 602.  NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.

            Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with
respect to the Debentures of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail,
first class postage prepaid, to all Holders of Debentures of such series, as
their names and addresses appear in the Debenture Register, notice of such
default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been
cured or waived; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of a default in
the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any
Debenture of such series or in the payment of any sinking fund installment with
respect to Debentures of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in
withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive
committee or a trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the
Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the
interest of the Holders of Debentures of such series; and PROVIDED, FURTHER,
that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4)
with respect to Debentures of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be
given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.  For the purpose of
this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or
lapse of


                                        39

hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

            (e)   the Trustee shall be under no obligation to expend or risk its
own funds or to exercise, at the request or direction of any of the Holders, any
of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture pursuant to this
Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or
direction;

determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled
upon reasonable request to


                                        40

examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent

or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it
hereunder.

            (h)   the permissive right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in
this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty.


SECTION 604.      NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF DEBENTURES.

            The recitals contained herein and in the Debentures, except the
Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of
the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any
responsibility for their correctness.  The Trustee makes no representations as
to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Debentures.  Neither
the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or
application by the Company of Debentures or the proceeds thereof.


SECTION 605.  MAY HOLD DEBENTURES.

                                        41

      provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
      trust);

            (2)   except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse

      provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the
      expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel, which compensation,

      with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

            (b)   The obligations of the Company under this Section to
compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for
expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness
hereunder.  Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to
that of the Debentures upon all property and funds held or collected by the
Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of
particular Debentures.


SECTION 608.  DISQUALIFICATION; CONFLICTING INTERESTS.

            (a)   If the Trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest,
as defined in this Section, with respect to the Debentures of any series, and if
the default to which such conflicting interest relates has not been cured, duly
waived or otherwise eliminated, within 90 days after ascertaining that it has
such conflicting interest, it shall either eliminate such conflicting interest,
except as otherwise provided herein, or resign with respect to the Debentures of
that series in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this
Article and the Company shall promptly appoint a Successor Trustee in the manner
provided herein.

            (b)   In the event that the Trustee shall fail to comply with the
provisions of subsection (a) of this Section with respect to the Debentures of
any series, the Trustee shall, within 10 days after the expiration of such
90-day period, transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, to all Holders of
Debentures of that series, as their names and addresses appear in the Debenture
Register, notice of such failure.


                                        42

            (c)   For the purposes of this Section, the Trustee shall be deemed
to have a conflicting interest with respect to the Debentures of any series if a
default has occurred and is continuing and:

            (1)   the Trustee is trustee under this Indenture with respect to
      the Outstanding Debentures of any series other than that series or is
      trustee under another indenture under which any other securities, or
      certificates of interest or participation in any other securities, of the
      Company are outstanding, unless such other indenture is a collateral trust
      indenture under which the only collateral consists of Debentures issued
      under this Indenture, PROVIDED that there shall be excluded from the
      operation of this paragraph this Indenture with respect to the
      Debentures of any series other than that series or any indenture or
      indentures under which other securities, or certificates of interest or
      participation in other securities, of the Company are outstanding, if

                  (i)   this Indenture and such other indenture or indentures
            are wholly unsecured and rank equally and such other indenture or
            indentures (and such series) are hereafter qualified under the Trust
            Indenture Act, unless the Commission shall have found and declared
            by order pursuant to Section 305(b) or Section 307(c) of the Trust
            Indenture Act that differences exist between the provisions of this
            Indenture with respect to Debentures of that series and one or more
            other series or the provisions of such other indenture or indentures
            (or such series) which are so likely to involve a material conflict
            of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest or for
            the protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee from acting as
            such under this Indenture with respect to the Debentures of that
            series and such other series or under such other indenture or
            indentures, or

                  (ii)  the Company shall have sustained the burden of proving,
            on application to the Commission and after opportunity for hearing
            thereon, that trusteeship under this Indenture with respect to the
            Debentures of that series and such other series or such other
            indenture or indentures is not so likely to involve a material
            conflict of interest as to make it necessary in the public interest
            or for the protection of investors to disqualify the Trustee from
            acting as such under this Indenture with respect to the Debentures
            of that series and such other series or under such other indenture
            or indentures;

            (2)   the Trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is
      an underwriter for the Company;



                                        43
<PAGE>



            (3)   the Trustee directly or indirectly controls or is directly or
      indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect common control
      with the Company or an underwriter for the Company;

            (4)   the Trustee or any of its directors or executive officers is a
      director, officer, partner, employee, appointee or representative of the
      Company, or of an underwriter (other than the Trustee itself) of the
      Company who is currently engaged in the business of underwriting, except
      that (i) one individual may be a director or an executive officer, or
      both, of the Trustee and a director or an executive officer, or both, of
      the Company, but may not be at the same time an executive officer of both
      the Trustee and the Company; (ii) if and so long as the number of
      directors of the Trustee in office is more than nine, one additional
      individual may be a director or an executive officer, or both, of the
      Trustee and a director of the Company; and (iii) the Trustee may be
      designated by the Company or by an underwriter for the Company to act in
      the capacity of transfer agent, registrar, custodian, paying agent, fiscal
      agent, escrow agent or depository, or in any other similar capacity, or,
      subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Subsection, to act as
      trustee, whether under an indenture or otherwise;

            (5)   10% or more of the voting securities of the Trustee is
      beneficially owned either by the Company or by any director, partner or
      executive officer thereof, or 20% or more of such voting securities is
      beneficially owned, collectively, by any two or more of such Persons; or
      10% or more of the voting securities of the Trustee is beneficially owned
      either by an underwriter for the Company or by any director, partner or
      executive officer thereof, or is beneficially owned, collectively, by any
      two or more such Persons;

            (6)   the Trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral
      security for an obligation which is in default (as hereinafter in this
      Subsection defined), (i) 5% or more of the voting securities, or 10% or
      more of any other class of security, of the Company, not including the
      Debentures issued under this Indenture and securities issued under any
      other indenture under which the Trustee is also trustee, or (ii) 10% or
      more of any class of security of an underwriter for the Company;

            (7)   the Trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral
      security for an obligation which is in default (as hereinafter in this
      Subsection defined), 5% or more of the voting securities of any Person
      who, to the knowledge of the Trustee, owns 10% or more of the voting
      securities of, or controls directly or indirectly or is under direct or
      indirect common control with, the Company;


                                        44
<PAGE>



            (8)   the Trustee is the beneficial owner of, or holds as collateral
      security for an obligation which is in default (as hereinafter in this
      Subsection defined), 10% or more of any class of security of any Person
      who, to the knowledge of the Trustee, owns 50% or more of the voting
      securities of the Company;

            (9)   the Trustee owns, on the date of default upon the Debentures
      of any series or any anniversary of such default while such default upon
      the Debentures issued under this Indenture remains outstanding, in the
      capacity of executor, administrator, testamentary or INTER VIVOS
      trustee, guardian, committee or conservator, or in any other similar
      capacity, an aggregate of 25% or more of the voting securities, or of any
      class of security, of any Person, the beneficial ownership of a specified
      percentage of which would have constituted a conflicting interest under
      paragraph (6), (7) or (8) of this Subsection.  As to any such securities
      of which the Trustee acquired ownership through becoming executor,
      administrator or testamentary trustee of an estate which included them,
      the provisions of the preceding sentence shall not apply, for a period of
      two years from the date of such acquisition, to the extent that such
      securities included in such estate do not exceed 25% of such voting
      securities or 25% of any such class of security.  Promptly after the dates
      of any default upon the Debentures issued under this Indenture and
      annually in each succeeding year that the Debentures issued under this
      Indenture remain in default, the Trustee shall make a check of its
      holdings of such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of
      such dates.  If the Company fails to make payment in full of the principal
      of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any of the Debentures when
      and as the same becomes due and payable, and such failure continues for 30
      days thereafter, the Trustee shall make a prompt check of its holdings of
      such securities in any of the above-mentioned capacities as of the date of
      the expiration of such 30-day period, and after such date, notwithstanding
      the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, all such securities so held by
      the Trustee, with sole or joint control over such securities vested in it,
      shall, but only so long as such failure shall continue, be considered as
      though beneficially owned by the Trustee for the purposes of paragraphs
      (6), (7) and (8) of this Subsection; or

            (10)  except under the circumstances described in paragraphs (1),
      (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this Subsection, the Trustee shall be or shall
      become a creditor of the Company.

      For purposes of paragraph (1) of this Subsection, and of Section 513, the
term "series of securities" or "series" means a series, class or group of
securities issuable under an indenture pursuant to whose terms holders of one
such series may vote to direct the indenture trustee, or otherwise take action
pursuant


                                        45
<PAGE>



to a vote of such holders, separately from holders of another such series;
provided, that "series of securities" or "series" shall not include any series
of securities issuable under an indenture if all such series rank equally and
are wholly unsecured.

            The specification of percentages in paragraphs (5) to (9),
inclusive, of this Subsection shall not be construed as indicating that the
ownership of such percentages of the securities of a person is or is not
necessary or sufficient to constitute direct or indirect control for the
purposes of paragraph (3) or (7) of this Subsection.

            For the purposes of paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (9) of this
Subsection only, (i) the terms "security" and "securities" shall include only
such securities as are generally known as corporate securities, but shall not
include any note or other evidence of indebtedness issued to evidence an
obligation to repay moneys lent to a person by one or more banks, trust
companies or banking firms, or any certificate of interest or participation in
any such note or evidence of indebtedness; (ii) an obligation shall be deemed to
be "in default" when a default in payment of principal shall have continued for
30 days or more and shall not have been cured; and (iii) the Trustee shall not
be deemed to be the owner or holder of (A) any security which it holds as
collateral security, as trustee or otherwise, for an obligation which is not in
default as defined in clause (ii) above, or (B) any security which it holds as
collateral security under this Indenture, irrespective of any default hereunder,
or (C) any security which it holds as agent for collection, or as custodian,
escrow agent or depository, or in any similar representative capacity.

            (d)   For the purposes of this Section:

            (1)   The term "underwriter", when used with reference to the
      Company, means every person who, within one year prior to the time as of
      which the determination is made, has purchased from the Company with a
      view to, or has offered or sold for the Company in connection with, the
      distribution of any security of the Company outstanding at such time, or
      has participated or has had a direct or indirect participation in any such
      undertaking, or has participated or has had a participation in the direct
      or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking, but such term shall not
      include a person whose interest was limited to a commission from an
      underwriter or dealer not in excess of the usual and customary
      distributors' or sellers' commission.

            (2)   The term "director" means any director of a corporation or any
      individual performing similar functions with respect to any organization,
      whether incorporated or unincorporated.



                                        46
<PAGE>



            (3)   The term "person" means an individual, a corporation, a
      partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, a trust, an
      unincorporated organization or a government or political subdivision
      thereof.  As used in this paragraph, the term "trust" shall include only a
      trust where the interest or interests of the beneficiary or beneficiaries
      are evidenced by a security.

            (4)   The term "voting security" means any security presently
      entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote in the direction or
      management of the affairs of a person, or any security issued under or
      pursuant to any trust, agreement or arrangement whereby a trustee or
      trustees or agent or agents for the owner or holder of such security are
      presently entitled to vote in the direction or management of the affairs
      of a person.

            (5)   The term "Company" means any obligor upon the Debentures.

            (6)   The term "executive officer" means the president, every vice
      president, every trust officer, the cashier, the secretary and the
      treasurer of a corporation, and any individual customarily performing
      similar functions with respect to any organization whether incorporated or
      unincorporated, but shall not include the chairman of the board of
      directors.

            (e)   The percentages of voting securities and other securities
specified in this Section shall be calculated in accordance with the following
provisions:

            (1)   A specified percentage of the voting securities of the
      Trustee, the Company or any other person referred to in this Section (each
      of whom is referred to as a "person" in this paragraph) means such amount
      of the outstanding voting securities of such person as entitles the holder
      or holders thereof to cast such specified percentage of the aggregate
      votes which the holders of all the outstanding voting securities of such
      person are entitled to cast in the direction or management of the affairs
      of such person.

            (2)   A specified percentage of a class of securities of a person
      means such percentage of the aggregate amount of securities of the class
      outstanding.

            (3)   The term "amount", when used in regard to securities, means
      the principal amount if relating to evidences of indebtedness, the number
      of shares if relating to capital shares and the number of units if
      relating to any other kind of security.

            (4)   The term "outstanding" means issued and not held by or for the
      account of the issuer.  The following


                                        47
<PAGE>



      securities shall not be deemed outstanding within the meaning of this
      definition:

                    (i) securities of an issuer held in a sinking fund relating
            to securities of the issuer of the same class;

                   (ii) securities of an issuer held in a sinking fund relating
            to another class of securities of the issuer, if the obligation
            evidenced by such other class of securities is not in default as to
            principal or interest or otherwise;

                  (iii) securities pledged by the issuer thereof as security for
            an obligation of the issuer not in default as to principal or
            interest or otherwise; and

                  (iv)  securities held in escrow if placed in escrow by the
            issuer thereof;

      PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any voting securities of an issuer shall be
      deemed outstanding if any person other than the issuer is entitled to
      exercise the voting rights thereof.

            (5)   A security shall be deemed to be of the same class as another
      security if both securities confer upon the holder or holders thereof
      substantially the same rights and privileges; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
      in the case of secured evidences of indebtedness, all of which are issued
      under a single indenture, differences in the interest rates or maturity
      dates of various series thereof shall not be deemed sufficient to
      constitute such series different classes and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that,
      in the case of unsecured evidences of indebtedness, differences in the
      interest rates or maturity dates thereof shall not be deemed sufficient to
      constitute them securities of different classes, whether or not they are
      issued under a single indenture.

            (f)   Except in the case of a default in the payment of the
principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debentures issued under
this Indenture, or in the payment of any sinking or analogous fund installment,
the Trustee shall not be required to resign as provided by this Subsection if
such Trustee shall have sustained the burden of proving, on application to the
Commission and after opportunity for hearing thereon, that (i) the default under
the Indenture may be cured or waived during a reasonable period and under the
procedures described in such application and (ii) a stay of the Trustee's duty
to resign will not be inconsistent wit the interests of the Holders.  The filing
of such an application shall automatically stay the performance of the duty to
resign until the Commission orders otherwise.



                                        48
<PAGE>



            Any resignation of the Trustee shall become effective upon the
appointment of a successor trustee and such successor's acceptance of such an
appointment.


SECTION 609.  CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY.

            There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of
America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such
laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus
of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
State authority.  If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital
and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.  The
Company may not, nor may any person directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee.  If
at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it shall resign promptly in the manner and with the
effect hereinafter specified in this Article.


SECTION 610.      RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.

            (a)   No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of
a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

            (b)   The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the
Debentures of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the
Company.  If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by
Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after
the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Debentures of such series.

            (c)   The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Debentures of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Debentures of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.

            (d)   If at any time:

            (1)   the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608(a) after
      written request therefor by the Company or by


                                        49
<PAGE>



      any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debenture for at least six
      months, or

            (2)   the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and
      shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by
      any such Holder, or

            (3)   the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
      adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
      property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
      control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
      rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,


then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Debentures, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Debenture for at least six months
may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all
Debentures and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

            (e)   If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with
respect to the Debentures of one or more series, the Company, by a Board
Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect
to the Debentures of that or those series (it being understood that any such
successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Debentures of one or more
or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with
respect to the Debentures of any particular series) and shall comply with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.  If, within one year after such
resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a
successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures of any series shall be
appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Debentures of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring
Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section
611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures of such series
and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.  If
no successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures of any series shall have
been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the
manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Debenture of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures of such
series.

<PAGE>



            (f)   The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Trustee with respect to the Debentures of any series and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures of any series
by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to
all Holders of Debentures of such series as their names and addresses appear in
the Debenture Register.  Each notice shall include the name of the successor
Trustee with respect to the Debentures of such series and the address of its
Corporate Trust Office.


SECTION 611.  ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR.

            (a)   In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee
with respect to all Debentures, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

            (b)   In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee
with respect to the Debentures of one or more (but not all) series, the Company,
the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures
of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debentures of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Debentures, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Debentures of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts

any other such

Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the
extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debentures of that or
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on
request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Debentures of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

            (c)   Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

            (d)   No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at
the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and
eligible under this Article.


SECTION 612.      MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS.

            Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, PROVIDED such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto.  In case any Debentures shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Debentures so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Debentures.


SECTION 613.      PREFERENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.

            (a)   Subject to Subsection (b) of this Section, if the Trustee
shall be or shall become a creditor, directly or indirectly, secured or
unsecured, of the Company within three months prior to a default, as defined in
Subsection (c) of this Section, or subsequent to such a default, then, unless
and until such default shall be cured, the Trustee shall set apart and hold in a
special account for the benefit of the Trustee individually,


                                        52
<PAGE>



the Holders of the Debentures and the holders of other indenture securities, as
defined in Subsection (c) of this Section:

            (1)   an amount equal to any and all reductions in the amount due
      and owing upon any claim as such creditor in respect of principal or
      interest, effected after the beginning of such three months' period and
      valid as against the Company and its other creditors, except any such
      reduction resulting from the receipt or disposition of any property
      described in paragraph (2) of this Subsection, or from the exercise of any
      right of set-off which the Trustee could have exercised if a petition in
      bankruptcy had been filed by or against the Company upon the date of such
      default; and

            (2)   all property received by the Trustee in respect of any claims
      as such creditor, either as security therefor, or in satisfaction or
      composition thereof, or otherwise, after the beginning of such three
      months' period, or an amount equal to the proceeds of any such property,
      if disposed of, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, to the rights, if any, of the
      Company and its other creditors in such property or such proceeds.

            Nothing herein contained, however, shall affect the right of the
Trustee:

            (A)   to retain for its own account (i) payments made on account of
      any such claim by any Person (other than the Company) who is liable
      thereon, and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by
      the Trustee to a third Person, and (iii) distributions made in cash,
      securities or other property in respect of claims filed against the
      Company in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization
      pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law;

            (B)   to realize, for its own account, upon any property held by it
      as security for any such claim, if such property was so held prior to the
      beginning of such three months' period;

            (C)   to realize, for its own account, but only to the extent of the
      claim hereinafter mentioned, upon any property held by it as security for
      any such claim, if such claim was created after the beginning of such
      three months' period and such property was received as security therefor
      simultaneously with the creation thereof, and if the Trustee shall sustain
      the burden of proving that at the time such property was so received the
      Trustee had no reasonable cause to believe that a default, as defined in
      Subsection (c) of this Section, would occur within three months; or

            (D)   to receive payment on any claim referred to in paragraph (B)
      or (C), against the release of any property


                                        53
<PAGE>



      held as security for such claim as provided in paragraph (B) or (C), as
      the case may be, to the extent of the fair value of such property.

            For the purposes of paragraphs (B), (C) and (D), property
      substituted after the beginning of such three months' period for property
      held as security at the time of such substitution shall, to the extent of
      the fair value of the property released, have the same status as the
      property released, and, to the extent that any claim referred to in any of
      such paragraphs is created in renewal of or in substitution for or for the
      purpose of repaying or refunding any pre-existing claim of the Trustee as
      such creditor, such claim shall have the same status as such pre-existing
      claim.

            If the Trustee shall be required to account, the funds and property
held in such special account and the proceeds thereof shall be apportioned among
the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of other indenture securities in such
manner that the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of other indenture
securities realize, as a result of payments from such special account and
payments of dividends on claims filed against the Company in bankruptcy or
receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Federal
Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law, the same percentage of their respective
claims, figured before crediting to the claim of the Trustee anything on account
of the receipt by it from the Company of the funds and property in such special
account and before crediting to the respective claims of the Trustee and the
Holders and the holders of other indenture securities dividends on claims filed
against the Company in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for
reorganization pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or applicable State law,
but after crediting thereon receipts on account of the indebtedness represented
by their respective claims from all sources other than from such dividends and
from the funds and property so held in such special account.  As used in this
paragraph, with respect to any claim, the term "dividends" shall include any
distribution with respect to such claim, in bankruptcy or receivership or
proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or
applicable State law, whether such distribution is made in cash, securities or
other property, but shall not include any such distribution with respect to the
secured portion, if any, of such claim.  The court in which such bankruptcy,
receivership or proceedings for reorganization is pending shall have
jurisdiction (i) to apportion among the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of
other indenture securities, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph,
the funds and property held in such special account and proceeds thereof, or
(ii) in lieu of such apportionment, in whole or in part, to give to the
provisions of this paragraph due consideration in determining the fairness of
the distributions to be made to the Trustee and the Holders and the holders of
other indenture securities with respect to their respective claims, in which
event it shall not be necessary to


                                        54
<PAGE>



liquidate or to appraise the value of any securities or other property held in
such special account or as security for any such claim, or to make a specific
allocation of such distributions as between the secured and unsecured portions
of such claims, or otherwise to apply the provisions of this paragraph as a
mathematical formula.

            Any Trustee which has resigned or been removed after the beginning
of such three months' period shall be subject to the provisions of this
Subsection as though such resignation or removal had not occurred.  If any
Trustee has resigned or been removed prior to the beginning of such three
months' period, it shall be subject to the provisions of this Subsection if and
only if the following conditions exist:


                   (i)  the receipt of property or reduction of claim, which
            would have given rise to the obligation to account, if such Trustee
            had continued as Trustee, occurred after the beginning of such three
            months' period; and

                  (ii)  such receipt of property or reduction of claim occurred
            within three months after such resignation or removal.

            (b)   There shall be excluded from the operation of Subsection (a)
of this Section a creditor relationship arising from:

            (1)   the ownership or acquisition of securities issued under any
      indenture, or any security or securities having a maturity of one year or
      more at the time of acquisition by the Trustee;

            (2)   advances authorized by a receivership or bankruptcy court of
      competent jurisdiction or by this Indenture, for the purpose of preserving
      any property which shall at any time be subject to the lien of this
      Indenture or of discharging tax liens or other prior liens or encumbrances
      thereon, if notice of such advances and of the circumstances surrounding
      the making thereof is given to the Holders at the time and in the manner
      provided in this Indenture;

            (3)   disbursements made in the ordinary course of business in the
      capacity of trustee under an indenture, transfer agent, registrar,
      custodian, paying agent, fiscal agent or depository, or other similar
      capacity;

            (4)   an indebtedness created as a result of services rendered or
      premises rented; or an indebtedness created as a result of goods or
      securities sold in a cash transaction, as defined in Subsection (c) of
      this Section;



                                        55
<PAGE>



            (5)   the ownership of stock or of other securities of a corporation
      organized under the provisions of Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve
      Act, as amended, which is directly or indirectly a creditor of the
      Company; and

            (6)   the acquisition, ownership, acceptance or negotiation of any
      drafts, bills of exchange, acceptances or obligations which fall within
      the classification of self-liquidating paper, as defined in Subsection (c)
      of this Section.

            (c)   For the purposes of this Section only:

            (1)   the term "default" means any failure to make payment in full
      of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the
      Debentures or upon the other indenture securities when and as such
      principal (or premium, if any) or interest becomes due and payable;

            (2)   the term "other indenture securities" means securities upon
      which the Company is an obligor (as defined in the Trust Indenture Act)
      outstanding under any other indenture (i) under which the Trustee is also
      trustee, (ii) which contains provisions substantially similar to the
      provisions of this Section, and (iii) under which a default exists at the
      time of the apportionment of the funds and property held in such special
      account;

            (3)   the term "cash transaction" means any transaction in which
      full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after
      delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other
      orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand;

            (4)   the term "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of
      exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or
      incurred by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase,
      processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or
      merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to,
      possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the
      receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or
      merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is
      received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor
      relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing,
      negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or
      obligation;

            (5)   the term "Company" means any obligor upon the Debentures; and

SECTION 614.      AUTHENTICATING AGENTS.

            From time to time the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may appoint
one or more Authenticating Agents with respect to one or more series of
Debentures with power to act on the Trustee's behalf and subject to its
direction in the authentication and delivery of Debentures of such series or in
connection with transfers and exchanges under Sections 304, 305, 306, and 1107
as fully to all intents and purposes as though the Authenticating Agent had been
expressly authorized by those Sections of this Indenture to authenticate and
deliver Debentures of such series.  For all purposes of this Indenture, the
authentication and delivery of Debentures by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to
this Section shall be deemed to be authentication and delivery of such
Debentures "by the Trustee".  Each such Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable
to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing
business under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District
of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and  subject to
supervision or examination by Federal, State or District of Columbia authority.
If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually pursuant to
law or the requirements of such authority, then for the purposes of this Section
the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so published.  If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible
in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this
Section.

            Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger
or consolidation or to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of any Authenticating
Agent, shall be the successor of the Authenticating Agent hereunder, if such
successor corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties
hereto or the Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.

            An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company.  The Trustee may at any
time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice
of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company.  Upon receiving
such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
the Trustee shall have actual knowledge that any Authenticating Agent shall
cease to be eligible under this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor
Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail
notice of


                                        57
<PAGE>



such appointment to all Holders of Debentures of the series with respect to
which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as the names and addresses of such
Holders appear on the Debenture Register.  Any successor Authenticating Agent,
upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if
originally named as an Authenticating Agent.  No successor Authenticating Agent
shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

            The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to
time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.

            The Trustee shall incur no liability for the appointment of any
Authenticating Agent with respect to the Debentures of one or more series or for
any misconduct or negligence of such Authenticating Agent, including without
limitation, its authentication of the Debentures upon original issuance or
pursuant to Section 306.  In the event the Trustee does incur liability for any
such misconduct or negligence of the Authenticating Agent, the Company agrees to
indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it harmless against, any such liability,
including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any liability in
connection with such misconduct or negligence of the Authenticating Agent.

            If an appointment with respect to one or more series of Debentures
is made pursuant to this Section, the Debentures of such series may have
endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an
alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:

            This is one of the Debentures of the series designated herein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

                                 ARTICLE SEVEN

               HOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY TRUSTEE AND COMPANY

SECTION 701.      COMPANY TO FURNISH TRUSTEE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF HOLDERS.

            The Company, will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee
with respect to the Debentures of each series

            (a) monthly, on each Regular Record Date, a list, in such form as
      the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the
      Holders as of such Regular Record Date, and

            (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing,
      within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a
      list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior
      to the time such list is furnished; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that so long as
      the Trustee is Debenture Registrar for any series of Debentures, no such
      list shall be required to be furnished with respect to any such series.


SECTION 702.      PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION; COMMUNICATIONS TO HOLDERS.

            (a)  The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most
recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 701 and the names
and addresses of Holders received by the Trustee in its capacity as Debenture
Registrar.  The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in
Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

            (b)  If three or more Holders (herein referred to as "applicants")
apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof
that each such applicant has owned a Debenture for a period of at least six
months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that
the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders with respect to their
rights under this Indenture or under the Debentures and is accompanied by a copy
of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to
transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five business days after the receipt of
such application, at its election, either

            (i)   afford such applicants access to the information preserved at
      the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 702(a), or

            (ii)  inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders
      whose names and addresses appear in the


                                        59
<PAGE>



      information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with
      Section 702(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders
      the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in such
      application.

            If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to
such information, the Trustee shall, upon the written request of such
applicants, mail, first class postage prepaid, to each Holder whose name and
address appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in
accordance with Section 702(a) a copy of the form of proxy or other
communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness
after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or
provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within
five days after such tender the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file
with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a
written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such
mailing would be contrary to the best interest of the Holders or would be in
violation of applicable law.  Such written statement shall specify the basis of
such opinion.  If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the
objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order
refusing to sustain any of such objections or if, after the entry of an order
sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have
been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail, first
class postage prepaid, copies of such material to all such Holders with
reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such
tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to
such applicants respecting their application.

            (c)  Every Holder of Debentures, by receiving and holding the same,
agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee
nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the
disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders
in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from which such
information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by
reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under Section 702(b).


SECTION 703.  REPORTS BY TRUSTEE.

            (a)   On or before July 15 in each year in which any of the
Debentures are outstanding, the Trustee shall transmit by mail, first class
postage prepaid, to the Holder, as their names and addresses appear upon the
Debenture Register, a brief report dated as of the preceding May 15, with
respect to any of the following events which may have occurred within the
previous


                                        60
<PAGE>



twelve months (but if no such event has occurred within such period no report
need be transmitted):

            (1)   any change to its eligibility under Section 609 and its
      qualifications under Section 608;

            (2)   the creation of or any material change to a relationship
      specified in paragraphs (1) through (10) of subsection (c) of Section 608;

      elects so to state, the circumstances surrounding the making thereof) made
      by the Trustee (as such) which remain unpaid on the date of such report,
      and for the reimbursement of which it claims or may claim a lien or
      charge, prior to that of the Debentures, on any property or funds held or
      collected by it as Trustee if such advances so remaining unpaid aggregate
      more than 1/2 of 1% of the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding
      on the date of such report;

            (4)  any change to the amount, interest rate, and maturity date of
      all other indebtedness owing by the Company, or by any other obligor on
      the Debentures, to the Trustee in its individual capacity, on the date of
      such report, with a brief description of any property held as collateral
      security therefor, except any indebtedness based upon a creditor
      relationship arising in any manner described in Section 613(b) (2), (3),
      (4) or (6);

            (5)   any change to the property and funds, if any, physically in
      the possession of the Trustee as such on the date of such report;

            (6)   any change to any release, or release and substitution, of
      property subject to the lien of this Indenture (and the consideration
      thereof, if any) which the Trustee has not previously reported;

            (7)   any additional issue of Debentures which the Trustee has not
      previously reported; and

            (8)   any action taken by the Trustee in the performance of its
      duties under this Indenture which it has not previously reported and which
      in its opinion materially affects the Debentures or the Debentures of any
      series, except any action in respect of a default, notice of which has
      been or is to be withheld by it in accordance with the provisions of
      Section 602.

            (b)  The Trustee shall transmit by mail, first class postage
prepaid, to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Debenture
Register, a brief report with respect to the character and amount of any
advances (and if the Trustee


                                        61
<PAGE>



elects so to state, the circumstances surrounding the making thereof) made by
the Trustee (as such) since the date of the last report transmitted pursuant to
Subsection (a) of this Section (or if no such report has yet been so
transmitted, since the date of execution of this instrument) for the
reimbursement of which it claims or may claim a lien or charge, prior to that of

                                   COVENANTS

SECTION 1001.     PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND INTEREST.

            The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of

or surrendered for payment, where Debentures of that series may be surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Debentures of that series and this Indenture
may be served.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency.  If at

            The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other
offices or agencies where the Debentures of one or more series may be presented
or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind
such designations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such designation or rescission
shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office
or agency in each Place of Payment for Debentures of any series for such
purposes.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any
such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such
other office or agency.


SECTION 1003.     MONEY FOR DEBENTURES PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST.

            If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to any series of Debentures, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any of the Debentures
of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or
interest, if any, so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons
or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee
of its action or failure so to act.

            Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any
series of Debentures, it will, on, in case the payment referred to below is made
in same day funds, or, in all other cases, prior to, each due date of the
principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Debentures of
that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal
(and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest,
and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify
the Trustee of its failure so to act.

            The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of
Debentures other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to
the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

                  (1)  hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal
      of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on Debentures of that series
      in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums
      shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

                  (2)  give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or
      any other obligor upon the Debentures of that series) in the making of any
      payment of principal (and


                                        69
<PAGE>



      premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Debentures of that series;
      and

                  (3)  at any time during the continuance of any such default,
      upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all
      sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.

            The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such money.

            Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then
held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium,
if any) or interest, if any, on any Debenture of any series and remaining
unclaimed for three years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest
has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or
(if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the
Holder of such Debenture shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor,
look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee
or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the
Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a
newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each
Business Day and of general circulation in the City, County and State of New
York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified
therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication,
any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the
Company.


SECTION 1004.     CORPORATE EXISTENCE.

            Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done
all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence and will use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its rights (charter and
statutory) and franchises; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall
determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of
the


                                        70

business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any
material respect to the Holders.

of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in
good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary
equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of
the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection
therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from
discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such
discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of
its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any
material respect to the Holders.


SECTION 1006.  PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CLAIMS.

            The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or
upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2)
all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by
law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be required to pay or
discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or
claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings.


SECTION 1007.  STATEMENT BY OFFICERS AS TO DEFAULT.

            The Company will deliver to the Trustee on or before May 15, 1996,
and on May 15 in each year thereafter, an Officers' Certificate stating that in
the course of the performance by each signer of his duties as an officer of the
Company he would normally have knowledge of any default by the Company in the
performance and observance of any of the covenants contained in Sections 1001 to
1006, stating whether or not he has knowledge of any such default and, if so,
specifying each such default of which such signer has knowledge and the nature
thereof.

                           REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES

SECTION 1101.  APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE.

            Debentures of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Debentures of any series)
in accordance with this Article.


SECTION 1102.  ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE.

            The election of the Company to redeem any Debentures shall be
evidenced by an Officers' Certificate.  In case of any redemption at the
election of the Company of less than all the Debentures of any series, the
Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the
Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Debentures of
such series to be redeemed, such notice to be accompanied by a written statement
signed by an authorized officer of the Company stating that no defaults in the
payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to the Debentures of that
series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured).  In the case of any
redemption of Debentures prior to the expiration of any restriction on such
redemption provided in the terms of such Debentures or elsewhere in this
Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate
evidencing compliance with such restriction.


SECTION 1103.  SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF DEBENTURES TO BE REDEEMED.

            If less than all the Debentures of any series are to be redeemed,
the particular Debentures to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures of
such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the


                                        74
<PAGE>



selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized
denomination for Debentures of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of
the principal amount of Debentures of such series of a denomination larger than
the minimum authorized denomination for Debentures of that series.

            Debentures shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for
redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in a
written statement signed by an authorized officer of the Company and delivered
to the Debenture Registrar at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date as
being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by
either (a) the Company or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written
statement which is an Affiliate of the Company.

            The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the
Debentures selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debentures selected
for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.


            For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debentures shall relate,
in the case of any Debentures redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the
portion of the principal amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be
redeemed.


SECTION 1104.  NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

            Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption

the Debenture Register.

            All notices of redemption shall state:

            (1)  the Redemption Date,

            (3)  if less than all the Outstanding Debentures of any series are
      to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
      redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be
      redeemed,

            (4)  that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become
      due and payable upon each such Debenture to be redeemed and, if
      applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said
      date,

            (5)  the place or places where such Debentures are to be surrendered
      for payment of the Redemption Price, and


                                        75
<PAGE>



            (6)  that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.

            Notice of redemption of Debentures to be redeemed at the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.


SECTION 1105.  DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE.

            On, in the case of same day funds, or in all other cases at least
five Business Days prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with
the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own
Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount
of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the
Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the
Debentures which are to be redeemed on that date (to the extent that such
amounts are not already on deposit at such time in accordance with the
provisions of Section 401, 403 or 1008).


SECTION 1106.  DEBENTURES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE.

            Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Debentures
so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued and
unpaid interest) such Debentures shall cease to bear interest.  Upon surrender
of any such Debenture for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Debenture shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with
accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the  Redemption
Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Debentures, or one or more
Predecessor Debentures, registered as such at the close of business on the
relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section
307.

            If any Debenture called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall,
until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed
therefor in the Debenture.

SECTION 1107.  DEBENTURES REDEEMED IN PART.

            Any Debenture (including any Global Debenture) which is to be
redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with,
if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer


                                        76
<PAGE>



in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such
Debenture without service charge, a new Debenture or Debentures of the same
series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of the Debenture so surrendered; PROVIDED, that a Global Debenture
shall be in a denomination equal to the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Global Debenture so surrendered.


                                ARTICLE TWELVE

                                 SINKING FUNDS

SECTION 1201.  APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE.

            The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking
fund for the retirement of Debentures of a series except as otherwise specified
as contemplated by Section 301 for Debentures of such series.

            The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Debentures of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking
fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by
the terms of Debentures of any series is herein referred to as an "optional
sinking fund payment".  If provided for by the terms of Debentures of any
series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction
as provided in Section 1202.  Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the
redemption of Debentures of any series as provided for by the terms of
Debentures of such series.


SECTION 1202.     SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH DEBENTURES.

            In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund
payment with respect to any series of Debentures in cash, the Company may at its
option (a) deliver to the Trustee Debentures of such series theretofore
purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the
mandatory sinking fund) by the Company or receive credit for Debentures of such
series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired
(except as aforesaid) by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation pursuant to Section 309, (b) receive credit for optional sinking
fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c)
receive credit for Debentures of such series (not previously so credited)
redeemed by the Company through any optional redemption provision contained in
the terms of such series.  Debentures so


                                        77
<PAGE>



delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the
sinking fund Redemption Price specified in such Debentures.


SECTION 1203.     REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES FOR SINKING FUND.

            Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
any series of Debentures, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying (a) the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment
for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, (b) whether or not the
Company intends to exercise its right, if any, to make an optional sinking fund
payment with respect to such series on the next ensuing sinking fund payment
date and, if so, the amount of such optional sinking fund payment, and (c) the
portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the
portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting
Debentures of that series pursuant to Section 1202, and will also deliver to the
Trustee any Debentures to be so delivered.  Such written statement shall be
irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Company shall become
unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein
referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date.
Failure of the Company, on or before any such 60th day, to deliver such written
statement and Debentures specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not
constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the
irrevocable election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment
for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be
paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Debentures of such
series in respect therefor and (ii) that the Company will make no optional
sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.

            Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the
Trustee shall select the Debentures to be redeemed upon such sinking fund
payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the
redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company
in the manner provided in Section 1104.  Such notice having been duly given, the
redemption of such Debentures shall be made upon the terms and in the manner
stated in Sections 1105, 1106 and 1107.

            The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Debenture
of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of
Debentures of such series by operation of the sinking fund during the
continuance of a default in payment of interest with respect to Debentures of
that series or an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures of that series
except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Debentures shall
theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or


                                        78
<PAGE>



cause to be redeemed such Debentures, provided that it shall have received from
the Company a sum sufficient for such redemption.  Except as aforesaid, any
moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or
Event of Default, shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking
fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be
deemed to have been collected under Article Five and held for the payment of all
such Debentures.  In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as
provided in Section 513 or the default or Event of Default cured on or before
the 60th day preceding the sinking fund payment date, such moneys shall
thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in
accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Debentures.

to be bound by such provisions.

            The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
all Debentures issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner
hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, whether outstanding at the
date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.

            No provision of this Article Thirteen shall prevent the occurrence
of any default or Event of Default hereunder.


SECTION 1302.     LIMITATIONS ON PAYMENTS TO HOLDERS.  In the event and during
the continuation of any default in the payment of principal, premium, interest
or any other payment due on any Senior Indebtedness continuing beyond the period
of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Senior
Indebtedness, unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or
shall have ceased to exist, and in the event that the maturity of any Senior
Indebtedness has been accelerated because of a default, then no payment shall be
made by the Company with respect to the principal (including redemption and
sinking fund payments) of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Debentures.

            In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall
be received by the Trustee or any holder when such


                                        79
<PAGE>



payment is prohibited by the preceding paragraph of this Section 1302, such
payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or
delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their respective
representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to
which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective
interests may appear, but only to the extent that the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify
the Trustee within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on
the Senior Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the
Trustee shall be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.


SECTION 1303.     PAYMENTS IN BANKRUPTCY.  Upon any payment by the Company, or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding-up or
liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary
or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due
or to become due upon all Senior Indebtedness shall first be paid in full, or
payment thereof provided for in money in accordance with its terms, before any
payment is made on account of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on
the Debentures; and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or
reorganization any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the
Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to
which the Holders of the Debentures or the Trustee would be entitled, except for
the provisions of this Article Thirteen, shall by paid by the Company or by any
receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders of the Debentures or by
the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders, as calculated by
the Company) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or
trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any
Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may
appear, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, in money
or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution
to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution
is made to the Holders of Debentures or to the Trustee.

            In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the
Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures before all Senior Indebtedness is paid
in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its
terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust


                                        80
<PAGE>



for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or
trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any
Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may
appear, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all
Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior
Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect
to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness.

            For purposes of this Article Thirteen, the words, "cash, property or
securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as
reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation
provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which
is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article Thirteen with
respect to the Debentures to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at
the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the Senior Indebtedness is assumed by
the new corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or
readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are

winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 1303
if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger,
conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in this Indenture.
Nothing in Section 1302 or in this Section 1303 shall apply to claims of, or
payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607.


SECTION 1304.     SUBROGATION OF DEBENTURES.  Subject to the payment in full
of all Senior Indebtedness, the rights of the Holders of the Debentures shall be
subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive
payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company
applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if
any) and interest on the Debentures shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes
of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the
Debentures or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this
Article Thirteen, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article
Thirteen, to or for the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders
of the Debentures or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors
other than holders of

Debentures, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness on the
other hand.

            Nothing contained in this Article Thirteen or elsewhere in this
Indenture or in the Debentures is intended to or shall impair, as between the
Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the
Holders of the Debentures, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Debentures the principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or
shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Debentures and creditors
of the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall
anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Debenture
from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default
under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article Thirteen
of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities
of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

            Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred
to in this Article Thirteen, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section
601, and the Holders of the Debentures shall be entitled to rely upon any order
or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a
certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation trustee, agent
or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or
to the Holders of the Debentures, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons
entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount hereof or payable
thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts
pertinent thereto or to this Article Thirteen.


SECTION 1305.     AUTHORIZATION BY HOLDERS.  Each Holder of a Debenture by his
acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee in his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination
provided in this Article Thirteen and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact

notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any


                                        82

fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment of
monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Debentures pursuant to the
provisions of this Article Thirteen.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Article Thirteen or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not
be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the
making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the
Debentures pursuant to the provisions of this Article Thirteen, unless and until
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof
at the principal office of the Trustee from the Company or a holder or holders
of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of
any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601,
shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided
that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this
Section 1306 at least two business days prior to the date upon which by the
terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without
limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on
any Debenture), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to
apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be
affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it within two
business days prior to such date.

            The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be
entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person
representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on
behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder
of Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders.  In
the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is
required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior
Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this
Article Thirteen, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness
held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate
in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of
such Person under this Article Thirteen, and if such evidence is not furnished
the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination
as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.


SECTION 1307.     TRUSTEE'S RELATION TO SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  The Trustee in
its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this
Article Thirteen in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it,
to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in
this


                                        83
<PAGE>



Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

            With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Article Thirteen, and no implied covenants
or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe
any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the
provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of
Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Debentures,
the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of Senior
Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Thirteen or otherwise.


SECTION 1308.     ACTS OF HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  No right of any
present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as
herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any
act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to
act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company
with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any
knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

            Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing
paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to
time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the
Debentures, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Debentures
and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article
Thirteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Debentures to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change
the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew
or alter, Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner
Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under
which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior
Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection
of Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against the Company and any other Person.

            UMB Bank, N.A., as Trustee hereby accepts the trusts in this
Indenture declared and provided, upon the terms and conditions hereinabove set
forth.

<PAGE>



      FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of the 1st day of June, 1995 (the
"First Supplemental Indenture"), between UTILICORP UNITED INC., a corporation
duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Company"), and UMB Bank, N.A., a national banking
association organized and existing under the laws of the United States, as
trustee (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Trustee") under the Indenture
dated as of June 1, 1995 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Indenture";
all terms used and not defined herein are used as defined in the Indenture).

      WHEREAS, the Company executed and delivered the Indenture to the Trustee
to provide for the future issuance of securities and the Company desires to
issue its junior subordinated debentures (the "Debentures"), said Debentures to
be issued from time to time in series as might be determined by the Company
under the Indenture, in an unlimited aggregate principal amount which may be
authenticated and delivered thereunder as in the Indenture provided; and

      WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Company desires to
provide for the establishment of a new series of its Debentures to be known as
its 8 7/8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, Series A, Due
2025 (said series being hereinafter referred to as the "Series A Debentures"),
the form and substance of such Series A Debentures and the terms, provisions and
conditions thereof to be set forth as provided in the Indenture and this First
Supplemental Indenture; and

      WHEREAS, UtiliCorp Capital L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
("UtiliCorp Capital"), has offered to the public its 8 7/8% Cumulative Monthly
Income Preferred Securities, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Securities"),
representing limited partner interests in the Company and proposes to invest the
proceeds from such offering in the Series A Debentures; and

      WHEREAS, upon the occurrence of a Special Event (as defined in the Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of UtiliCorp Capital L.P., dated
June 12, 1995, as amended or supplemented (the "Limited Partnership
Agreement")), the Company may dissolve UtiliCorp Capital and cause to be
distributed to the holders of the Series A Preferred Securities, on a pro rata
basis, Series A Debentures (a "Dissolution Event"); and

      WHEREAS, the Company desires and has requested the Trustee to join with it
in the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture, and all
requirements necessary to make this First Supplemental Indenture a valid
instrument, in accordance with its terms, and to make the Series A Debentures,
when executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the
valid obligations of the Company, have been performed and fulfilled, and the
execution and delivery hereof have been in all respects duly authorized:



<PAGE>



      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the purchase and acceptance of the
Series A Debentures by the holders thereof, and for the purpose of setting
forth, as provided in the Indenture, the form and substance of the Series A
Debentures and the terms, provisions and conditions thereof, the Company
covenants and agrees with the Trustee as follows:



                                  ARTICLE ONE

                         General Terms and Conditions of
                             the Series A Debentures

      SECTION 1.01. There shall be and is hereby authorized a series of
Debentures designated the "8 7/8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures, Series A, Due 2025", unlimited in aggregate principal amount.  The
Series A Debentures will initially be issued in the aggregate principal amount
of $100,000,000.  The Series A Debentures shall mature and the principal shall
be due and payable together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
including Additional Interest (as hereinafter defined) on June 12, 2025, and
shall be issued in the form of registered Series A Debentures without coupons.

      SECTION 1.02. Except as provided in Section 1.03 herein, the Series A
Debentures shall be issued in certificated form. Principal and interest on the
Series A Debentures issued in certificated form will be payable, the transfer of
such Series A Debentures will be registrable and such Series A Debentures will
be exchangeable for the Series A Debentures bearing identical terms and
provisions at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City and State of New York; provided, however, that payment of interest may
be made at the option of the Company by check mailed first class, postage
prepaid to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the
Debenture Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of the
Series A Debentures is UtiliCorp Capital, the payment of the principal of and
interest on (including Additional Interest, if any) the Series A Debentures will
be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by UtiliCorp
Capital.

      SECTION 1.03.  In connection with a Dissolution Event, the Series A
Debentures in certificated form may be presented to the Trustee by UtiliCorp
Capital in exchange for a Global Debenture in an aggregate principal amount
equal to all Outstanding Series A Debentures, to be registered in the name of
the Depository, or its nominee, and delivered by the Trustee to the Depository
for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions
of UtiliCorp Capital.  The Company upon any such presentation shall execute a
Global Debenture in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the
Trustee for authentication and delivery as hereinabove and in the Indenture
provided. Payments on the Series A Debentures issued as a Global Debenture will
be made to the Depository. The Depository for the Series A Debentures shall be
The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York.



                                     -2-
<PAGE>



      SECTION 1.04.  Each Series A Debenture will bear interest at the rate of 8
7/8% per annum from the original date of issuance until the principal thereof
becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that
payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue
installment of interest at the same rate per annum, payable monthly in arrears
on the last day of each calendar month of each year (each, an "Interest Payment
Date", commencing on June 30, 1995), to the person in whose name such Series A
Debenture or any predecessor Series A Debenture is registered in the Debenture
Register, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest
installment, which shall be the close of business on the Business Day next
preceding that Interest Payment Date. If pursuant to the provisions of Section
305 of the Indenture the Series A Junior Subordinated Debentures are no longer
represented by a Global Debenture, the Company may select a Regular Record Date
for such interest installment which shall be any date not later than fifteen
days preceding an Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not
punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the person in
whose name the Series A Debenture (or one or more Predecessor Debentures) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the
Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be
given to the registered Holders of the Series A Debentures not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other
lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange
on which the Series A Debentures may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture
hereinafter referred to.

      The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on
which interest is payable on the Series A Debentures is not a Business Day, then
payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day
which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of
any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

      If at any time when UtiliCorp Capital is the holder of the Series A
Debentures, UtiliCorp Capital shall be required to pay any interest on dividends
in arrears in respect of the Series A Preferred Securities pursuant to the terms
thereof, then the Company will pay as interest (the "Additional Interest") an
amount equal to such interest on dividends in arrears. In addition, if UtiliCorp
Capital would be required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United
States, or any other taxing authority, then, in any such case, the Company shall
also pay as Additional Interest such amounts as shall be required so that the
net amount received and retained by UtiliCorp Capital after paying any such
taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges will not be less than the
amounts UtiliCorp Capital would have received had no such taxes, duties,
assessments or governmental charges been imposed.

                                  ARTICLE TWO

                  Mandatory Prepayment and Optional Redemption
                          of the Series A Debentures

      SECTION 2.01.  If UtiliCorp Capital redeems the Series A Preferred
Securities in accordance with the terms thereof, the Series A Debentures will
become due and payable in a principal amount equal to the aggregate stated
liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Securities so redeemed,
together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, including Additional
Interest, if any (the "Mandatory Prepayment Price"). Any payment pursuant to
this provision shall be made in immediately available same day funds prior to
12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such redemption or at such earlier
time as the Company and UtiliCorp Capital shall agree.

      SECTION 2.02.  At such time as there are no Series A Preferred Securities
remaining outstanding and subject to the terms of Articles Eleven and Twelve of
the Indenture, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Series A
Debentures, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after June 12, 2000,
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, including any Additional Interest, if
any, to the date of such redemption (the "Optional Redemption Price"). Any
redemption pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days' notice, at the Optional Redemption Price. If the Series A
Debentures are only partially redeemed pursuant to this Section, the Debentures
will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the
Trustee; provided, that if at the time of redemption, the Series A Debentures
are registered as a Global Debenture, the Depository shall determine the
principal amount of such Series A Debentures held by each Series A
Debentureholder to be redeemed.


                                  ARTICLE THREE

                      Extension of Interest Payment Period

      SECTION 3.01.  The Company shall have the right, at any time during the
term of the Series A Debentures, from time to time to extend the interest
payment period, of such Series A Debentures for up to 60 consecutive months (the
"Extended Interest Payment Period"), at the end of which period the Company
shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid thereon (together with interest
thereon at the rate specified for the Series A Debentures to the extent
permitted by applicable law); provided that, during such Extended Interest
Payment Period the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, or redeem,
purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its
capital stock or make any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing.
Prior to the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the
Company may further extend such period, provided that such period together with
all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed 60 consecutive months. Upon
the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of
all accrued and unpaid interest and


                                     -4-
<PAGE>



any Additional Interest then due, the Company may select a new Extended Interest
Payment Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest during an
Extended Interest Payment Period, except at the end thereof, shall be due and
payable.

      SECTION 3.02.  (a)  If UtiliCorp Capital is the sole holder of the Series
A Debentures at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment
Period, the Company shall give both UtiliCorp Capital and the Trustee written
notice of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period one Business
Day prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which dividends on
the Series A Preferred Securities are payable or (ii) the date UtiliCorp Capital
is required to give notice of the Record Date or the date such dividends are
payable to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory
organization or to holders of the Series A Preferred Securities, but in any
event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. The Company
shall cause UtiliCorp Capital to give notice of the Company's selection of such
Extended Interest Payment Period to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Securities.

            (b)   If UtiliCorp Capital is not the sole Holder of the Series A
      Debentures at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment
      Period, the Company shall give the Holders of the Series A Debentures and
      the Trustee written notice of its selection of such Extended Interest
      Payment Period 10 Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next
      succeeding Interest Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required
      to give notice of the record or payment date of such interest payment to
      the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self- regulatory
      organization or to Holders of the Series A Debentures, but in any event
      not less than two Business Days prior to such Record Date.

            (c)   The month in which any notice is given pursuant to paragraphs
      (a) or (b) of this Section shall constitute one of the 60 months which
      comprise the maximum Extended Interest Payment Period.


                                  ARTICLE FOUR

                                Right of Set-Off

      SECTION 4.01.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture
or herein, the Company shall have the right to set-off any payment it is
otherwise required to make thereunder or hereunder with and to the extent the
Company has heretofore made, or is concurrently on the date of such payment
making, a payment under the Guarantee, dated as of June 12, 1995 executed by the
Company and furnished to UtiliCorp Capital for the benefit of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Securities.

                                 ARTICLE FIVE

                         Covenant to List on Exchange

      SECTION 5.01.  If the Series A Debentures are to be issued as a Global
Debenture in connection with the distribution of the Series A Debentures to the
holders of the Series A Preferred Securities upon a Dissolution Event, the
Company will use its best efforts to list such Debentures on the New York Stock
Exchange or on such other exchange as the Series A Preferred Securities are then
listed and traded on the same part of any such exchange.


                                  ARTICLE SIX

                          Form of Series A Debenture

      SECTION 6.01.  The Series A Debentures and the Trustee's Certificate of
Authentication to be endorsed thereon are to be substantially in the following
forms:

                         (FORM OF FACE OF DEBENTURE)

      [If the Debenture is to be a Global Debenture, insert - This Debenture is
a Global Debenture within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to
and is registered in the name of a Depository or a nominee of a Depository. This
Debenture is exchangeable for Debentures registered in the name of a person
other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances
described in the Indenture, and no transfer of this Debenture (other than a
transfer of this Debenture as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the
Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another
nominee of the Depository) may be registered except in limited circumstances.

      Unless this Debenture is presented by an authorized representative of The

for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Debenture issued is
registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an
authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company and any payment hereon
is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR

                             UTILICORP UNITED INC.

8 7/8% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURE, SERIES A, DUE 2025

      UTILICORP UNITED INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of the State of Delaware (herein referred to as the "Company", which term
includes any successor corporation under the Indenture), for value received,
hereby promises to pay to UtiliCorp Capital L.P. ("UtiliCorp Capital") or
registered assigns, the principal sum of One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000) on June 12, 2025, and to pay interest on said principal sum from
June 12, 1995 or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an
"Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for,
monthly in arrears on the last day of each calendar month of each year
commencing June 30, 1995 at the rate of 8 7/8% per annum plus Additional
Interest, if any, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable,
and on any overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that
payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue
installment of interest at the same rate per annum.  The amount of interest
payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is
payable on this Debenture is not a Business Day, then payment of interest
payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business
Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay),
except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such
payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case
with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest installment
so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name
this Debenture (or one or more Predecessor Debentures, as defined in said
Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for
such interest installment, [which shall be the close of business on the Business
Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date]. [If pursuant to the provisions
of Section 305 of the Indenture the Series A Junior Subordinated Debentures are
no longer represented by a Global Debenture--which shall be the close of
business on the ___ Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date.] Any
such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall
forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holders on such Regular Record
Date, and may be paid to the person in whose name this Debenture (or one or more
Predecessor Debentures) is registered in the Debenture Register at the close of
business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of
such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered Holders
of this series of Debentures not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record
Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent
with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Debentures may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more
fully provided in the Indenture hereinafter referred to. The principal of (and


                                     -7-
<PAGE>



premium, if any) and the interest on this Debenture shall be payable at the
office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City and State of New York, in any coin or currency of the United
States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be
made at the option of the Company by check mailed first class, postage prepaid,
to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Debenture
Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of this Debenture
is UtiliCorp Capital, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest (including Additional Interest, if any) in this Debenture will be made
at such place and to such account as may be designated by UtiliCorp Capital.

      The indebtedness evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided in
the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Debenture is issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Debenture,
by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b)
authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so
provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice
of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the
Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or
hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said
provisions.

      This Debenture shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to, be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the
Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of
the Trustee.

      Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by the
Trustee referred to on the reverse side hereof, this Debenture shall not be
entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose.

      The provisions of this Debenture are contained on the reverse side hereof
and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as
though fully set forth at this place.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Instrument to be executed
as of June 1, 1995

Dated:  June 12, 1995


                        (FORM OF REVERSE OF DEBENTURE)

   This Debenture is one of a duly authorized series of Debentures of the
Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Debentures"), specified in the
Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant
to an Indenture dated as of June 1, 1995 duly executed and delivered between the
Company and UMB Bank, N.A., a national banking association duly organized and
existing under the laws of the United States, as Trustee (herein referred to as
the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of
June 1, 1995 between the Company and the Trustee (said Indenture as so
supplemented being hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture"), to which
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a
description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the
Debentures. By the terms of the Indenture, the Debentures are issuable in series
which may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other
respects as in the Indenture provided. This series of Debentures is limited in
aggregate principal amount as specified in said First Supplemental Indenture.

   If UtiliCorp Capital redeems its 8 7/8% Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred
Securities, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Securities") in accordance with
the terms thereof, this Debenture will become due and payable in a principal
amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation preference of the Series A
Preferred Securities so redeemed, together with any interest accrued thereon,
including Additional Interest (the "Mandatory Prepayment Price"). Any Mandatory
Prepayment Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date
of such redemption or at such earlier time as the Company and UtiliCorp Capital
shall agree. At such time as there are no Series A Preferred Securities
remaining outstanding and subject to the


                                     -9-
<PAGE>



terms of Articles Eleven and Twelve of the Indenture, the Company shall have the
right to redeem this Debenture at the option of the Company, without premium or
penalty, in whole or in part at any time on or after June 12, 2000 (an "Optional
Redemption"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus
any accrued but unpaid interest, including any Additional Interest, if any, to
the date of such redemption (the "Optional Redemption Price"). Any redemption
pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 nor more than 60
days' notice, at the Optional Redemption Price. If the Debentures are only
partially redeemed by the Company pursuant to an Optional Redemption, the
Debentures will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized
by the Trustee; provided that if at the time of redemption, the Debentures are
registered as a Global Debenture, the Depositary shall determine the principal
amount of such Debentures held by each Holder to be redeemed.

   In the event of redemption of this Debenture in part only, a new Debenture or
Debentures of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in
the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

   In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred
and be continuing, the principal of all of the Debentures may be declared, and
upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the
effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

   The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire
indebtedness of this Debenture upon compliance by the Company with certain
conditions set forth therein.

   The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Debentures of each series affected at the time
outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for
the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Debentures; provided,
however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity
of any Debentures of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of  interest thereon, or reduce
any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the
Holder of each Debenture so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of
Debentures, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such
supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Debenture
then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures of all series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of
the Holders of the Debentures of such series, to waive any past default in the
performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established
pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences,
except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on any of the Debentures of such series. Any such consent or waiver by
the registered Holder of this Debenture (unless revoked as provided in the
Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future
Holders and owners of this


                                     -10-
<PAGE>



Debenture and of any Debenture issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof
(whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or
not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debenture.

   No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on this Debenture at the time and place and at the rate and in the
manner herein prescribed.

   The Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the
Debentures, from time to time to extend the interest payment period of such
Debentures to up to 60 consecutive months (the "Extended Interest Payment
Period"), at the end of which period the Company shall pay all interest then
accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon at the rate specified for the
Debentures to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable law); provided that, during such Extended Interest Payment Period the
Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, or redeem, purchase, acquire
or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make
any guarantee payments with respect to the foregoing. Prior to the termination
of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend
such Extended Interest Payment Period,  provided that such Period together with
all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed 60 consecutive months. At
the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the
payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts then due,
the Company may select a new Extended Interest Payment Period.

   As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, this Debenture is transferable by the registered Holder hereof on the
Debenture Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Debenture for
registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City and State of New York accompanied by a written instrument
or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee
duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Debentures of authorized denominations
and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the
designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any
such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.

   Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Debenture, the
Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Debenture Registrar may deem and
treat the registered Holder hereof as recorded in the Debenture Register as the
absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Debenture shall be overdue and
notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other
than the Debenture Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on
account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and
for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying
agent nor any Debenture Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

on this Debenture, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect
hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator,
stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the
Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any
constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as
part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and
released.

3.   ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN


                                       -2-
<PAGE>

     3.1  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.

     3.2  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the
sole authority to determine:

          (i)  the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom Awards
     shall be granted;

          (ii) the number of Shares to be covered by each Award;

          (iii)     the price to be paid for the Shares upon the exercise of
     each Option;

          (iv) the Term within which each Option may be exercised;

          (v)  the terms and conditions of each Option, which may include
     provisions for payment of the option price in Shares at the Fair Market
     Value of such Shares on the day of their delivery for such purpose;

          (vi) the restrictions on transfer and forfeiture conditions with
     respect to a Restricted Stock Award; and

          (vii) any other terms and conditions of the Award.

     3.3  The Committee may construe and interpret the Plan, reconcile
inconsistencies thereunder and supply omissions therefrom.  Any decision or
action taken by the Committee in the exercise of such powers or otherwise,
arising out of or in connection with the construction, administration,
interpretation and effect of the Plan and of its rules and regulations shall be
conclusive and binding upon all Grantees, and any other person claiming under or
through any Grantee.

     3.4  The Committee shall designate one of its members as Chairman.  It
shall hold its meetings at such times and places as may be determined.  All
determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members at
the time in office.  Any determination reduced to writing and signed by a
majority of the members of the Committee at the time in office shall be fully as
effective as if it had been made at a meeting duly called and held.  The
Committee may appoint a Secretary, who need not be a member of the Committee,
and may establish and amend such rules and regulations for the conduct of its
business and the administration of the Plan as it shall deem advisable.

     3.5  No member of the Committee shall be liable, in the absence of bad
faith, for any act or omission with respect to his service on the Committee.
Service on the Committee is hereby specifically declared to constitute service
as a Director of the Company, to the end that the members of the Committee
shall, in respect of their acts and omissions as such, be entitled to the
limitation of liability, indemnification and reimbursement as Directors of the
Company pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and to the benefits
of any insurance policy maintained by the Company providing coverage with
respect to acts or omission of Directors of the Company.


                                       -3-
<PAGE>

     3.6  The Committee shall regularly inform the Board as to its actions under
the Plan in such manner, at such times, and in such form as the Board may
request.

     3.7  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Committee shall not
exist at any time during the term of this Plan, the Plan shall be administered
by the Board of Directors but only in the event the Board consists of a majority
of persons who are Disinterested Persons and a majority of Directors acting in
any matter related to the Plan consists of Disinterested Persons.

4.   ELIGIBILITY

     Awards may be made under the Plan only to the class of employees of the
Company or of a Subsidiary, including officers, consisting of those employees
who have executive, managerial, supervisory or professional responsibilities
("Eligible Employees").  A Director who is not an employee shall not be eligible
to receive an Award.  Awards may be made to Eligible Employees whether or not
they have received prior Awards under the Plan or under any other plan, and
whether or not they are participants in other benefit plans of the Company.

5.   SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN

     3,262,644(1) Shares are hereby reserved for issuance in connection with
Awards under the Plan and the issuance of Shares pursuant to Section 19, below.
The Shares so used may be Shares held in the treasury, however acquired, or
Shares which are authorized but unissued.  Any Shares subject to Options which
lapse unexercised, and any Shares forming part of a Restricted Stock Award which
do not vest in the Grantee, shall once again be available for grant of Awards.

6.   GRANTING OF OPTIONS

     6.1  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may from time to time
grant Options to Eligible Employees.

     6.2  Pursuant to the Code and applicable regulations, the aggregate Fair
Market Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of Shares as to
which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Grantee during any calendar
year (under all Plans of the Grantee's employer corporation and its parent and
subsidiary corporations) shall not exceed $100,000.  No ISO shall be granted to
a Grantee who, at the time the ISO is granted, owns (within the meaning of
Section 422(b)(6) of the Code) stock possessing more than 10 percent of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Grantee's employer
corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation unless, at the time the
ISO is granted, the Option price is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market
Value of the stock subject to the


- ----------------------------

     (1) 262,644 Shares remain unissued under the 1986 Stock Incentive Plan and
3,000,000 additional Shares have been added to the Plan hereunder, contingent
upon the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and approval by the
Company's stockholders at the annual stockholders' meeting in 1996.


                                       -4-
<PAGE>

ISO, and the ISO by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five
years from the date the ISO is granted.

     6.3  The purchase price of each Share subject to an Option shall be fixed
by the Committee, but shall not be less than the greater of the par value of the
Share or 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Share on the date the
Option is granted, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2 with respect to a
10 percent stockholder.

     6.4  Each Option shall expire and all rights to purchase Shares thereunder
shall terminate on the date fixed by the Committee and expressed in the written
instrument evidencing the Option, which date in the case of ISOs shall not be
after the expiration of ten years from the date the Option is granted.

     6.5  Subject to the terms of the Plan each Option shall become exercisable
at the time, and for the number of Shares, fixed by the Committee and expressed
in the written instrument evidencing the Option; provided, however, that during
any fiscal year of the Company, no Grantee shall be granted Options covering
more than 150,000 Shares.  Except to the extent otherwise provided in or
pursuant to Sections 9 and 10, no Option shall become exercisable as to any
Shares prior to the first anniversary of the date on which the Option was
granted.

     6.6  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may at the time of the
Award make all or any portion of Option Shares subject to a Right of First
Refusal for any period of time designated by the Committee in the written
instrument evidencing the Awards.

7.   RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

     7.1  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may also grant
Eligible Employees Restricted Stock Awards.

     7.2  The number of Shares covered thereby and other terms and conditions of
any such Restricted Stock Award, including the period for which and the
conditions on which the Shares included in the Award will be subject to
forfeiture and restrictions on transfer or on the ability of the Grantee to make
elections with respect to the taxation of the Award without the consent of the
Committee, shall be determined by the Committee and expressed in the written
instrument evidencing the Award; provided, however, that during any fiscal year
of the Company, no Grantee shall receive Restricted Stock Awards covering more
than 150,000 Shares.  Except as provided in or pursuant to Sections 9 and 10, no
such restrictions shall lapse earlier than the first, or later than the tenth,
anniversary of the date on which the Award was granted.

     7.3  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may at the time of the
Award make all or portion of the Shares awarded under a Restricted Stock Award
subject to a Right of First Refusal for any period of time designated by the
Committee and expressed in the written instrument evidencing the Award.


                                       -5-
<PAGE>

     7.4  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose performance
restrictions on Restricted Stock Awards as it may deem advisable or appropriate
in accordance with this Section 7.4.

          7.4.1     The Committee may set restrictions based upon (a) the
     achievement of specific performance objectives (Company-wide, divisional or
     individual), (b) applicable Federal or state securities laws, or (c) any
     other basis determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

          7.4.2     For purposes of qualifying Restricted Stock Awards as
     "performance-based compensation" under section 162(m) of the Code, the
     Committee, in its sole discretion, may set restrictions based upon the
     achievement of performance goals.  The performance goals shall be set by
     the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the
     Restricted Stock Awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation"
     under Section 162(m) of the Code.  In granting Restricted Stock Awards that
     are intended to qualify under Code Section 162(m), the Committee shall
     follow any procedures determined by it in its sole discretion from time to
     time to be necessary, advisable or appropriate to ensure qualification of
     the Restricted Stock Awards under Code Section 162(m) (e.g., in determining
     the performance goals).

8.   NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF RIGHTS

     No Option and no rights under any Restricted Stock Award shall be
transferable by the Grantee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution, and each Option may be exercised during the lifetime of the
Grantee only by him; and the written instrument evidencing each Option and each
Restricted Award shall so state.

9.   DEATH OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     9.1  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may make and
include in the written instrument evidencing an Option such provisions
concerning exercise or lapse of the Option on death or termination of employment
as it shall in its discretion determine.  No such provision shall permit an
Option to be exercised prior to six months after the date on which it was
granted, except in the event of death or termination of employment by reason of
disability.

     9.2  No ISO shall be exercisable after the date which is three months
following the Grantee's termination of employment for any reason other than
death or disability, unless (a) the Grantee dies during such three-month period,
and (b) the written instrument evidencing the Award or the Committee permits
later exercise.  No ISO may be exercised more than one year after the Grantee's
termination of employment on account of disability, unless (a) the Grantee dies
during such one-year period and (b) the written instrument evidencing the Award
or the Committee permits later exercise.

     9.3  The effect of death or termination of employment on Shares issuable or
deliverable pursuant to any Restricted Stock Awards shall be as stated in the
written instrument evidencing the Award.


                                       -6-
<PAGE>

     9.4  A transfer of employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or
between Subsidiaries, shall not constitute a termination of employment for
purposes of the Award and the Plan.

10.  PROVISIONS RELATING TO TERMINATION OF THE COMPANY'S SEPARATE EXISTENCE

     The Committee may provide that in the event that the Company is to be
wholly or partially liquidated, or agrees to participate in a merger,
consolidation or reorganization in which it or any entity controlled by it is
not the surviving entity, any or all Options granted under the Plan shall be
immediately exercisable in full and the restrictions relating to any or all
Restricted Stock Awards made under the Plan shall immediately lapse.

11.  WRITINGS EVIDENCING AWARDS

     Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a writing which
may, but need not be, in the form of an agreement to be signed by the Grantee.
The writing shall set forth the nature and size of the Award, its Term, the
other terms and conditions thereof, and such other matters as the Committee
directs.  Acceptance of any benefits of an Award by the Grantee shall be an
assent to the terms and conditions set forth therein, whether or not the writing
is in the form of an agreement signed by the Grantee.

12.  EXERCISE OF RIGHTS UNDER AWARDS

     12.1 A person entitled to exercise an Option may do so only by delivery of
a written notice to that effect specifying the number of Shares with respect to
which the Option is being exercised and any other information which the
Committee has previously prescribed and of which such person has been notified.

     12.2 Such a notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase
price of any Shares to be purchased thereunder, with such payment being made in
cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the Option
equal to the purchase price payable under the Option, or a combination of cash
and Shares, and no Shares shall be issued upon exercise of an Option until full
payment has been made therefor; provided that payment in part or full by the
transfer of Shares to the Company shall be subject to approval by the Committee.

     12.3 Upon exercise of an Option or after grant of a Restricted Award under
which a Right of First Refusal has been required with respect to some or all of
the Shares subject to such Option, or included in the Restricted Stock Award,
the Grantee shall be required to acknowledge, in writing, his or her
understanding of such Right of First Refusal and the legend which shall be
placed on the certificates for such Shares in respect thereof.

     12.4 All notices or requests by a Grantee provided for herein shall be
delivered to the Secretary of the Company.

13.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PLAN AND DURATION


                                       -7-
<PAGE>

     13.1 The Plan shall become effective on September 1, 1995, the date of its
approval by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company,
subject to approval of the stockholders at a meeting duly held in accordance
with applicable law; and subject to approval by any governmental body, the
approval of the Plan by which body is required under applicable law.  No Option
shall be exercisable nor shall any Shares be deliverable under a Restricted
Stock Award prior to receipt of all required approvals.

     13.2 No Awards may be granted under the Plan after September 1, 2005,
although the terms of any Award may be amended at any time prior to the
expiration of the Award in accordance with the Plan.

14.  DATE OF AWARD

     The date of an Award shall be the date on which the Committee's
determination to grant the same is final, or such latter date as shall be
specified by the Committee in connection with such determination.

15.  STOCKHOLDER STATUS

     No person shall have any rights as a stockholder by virtue of the grant of
an Award under the Plan except with respect to Shares actually issued to that
person.

16.  POSTPONEMENT OF EXERCISE

     The Committee may postpone any exercise of an Option or the delivery of any
Shares pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award for such period as the Committee in
its discretion may deem necessary in order to permit the Company (i) to effect
or maintain registration of the Plan or the Shares issuable upon the exercise of
an Option or distributable in satisfaction of a Restricted Stock Award under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any applicable
jurisdiction, (ii) to permit any action to be taken in order to comply with
restrictions or regulations incident to the maintenance of a public market for
its Shares or to list the Shares thereon; or (iii) to determine that such Shares
and the Plan are exempt from such registration or that no action of the kind
referred to in (ii) above need be taken; and the Company shall not be obligated
by virtue of any terms and conditions of any Award or any provision of the Plan
to permit the exercise of an Option to sell or deliver Shares in violation of
the Securities Act of 1933 or other applicable law.  Any such postponement shall
not extend the Term of an Option nor shorten the Term of a restriction
applicable under any Restricted Stock Award; and neither the Company nor its
directors or officers or any of them shall have any obligation or liability to
the Grantee of an Award, to any Successor of a Grantee or to any other person
with respect to any Shares as to which an Option shall lapse because of such
postponement or as to which issuance under a Restricted Stock Award was thereby
delayed.

17.  TERMINATION, SUSPENSION OR MODIFICATION OF PLAN

     The Board may at any time terminate, suspend or modify the Plan, except
that the Board shall not, without authorization of the stockholders of the
Company, effect any change (other than through adjustment for changes in
capitalization as herein provided) which


                                       -8-
<PAGE>

increases the aggregate number of Shares for which Awards may be granted or
sold, materially amends the formula for determining the purchase price of Shares
on which Options may be granted, changes the class of employees eligible to
receive Awards, extends the period during which Awards may be granted or removes
the restrictions set forth in this sentence.

     No termination, suspension or modification of the Plan shall adversely
affect any right acquired by any Grantee or any Successor under an Award granted
before the date of such termination, suspension or modification unless such
Grantee or Successor shall consent thereto.  Adjustments for changes in
capitalization or corporate transactions as provided for herein shall not,
however, be deemed to adversely affect such right.

18.  ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION AND CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS

     Any change in the number of outstanding shares of the Company occurring
through stock splits, combination of shares, recapitalization, or stock
dividends after the adoption of the Plan shall be appropriately reflected in an
increase or decrease in the aggregate number of Shares then available for the
grant of Awards under the Plan, or to become available through the termination,
surrender or lapse of Awards previously granted and in the numbers of Shares
subject to Restricted Stock Awards then outstanding; and appropriate adjustments
shall be made in the per Share option price and/or number of Shares subject to
the Option as to any outstanding Options.  No fractional Shares shall result
from such adjustments.  Similar adjustments shall be made in the event of
distribution of other securities in respect of outstanding Shares or in the
event of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or any other change in the
corporate structure or Shares of the Company, if and to the extent that the
Committee deems such adjustments appropriate.

19.  DELIVERY OF SHARES IN LIEU OF CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS OR DIRECTOR'S FEES

     (a)  Any employee otherwise eligible for an Award under the Plan who is
eligible to receive a cash bonus or incentive payment from the Company under any
management bonus or incentive plan of the Company or entitled to receive a cash
payment for services rendered as a Director, may make application to the
Committee in such manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the Committee
to receive Shares available under the Plan in lieu of all or any portion of such
cash payment.  Such an application may be made by, and approved with respect to,
a member of the Committee.

     (b)  The Committee may in its discretion honor such application by
delivering Shares available under the Plan to such employee, equal in Fair
Market Value on the delivery date to that portion of the cash payment otherwise
payable to the employee under such bonus or incentive plan, or for services
rendered as a Director, for which a Share delivery is to be made in lieu of cash
payment.

     (c)  Any Shares delivered to an employee under this Section shall reduce
the aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance and delivery under the
Plan.


                                       -9-
<PAGE>

     (d)  Such applications and such delivery of Shares shall not be permitted
after the expiration of ten years from the effective date of the Plan.  Delivery
of such Shares shall be deemed to occur on the date certificates therefor are
sent by United States mail or hand-delivered to the recipient.

20.  NON-UNIFORM DETERMINATION PERMISSIBLE

     The Committee's determination under the Plan including, without limitation,
determinations as to the persons to receive Awards, the form, amount and type of
Awards (i.e., ISOs, NQSOs or Restricted Stock Awards), the terms and provisions
of Awards, the written instruments evidencing such Awards, and the granting or
rejecting of applications for delivery of Shares in lieu of cash bonus or
incentive payments or compensation of a Director need not be uniform as among
persons similarly situated and may be made selectively among otherwise eligible
employees or Directors, whether or not such employees or Directors are similarly
situated.

21.  TAXES

     (a)  The Company shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any
withholding tax payable with respect to any Awards or Shares delivered in lieu
of cash payments.  The person entitled to receive Shares pursuant to the Award
will be given notice as far in advance as practicable to permit such cash
payment to be made to the Company.  The Company may defer making delivery of
Shares until indemnified to its satisfaction with respect to any such
withholding tax.

     (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time when a Grantee is required
to pay to the Company an amount required to be withheld under applicable income
tax laws, the Grantee may satisfy this obligation in whole or in part by
electing (the "Election") to have the Company withhold Shares having a value
equal to the amount required to be withheld.  The value of the Shares to be
withheld shall be based on the closing price of the Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined
("Tax Date").  Each election must be made prior to the Tax Date.  The Committee
may disapprove any Election or may suspend or terminate the right to make
Elections.  An Election is irrevocable.

     If the Grantee is a Section 16 Person, then an Election relating to taxes
due upon the exercise of an NQSO is subject to the following additional
restrictions:

          (1)  No Election shall be effective for a Tax Date which occurs within
     six months of the grant of the Option.

          (2)  The Election must be made either six months prior to the Tax Date
     or must be made during a period beginning on the third business day
     following the date of release for publication of the Company's quarterly or
     annual summary statement of sales and earnings and ending on the twelfth
     business day following such date (except that this limitation will not
     apply in the event death or disability of the Grantee occurs prior to the
     expiration of the six month period).


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

          (3)  If the Tax Date is deferred until six months after exercise, the
     full amount of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of
     the Option will be issued and transferred to the Grantee upon exercise, but
     such Grantee shall be unconditionally obliged to tender back to the Company
     the proper number of shares of Common Stock on the Tax Date to satisfy the
     income tax withholding requirements, plus cash for any fractional amount.

22.  TENURE

     An employee's right, if any, to continue in the employ of the Company or a
Subsidiary shall not be affected by the fact that he is a participant under this
Plan; and the Company or Subsidiary shall retain the right to terminate his
employment without regard to the effect such termination may have on any rights
he may have under the Plan.

23.  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

     The proceeds received by the Company from sale of its Shares pursuant to
Options granted under the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.

24.  OTHER ACTIONS

     Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the authority of the
Company to exercise all of its corporate rights and powers, including, by way of
illustration and not by way of limitation, the right to grant Options for proper
corporate purposes otherwise than under the Plan to any employee or any other
person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, or to grant Options to,
or assume Options of, any person in connection with the acquisition by purchase,
lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or any part of the business or
assets of any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity.

          Service and Service under the MPS Plan equaled his
          combined actual years of Credited Service and Service
          under the MPS Plan and the UtiliCorp Plan; provided,
          however, no years of Credited Service and Service
          shall be counted under both the MPS Plan and UtiliCorp
          Plan for the same period of employment; and

               (iii)     the provision of the MPS Plan as of
          July 31, 1988 (including those provisions reducing the
          Employee's accrued benefit in the event his retirement
          benefits commenced prior to his attainment of age (62)
          remained unchanged.

               (b) An amount equal to the sum of:

                    (i)  the present value of the Employee's
          accrued benefits under the UtiliCorp Plan as of the
          time of the commencement of monthly retirement income
          to the Employee under said Plan, calculated in accor-
          dance with the provisions of the UtiliCorp Plan, (in-
          cluding those provisions reducing the Employee's
          accrued benefit in the event his retirement benefits
          commence prior to his attainment of age 62); and

                    (ii) the value of the Employee's plan
          account(s) in the UtiliCorp United Inc. Employee Stock
          Ownership Plan (ESOP), determined as of the valuation
          date next preceding the Employee's termination of
          employment with the Corporation.  The fair market
          value of Corporation common stock or other employer
          securities in the Employee's ESOP plan account(s)
          shall be determined in the same manner for purposes of
          this Agreement as under the ESOP.

     (B)  An amount equal to the excess of (a) over (b):

               (a)  An amount equal to the present value of the
     Employee's accrued benefits under the UtiliCorp Plan as of
     the time of the commencement of monthly retirement income
     under the UtiliCorp Plan, calculated in accordance with the prov-
     isions reducing the Employee's accrued benefit in the event
     his monthly retirement income commences prior to his
     attainment of age (62), but with the addition of 6.74 years
     of benefit accrual service (Credited Service).

               (b)  An amount equal to the present value of the
          Employee's accrued benefits under the UtiliCorp Plan as of
          the time of the commencement of monthly retirement income
          under the UtiliCorp Plan, Calculated in accordance with the
          provisions of the UtiliCorp Plan (including those pro-
          visions reducing the Employee's accrued benefit in the
          event his monthly retirement income commences prior to his
          attainment of age 62).

          For purposes of this paragraph, the present value of the
     Employee's accrued benefits shall be calculated using the same
     interest rate assumption as is used for determining the actu-
     arial value of benefits under the UtiliCorp Plan as of the time
     monthly retirement income commences to the Employee under the
     UtiliCorp Plan.

          2.   EFFECT OF EARLY ESOP DISTRIBUTIONS.

               Notwithstanding subparagraph 1(A) (b) (ii),  if the Employee
     should receive a distribution from the ESOP prior to the time
     monthly retirement income commences to the Employee under the
     UtiliCorp Plan, the value of such distribution determined as of the
     date of the distribution shall be added to the total amount
     described in subparagraph 1(A) (b) in determining the amount of the
     Employee's supplemental retirement benefit.

          3.   PAYMENT OF BENEFITS.

               No benefit payments will commence under this Agreement prior
     to the Employee's termination of employment with the Corporation.
     Benefits under this Agreement shall be paid by the Corporation in
     the same manner and at or about the time benefits are paid to the
     Employee under the UtiliCorp Plan in accordance with elections made
     by the Employee under the UtiliCorp Plan.  Such benefit payments
     shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount described in para-
     graph 1 using the same assumptions for determining actuarial equiva-
     lents as described in the UtiliCorp Plan at the time of the Em-
     ployee's retirement.

          4.   DEATH BENEFITS FOR SPOUSE.

               Should the Employee die before the commencement of monthly
     retirement income under the UtiliCorp Plan, a monthly benefit shall
     be payable to his surviving spouse, if any, for her life, commencing
     as of the date that death benefits commence to the spouse under the
     UtiliCorp Plan.  The amount of such monthly benefit shall be equal
     to 50% of the monthly benefit that would have been payable to the
     Employee under this Agreement during his lifetime had he elected to
     retire as of the date of his death and receive payments under the
     UtiliCorp Plan in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity with
     his surviving spouse as beneficiary.

          5.   NO CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.

          Nothing contained herein shall be construed to be a contract
     of employment for any term of years, nor as conferring upon the Em-
     ployee the right to continue in the employ of the Corporation in his
     present capacity, or in any other capacity.

          6.   BENEFITS PAYABLE ONLY FROM CORPORATE ASSETS.

               (a)  Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action
     taken pursuant to its provisions by either party shall create or be
     construed to create, a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship
     between the Corporation and the Employee or any other person.

               (b)  The payments to the Employee or his surviving spouse
     shall be made from assets which shall continue for all purposes to
     be a part of the general assets of the Corporation and no person
     shall acquire any interest in such assets by virtue of this Agree-
     ment.  To the extent the Employee or his surviving spouse acquires a
     right to receive payments from the Corporation under this Agreement,
     such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured gen-
     eral creditor of the Corporation.

          7.   NON-ASSIGNABILITY OF BENEFITS.

               Neither the Employee nor his spouse shall have the power or
     right to transfer, assign, anticipate, hypothecate or otherwise en-
     cumber all or any part of the amounts payable by the Corporation
     hereunder.  Such amounts shall not be subject to seizure by any
     creditor of the Employee, by a proceeding at law or in equity, nor
     transferable by operation of law in the event of bankruptcy, insol-
     vency or death of the Employee or his spouse.  Notwithstanding any
     provision to the contrary in this Agreement, any such attempted
     assignment, transfer or encumbrance shall be void.

          8.   AMENDMENT.

               This Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified, ex-
     cept by a written instrument signed by both parties and may not be
     terminated, except as provided herein.

          9.   GOVERNING LAW.

               This Agreement, and the rights of the parties hereunder,
     shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
     the State of Missouri.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement, in
     duplicate, as of the date first written above.

                SEVERANCE COMPENSATION AGREEMENT


     This Agreement is effective as of the date it is signed by
both UTILICORP UNITED INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and _________________________________________________
("Executive").

     WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors has determined
that it is appropriate to reinforce and encourage the continued
attention and dedication of members of the Company's management,
including the Executive, to their assigned duties without
distraction in potentially disturbing circumstances arising from
the possibility of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 2
below) of the Company or a Spin-Off affecting Executive (as
defined in Section 3 below) of a business unit of the Company;
and

     WHEREAS, this Agreement sets forth the severance
compensation to which the Executive will be entitled upon certain
conditions if the Executive's employment with the Company or a
Spin-Off Purchaser (as defined in Section 3) terminates following
a Change in Control or a Spin-Off.

     1.   TERM.  This Agreement shall terminate, except to the
extent that any obligation of the Company hereunder remains
unpaid as of such time, upon the earliest of (a) three years from
the date hereof if a Change in Control or a Spin-Off affecting
Executive has not occurred within such three-year period;
provided that the term of this Agreement shall be automatically
extended for an additional year upon each anniversary of the date
hereof until a party provides notice to the other party that such
automatic extention shall cease, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate at the end of the then existing three-year term;
(b) the termination of the Executive's employment prior to a
Change in Control or a Spin-Off affecting Executive by the
Company or the Executive for any reason, with or without Cause
(as defined in Section 4(c) below); (c) the Executive's death;
(d) the termination of the Executive's employment following a
Change in Control or a Spin-Off affecting Executive by the
Company, or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be, for
Cause, or as a result of the Executive's Disability (as defined
in Section 4(a) below), or Retirement (as defined in Section 4(b)
below); (e) the termination of the Executive's employment
following a Change in Control or a Spin-Off affecting Executive
by the Executive for any reason other than for Good Reason (as
defined in Section 4(d) below; or (f) three years from the date
of a Change in Control of the Company or one year from the date
of a Spin-Off affecting Executive.

     2.   CHANGE IN CONTROL.  For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) there
shall be consummated (x) any reorganization, consolidation or
merger of the Company in which the Company is not the continuing

<PAGE>

or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the
Company's Voting Securities (as defined below) would be converted
into cash, securities or other property, other than a
reorganization, consolidation or merger of the Company in which
the holders of the Company's Voting Securities immediately prior
to the reorganization, consolidation or merger own at least 66
2/3% of the Voting Securities of the surviving corporation
immediately after the reorganization, consolidation or merger, or
(y) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one
transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or
substantially all, of the assets of the Company; (ii) the holders
of the Voting Securities of the Company approve any plan or
proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; (iii)
any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act")), shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the
Company's outstanding Voting Securities (other than as a result
of an acquisition directly from the Company); provided, that no
acquisition by the Company, its affiliates, or any employee
benefit plan of the Company or its affiliates shall be deemed to
constitute a Change in Control; (iv) at the time that individuals
who, as of the date hereof, constitute the board of directors of
the Company (as of the date hereof, the "Incumbent Board") cease
for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board,
provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the
date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the
Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board
(other than an election or nomination of an individual whose
initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or
threatened election contest relating to the election of the
directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11
of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be,
for purposes of this Agreement, considered as though such person
were a member of the Incumbent Board; or (v) the occurrence of
any other event which the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion
determines constitutes a Change in Control.  For purposes of this
Agreement, "Voting Securities" of a person means equity
securities or equity interests having a general right to vote for
election of the members of the board of directors or managers of
such person.

the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion to be a separate
business unit at the time of the Disposition.

                              -2-
<PAGE>

     (c)  "Disposition" means any of the following: (i) there
shall be consummated (x) any reorganization, consolidation or
merger of the Business Unit following which the Company owns,
directly and indirectly, less than 50% of the Voting Securities
of the Business Unit (if the Business Unit was prior to such
transaction a subsidiary of the Company), or (y) any sale, lease,
exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of
related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets
of the Business Unit; (ii) the holders of the Voting Securities
of the Business Unit approve any plan or proposal for the
liquidation or dissolution of the Business Unit (unless such
Business Unit continues to function as an unincorporated Business
Unit within the Company, as determined by the Incumbent Board in
its sole discretion); or (iii) the occurrence of any other event
which the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines
constitutes a Spin-Off affecting Executive.

merger involving a Business Unit which is a direct or indirect
subsidiary of the Company, the surviving corporation of the

     4.   OTHER DEFINITIONS.

     (a)  DISABILITY.  The term "Disability" as used in this
Agreement shall mean the Executive's incapacity due to physical
or mental illness which shall have caused the Executive to have
been absent from his or her duties with the Company or the Spin-
Off Purchaser, as the case may be, on a full-time basis for six
months and the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time
performance of the Executive's duties within 30 days after
written Notice of Termination (as defined in paragraph 4(e)
below) has been given by the Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser,
as the case may be.

     (b)  RETIREMENT.  The term "Retirement" as used in this
Agreement shall mean termination by the Company or the Executive
of the Executive's employment based on the  Executive's having
retired pursuant to the then existing retirement plan of the
Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be, at or
after age 65 or by any agreement between the Company or the Spin-
Off Purchaser, as the case may be, and the Executive, or by any
generally applicable retirement policy of the Company or the
Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be.

     (c)  CAUSE.  The term "Cause" as used in this Agreement
shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by the Executive
to substantially perform his or her duties of employment with
Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be (other than
any such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to

                                -3-
<PAGE>

physical or mental illness), unless the Executive uses reasonable
efforts to correct such failure within a reasonable time after
demand for substantial performance is delivered by the Company or
the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be, that specifically
identifies the manner in which the Company or the Spin-Off
Purchaser, as the case may be, believes the Executive has not
substantially performed his or her duties, (ii) the willful
misconduct by the Executive which materially injures the Company
or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be, monetarily or
otherwise, or (iii) conviction of, or entry of a plea of NOLO
CONTENDERE with regard to, any felony or any crime involving
moral turpitude or dishonesty of or by the Executive.  For
purposes of this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on the
Executive's part shall be considered "willful" unless done, or
omitted to be done, by him or her not in good faith and without
reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Company or the Spin-Off
Purchaser, as the case may be.

     (d)  GOOD REASON.

          (i)  For purposes of this Agreement "Good Reason" shall

     from time to time during the term of this Agreement, or the
     Company's failure to increase (within 12 months of the
     Executive's last increase in base salary) the Executive's
     base salary after such Change in Control in an amount which
     at least equals, on a percentage basis, the average
     percentage increase in base salary for the Executive during
     the three-year period immediately preceding the Change in
     Control;

               (C)   any failure by the Company to continue in
     effect any benefit plan or arrangement such as health, life
     and disability insurance in which the Executive was
     participating at the time of the Change in Control, or other
     material fringe benefits (such as SERPs, deferred
     compensation plans, or 401(k) plans) enjoyed by the

     materially reduce the Executive's benefits under any such
     Benefit Plans, taken in the aggregate;

               (D)  any failure by the Company to continue in
     effect any incentive plan or arrangement, such as bonus or

     substantially consistent with the Executive's business
     travel obligations at the time of the Change in Control;

     to any place outside of the metropolitan area in which the
     Executive performed the Executive's duties prior to the
     Spin-Off, except for required travel by the Executive on the
     Company's business to an extent substantially consistent
     with the Executive's business travel obligations at the time
     of the Spin-Off;

               (F)  any reduction in the number of paid vacation
     days per year to which the Executive was entitled
     immediately preceding the Spin-Off;

               (G)   any material breach by the Company or the
     Spin-Off Purchaser of any provision of this Agreement;

               (H)  any failure by the Company to obtain the
     assumption of this Agreement by the Spin-Off Purchaser; or

               (I)  any purported termination of the Executive's
     employment which is not effected pursuant to a Notice of
     Termination satisfying the requirements of Section 4(e), and
     for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported
     termination shall be effective.

     (e)  NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any termination of the
Executive's employment due to the Executive's Disability or
Retirement, or for Cause, shall be effected pursuant to a Notice
of Termination conforming to the requirements of this section.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall
mean a written notice which shall indicate those specific
termination provisions in this Agreement relied upon and which
sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's
employment.  For purposes of this Agreement, no such purported
termination shall be effective without such Notice of
Termination.

     (f)  DATE OF TERMINATION.  "Date of Termination" shall mean
(i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Executive for Good
Reason, the date Executive delivers notice of such termination to
the Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be; (ii)
if Executive's employment is terminated by the Company or the
Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case may be, for Disability, 30 days
after Notice of Termination is given to the Executive (provided
that the Executive shall not have offered to return and is able
to return to the performance of the Executive's duties on a full-
time basis during such 30-day period) or (iii) if the Executive's
employment is terminated by the Company or the Spin-Off
Purchaser, as the case may be, for any other reason, the date on
which a Notice of Termination is given.

     5.   SEVERANCE COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
The Executive shall be entitled to payments and other benefits as
set forth in Sections 5(a) and 5(b) upon the occurrence of any of
the following: (x) within three years following a Change in
Control, the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment
other than for Disability, Retirement, or Cause, or, within such
three-year period, the Executive shall terminate his or her
employment for Good Reason; (y) in connection with a Spin-Off

                              -7-
<PAGE>

affecting Executive where the Executive does not become employed
by the Spin-Off Purchaser, the Company shall, at or within one
year following such Spin-Off, terminate the Executive's
employment other than for Disability, Retirement, or Cause, or
the Executive shall terminate his or her employment for any of
the grounds defined as "Good Reason" in Section 4(d)(i) (other
than the grounds set forth in Section 4(d)(i)(A)); provided that
the Company shall have no liability to Executive in the event
that the Spin-Off Purchaser shall have offered employment to
Executive on terms which would not give Executive grounds to
terminate his or her employment for Good Reason pursuant to
Section 4(d)(ii) (any such termination by the Company, where the
Executive does not receive such an offer from the Spin-Off
Purchaser, shall be referred to herein as a "Spin-Off
Termination"); or (z) within one year following a Spin-Off
affecting the Executive, the Spin-Off Purchaser shall terminate
the Executive's employment other than for Disability, Retirement,
or Cause, or within such one-year period, the Executive shall
terminate his or her employment for Good Reason.  Except as
specifically provided in this Section 5, the Executive shall have
no right to receive compensation under this Agreement.
Termination of employment due to death shall not give rise to any
rights to compensation under this Agreement.  In the case of (x)
and (y) above, the Company shall be liable to make such payments
and provide such benefits, and in the case of (z) above, the
Spin-Off Purchaser shall be liable to make such payments and
provide such benefits (except that in the case of (z) above the
Company shall be bound by the provisions of Section 5(b)(ii)(A)).

     (a)  SEVERANCE PAY.  The Company, or the Spin-Off Purchaser,
as the case may be, shall pay as severance pay in a lump sum, in
cash, on the fifth business day following the Date of
Termination, an amount equal to:

          (i)  In the event that such termination follows a
     Change in Control, 2.99 times the average of the aggregate
     annual compensation includable for Federal income tax
     purposes as gross income paid to the Executive by the
     Company and any of its subsidiaries during the five calendar
     years ending immediately before the Change in Control (the
     "Executive's Average Annual Compensation") (provided, that
     if the Executive was not employed by the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries for the entire duration of such five-year
     period, the "Executive's Average Annual Compensation" shall
     be the annualized average of the Executive's aggregate
     compensation includable for Federal income tax purposes as
     gross income paid by the Company and any of its subsidiaries
     during the portion of such five-year period during which the
     Executive was employed by the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries); and

          (ii) In the event that such termination is in
     connection with or follows a Spin-Off, 1.0 times the
     Executive's Average Annual Compensation.

                               -8-
<PAGE>

     (b)  OTHER BENEFITS.  In addition to compensation set forth
in Section 5(a) hereof, subject to the provisions and limitations
set forth below, the Executive shall be entitled to the following
benefits from the Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as the case
may be:

     (i)  In the event of termination of Executive's employment
     following a Change in Control, or in the event of a Spin-Off
     Termination of Executive, the following benefits shall be
     provided to Executive:

          (A)   Commencing on the Date of Termination and for a
     period of three months thereafter, the Executive may
     exercise all stock options granted to the Executive pursuant
     to the Company's Stock Incentive Plan or any such other
     stock plan.  Such stock options shall be exercisable whether
     or not: (i) a period of one year has elapsed from the date
     of grant to the date of exercise; or (ii) any installment
     exercise terms as stipulated by the Committee in any
     agreement issued under the Plan have been satisfied.
     However, in no event shall the Executive exercise any stock
     option after the expiration of the option period as
     stipulated in an agreement issued under such Plan;

          (B)  Effective as of the Date of Termination, any
     restrictions relating to stock awards under the Company's
     Stock Incentive Plan shall lapse;

          (C)  Effective as of the Date of Termination, any
     compensation which has been deferred will be paid upon
     termination; and

          (D)  Effective as of the Date of Termination, the
     Executive will be immediately vested in any long term
     incentive compensation under any long term incentive plan of
     the Company.

     (ii) In the event of termination of Executive's employment
     by the Spin-Off Purchaser following a Spin-Off, the
     following benefits shall be provided to Executive:

          (A)  If Executive's employment by the Spin-Off
     Purchaser is terminated within three months after the
     termination of Executive's employment by the Company,
     commencing on the Date of Termination and for the remainder
     of the period of three months following the termination of
     Executive's employment by the Company, the Executive may
     exercise all stock options granted to the Executive pursuant
     to the Company's Stock Incentive Plan or any such other
     stock plan.  Such stock options shall be exercisable whether
     or not: (i) a period of one year has elapsed from the date
     of grant to the date of exercise; or (ii) any installment
     exercise terms as stipulated by the Committee in any
     agreement issued under the Plan have been satisfied.
     However, in no event shall the Executive exercise any stock
     option after the expiration of the option period as
     stipulated in an agreement issued under such Plan];

                              -9-
<PAGE>

          (B)  If Executive's employment by the Spin-Off
     Purchaser is terminated more than three months after the
     termination of Executive's employment by the Company, the
     Spin-Off Purchaser shall pay to the Executive, in cash, the
     amount determined by multiplying (x) the number of stock
     options granted to the Executive pursuant to the Company's
     Stock Incentive Plan or any such other stock plan which
     Executive did not have the right to exercise upon the
     termination of his or her employment by the Company (other
     than stock options with respect to which the option period
     as stipulated in an agreement issued under said Plan had
     expired), by (y) the difference between (A) the closing
     price for the Company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange
     on the day of the termination of Employee's Employment by
     the Company and (B) the average exercise price of such
     options;

          (C)  The Spin-Off Purchaser shall pay to the Executive,
     in cash, the amount determined by multiplying (x) the number
     of shares of stock which had been awarded to the Executive
     pursuant to the Company's Stock Incentive Plan, but which
     were restricted and which Executive forfeited due to the
     termination of his or her employment with the Company, by
     (y) the closing price for the Company's stock on the New
     York Stock Exchange on the day of the termination of
     Employee's employment by the Company;

          (D)  The Spin-Off Purchaser shall pay to the Executive,
     in cash, the amount of any deferred compensation forfeited
     by the Executive due to the termination of his or her
     employment with the Company; and

          (E)  The Spin-Off Purchaser shall pay to the Executive,
     in cash, the amount of any long term incentive compensation
     under any long term incentive plan of the Company forfeited
     by the Executive due to the termination of his or her
     employment with the Company.


     (iii)     Effective as of the Date of Termination, the
     Company (in the case of a termination following a Change in
     Control or a Spin-Off Termination, or the Spin-Off
     Purchaser, in the case of termination of the Executive
     following employment by the Spin-Off Purchaser) will provide
     a benefit under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
     Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA") and Section 4980 of the
     Code, as follows: the Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as
     the case may be, shall pay the percentage of the cost of
     COBRA coverage with respect to the Executive's coverage
     status (e.g., individual or family coverage) in effect
     immediately prior to the Date of Termination for the maximum
     period of continuation coverage then required or permitted
     under COBRA, which percentage shall be the fraction
     (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which shall be
     the difference between (x) the monthly cost of COBRA
     coverage for the Executive's coverage status in effect
     immediately prior to the Date of Termination and (y) the
     Executive's monthly contribution toward the Executive's
     coverage in effect immediately prior to the Date of
     Termination, and the denominator of which shall be the
     monthly cost of COBRA coverage for the Executive's coverage

                                 -10-
<PAGE>

     status in effect immediately prior the Date of Termination.
     All of such amounts shall be determined as of the day
     immediately preceding the Date of Termination.  The
     insurance continuation benefits paid for hereunder shall be
     deemed to be a part of the Executive's COBRA coverage.  In
     addition, in the event of termination following a Change in
     Control, the Company shall, beginning at the expiration of
     the Executive's COBRA continuation coverage under this
     paragraph and continuing until three (3) years after the
     Date of Termination, provide the Executive with health
     insurance coverage at the same cost to the Executive and at
     the same level of coverage for the Executive as the COBRA
     continuation coverage in effect immediately prior to the
     expiration of the Executive's COBRA continuation coverage.
     The Company shall, at the Executive's option, contribute
     amounts it is required to contribute on behalf of Executive
     pursuant to this Section 5(b) (iii) either to: (A) plans
     maintained for the Company's employees; or (B) a private
     medical plan of the Executive's choice if the Executive
     chooses not to participate in the plans referred to in (A).
     All such benefits shall be in addition to any other benefits
     relating to health or medical care benefits that are
     available under the Company's policies to the Executive
     following termination of employment.

     (iv) An additional cash payment shall be made as follows:

          (A)  In the event of termination of Executive's
     employment following a Change in Control,  the Company will
     pay to the Executive, in cash, at the time the Company makes
     the payments required under Section 5(a), an amount equal to
     the sum of the annual incentive paid to the Executive in
     each of the immediately preceding two calendar years; or

          (B)  The Company, in the event of a Spin-Off
     Termination of Executive, or the Spin-Off Purchaser, in the
     event of termination of Executive's employment by the Spin-
     Off Purchaser following a Spin-Off, will pay to the
     Executive, in cash, at the time the Company or the Spin-Off
     Purchaser, as the case may be, makes the payments required
     under Section 5(a), an amount equal to the sum of the annual
     incentive paid to the Executive in the immediately preceding
     calendar year.
                                 -11-

     (c)  REDUCTION OF PAYMENTS.

          (i)  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
     notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that
     any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the
     benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable or
     distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be nondeductible
     by the Company for Federal income tax purposes because of
     Section 280G of the Code, then the aggregate present value
     of amounts payable or distributable as severance benefits
     hereunder shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount.  The
     "Reduced Amount" shall be an amount expressed in present
     value which maximizes the aggregate present value of such
     severance benefits without causing any Payment to be
     nondeductible by the Company because of Section 280G of the
     Code.  Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, if the
     Reduced Amount is zero and it is determined further that any
     Payment which is not part of the severance benefits payable
     hereunder would nevertheless be nondeductible by the Company
     for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of
     the Code, then the aggregate present value of Payments which
     are not severance benefits under this Agreement shall also
     be reduced (but not below zero) to an amount expressed in
     present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of
     Payments without causing any payment to be nondeductible by
     the Company because of Section 280G of the Code.  For
     purposes of this paragraph 5, present value shall be
     determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the
     Code.

          (ii) All determinations required to be made under this
     paragraph 5 shall be made by an accounting firm jointly
     selected by the Executive and the Company (the "Accounting
     Firm") and paid by the Company; provided that the Company
     shall have the right to appoint the Company's independent
     auditors to make such determinations, and such appointment
     shall be final.  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed
     supporting calculations both to the Company and the
     Executive within 15 business days of the Date of Termination
     or such earlier time as is requested by the Company and an
     opinion to the Executive that he or she has substantial
     authority not to report any excise tax on his Federal income
     tax return with respect to any Payments.  Any such
     determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon
     the Company and the Executive.  The Executive shall
     determine which and how much of the Payments, shall be
     eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of
     this paragraph 5, provided that, if the Executive does not
     make such determination within ten business days of the
     receipt of the calculations made by the Accounting Firm, the
     Company shall elect which and how much of the Payments shall
     be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of
     this paragraph 5 and shall notify the Executive promptly of
     such election; and provided further that any Payments which
     do not constitute gross income to the Executive shall not be
     reduced or eliminated unless all other Payments have first
     been eliminated.  Within five business days thereafter, the
     Company shall pay to or distribute to or for the benefit of
     the Executive such amounts as are then due to the Executive
     under this Agreement.
                                 -12-
<PAGE>

          (iii)  As a result of the uncertainty in the
     application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the
     initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it
     is possible that Payments will have been made by the Company
     which should not have been made ("Overpayment") or that
     Payments will not have been made by the Company which could
     have been made ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent
     with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In the
     event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of
     a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the
     Executive or the Company which the Accounting Firm believes
     has a high probability of success, determines that an
     Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or
     distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the
     Executive shall be treated for all purposes as a loan AB
     INITIO to the Executive which the Executive shall repay to
     the Company together with interest at the applicable federal
     rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code;
     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such loan shall be deemed to have
     been made and no amount shall be payable to the Company if
     and to the extent such deemed loan and payment would not
     either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject
     to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or
     generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that the
     Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other
     substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has
     occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by
     the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together
     with interest at 120% of the applicable federal rate
     provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, compounded
     semiannually.

     (iv) In the event that a reduction of benefits and payments
     is required pursuant to this section (c), the Company shall,
     to the extent practicable and permitted without causing any
     Overpayment, permit the Executive to select which payments
     and benefits provided for hereunder will be paid as provided
     by the Company to the Executive.

     6.   NO OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DAMAGES; NO EFFECT ON OTHER
CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS.

     (a)  The Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages
or the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by
seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of
any payment provided for under this  Agreement be reduced by any
compensation earned by the Executive as the result of employment
by another employer after the Date of Termination, or otherwise.

                             -13-
<PAGE>

     (b)  The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment
provided for hereunder, shall not reduce any amounts otherwise
payable, or in any way diminish the Executive's existing rights,
or rights which would accrue solely as a result of the passage of
time, under any Benefit Plan, Incentive Plan or Securities Plan,
employment agreement or other contract, plan or arrangement.

     7.   SUCCESSOR TO THE COMPANY.

     (a)  The Company will require any successor or assign
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company or in the event of a Spin-Off that may
affect the Executive's employment with the Company, by agreement
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive,
expressly, absolutely and unconditionally to assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
that the Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession or assignment had taken place.  Any failure of the
Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of
any such succession or assignment shall be a material breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to terminate the
Executive's employment for Good Reason.  As used in this
Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore
defined and any successor or assign to its business and/or assets
as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided
for in this Section 8 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.  If
at any time during the term of this Agreement the Executive is
employed by any corporation, a majority of the Voting Securities
of which is then owned by the Company, or other entity of which a
majority of the Voting Securities is owned by the Company,
"Company" as used in Sections 4, 5, 13 and 14 hereof shall in
addition include such employer.  In such event, the Company
agrees that it shall pay or shall cause such employer to pay any
amounts owed to the Executive pursuant to Section 5 hereof.

     (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal and legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs,
distributees, devisees and legatees.  If the Executive should die
while any amounts are still payable to him or her hereunder, all
such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's
devisee, legatee, or other designee, or if there be no such
designee, to the Executive's estate.  The services to be provided
by the Executive to the Company under this Agreement are personal
and are not delegable or assignable.

     8.   NOTICE.  For purposes of this Agreement, notices and
all other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered or mailed by United States certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, as follows:

          the Executive on the books of the Company.

     Another address may be used if a party has furnished a
different address to the other party in writing in accordance
herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be
effective only upon receipt.

     9.   SOLE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement represents the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the matters
contemplated herein.  Any earlier agreement relating to severance
compensation between the parties or between the Executive and any
affiliate of the Company is hereby terminated and superseded, and
all obligations by either party thereunder shall cease
immediately preceding the commencement of the term of this
Agreement and are hereby agreed to be satisfied in full.  No
agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or
implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made
by either party which are not set forth expressly in this
Agreement.

     10.  VALIDITY.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which
shall remain in full force and effect.

     11.  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument.

     12.  LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company, or, in the event
of a Spin-Off affecting Executive in which the Spin-Off Purchaser
employs the Executive, the Spin-Off Purchaser, shall pay all
legal fees and expenses which the Executive reasonably may incur
as a result of the Company's or the Spin-Off Purchaser's (as the
case may be) contesting the validity, enforceability or the
Executive's interpretation of, or determinations under, this
Agreement.

     13.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  The Executive agrees not to
disclose during the term hereof or thereafter any of the
Company's confidential or trade secret information, except as
required by law.  The Executive recognizes that the Executive
shall be employed in a sensitive position in which, as a result
of a relationship of trust and confidence, the Executive will

                              -15-
<PAGE>

have access to trade secrets and other highly confidential and
sensitive information.  The Executive further recognizes that the
knowledge and informed acquired by the Executive concerning the
Company's materials regarding employer/employee contracts,
customers, pricing schedules, advertising and interviewing
techniques, manuals, systems, procedures and forms represent the
most vital part of the Company's business and constitute by their
very nature, trade secrets and confidential knowledge and
information.  The Executive hereby stipulates and agrees that all
such information and materials shall be considered trade secrets
and confidential information.  If it is at any time determined
that any of the information or materials identified in this
paragraph 14 are, in whole or in part, not entitled to protection
as trade secrets, they shall nevertheless be considered and
treated as confidential information in the same manner as trade
secrets, to the maximum extent permitted by law.  The Executive
further agrees that all such trade secrets or other confidential
information, and any copy, extract or summary thereof, whether
originated or prepared by or for the Executive or otherwise
coming into the Executive's knowledge, possession, custody, or
control, shall be and remain the exclusive property of the
Company.

     14.  WITHHOLDING.  The Company or the Spin-Off Purchaser, as
the case may be, may withhold from any benefits payable under
this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as shall
be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or
ruling.

     15.  ARBITRATION.  Any claim or controversy arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any breach thereof shall be
settled by arbitration.  Any such arbitration shall take place in
Kansas City, Missouri, in accordance with the rules of the
