                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

         Zale Corporation (the "Company"), founded in 1924, is the nation's
largest chain of specialty retail jewelry stores, operating 1,177 retail
locations at July 31, 1995.  For the twelve months ended July 31, 1995, total
Company retail sales were approximately $1,036.1 million.  The Company sells
jewelry and giftware throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam through
its Zales, Gordon's, Guild and Diamond Park Divisions.  The Company operates
stores primarily in regional shopping malls and leased departments in
department stores.  Merchandise is sold for cash, on the Company's private
label credit cards and on bank and national credit and charge cards.  The
Company also markets credit insurance to its private label credit card
customers.

         The Company historically has purchased substantially all of its
merchandise in finished form from a network of established suppliers and
manufacturers located primarily in the United States, the Orient and Italy.
The Company is also centrally purchasing certain commodity items such as gold
chains direct from manufacturers or other primary sources.  A portion of the
merchandise offered by the Company is procured from vendors under consignment
programs through which the Company is not obligated to pay for the merchandise
until it is sold to retail customers.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

         The Company's goal in fiscal 1995 was to restore Zale Corporation as
the pre-eminent fine jewelry retailer in the nation.  To accomplish this task,
the Company developed a three-phase plan, starting with getting back to the
basics of retailing.  That meant understanding and satisfying customers' needs,
offering the right selection and quality of merchandise, and pursuing an
effective and efficient marketing strategy.  It also entailed paying close
attention to the Company's store environment and operations, especially in
improving customer service.

         A major element of the Company's three-phase plan was to strengthen
the merchandising in the stores. The Company developed a core group of items
which have been perennial best-sellers.  These items include tennis bracelets,
diamond anniversary bands and diamond stud earrings.  The Company made certain
that these key items were available in a variety of styles and began to fill
out the assortments with "good, better and best" price points.  The Company has
been diligent about maintaining a depth of stock on these key items at all
times versus the traditional approach of having one or two pieces per store.
Inventory management systems have been structured so that key items would be
more consistently in stock and systems have been developed for prompt
replenishment of key items.

         Consistent with the Company's new merchandising plan, the Company
began to make its marketing efforts more product-focused.  Print, television
and radio advertising feature selected key items in a variety of price points.
The Company has broadened its advertising beyond the Christmas season, to tie
in with other gift-giving holidays such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.
In-store promotions have been synchronized to take advantage of high mall
traffic periods.  These strategies have helped to position Zales and Gordon's
as gift-giving destinations.

         After refining the merchandise mix and marketing, the Company worked
to improve the quality of service and the efficiency of the stores.  The
Company focused initially on the top 300 stores in the Zales and Gordon's
Divisions, moving the most experienced and capable managers into these stores.
The Company also modified staff scheduling to put more sales personnel "on the
floor" during peak traffic periods and introduced more extensive training in
sales techniques and customer relationship building in all of its stores.  The
"focus" group of stores also received an increased level of merchandise and
marketing support.  As a result, the focus group stores outperformed the rest
of the chain.

         A majority of the Company's stores are situated in prime, centercourt
mall locations or other high traffic areas of shopping malls.  Beginning in
late fiscal 1994 and continuing into fiscal 1995, the Company set out to
establish separate identities for its Zales and Gordon's brand names.
Previously managed by a single team, the two divisions were placed under
separate management teams.  New divisional management was brought in to the
Zales, Gordon's and Guild divisions to create and implement an individualized
merchandising approach.  Different marketing techniques have been adopted,
targeted toward each division's specific demographic base.  At the same time,
the Company is committed to enhancing the cost and efficiency benefits of
centralized support operations.





                                       1
<PAGE>   3




         The Company offers credit through its own private label credit cards
to enable creditworthy customers to finance their purchases without using cash
or bank card lines of credit.  The Company seeks to establish a relationship
with its customers through merchandise and credit card programs that encourages
repeat purchases of fashion and gift items as well as substantial purchases on
occasions such as engagements, anniversaries, Christmas, birthdays, graduations
and other gift-giving holidays.  Through mailing lists available from the
Company's credit operations, the Company can mail promotional material directly
to customers to advertise special sales or unique items that are offered in its
stores.  The Company encourages customers with major credit cards to apply for
a Company credit card even when no purchase is made.  This enables the Company
to solicit new business from those customers by direct mailings.  The Company
believes that this program enhances future sales to customers with a strong
credit history.

         As part of the Company's business strategy, it has embarked on a store
remodeling and refurbishment program.  This program will enable the Company to
enhance its stores in certain key markets relative to its competition.
Additionally, the Company plans on making expenditures of approximately $15.0
million on its management information systems to migrate to client server based
applications from mainframe applications over the next several years.  The
Company anticipates spending approximately $50.0 million on capital
expenditures in fiscal 1996.  Capital expenditures are typically scheduled for
the late spring through early fall in order to have new or renovated stores
ready for the Christmas selling season.  During the year ended July 31, 1995,
the Company made approximately $42.3 million in capital expenditures
principally to open 18 new stores and enhance the appearance of 393 stores.
This included 153 relocations, complete remodelings or major refurbishments and
240 stores that were enhanced through addition of either or all of new carpet,
paint and new wall coverings and display elements.  The Company intends to
continue its store upgrade program and open 250 new locations over the next
three years.

        Diamond Park Division

        At August 1, 1995, the Diamond Park Division operated 188 leased
locations in department stores including Dillard's(R) (66 locations),
Mercantile (59 locations), The Broadway(R) (41 locations), and Marshall
Field's(R) (22 locations) in 24 states.  The Diamond Park Division offers a
service for retailers that wish to turn to an outside provider for specialized
management and marketing skills required to sell fine jewelry.  The Diamond
Park Division creates leased jewelry departments at specified locations,
primarily major department stores, tailoring the merchandising concept to that
of the host company.

BUSINESSES OF NON-RETAIL AFFILIATES

         Zale Indemnity Company, Zale Life Insurance Company and Jewel
Re-Insurance Ltd. are providers of various types of insurance coverage, which
typically are marketed to the Company's private label credit card customers.
The three companies are the insurers (either through direct written or
reinsurance contracts) of the Company's customer credit insurance coverages.
In addition to providing replacement property coverage for certain perils, such
as theft, credit insurance coverage provides protection to the creditor and
cardholder for losses associated with the disability, involuntary unemployment
or death of the cardholder.  Zale Life Insurance Company also provides group
life insurance coverage for eligible employees of the Company.  Zale Indemnity
Company, in addition to writing direct credit insurance contracts, also has
certain discontinued businesses that it continues to run off.  Credit insurance
operations are dependent on the Company's retail sales on its private label
credit cards and are not significant on a stand-alone basis.

PURCHASING AND INVENTORY

         The Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in finished
form from a network of established suppliers and manufacturers located
primarily in the United States, the Orient and Italy.  The Company either
purchases merchandise from its vendors or acquires merchandise on consignment.
The Company had approximately $85.9 million and $111.4 million of consignment
inventory on hand at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The Company is
subject to the risk of fluctuation in prices of diamonds, precious stones and
gold.  The Company historically has not engaged in any substantial amount of
hedging activities with respect to merchandise held in inventory, since the
Company has been able to adjust retail prices to reflect significant price
fluctuations in the commodities that are used in the merchandise it sells.  No
assurances, however, can be given that the Company will be able to adjust
prices to reflect commodity price fluctuations in the future.  The Company is
not subject to substantial currency fluctuations because most purchases are
dollar denominated.  During the years ended July 31, 1995 and March 31, 1994,
the Company purchased approximately 29 percent and 38 percent, respectively, of
its merchandise from its top five vendors.  Although the Company believes that
alternate sources of supply are available, the abrupt loss of any significant
supplier during the three months ended November 30 of any year, the period
leading up to the Christmas selling season, could result in a material adverse
effect on the Company's business.

COMPETITION

         The jewelry retailing industry is highly competitive.  The industry is
fragmented, and the Company competes with a large number of independent
regional and local jewelry retailers, as well as nationally recognized jewelry
chains.  The Company's sales represent approximately 6% of national retail
jewelry store sales.  The Company must also compete with other types of
retailers who sell jewelry and gift items, such as department stores, catalog
showrooms, discounters and home shopping programs.  The Company believes that
it is also competing for consumers' discretionary spending dollars.  The
Company must, therefore, also compete with retailers who offer merchandise
other than jewelry or giftware.

         Notwithstanding the national or regional reputation of its
competition, the Company believes that it must compete on a mall-by-mall basis
with other retailers of jewelry as well as with retailers of other types of
discretionary items.  Therefore, the Company competes primarily on the basis of
store location, reputation for high- quality, distinctive and value-priced
merchandise, personal service and its ability to offer private label credit
card programs to customers wishing to finance their purchases.  The Company's
success is also dependent on its ability to react to and create customer demand
for specific product lines.

         The Company also competes for desirable new store locations with other
jewelers and specialty retailers.  Historically, the Company has generally been
able to lease locations in new or vacated mall space which the Company
considered desirable.

         The Company holds no material patents, licenses (other than its
licenses to operate its Diamond Park leased locations), franchises or
concessions; however, the established tradenames for stores and products in the
Company's Zales, Gordon's and Guild Divisions are important to the Company in
maintaining its competitive position in the jewelry retailing industry.

CREDIT OPERATIONS

         Jewelers Financial Services, Inc. ("JFS") has credit approval,
customer service and collection systems that management considers to be
sophisticated.  The Company offers and grants credit to qualified customers.
See "Business Strategy".  The credit programs help facilitate the sale of
merchandise to customers who wish to finance their purchases rather than use
cash or major credit cards.  Credit extension, customer service and advanced
collections for all the accounts are performed by JFS at servicing centers
located in Tempe, Arizona; Clearwater Florida; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Guam.
The Company has Point-of-Sale Instant Credit ("POSIC") which allows sales
associates to obtain new account credit approval generally within two minutes
for most qualified customers.  This compares to the previous instant credit
turnaround time of approximately fifteen minutes.   Flexible payment
arrangements, typically twenty-eight to thirty-four months, are extended to
credit customers.  Early stage collection of accounts, collection agency
placement of charged- off accounts and collection of accounts under which the
related obligors are involved in bankruptcy proceedings are performed by JFS at
the Company's National Collections Center located in San Marcos, Texas.  The
mailing of statements regarding the accounts and the processing of payments on
the accounts are performed by JFS at the Company's headquarters in Irving,
Texas.  The Company's credit insurance affiliates provide coverage for credit
purchasers in the event of total disability, involuntary unemployment, death
and losses due to theft, burglary, fire and windstorm.  See "Businesses of
Non-Retail Affiliates".

         Approximately 52 percent of the Company's retail sales during the year
ended July 31, 1995 through its Zales, Gordon's and Guild Divisions were
generated by credit sales on the private label credit cards.  At July 31, 1995,
there were approximately 656,000 active customer charge accounts.  The Company
also has an additional 473,000 promotable charge customers without an
outstanding balance and over 2.5 million customer names on file that are not
current charge customers.

EMPLOYEES

         As of July 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 9,000 employees, of
whom 23 are represented by unions.  The Company considers its relations with
its employees to be good.

OTHER

         On December 13, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized
the change in the Company's fiscal year end to July 31.  Such change was
effective as of April 1, 1994.  The Company's determination to change its
fiscal year was based on several considerations.  By changing to a July 31
fiscal year end, the Company has established quarterly reporting periods that
are more consistent with other companies in the retail industry.  Additionally,
a July 31 year end coincides with the Company's emergence from bankruptcy
proceedings, thereby providing for greater comparability of historical
financial data in the future, and, it makes the Company's planning process more
effective.

ITEM 2.  PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES

         The Company occupies a corporate headquarters facility, completed in
March 1984 with 430,000 square feet, under a lease extending through September
1997.  The facility is located on a 17-acre tract in Las Colinas, a planned
business development in Irving, Texas, near the Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport.  The Company owns 33 acres of land surrounding the corporate
headquarters facility and a 120,000 square foot warehouse in Dallas, Texas.

         The Company also leases four servicing centers located in Clearwater,
Florida (30,000 square feet), Tempe, Arizona (24,200 square feet), San Juan,
Puerto Rico (2,900 square feet) and Guam (556 square feet) and one national
collections center located in San Marcos, Texas (9,000 square feet).

         The Company rents all of its retail spaces, other than the Diamond
Park Division leased locations, under leases with terms ranging from five to
fifteen years.  Most of the store leases provide for the payment of base
rentals plus real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees and
merchants association dues, as well as percentage rents based on the stores'
gross sales.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         JEWEL RECOVERY, L.P. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Zale
assigned certain claims and causes of action and advanced $3.0 million to Jewel
Recovery, L.P., a limited partnership ("Jewel Recovery") which was formed upon
Zale's emergence from bankruptcy.  The sole purpose of Jewel Recovery is to
prosecute and settle such assigned claims and causes of action.  The general
partner of Jewel Recovery is Jewel Recovery, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company.
Its limited partners are holders of various unsecured claims against Zale.

         There is a possibility that the Company may recover the $3.0 million
advance made to Jewel Recovery as well as other amounts related to the
finalization of the Chapter 11 claims settlement process.  It is likely that
these matters will be resolved by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 1996.
The Company does not expect these recoveries to be material to its financial
position or recurring operations.

         In addition, the Company and ZDel have agreed to indemnify certain
parties to litigation settlements entered into by the Company in connection
with the Plan of Reorganization against cross-claims, similar third-party
claims or costs of defending such claims brought against such parties as a
result of litigation instigated by the Company, ZDel or Jewel Recovery.  At
October 6, 1995, no material claims had been asserted against the Company or
ZDel for such indemnification.

         OTHER.  The Company is involved in certain other legal actions and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business.  Management believes that
such litigation and claims will be resolved without material effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.



ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders of the Company
during the quarter ended July 31, 1995.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Zale Corporation:

We have audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
financial statements included in Zale Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiaries' Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated by reference in this
Form 10-K, and have issued our reports thereon dated September 12, 1995.  Our
report on the financial statements for the four months ended July 31, 1993, and
for the year ended March 31, 1993, includes an explanatory paragraph with
respect to changes in methods of accounting for postretirement benefits other
than pensions and accounting for income taxes as discussed in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our audits were made for the purpose of
forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
Schedule II is the responsibility of the Company's management and is presented
for the purpose of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

in the Transaction Documents;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants
herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby expressly acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:


                                   ARTICLE I

                                  DEFINITIONS

                 Section 1.01.  Definitions.  Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined in this Indenture are used in this Indenture with the
meanings assigned to such terms in the Glossary of Terms attached to this
Indenture as Annex I.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            ISSUE, EXECUTION, FORM,
                       REGISTRATION AND PAYMENT OF NOTES

                 Section 2.01.  Issuance of Notes.  Upon the execution and
delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may issue on a private placement basis,
$37,620,000 in aggregate principal amount of


                                       1

<PAGE>   9


Class A-1 Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes (the "Class A-1 Notes"), $294,100,000
in aggregate principal amount of Class A-2 7.325% Asset Backed Notes (the "Class
A-2 Notes"), $28,600,000 in aggregate principal amount of Class B 7.50% Asset
Backed Notes (the "Class B Notes") and $20,440,000 in aggregate principal amount
of Class C 8.15% Asset Backed Notes (the "Class C Notes" and, collectively with
the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes and the Class B Notes, the "Notes").
The Notes shall be issued in minimum denominations of $250,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

                 Section 2.02.  Execution of Notes.  The Notes shall be signed
on behalf of the Issuer by one of the Authorized Officers of the Owner Trustee
under its corporate seal which may be in facsimile form and be imprinted or
otherwise reproduced thereon. Such signatures may be the manual or facsimile
signatures of the present or any future such officers of the Owner Trustee on
behalf of the Issuer.  The seal of the Issuer may be in the form of a facsimile
thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the
Notes.  Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction
of the seal or any such signature shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any Note which has been duly authenticated and delivered by
the Indenture Trustee.  In case any such officer of the Owner Trustee on behalf
of Issuer who shall have signed any of the Notes shall cease to be such officer
before the Note so signed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Indenture
Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Note nevertheless may be
authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such
Note had not ceased to be such officer of the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer; and any Note may be signed on behalf of the Issuer by such officers as,
at the actual date of the execution of such Note, shall be the proper officers
of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this
Indenture any such officer was not such an officer.

                 Section 2.03.  Authentication and Delivery of Notes.  Notes
executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer as set forth in Section
2.02 of this Indenture shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee for
authentication, and upon such delivery and written direction, an Authorized
Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Notes.
Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.

                 Section 2.04.  Certificate of Authentication.  Only such Notes
as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form
set forth in the form of Class A-1 Notes, Class A-2 Notes, Class B Notes and
Class C Notes attached


                                       2

to this Indenture as Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C and Exhibit D,
respectively, authenticated by the Indenture Trustee by manual signature of one
of its Authorized Officers, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture
or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.  Such certificate of authentication
by the Indenture Trustee upon any Note executed by the Issuer shall be
conclusive evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly authenticated
and delivered under this Indenture and that the Noteholder thereof is entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture.

                 Section 2.05.  Book-Entry Notes.  The Notes, upon original
issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more typewritten Notes
representing the Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered to the Depository, as the
initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Issuer.  The Notes shall
initially be registered on the Note Register in the name of Cede & Co., the
nominee of the Depository, and no Noteholder will receive a definitive Note
representing such Noteholder's interest in the Notes, except as provided in
Section 2.09.  Unless and until certificated, fully registered Notes (the
"Definitive Notes") have been issued to Noteholders pursuant to Section 2.09:

                 (a)       the provisions of this Section 2.05 shall be in full
         force and effect;

                 (b)       the Issuer, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee
         may deal with the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants
         for all purposes (including the making of payments on the Notes) as
         the authorized representative of the Noteholders;

                 (c)       to the extent that the provisions of this Section
         2.05 conflict with any other provisions of this Indenture, the
         provisions of this Section 2.05 shall control; and

                 (d)       the rights of Noteholders shall be exercised only
         through the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants and
         shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
         such Noteholders and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency
         Participants.  Unless and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant
         to Section 2.09, the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry
         transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and
         transmit distributions of principal and interest on the Notes to such
         Clearing Agency Participants.

         The Clearing Agency Participants shall have no rights under this
Indenture under or with respect to any of the Notes held on their behalf by the
Depositary, and the Depositary may be treated by the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee, and any of their respective agents, employees, officers and directors,
as the absolute owner of the Notes for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Indenture shall prevent the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, or any of their respective agents, from
giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by the Depositary, or shall impair, as between the Depositary and the
Clearing Agency Participants, the operation of customary practices governing
the exercise of the rights of a Noteholder of any Class A-1 Notes, Class A-2
Notes, Class B Notes or Class C Notes.  Subject to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.05, any Noteholder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any
Person, including Clearing Agency Participants and Persons that may hold
interests through Clearing Agency Participants, to take any action which a
Noteholder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Notes.

                 Section 2.06.  Legends.  (a)  The Book-Entry Notes shall bear
a legend in substantially the following form:

                 UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
         OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY ("DTC"), NEW YORK, NEW YORK, TO THE
         ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT,
         AND ANY NOTE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH
         OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC OR
         TO SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF
         DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.), ANY TRANSFER,
         PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON
         IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN
         INTEREST HEREIN.

                 TRANSFERS OF THIS NOTE SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS IN WHOLE,
         BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF DTC OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH
         SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE, AND TRANSFERS OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN THIS
         NOTE SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
         RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE INDENTURE REFERRED TO HEREIN.

         (b)     The Definitive Notes shall bear a legend in substantially the

                 THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
         1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS,
         AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
         TRANSFERRED (AND THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS NOTE, AGREES
         THAT THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
         TRANSFERRED) EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO RULE 144A OR ANOTHER EXEMPTION
         FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (2) IF SUCH OFFER FOR SALE
         OR OTHER TRANSFER IS MADE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND
         (3) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS TO TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE
         INDENTURE REFERRED TO HEREIN.

                 Section 2.07.  Notices to Clearing Agency.  Whenever notice or
other communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture to be
delivered as provided in Section 14.01, unless and until Definitive Notes shall
have been issued to Noteholders pursuant to Section 2.09, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Servicer shall give all such notices and
communications specified herein to be given to Noteholders to the Clearing
Agency.

                 Section 2.08.  Letter of Representations.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Indenture or any Series Supplement, the
parties hereto shall comply with the terms of each Letter of Representations.

                 Section 2.09.  Definitive Notes.  If (a) the Trust advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that the Depositary is no longer willing or able to
discharge properly its responsibilities as depository with respect to such
Notes, and the Trust is unable to locate a qualified successor, or (b) after the
occurrence of a Servicer Default, Class A-1 Noteholders, Class A-2 Noteholders,
Class B Noteholders or Class C Noteholders representing not less than 50% of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2
Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes, collectively, as the case may be,
advise the Indenture Trustee and the Depositary (which notice may be made
through Clearing Agency Participants), in writing, that the continuation of a
book-entry system through the Depositary (or a successor thereto) is no longer
in the best interests of Noteholders of such class, the Indenture Trustee shall
notify the Clearing Agency of the occurrence of any such event and of the
availability of Definitive Notes to Noteholders requesting the same.  Upon
surrender by the Depositary of the Notes representing the Class A-1 Notes, the
Class A-2 Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes, as the case may be, and
instructions by the Depositary to the Indenture Trustee for re-registration, the
Indenture Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Class A-1

Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class B Notes or the Class C Notes, as the case
may be, to the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class B
Noteholders or the Class C Noteholders, as the case may be, or their respective

will recognize the holders of such Definitive Notes as Registered Noteholders
under the Transaction Documents.  Neither the Trust nor the Indenture Trustee
shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such
instructions.  Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, all references herein to
obligations with respect to such Notes imposed upon or to be performed by the
Clearing Agency shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the
Indenture Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive
Notes and the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the holders of the Definitive
Notes as Noteholders hereunder.


                 Section 2.10.  Note Register; Persons Deemed Registered
Noteholders.  In the event any classes of Notes are issued as Definitive Notes,

as the Issuer may prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of,
and the registration of transfer and exchange of, the Notes.  The Note Register

identification number of each registered holder of the Class A-1 Notes (a
"Class A-1 Registered Noteholder"), the Class A-2 Notes (a "Class A-2

and the Class C Notes (a "Class C Registered Noteholder") (the Class A-1

collectively, as the "Registered Noteholders") as provided by the Noteholders
by delivery by each Noteholder to the Indenture Trustee of a completed
Noteholder Data Sheet in substantially the form attached to this Indenture as
Exhibit F (a "Noteholder Data Sheet"), together with the numbers of the Notes,
the principal amount of each Note and details with respect to the registration
of any transfer or exchange of Notes.  The Indenture Trustee shall rely on the
information set forth in Noteholder Data Sheets provided by the Noteholders
(and shall be entitled to so rely absent manifest error), as may be modified in
a written notice by any Noteholder received by the Indenture Trustee.  The
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee and any of their respective agents may deem
and treat the


                                       6

<PAGE>   14

Noteholder of any Note as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of the principal of and interest and premium, if any, on such
Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note may be

agents shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

                 Section 2.11.  Payments of Interest; Payment to Noteholder on
Record Date.

                 The Class A-1 Notes shall bear interest at a variable rate

recent Interest Period for which interest has been paid or duly provided for,
or, if no interest has yet been paid or duly provided for, from the Issuance
Date, (2) except with respect to the Class A-1 Notes (with respect to which
interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual
number of days elapsed), shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months and (3) shall be payable monthly, in arrears, on each

to the interest that accrued during the immediately preceding Interest Period
on the principal balance of the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class
B Notes and the Class C Notes, respectively, outstanding during such Interest
Period (from time to time and after giving effect to payments of principal and
allocations of Noteholder Charge-Offs, if any, made during such preceding
Interest Period, including payments of principal and allocations of Noteholder
Charge-Offs made on the Payment Date during such preceding Interest Period).
All payments of interest with respect to the Notes shall be paid, on each
Payment Date therefor, to the Person who is the Noteholder of the Note or Notes

being paid as of the close of business on the

                                       7

last day of the calendar month immediately preceding such Payment Date, whether
or not such date is a Business Day (the "Record Date"), notwithstanding any
transfer or exchange of such Note or Notes subsequent to the Record Date and
prior to such Payment Date; provided that, the final interest payment shall be
payable to the Person to whom principal is payable pursuant to Section 2.12 of

funds to the account maintained by such Noteholder in the United States who (1)
is an original Noteholder, (2) is a transferee that delivers to the Indenture
Trustee account payment instructions ("Account Payment Instructions") prior to

Account Payment Instructions, a "Wire Transfer Payment Recipient") or (B) with
respect to Noteholders as to which Account Payment Instructions have not been so
received, by check of the Indenture Trustee mailed to such Noteholder at the
address of such Noteholder as set forth on the Record Date in the Note Register.
All payments of interest to Wire Transfer Payment Recipients with respect to the
Notes shall continue to be made pursuant to the applicable Account Payment
Instructions until such time, if any, that revised written Account Payment
Instructions of such Noteholder are received by the Indenture Trustee.  The
Indenture Trustee and the Issuer are entitled to rely on such Account Payment
Instructions and to make payments in accordance therewith until receipt of
revised written Account Payment Instructions in accordance with this Indenture.
Payments of interest with respect to Book-Entry Notes shall be made in
accordance with Section 2.05 hereof.

                 Section 2.12.  Payments of Monthly Principal.  Payments of
Monthly Principal of the Notes shall be made on each Payment Date, commencing
with the Amortization Commencement Date, pursuant to and in accordance with

Definitive Notes shall be paid by the Indenture Trustee (1) to Noteholders that
are Wire Transfer Payment Recipients, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account maintained by such Wire Payment Recipient specified in
such Wire Payment Recipient's Account Payment Instructions, and (2) to
Noteholders that are not Wire Transfer Payment Recipients, by check of the
Indenture Trustee mailed to such Noteholder at the address of such Noteholder
as set


                                       8

forth in the Note Register.  With respect to the final payment by the Indenture
Trustee to a Noteholder of the final installment of Monthly Principal and
accrued but unpaid interest and the Optional Full Redemption Price, if any, on
any Note, the Indenture Trustee shall make such final payment (1) to Noteholders
that are Wire Transfer Payment Recipients, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account maintained by such Wire Payment Recipient in the
United States which was designated in the applicable note purchase agreement or
in later written instructions delivered to the Indenture Trustee, only upon
presentation and surrender of such Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Indenture Trustee on or after such date of payment, and (2) to Noteholders that
are not Wire Transfer Payment Recipients, by check of the Indenture Trustee
mailed to such Noteholder at the address of such Noteholder as set forth in the
Note Register, only upon presentation and surrender of such Note at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee on or after such date of
payment.  Any reduction in the principal amount of the Notes effected by any
payments of Monthly Principal or otherwise shall be binding upon all Noteholders
and all future Noteholders, whether or not any such reduction is noted upon a
Note so reduced, or a Note issued upon the registration of exchange or transfer
thereof.  Payments of principal with respect to the Book-Entry Notes shall be
made in accordance with Section 2.05 hereof.

                 Section 2.13.  Optional Redemptions of the Notes.  In

                 Section 2.14.  Exchange and Transfer.

                 (a)      Exchanges of Notes.  Definitive Notes may be
exchanged for one or more Definitive Notes of any authorized denomination in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
Definitive Notes surrendered, upon surrender of the Definitive Notes to be
exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee.  Whenever any
Definitive Notes are so surrendered for exchange, the Owner Trustee, on behalf
of the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for the surrendered Definitive Notes, the Notes which the
Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive, bearing numbers not
contemporaneously outstanding.

                          (1)     Transfers of Beneficial Interests in the
Book-Entry Notes.  Transfers of all or any part of any beneficial interest in
any of the Book-Entry Notes shall be made in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the Depositary.  Unless and until Definitive Certificates are
issued pursuant to Section 2.09, the initial Clearing Agency will make
book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants.

                          (2)     Transfers of Definitive Notes.  Each
Noteholder of a Definitive Note may, at any time, subject to the restrictions
on transfer set forth in the Notes and this Indenture, transfer such Note, in

                 satisfactory in form and substance to the Issuer,

                 require registration under the Securities Act or qualification
                 of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, and that such
                 transfer shall not otherwise violate any United States Federal

In connection with any registration of exchange or transfer of Notes, (1) the
Issuer and the Indenture


                                       11

Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any fees and
expenses (including without limitation any governmental charge or tax and the
fees) that may be imposed in connection therewith and (2) the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee shall not be required to register the exchange or transfer of
any Note (A) for a period of fifteen (15) days immediately preceding the mailing
of a notice of redemption pursuant to Section 9.03 of this Indenture or (B)
selected, called or being called for redemption.  All Notes issued upon any
exchange or transfer of Notes permitted by this Indenture (1) shall be delivered
to the Noteholder thereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee
or (at the risk of such Noteholder) sent by mail to such address as may be
specified by such Noteholder in the related request for exchange or transfer;
(2) shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt and
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered
upon such exchange or transfer.  All Notes presented for registration of
transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or
the Indenture Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee (including the form of assignment attached to this Indenture
as Exhibit H) duly executed by, the Noteholder thereof or its attorney duly
authorized in writing.

                 Section 2.15.  Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen
Notes.  In case any temporary or Definitive Note shall become mutilated,
defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer, in its discretion, may execute,
and upon the written order of the Issuer, an authorized officer of the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new temporary or definitive
Note bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, evidencing the same
rights and obligations as such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen
Note, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Note, or in
lieu of a substitution for the Note destroyed, lost or stolen.  The applicant
for such a substituted Note shall (1) furnish to the Issuer and to the
Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee either
(a) if the Noteholder is an original holder or an institution, an indemnity
agreement in favor of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in a form
satisfactory to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee or (b) such security or
indemnity (which may be in the form of a bond) as may be required by the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and such agent, (2) in each case of destruction,
loss or theft, furnish to the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee evidence to
the satisfaction of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee of the destruction,
loss or theft of the relevant Note and the ownership thereof and (3) in each
case of mutilation or


                                       12

<PAGE>   20

defacing, surrender the mutilated or defaced Note to the Issuer or to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation thereof.   Upon the issuance of any
substituted Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee may require the payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any fees and expenses (including without
limitation any governmental charge or tax) that may be imposed in connection
therewith.  Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.15 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen
shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or
not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by
anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of and shall be subject to
all the limitations of rights set forth in this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes, of the class of Note destroyed,
lost or stolen, duly authenticated and delivered under this Indenture.  In the
case of any Note which is mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen within
the fifteen (15) day period prior to the Optional Redemption Date, the
Scheduled Redemption Date or Series Termination Date of such Note, the Issuer
may, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of the
same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced
Note) if the applicant for such payment shall (1) furnish to the Issuer and to
the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee such
security or indemnity (which may be in the form of a bond) as may be required
by the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and such agent and (2) in each case of
destruction, loss or theft, furnish to the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee
evidence to the satisfaction of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee of the
destruction, loss or theft of the relevant Note and the ownership thereof.  All
Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent
permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes
and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law
or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the
replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without
the surrender thereof.

                 Section 2.16.  Cancellation of Notes; Destruction Thereof.
All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption or registration of transfer or
exchange pursuant to any of the provisions of this Indenture, whether
surrendered to the Issuer or to any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee, shall be delivered to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation and shall
be promptly cancelled and destroyed by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with
its standard procedures (unless previously instructed in writing by the Issuer
to do otherwise), and if


                                       13

<PAGE>   21

surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled and destroyed
by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard procedures (unless
previously instructed in writing by the Issuer to do otherwise); and no Notes
shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the
provisions of this Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee shall promptly deliver a
certificate of any such cancellation and destruction to the Issuer.

                 Section 2.17.  Temporary Notes.  Pending the preparation of
definitive Notes, the Authorized Officers of the Issuer may execute and the
Indenture Trustee shall, upon the written order of the Issuer authenticate and
deliver temporary Notes (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise
reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee).
Temporary Notes shall be issuable as registered Notes without coupons, of any
authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Notes,
but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for
temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Issuer.  Temporary Notes may
contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be
appropriate.  Every temporary Note shall be executed by the Issuer and be
authenticated and delivered by the Indenture Trustee upon the same conditions
and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive
Notes.  Without unreasonable delay after the issuance of any temporary Notes,
the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Notes and thereupon
temporary Notes may be surrendered in exchange for such definitive Notes
without charge at the Indenture Trustee's Corporate Trust Office, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary
Notes a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of authorized
denominations.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall be entitled to
the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Notes.

                 Section 2.18.  Appointment of Indenture Trustee.  Each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note, shall be deemed to have consented to
the appointment of the Indenture Trustee to act, on the terms and conditions
specified in this Indenture, as Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the
Noteholders.  To the extent permitted by the terms of the Notes and this
Indenture and subject to Article XI herein, the Indenture Trustee shall follow
the directions of the Seller, or if for federal income tax purposes, a
different party or parties are deemed to be the holders of the equity interests
in the Trust, the Indenture Trustee shall follow the directions of the holders
of a majority of the equity interests in the Trust.

                 Section 2.19.  Issuer and Affiliate.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Indenture or the Notes, the Issuer and any
Affiliate thereof may at any time purchase any Notes, at any price or prices,
in the open market or otherwise; provided, however, that their rights and
remedies in respect of the Notes shall be subject to Section 10.13 of the
Purchase and Servicing Agreement.  Any Note held by the Issuer or an Affiliate
thereof shall be deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of determining
Majority Noteholders.

                 Section 2.20.  [Reserved]

                 Section 2.21.  Certain Certificates.  The Issuer shall furnish
the Indenture Trustee with a certificate of the Owner Trustee certifying the
incumbency and specimen signatures of officers of the Owner Trustee authorized
on behalf of the Owner Trustee to execute Notes and to give instructions or to
make certain representations to the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture, which certificate the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on until such time, if any, that the Indenture
Trustee receives from the Owner Trustee a revised certificate.  The Indenture
Trustee shall furnish the Owner Trustee with a certificate of the Indenture
Trustee certifying the incumbency and specimen signatures of officers of the
Indenture Trustee authorized on behalf of the Indenture Trustee to authenticate
Notes, on which certificate the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to rely.

                 Section 2.22.  Issuance of Additional Notes.  Pursuant to any
one or more Series Supplements, the Issuer may issue from time to time a new
Series, subject to the conditions described below (each such issuance or sale,
a "New Issuance").  The Issuer may designate, with respect to any newly issued
Series, the principal terms of such new Series (the "Principal Terms" of such
Series) in any such Series Supplement.  The terms of each Series Supplement
may, subject to certain conditions described below, modify or amend the terms
of the Indenture solely as applied to such new Series.  None of the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Seller is required or intends to obtain
the consent of any Noteholder of any outstanding Series to issue any additional
Series.

                 The Issuer may designate Principal Terms such that each Series
has a period during which accumulation of the principal amount thereof in a
principal funding account or pay-out of the principal amount thereof is
intended to occur, which may have a different length, and begin on a different
date, than such periods for any other Series.  Further, one or more Series may
be in their


                                       15


<PAGE>   23

interest-only or pay-out periods while other Series are not. Moreover, each
Series may have the benefits of Enhancements issued by providers of Enhancement
different from the providers of Enhancement with respect to any other Series.
The Indenture Trustee shall hold any such Enhancement only on behalf of the
Series to which such Enhancement relates.  With respect to each such
Enhancement, the Seller may deliver a different form of Enhancement agreement
(if any).  There is no limit to the number of New Issuances that the Issuer may
issue.

                 A New Issuance may only occur upon the satisfaction of the
following conditions:  (a) the Issuer shall have given the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer, each Rating Agency (if any rated notes are outstanding) and each
provider of Enhancement written notice of such New Issuance and the date upon
which the New Issuance is to occur; (b) the Issuer shall have delivered to the
Indenture Trustee the related Series Supplement in form satisfactory to the
Indenture Trustee; (c) with respect to a new Series only, the Seller shall have
delivered to the Indenture Trustee any related Enhancement agreement; (d) the
Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with respect to such
issuance; (e) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture Trustee, each
Rating Agency (if any rated notes are outstanding) and each provider of an
Enhancement an opinion of counsel (a "Tax Opinion") acceptable to the Indenture
Trustee that for Federal income tax purposes (i) the new notes issued shall be
properly characterized as debt (or as a partnership interest) and (ii) the New
Issuance shall not adversely affect the characterization of the notes of any
outstanding Series or class as debt; (f) the Issuer shall have delivered to the
Indenture Trustee a certificate to the effect that no Early Amortization Event
(or event that if not cured within the applicable grace period would constitute
an Early Amortization Event) has occurred and is continuing and that such New
Issuance is not reasonably expected to result in an Early Amortization Event at
any time in the future; (g) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Indenture
Trustee a certificate to the effect that each of the conditions set forth
herein for the New Issuance and the execution and delivery of the related
Series Supplement has been satisfied; and (h) any other conditions specified in
any Series Supplement.  Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer shall execute the Series Supplement and, with
respect to a New Issuance of a Series, issue to the Issuer the notes of such
new Series for execution by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and
deliver such notes to the Indenture Trustee for authentication.

certificates or instruments, if any, representing or evidencing the Collateral
the possession of which by the Indenture Trustee is necessary to perfect the

       Section 4.01.  Post Office Boxes and Collection Deposit Accounts.

                          (a)     Post Office Boxes.  The Issuer has
established or caused to be established the post office boxes listed on
Schedule I to this Indenture (such post office boxes, or any successor post
office boxes established in accordance with this Indenture, being referred to
as the "Post Office Boxes") for the collection of Mail Payments.  The Issuer
(1) represents and warrants that no post office box other than the Post Office
Boxes has been established for the collection of Mail Payments, (2) agrees that
the Indenture Trustee is authorized to receive mail delivered to the Post
Office Boxes, that a Standing Delivery Order in the form attached to this
Indenture as Exhibit M has been filed with the United States Postal Service
authorizing the Indenture Trustee to receive mail delivered to the Post Office
Boxes, and that the Indenture Trustee, acting at the written direction of the
Majority Noteholders, may deny the Issuer access to the Post Office Boxes
following the occurrence and during the continuance of a Servicer Default
(provided that, no direction by the Majority Noteholders to the Indenture
Trustee to deny the Issuer access to any Post Office Box shall be effective
unless such Majority Noteholders provide prior written certification to the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee that a Servicer Default has occurred and is
continuing) and (3) agrees that no new post office box shall be established for
the collection of Mail Payments unless and until a Standing Delivery Order has
been filed with the United States Postal Service authorizing the Indenture
Trustee to receive mail delivered to such post office box.  The Servicer agrees
to pay all fees for the use of the Post Office Boxes.

                          (b)     Establishment of Collection Deposit Accounts.
The Issuer has established or caused to be established and maintained with the
banks listed on Schedule I to this Indenture (the "Collection Deposit Account
Banks") the blocked deposit accounts listed on such Schedule I in the name of
the Indenture Trustee into which the Mail Payments shall be deposited, from the
Post Office Boxes, from time to time (all such blocked deposit accounts, or any
successor blocked deposit accounts established in accordance with this
Indenture, together with all Collections, moneys, instruments and other
property from time to time deposited therein being collectively referred to as
the "Collection Deposit Accounts").  The Issuer hereby transfers to the
Indenture Trustee the sole and exclusive dominion over and control of the
Collection Deposit Accounts.  Prior to or contemporaneously with the execution
of this Indenture, the Issuer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee fully
executed letters in the form attached to this Indenture as Exhibit N (the
"Collection Deposit Account Letters") from each of the Collection Deposit
Account Banks.  To the extent the Indenture Trustee may exercise any authority
granted to it under a Collection Deposit Account Letter, it shall do so only at
the written direction of the Majority Noteholders.

                          (c)     Termination of Collection Deposit Accounts;
Successor Collection Deposit Accounts.  In the event any Collection Deposit
Account Bank shall, after the date of this Indenture, terminate a Collection
Deposit Account for any reason, or if the Indenture Trustee, acting at the
written direction of the Majority Noteholders, shall demand such termination,
the Issuer agrees to make all future deposits of Mail Payments to another
Collection Deposit Account that has not been terminated or to a successor
Collection Deposit Account established as provided below in this Section
4.01(c); provided, that, if the Indenture Trustee, acting at the written
direction of the Majority Noteholders, shall demand termination of all
Collection Deposit Accounts, the Issuer agrees to make all future deposits of
Mail Payments directly to the Collateral Account.  No direction by the Majority
Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee to demand the termination of a Collection
Deposit Account shall be effective unless such Majority Noteholders give prior
written notice to the Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer that (1) an Early
Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, (2) the subject Collection
Deposit Account Bank is not performing in all material respects under the terms
of the applicable Collection Deposit Account Letter or (3) such Majority
Noteholders reasonably believe that the Collection Deposit Account Bank at
which the subject Collection Deposit Account is maintained may become subject
to insolvency, receivership or similar proceedings (it being understood that
the Majority Noteholders shall have no obligation


                                       21

<PAGE>   29


to give any such notice).  No new Collection Deposit Account shall be
established until and unless a successor Collection Deposit Account Bank shall
have executed and delivered to the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee a
Collection Deposit Account Letter.  The Indenture Trustee shall have sole and
exclusive dominion over and control of any such successor Collection Deposit
Account.

                 Section 4.02.  Collateral Account.

                          (a)     Establishment of Collateral Account;
Subaccount Structure.  The Issuer has established or caused to be established
and maintained with the Indenture Trustee a collateral account identified as
such on Schedule I to this Indenture (such account, or any successor collateral
account established pursuant to this Indenture, together with all Collections,
moneys, instruments and other property from time to time deposited therein, the
"Collateral Account"), which is a segregated trust account of the Issuer in the
name of the Indenture Trustee.  The Collateral Account shall include a notation
that it has been established pursuant to this Indenture.  The Collateral
Account shall have the following subaccounts (which need not be separate trust
accounts):  (1) an Interest Subaccount (the "Interest Subaccount") and (2) a
General Subaccount (the "General Subaccount").  All amounts initially
transferred to the Collateral Account (including collections received from Mail
Payments pursuant to Section 4.01 hereof and collections received from Store
Payments pursuant to Section 6.04 of the Purchase and Servicing Agreement)
shall be held in the General Subaccount and shall remain in the General
Subaccount unless and until withdrawn or transferred in accordance with the
instructions delivered to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture.
Amounts held in the General Subaccount shall be available for use for all
purposes under this Indenture.  On the Issuance Date, the proceeds received by
the Issuer from the issuance and sale of the Notes (which proceeds shall be in
the form of immediately available funds), less that amount of such proceeds
used to purchase Receivables pursuant to the Purchase and Servicing Agreement,
shall be deposited into the Collateral Account to effect the allocations,
transfers, applications and payments required and permitted under Article V of
this Indenture.  The Issuer hereby transfers to the Indenture Trustee the sole
and exclusive dominion over and control of the Collateral Account.

                          (b)     Investment of Collateral Account Funds.
Funds on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be invested by the Indenture
Trustee, at the written direction of the Servicer, in specified Eligible
Investments which shall mature on or prior to the Business Day preceding the
next Payment Date.  Any funds in


                                       22

<PAGE>   30

the Collateral Account for which no permitted investment instructions are
received by the Indenture Trustee by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on any
Business Day shall be invested by the Indenture Trustee in such investments as
described in clause (vi) of the definition of "Eligible Investments" set forth
in Annex I hereto or, if such investment is not an Eligible Investment or is
otherwise not available, in Eligible Investments of a type specified in clause
(i) of the definition thereof.  Eligible Investments shall be maintained in the
name of the Indenture Trustee or its nominee or its custodian (and, in either
case, the Indenture Trustee's books and records shall include the notation that
such Eligible Investments are maintained pursuant to this Indenture) and, if
certificated, the Indenture Trustee or custodian shall maintain possession of
the certificates.  Any direction of the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee to
make an investment shall be made in writing and shall certify that the requested
investment qualifies as an Eligible Investment for purposes of this Indenture.
Any earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on invested Collateral
Account funds shall be invested and reinvested by the Indenture Trustee, at the
written direction of the Servicer, in Eligible Investments, and all such
earnings shall be deposited to and retained in the General Subaccount as set
forth in this Indenture for subsequent application and transfer pursuant to this
Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee may, at the written direction of the Servicer,
liquidate an Eligible Investment prior to maturity if such liquidation would not
result in a loss of all or part of the principal portion of such Eligible
Investment or if, prior to the maturity of such Eligible Investment, a default
occurs in the payment of principal, interest or any other amount with respect to
such Eligible Investment. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any loss
or expense incurred or resulting from the investment performance of any
investment or reinvestment of moneys held in the Collateral Account in Eligible
Investments or from the sale or liquidation of any Eligible Investments in
accordance with this Indenture except for any losses or expenses resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indenture Trustee.

                          (c)     Termination of Collateral Account; Successor
Collateral Account.  In the event the Indenture Trustee shall, after the date
of this Indenture, terminate the Collateral Account for any reason, or if the
Indenture Trustee shall, acting at the written direction of the Majority
Noteholders, demand such termination, the Issuer agrees to notify all
Collection Deposit Account Banks to cease the transfer of funds required by the
Collection Deposit Account Letters from the Collection Deposit Accounts to the
Collateral Account (and, if the Issuer fails to so



                                       23

<PAGE>   31

notify the Collection Deposit Account Banks, the Issuer irrevocably grants the
Indenture Trustee, acting at the written direction of the Majority Noteholders,
the authority to so notify the Collection Deposit Account Banks).  No direction
by the Majority Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee to demand termination of
the Collateral Account shall be effective unless such Majority Noteholders give
prior written notice to the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee that (1) an
Early Amortization Event has occurred and is continuing, (2) the Indenture
Trustee is not performing in all material respects to the satisfaction of the
Issuer and the Majority Noteholders under the terms of this Indenture and the
other Transaction Documents or (3) such Majority Noteholders reasonably believe
that the Indenture Trustee may become subject to insolvency, receivership or
similar proceedings (it being understood that the Majority Noteholders shall
have no obligation to give any such notice).  In the event that the Collateral
Account is terminated pursuant to this Section 4.02(c), the Issuer shall
promptly establish a successor collateral account in accordance with Section
4.02(a) of this Indenture.

                 Section 4.03.  Excess Funding Account.

                          (a)     Establishment of Excess Funding Account.  The
Issuer has established or caused to be established and maintained with the
Indenture Trustee an excess funding account identified as such on Schedule I to
this Indenture (such account, or any successor excess funding account
established pursuant to this Indenture, together with all Collections, moneys,
instruments and other property from time to time deposited therein, the "Excess
Funding Account"), which is a segregated trust account of the Issuer in the
name of the Indenture Trustee.  The Excess Funding Account shall include a
notation that it has been established pursuant to this Indenture.  The Issuer
hereby transfers to the Indenture Trustee the sole and exclusive dominion over
and control of the Excess Funding Account.  The Issuer shall deposit to the
Excess Funding Account on the Issuance Date cash in an amount equal to the
excess of (i) $380,760,000 over (ii) the Borrowing Base as of the Issuance
Date.

                          (b)     Investment of Excess Funding Account Funds.
Funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account shall be invested by the
Indenture Trustee, at the written direction of the Servicer, in specified
Eligible Investments which shall mature on or prior to the Business Day
preceding the next Payment Date.  Any funds in the Excess Funding Account for
which no permitted investment instructions are received by the Indenture
Trustee by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on any Business Day shall be
invested by the Indenture Trustee in such investments as described


                                       24

<PAGE>   32

in clause (vi) of the definition of "Eligible Investments" set forth in Annex I
hereto or, if such investment is not an Eligible Investment or is otherwise not
available, in Eligible Investments of a type specified in clause (i) of the
definition thereof.   Eligible Investments shall be maintained in the name of
the Indenture Trustee or its nominee or custodian and, if certificated, the
Indenture Trustee or its nominee or custodian (and, in either case, the
Indenture Trustee's books and records shall include the notation that such
Eligible Investments are maintained pursuant to this Indenture) and, if
certificated, the Indenture Trustee or its custodian shall maintain possession
of the certificates.  Any direction of the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee to
make an investment shall be made in writing and shall certify that the requested
investment qualifies as an Eligible Investment for purposes of this Indenture.
Any earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on invested Excess Funding
Account funds shall be invested and reinvested by the Indenture Trustee, at the
written direction of the Servicer, in Eligible Investments, and, on the Business
Day preceding each Payment Date, all such earnings shall be deposited to and
retained in the General Subaccount for subsequent allocation and transfer
pursuant to this Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee may, at the written direction
of the Servicer, liquidate an Eligible Investment prior to maturity if such
liquidation would not result in a loss of all or part of the principal portion
of such Eligible Investment or if, prior to the maturity of such Eligible
Investment, a default occurs in the payment of principal, interest or any other
amount with respect to such Eligible Investment.  The Indenture Trustee shall
not be liable for any loss or expense incurred or resulting from the investment
performance of any investment or reinvestment of moneys held in the Excess
Funding Account in Eligible Investments or from the sale or liquidation of any
Eligible Investments in accordance with this Indenture except for any losses or
expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
of the Indenture Trustee.

                          (c)     Termination of Excess Funding Account;
Successor Excess Funding Account.  In the event the Indenture Trustee shall,
after the date of this Indenture, terminate the Excess Funding Account for any
reason, or if the Indenture Trustee shall, acting at the written direction of
the Majority Noteholders, demand such termination, the Issuer shall promptly
establish a successor excess funding account in accordance with Section
4.03.(a) of this Indenture.  No direction by the Majority Noteholders to the
Indenture Trustee to demand termination of the Excess Funding Account shall be
effective unless such Majority Noteholders give prior written notice to the
Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee that (1) an Early Amortization Event has


                                       25

<PAGE>   33


occurred and is continuing, (2) the Indenture Trustee is not performing to the
satisfaction of the Issuer and the Majority Noteholders or (3) such Majority
Noteholders reasonably believe that the Indenture Trustee may become subject to
insolvency, receivership or similar proceedings (it being understood that the
Majority Noteholders shall have no obligation to give any such notice).

                          (d)     Borrowing Base Deficiency.  If on any
Business Day during the Interest-Only Period a Borrowing Base Deficiency
exists, the Indenture Trustee shall cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency by
depositing from the General Subaccount into the Excess Funding Account an
amount equal to the Borrowing Base Deficiency.  To the extent funds in the
Collateral Account are insufficient to cover the Borrowing Base Deficiency, the
Trust may deposit additional funds from its own accounts in the Excess Funding
Account in an amount not to exceed any Borrowing Base Deficiency remaining
after available funds have been transferred from the Collateral Account.  If,
on any Business Day during the Interest-Only Period, the Borrowing Base exceeds
the Net Note Principal Amount, the amount of such excess on deposit in the
Excess Funding Account shall be released at the written direction of the
Servicer or as indicated in the Daily Report for deposit into the General
Subaccount.

                          (e)     Release of Excess Funding Account Funds.  On
any Business Day during the Interest-Only Period, the Indenture Trustee shall
release, from the funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account, that amount
of funds requested to be released by the Issuer (each such action, a "Release")
(as set forth in the Daily Report), for use as set forth in Section 5.01 of
this Indenture; provided that, no such Release shall be permitted to the extent
such Release would create a Borrowing Base Deficiency.

                          (f)     Application of Excess Funding Account Funds
on Amortization Commencement Date.  Upon the Amortization Commencement Date,
all funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account (including without
limitation all earnings thereon) shall be applied pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 5.04(c) of this Indenture.

                 Section 4.04.  Optional Redemption Account.

                          (a)     Establishment of Optional Redemption Account.
The Issuer has established or caused to be established and maintained with the
Indenture Trustee an optional redemption account identified as such on Schedule
I to this Indenture (such account, or any successor optional redemption account
established


                                       26

<PAGE>   34


pursuant to this Indenture, together with all Collections, moneys, instruments
and other property from time to time deposited therein, the "Optional Redemption
Account"), which is a segregated trust account of the Issuer in the name of the
Indenture Trustee.  The Optional Redemption Account shall include a notation
that it has been established pursuant to this Indenture.  The Issuer hereby
transfers to the Indenture Trustee the sole and exclusive dominion over and
control of the Optional Redemption Account.

                          (b)     Deposits from Excess Funding Account.  Funds
in the Excess Funding Account which shall be used to effect an Excess Funding
Account Optional Redemption as set forth in Section 9.02 hereof shall be
withdrawn by the Indenture Trustee from the Excess Funding Account and
deposited into the Optional Redemption Account for the period following the
Optional Redemption Announcement Date up to the Partial Redemption Date and
thereafter released to the Noteholders pursuant to Section 9.03 hereof.

                 Section 4.05.  Reserved.

                 Section 4.06.  Other Bank Accounts.  The Issuer agrees that it
shall have no, and shall not make or maintain any deposits in any bank account,
deposit account or trust account other than the Collection Deposit Accounts,
the Collateral Account, the Excess Funding Account, the Optional Redemption
Account and such accounts as are maintained pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

                 Section 4.07.  Correction of Improper Deposits.  If the Issuer
provides the Indenture Trustee with written notice that a deposit has been made
improperly into the Collateral Account, the Excess Funding Account or the
Collection Deposit Accounts, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly release the
amount of the improper deposit, together with interest actually earned thereon
(net of related losses and investment expenses), to correct such improper
deposit.

                 Section 4.08.  Maintenance of Collateral Account, Excess
Funding Account or Optional Redemption Account.  The Collateral Account, the
Excess Funding Account and the Optional Redemption Account shall at all times
be maintained (i) with a depositary institution whose deposits are insured to
the limits provided by law by the FDIC having corporate trust powers and acting
as trustee for funds deposited therein (provided, however, that such account
need not be maintained as a segregated trust account with the corporate trust
department of such institution if at all times the certificates of deposit,
short-term deposits or commercial paper or the long-term unsecured debt
obligations (other than such obligation whose rating is based on collateral or
on the credit of

                                       27

<PAGE>   35


a Person other than such institution or trust company) of such depositary
institution or trust company shall have a credit rating from Standard & Poor's
of at least A-1+ and Duff-1 from Duff & Phelps in the case of the certificates
of deposit, short-term deposits or commercial paper, or a rating from Standard
& Poor's of AAA and from Duff & Phelps of AAA in the case of the long-term
unsecured debt obligations) or (ii) with a depositary institution, which may
include the Indenture Trustee, which is acceptable to the Rating Agency (in the
case of (i) and (ii), a "Qualified Institution").  If at any time, the
institution holding the Collateral Account, Excess Funding Account or Optional
Redemption Account ceases to be a Qualified Institution, the Issuer shall
direct the Servicer to establish within 10 Business Days a new Collateral
Account, Excess Funding Account or Optional Redemption Account with a Qualified
Institution, transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new Collateral
Account, Excess Funding Account or Optional Redemption Account and from the
date such new Collateral Account, Excess Funding Account or Optional Redemption
Account is established, it shall be the "Collateral Account", the "Excess
Funding Account" or the "Optional Redemption Account".  The Servicer shall give
written notice to the Indenture Trustee of the location and account number of
the Collateral Account, the Excess Funding Account or the Optional Redemption
Account and shall notify the Indenture Trustee in writing prior to any
subsequent change thereof.  In the event any of the Collateral Account, Excess
Funding Account or Optional Redemption Account is maintained with a bank other
than with the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall receive a wire
transfer of immediately available funds from such bank no later than 10:00 a.m.
on any Payment Date with respect to any amounts from any such Collateral
Account, Excess Funding Account or Optional Redemption Account which the
Indenture Trustee is required to receive in order to make the distributions
required in accordance with Article V herein.

                          occurring in the next succeeding Settlement Period,
                          plus (B) the amount by which deposits to the Interest
                          Subaccount required pursuant to clause (i)(A) exceed

                          from and including the first day of the current

                          day of the current Settlement Period to the date of
                          determination, until the amount deposited in the

                          payable on the Payment Date occurring in the next
                          succeeding Settlement Period; and

laws of Delaware, (2) has all requisite power and authority to own its property
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted, (3) is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such

and authority to execute, deliver and


                                       34

perform its obligations under each of the Transaction Documents and each
other agreement or instrument contemplated thereby to which it is a party and
to issue the Notes.

                          (b)     Authorization.  The execution, delivery and
performance by the Issuer of each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and the performance by the Issuer of the other transactions contemplated
thereby (collectively, the "Transactions") (1) have been duly authorized by the
Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and (2) shall not (A) violate (i) any
provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, which violation would have a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any provision of the Certificate of Trust of the
Issuer, (iii) any order of any Governmental Authority or (iv) any provision of
any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Issuer is a party or
by which it or any of its property is or may be bound, which violation would

or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under
any such indenture, agreement or other instrument, which conflict, breach or

executed and delivered by the Issuer and constitutes, and each other
Transaction Document when executed and delivered by the Issuer shall

                          (g)     No Fraudulent Transfer. The assignment of
pledge of the security interest in the Collateral by the Issuer to the
Indenture Trustee does not constitute a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance under the United States Bankruptcy Code or applicable state
bankruptcy or insolvency laws or is otherwise void or voidable or subject to
subordination under similar laws or principles or for any other reason.

amount thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and

                 (3)      if such redemption is a Division Sale Optional

                 (4)      if Definitive Notes are outstanding, identify the
                          location where the Definitive Notes (or portion

                          Redemption Price or the Partial Redemption Price, as

                          shall (A) with respect to each Noteholder all or any
                          portion of the Notes of which are being redeemed on
                          such Optional Full Redemption Date or Partial
                          Redemption Date that is a Wire Transfer Payment
                          Recipient, wire transfer to such Noteholder, in
                          immediately available funds and pursuant to the
                          Account Payment Instructions of such Noteholder, that
                          portion of the Optional Full Redemption Price or the
                          Partial Redemption Price, as the case may be, due and
                          payable to such Noteholder with respect to such Notes
                          (or portion thereof) being redeemed, against
                          surrender by such Noteholder of such Notes; and (B)
                          with respect to each Noteholder all or any portion of
                          the Notes of which are being redeemed on such
                          Optional Full Redemption Date or Partial Redemption
                          Date that is not a Wire Transfer Payment Recipient,
                          make available, at the Indenture Trustee's Corporate
                          Trust Office, a check in the amount of that portion
                          of the Optional Full Redemption Price or the Partial
                          Redemption Price, as the case may be, due and payable
                          to such Noteholder with respect to such Notes (or
                          portion thereof) being redeemed, against surrender by
                          such Noteholder of such Notes.

                 Section 9.04.  Amounts Due; Premium; Notice; Partial
Redemptions; Wire Transfer Payment Recipients.  All amounts with respect to the
Notes (or that portion of the Notes) to be redeemed on any Optional Full
Redemption Date or Partial Redemption Date shall be due and payable on such

payment of such amounts), such Notes or portion thereof shall cease to bear
interest.  The Partial Redemption Premium (1) shall be calculated by the Issuer
pursuant to the formula set forth in Annex III to this Indenture and (2) as set
forth in the Optional Redemption Premium Calculation, shall be binding upon the
Issuer and each Noteholder of the Notes.  If by reason of the temporary or
permanent suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause,
it shall be impracticable to give any notice prescribed by Section 9.03 of this
Indenture to the Noteholders, then such notification in lieu thereof as shall
be made by the Issuer shall constitute sufficient provision of such notice;
provided that, such notification shall, so far as may be





                                       44
<PAGE>   52

practicable, approximate the terms and conditions of the notice in lieu of
which it is given.  Neither the failure to give notice nor any defect in any
notice given to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of any
notice with respect to any other Noteholder or any other Notes.  Presentation
of the Notes are not required with respect to a Partial Redemption of any
Notes.

                 Section 9.05.  Scheduled Redemption of the Notes.
         (a) If the Issuer shall not have given notice by June 15, 1999 that it
will redeem the Notes in full on the Payment Date occurring in July, 1999, the
Servicer, on behalf of the Trustee and the Noteholders, will promptly solicit
bids for the purchase of all or a portion of the Receivables for a purchase
price that, together with funds on deposit in the Collateral Account and Excess
Funding Account and Investment Proceeds available for payment of the Notes on
the Scheduled Redemption Date, will be sufficient to pay in full (a) the
outstanding principal balance of the Notes, (b) Monthly Interest for each class
of Notes payable on the Scheduled Redemption Date and (c) any unpaid Servicing
Fees payable to the Servicer on or prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date.  The
Servicer shall promptly, after receipt of any offer to purchase the Receivables,
inform the Seller of such offer and provide to the Seller a reasonably detailed
description of the terms of such offer.  The Servicer shall, not less than three
Business Days prior to the Scheduled Redemption Date, sell such Receivables to
(i) the Seller at the purchase price equal to the highest offer received by the
Servicer for the sale of such Receivables, or (ii) the highest bidder for the
sale of such Receivables if the Seller does not purchase such Receivables. The
proceeds of any such sale of Receivables shall be deposited in the Collateral
Account and treated as Collections and shall be paid to the Noteholders on the
Scheduled Redemption Date.

         (b) If the Servicer is unable to obtain a bid equal to the amount
required pursuant to subsection (a) above, an Amortization Period will commence
at the beginning of the August Cycle Month in 1999 and Collections will be
allocated on each Business Day pursuant to Section 5.03 and paid to the
Noteholders (together with funds on deposit in the Excess Funding Account
available for payment on the Payment Date occurring in September, 1999)
pursuant to Section 4.03(f).

                 Section 9.06.  Mandatory Redemption.  The Servicer shall, in
connection with any sale of a Seller Division, calculate the average of the Pro
Forma Net Yields for the three Settlement Periods immediately preceding the
Settlement Date on or immediately preceding the Optional Redemption
Announcement Date with respect to (x) all Receivables and (y) all Receivables
other


                                       45
<PAGE>   53

than Receivables originated by such Seller Division.  If the average of the Pro
Forma Net Yields calculated pursuant to clause (y) is less than (i) the excess
of (a) the average of the Pro Forma Net Yields calculated pursuant to clause
(x) over (b) 3.00%, or (ii) the average of (a) the Base Rates for such
Settlement Periods minus (b) 5.00%, the Issuer shall, on the Payment Date
occurring on or immediately following the date that is two weeks after the
Optional Redemption Announcement Date, redeem Notes in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount such that the remaining outstanding principal balance of the
Notes equals the Target Note Amount.  The "Target Note Amount" shall equal an
amount such that, if substituted for the denominator of the Pro Forma Net
Yield, the resulting percentage equals the greater of the percentages set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence.

                 Optional Full Redemption Price of any Notes on the Partial
                 Redemption Date or Optional Full Redemption Date,

                 Receivables over (ii) the Available Subordinated Amount shall
                 fail to equal or exceed the excess of (x) the outstanding
                 principal amount of the Notes over (y) the amount of funds on
                 deposit in the Excess Funding Account, which failure shall

                 obligations as Servicer under the Purchase and Servicing
                 Agreement, which failure would have a material adverse effect
                 on the rights and remedies of the Noteholders;

         (j)     the Issuer becoming required to register as an "investment
                 company" under the Investment Company Act;

         (k)     any representation or warranty in the Purchase and Servicing
                 Agreement shall prove to have been false or misleading in any
                 material respect when made and which continues to be incorrect
                 in any material respect for a period of sixty (60) days after
                 the Issuer's receipt of written notice thereof from the

                 Noteholders are materially and adversely affected; and

                 of funds remaining in the Excess Funding Account shall be less
                 than $100 million.


                 If any event described in clauses (a)(2), (c), (d), (i) or (k)
of Section 10.01 occurs, an Early Amortization Event shall be deemed to have
occurred only if, after the applicable grace period described in such clauses,
if any, either (A) the Indenture Trustee acting under the written direction of
the Majority Noteholders, by written notice to the Seller and the Servicer or
(B) the Majority Noteholders by written notice to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee declare that an Early Amortization Event has occurred as of the date of
such notice.  If any event described in clauses (a)(1), (b), (e), (f), (g),
(h), (j) or (l) of Section 10.01 occurs, an Early Amortization Event shall be
deemed to have occurred immediately upon the occurrence of such event, without
any notice or other action on the part of the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders.  The Early Amortization Period shall commence as of the day on
which the Early Amortization Event occurs.

                 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure in
performance referred to in clauses (a)(1) and (2) above for a





                                       48

period of ten (10) Business Days after the applicable grace period, or in
clauses (c), (h) or (j) above for a period of thirty (30) Business Days after
the applicable grace period, shall not constitute an Early Amortization Event
until the expiration of such additional ten (10) or thirty (30) Business Days,
respectively, if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the exercise
of reasonable diligence by the Issuer or the Servicer and such delay or failure
was caused by a Force Majeure.  The Issuer and the Servicer shall nevertheless
be required to use their best efforts to perform their obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents, and the
Issuer and/or the Servicer, as applicable, shall promptly give the Indenture
Trustee and, in the case of such delay or failure in performance by the
Servicer, the Issuer, any provider of Enhancement, the Seller and noteholders
of each Series issued and outstanding prompt notice of such failure or delay by
it, together with a description of the cause of such failure or delay and its
efforts to perform its obligations.

                 (a)  Following the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event,
the Indenture Trustee, acting at the written direction of the Majority
Noteholders, may apply all or any part of the Collections to the payment of the
Secured Obligations of the Issuer under this Indenture or under any of the
other Transaction Documents, as provided herein, and all rights and remedies
provided under all other applicable laws, which rights, in the case of each and
all of the foregoing, shall be cumulative.

                 (b)      The Issuer shall be deemed to have appointed the
Indenture Trustee its attorney-in-fact with full authority in its place and
stead, and in its name, to take any action and to execute any instrument
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Indenture pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture, including without limitation to

endorse and collect all drafts or other instruments and documents made payable
to the Issuer in connection therewith or representing any payment, dividend or
other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part or proceeds
thereof, and give full discharge for the same or (4) extend the time of payment
of or make any allowance or adjustment with respect to any or all of the
Collateral.

                 Section 10.03.  Additional Rights Upon the Occurrence of
Certain Events.  (a)  If an Insolvency Event shall occur with respect to the
Seller, this Agreement and the Trust shall be deemed to have terminated on the
sixty-first day following the Publication Date subject to the last paragraph of
this subsection (a); provided, that within fifteen days of the date of written
notice to an Authorized Officer of the Indenture Trustee of such Insolvency
Event, the Indenture Trustee shall:

                 (i)  publish a notice in an Authorized Newspaper that an
         Insolvency Event has occurred with respect to the Seller and that the
         Indenture Trustee intends to sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate
         the Receivables and the related transferred assets pursuant to this
         Indenture in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially
         reasonable terms, which shall include the solicitation of competitive
         bids (a "Disposition"); and

                 (ii)  send written notice substantially in the form set forth
         in Exhibit E hereto via Federal Express or another similar overnight
         courier to the Noteholders describing the provisions of this Section
         10.03 and requesting each Noteholder to advise the Indenture Trustee
         in writing whether or not it wishes the Indenture Trustee to instruct
         the Servicer not to effectuate a Disposition.

                 If, after sixty (60) days from the day notice pursuant to
clause (a)(i) is first published (the "Publication Date"), the Indenture
Trustee shall not have received the written instruction described in clause
(a)(ii) above from a majority in aggregate principal amount of the noteholders
of any class, the Indenture Trustee shall instruct the Servicer to effectuate a
Disposition, and the Servicer shall proceed to consummate a Disposition.  If,
however, a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the noteholders of any
class instruct the Indenture Trustee not to effectuate a Disposition, the Trust
shall continue pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

                 (b)  Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement and the
Trust pursuant to clause (a), the proceeds from any Disposition of the
Receivables and the related transferred assets pursuant to clause (a) shall be
treated as Collections on the Receivables and shall be deposited in the
Collateral Account.

                 (c)  The Indenture Trustee may appoint an agent or agents to
assist with its responsibilities pursuant to this Section 10.03 with respect to
competitive bids.

<PAGE>   58

                 (d)  The Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be permitted to
bid for the Receivables and the related transferred assets.  The Indenture
Trustee may obtain a prior determination from any bankruptcy trustee, receiver
or liquidator that the terms and manner of any proposed Disposition are
commercially reasonable.

                 (e)  Notwithstanding the termination of this Indenture and the
Trust pursuant to clause (a), the Indenture Trustee shall continue to have the
rights described in Section 10.02 and Article XI, and be subject to direction
on terms consistent with those set out in Section 10.07, pending the completion
of any Disposition and/or the reconstitution of the Trust.

                 Section 10.04.  Indenture Trustee May Enforce Claims Without
Possession of the Notes.  All rights of action and claims under this Indenture
and the Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Indenture Trustee without
the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any Proceeding
relating thereto, and any such Proceeding instituted by the Indenture Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee, be
for the ratable benefit of the Noteholders.  In any Proceedings brought by the
Indenture Trustee (including without limitation any Proceeding involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture), the Indenture Trustee shall
be held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be necessary to make
any Noteholders parties to any such Proceeding.

                 Section 10.05.  Restoration of Rights.  In the event the
Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture, and such Proceeding shall have been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholder, then and in every such
case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to
any determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to
their former positions and rights under this Indenture, and all rights,
remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders
shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been instituted.

                 Section 10.06.  Limitations on Suits by Noteholders.  No
Noteholder shall have any right to institute any Proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, upon, under or with respect to this Indenture or the Notes, or for
the appointment of a receiver,





                                       51

trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official, or for any
other remedy under this Indenture or the Notes, unless:

         (a)     such Noteholder shall have previously given written notice to
                 the Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer of a continuing Early
                 Amortization Event;

         (b)     the Majority Noteholders shall have previously (1) made
                 written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute, or to
                 cause the institution of, Proceedings in respect of such Early
                 Amortization Event in its own name as Indenture Trustee under
                 this Indenture and (2) offered to the Indenture Trustee
                 reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and
                 liabilities that may reasonably be incurred by the Indenture
                 Trustee in compliance with such request;

         (c)     the Indenture Trustee, for sixty (60) days after its receipt
                 of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, has failed to
                 institute any such Proceeding; and

         (d)     no direction inconsistent with such request has been given to
                 the Indenture Trustee during such sixty (60) day period by the
                 Majority Noteholders;

it being understood and intended that no Noteholder or Noteholders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture or the Notes to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of
any other Noteholder or Noteholders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority
or preference over any other such Noteholder or Noteholders (except as set
forth in this Indenture) or to enforce any right under this Indenture or the
Notes, except in the manner provided in this Indenture and for the equal and
proportionate benefit of all the Noteholders.

                 Section 10.07.  Control by Noteholders.  Pursuant to the terms
and provisions of this Indenture, the Majority Noteholders are authorized to
direct the Indenture Trustee to take all actions on behalf of the Noteholders
under this Indenture, the Notes and the other Transaction Documents and to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy
available to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders, or the exercising of any
trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture, the
Notes or the other Transaction Documents; provided that, such direction shall
not conflict with any rule of law or this Indenture, the Notes or the other
Transaction Documents; and provided further that, subject to the provisions of
Section 11.01





                                       52
<PAGE>   60

of this Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to decline to
follow any such direction (1) if the Indenture Trustee is advised pursuant to
the advice or an opinion of counsel that the action or Proceeding so directed
may not lawfully be taken or (2) if an Authorized Officer of the Indenture
Trustee determines in good faith that the action or Proceeding so directed
would involve the Indenture Trustee in personal liability.  Nothing in this
Indenture shall impair the right of the Indenture Trustee in its discretion to
take any action deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee and which is not
inconsistent with any direction by the Majority Noteholders.

                 Section 10.08.  Indenture Trustee To Give Notice of Early
Amortization Event, But May Withhold in Certain Circumstances.  The Indenture
Trustee shall transmit to the Noteholders and each Rating Agency notice of any
Early Amortization Event known to an Authorized Officer of the Indenture
Trustee, such notice to be transmitted within fifteen (15) days after the
occurrence thereof; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee shall not be
required to transmit to the Noteholders such notice if such Early Amortization
Event shall have been cured before the giving of such notice.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

                 Section 11.01.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Indenture
Trustee; Prior to Early Amortization Event; After Early Amortization Event.
Except as otherwise required by law, the Indenture Trustee, prior to the
occurrence of an Early Amortization Event and after the curing or waiving of
all Early Amortization Events which may have occurred, undertakes to perform
such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Indenture.  Except as otherwise required by law, prior to the occurrence of an
Early Amortization Event and after the curing or waiving of all Early
Amortization Events which may have occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall at all
times exercise reasonable care with respect to the Collateral.  The Indenture
Trustee shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care with respect to the
Collateral if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that
which the Indenture Trustee accords its own property.  If an Early Amortization
Event of which an Authorized Officer has knowledge of has occurred (which has
not been cured or waived), the Indenture Trustee shall exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would





                                       53
<PAGE>   61

exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.  If
an Early Amortization Event of which an Authorized Officer has knowledge of has
occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Indenture Trustee shall at
all times exercise such care with respect to the Collateral as a prudent man
would exercise with respect to his own property.  No provision of this
Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Indenture Trustee from liability
for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own
wilful misconduct, provided that:

         (a)     prior to the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event and
                 after the curing or waiving of all such Early Amortization
                 Events which may have occurred:

                 (1)      the duties and obligations of the Indenture Trustee
                          shall be determined solely by the express provisions
                          of this Indenture, and the Indenture Trustee shall
                          not be liable except for the performance of such
                          duties and obligations as are specifically set forth
                          in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or
                          obligations shall be read into this Indenture against
                          the Indenture Trustee; and

                 (2)      in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
                          Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee may
                          conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements
                          and the correctness of the opinions expressed
                          therein, upon any statements, certificates or
                          opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and
                          conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but
                          in the case of any such statements, certificates or
                          opinions which by any provision of this Indenture are
                          specifically required to be furnished to the
                          Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall be
                          under a duty to examine the same to determine whether
                          or not they conform to the requirements of this
                          Indenture;

         (b)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
                 judgment made in good faith by an Authorized Officer of the
                 Indenture Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the
                 Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
                 facts;

         (c)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any
                 action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good





                                       54
<PAGE>   62

                 faith in accordance with the written direction of the Majority
                 Noteholders relating to the time, method and place of
                 conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the
                 Indenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
                 upon the Indenture Trustee, under this Indenture or any Series
                 Supplement;

         (d)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
                 any failure by the Servicer to comply with any of its
                 obligations under the Purchase and Servicing Agreement unless
                 an Authorized Officer of the Indenture Trustee obtains actual
                 knowledge of such failure or the Indenture Trustee receives
                 written notice of such failure;

         (e)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
                 an Early Amortization Event unless an Authorized Officer
                 obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Indenture
                 Trustee receives written notice of such event from the
                 Servicer or the Majority Noteholders;

         (f)     the Indenture Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the
                 performance of the Servicer, nor shall it have any liability
                 in connection with malfeasance or nonfeasance by the Servicer
                 provided, however, that the Trustee shall forward to the
                 Noteholders any reports, certificates, or other documents
                 required to be delivered pursuant to this Indenture and the
                 Purchase and Servicing Agreement; the Indenture Trustee shall
                 have no liability in connection with compliance of the
                 Servicer or the Seller with statutory or regulatory
                 requirements related to the Receivables; the Indenture Trustee
                 shall not make or be deemed to have made any representations
                 or warranties with respect to the Receivables or the validity
                 or sufficiency of any assignment of the Receivables to the
                 Trust or the Indenture Trustee; and

         (g)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk
                 its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
                 the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or under any
                 Series Supplement or in the exercise of any of its rights or
                 powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the
                 repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
                 risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

Subject to Section 11.01 of this Indenture:

         (a)     the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully
                 protected in acting or refraining from acting, as applicable,
                 in accordance with any resolution, certificate, statement,

                 believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
                 presented by the proper party or parties;

         (b)     unless expressly required otherwise, any request or direction
                 of the Issuer mentioned in this Indenture shall be
                 sufficiently evidenced by a written request or order signed by
                 an Authorized Officer of the Owner Trustee;

         (c)     whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Indenture
                 Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter (including
                 without limitation an Early Amortization Event) be proved or
                 established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action
                 hereunder, the Indenture Trustee (unless other evidence be
                 herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
                 faith on its part, rely upon a certificate of a Financial
                 Officer of the Servicer;

         (d)     the Indenture Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice
                 of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and
                 complete authorization and protection in respect of any action
                 taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and
                 in reliance thereon;

         (e)     the Indenture Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
                 any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at
                 the request or direction of any of the Noteholders pursuant to
                 this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have offered to
                 the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs,
                 expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in
                 compliance with such request or direction;

         (f)     prior to the occurrence of an Early Amortization Event and
                 after the curing or waiving of all such Early Amortization
                 Events which may have occurred, the Indenture Trustee shall
                 not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or
                 matters stated in any





                                       56

                 resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
                 report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
                 debenture or other paper or document, unless so requested in
                 writing by the Majority Noteholders, but the Indenture
                 Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or
                 investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit,
                 and, if the Indenture Trustee shall determine to make such
                 further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to
                 examine, upon two (2) Business Days prior notice and during
                 normal business hours, the books, records and premises of the
                 Issuer, Seller or Servicer, personally or by agent or
                 attorney;

         (g)     the Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
                 under this Indenture or perform any duties under this
                 Indenture either directly or through agents, attorneys,
                 custodians or nominees, and the Indenture Trustee shall not be
                 responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of,
                 or for the supervision of, any such agent, attorney, custodian
                 or nominee appointed with due care by it hereunder;

         (h)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be personally liable for any
                 action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and

                 rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture or any
                 Supplement;

         (i)     the Indenture Trustee shall not be required to make any
                 initial or periodic examination of any documents or records
                 related to the Receivables for the purpose of establishing the
                 presence or absence of defects, the compliance by the Seller
                 with its representations and warranties or for any other
                 purpose; and

         (j)     when the Indenture Trustee incurs expenses or renders services
                 in connection with an Insolvency Event, such expenses
                 (including the fees and expenses of its counsel) and the
                 compensation for such services are intended to constitute
                 expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.

                 Section 11.03.  Certificate of Authorized Officer and Opinion
of Counsel.  Upon any application or request by the Issuer to the Indenture
Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the Issuer
shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee a certificate of an Authorized Officer
of the Issuer stating that





                                       57
<PAGE>   65

all conditions precedent, if any (including any covenants compliance with which
constitutes a condition precedent), provided for in this Indenture relating to
the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating
that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent, if any
(including any covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition
precedent), have been complied with, except that in the case of any such
application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents is
specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such
particular application or request, no additional certificate or opinion need be
furnished.  Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (1) a
statement that each individual signing such certificate or opinion has read
such covenant or condition and the definitions in this Indenture relating
thereto, (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or
investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such
certificate or opinion are based, (3) a statement that, in the opinion of each
such individual, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary
to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant
or condition has been complied with and (4) a statement as to whether, in the
opinion of each such individual, such condition or covenant has been complied
with.

                 Section 11.04.  Indemnification.

                 The Issuer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indenture
Trustee and each Noteholder and each of its respective directors, officers,
employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, losses, claims,
damages, actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) sustained by reason of any acts, omissions
or alleged acts or omissions relating to or arising out of the activities of
the Trust or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture or in connection
with the Issuer's performance under this Indenture or the Purchase and
Servicing Agreement, except to the extent such liabilities, losses, claims,
damages, actions, suits, judgments, demands, costs or expenses are caused by
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Indenture Trustee or any of
its directors, officers, employees or agents.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the rights of the Indenture Trustee hereunder to indemnification from the
Issuer shall be subordinated to the rights of the Noteholders to
indemnification hereunder from the Issuer and payments to the Indenture Trustee
in respect of such indemnification shall be payable solely from amounts
available for distribution to the Trust pursuant to Article V hereof.  The
Indenture Trustee's rights and remedies in respect of





                                       58
<PAGE>   66

claims for indemnification from the Issuer hereunder shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 14.08 hereof.  The indemnity set forth in this Section
11.04 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and the
satisfaction or discharge termination of this Indenture.

                 Section 11.05.  Fees and Expenses of the Indenture Trustee.
The fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee will be paid out of the
Servicing Fee paid to the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Purchase and
Servicing Agreement.

                 Section 11.06.  Acts of Noteholders.  Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by
this Indenture to be given or taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and
evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by
such Noteholders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and,
except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture
Trustee, and where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer or any other
Person.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing
any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture or any
other Transaction Document and (subject to Section 11.01 of this Indenture)
conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the
manner provided in this Section 11.06.  The fact and date of the execution by
any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of
a witness to such execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other
officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the
individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution
thereof.  Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or a member of
a partnership, on behalf of such corporation or partnership, such certificate
shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.  The fact and date of
the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person
executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that the Indenture
Trustee deems sufficient.  Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action by any Noteholder shall bind the
Noteholder of every Note issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange
therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done or suffered to be done
by the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon whether or not
notation of such action is made upon such Note.  The ownership of a Note for
the purpose of this Section 11.06 shall be proved by the Note Register.

                 Section 11.07.  Payments on the Notes.  On each Payment Date
(whether during the Interest-Only Period or the Amortization Period), the
Indenture Trustee shall effect all payments with respect to the Notes pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.

                 Section 11.08.  Documents and Information.  Whenever the
Indenture Trustee has the right to require the delivery of information pursuant
to this Indenture or any other Transaction Document, the Indenture Trustee
shall, acting at the written direction of the Majority Noteholders, request the
delivery of such information pursuant to such document.  The Indenture Trustee
shall make available copies of any document, report or schedule delivered to it
pursuant to this Indenture or any other Transaction Document for inspection
upon the written request of any of the Noteholders, and shall forward a copy of
any such document, report or schedule to any Noteholder, at such Noteholder's
expense, upon the written request of such Noteholder.  The Indenture Trustee
shall also furnish a copy of any such document, report or schedule to each
Rating Agency at the expense of the Issuer.  The Indenture Trustee shall, upon
a Noteholder's written request, advise the Noteholder to the extent then known
of (1) the amount of interest and Monthly Principal due on the next Payment
Date with respect to each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes and with
respect to the outstanding principal amount of all Notes, and (2) the
outstanding principal amount of each Note and the outstanding principal amount
of all Notes.

                 Section 11.09.  Application of Funds; Return of Unclaimed
Funds.  Until used or applied as provided in this Indenture, all funds received
by the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture shall be held in trust for the
purposes for which they were received, shall be uninvested for as long as such
funds are held in trust (unless otherwise provided by this Indenture) and shall
be segregated from other funds of the Indenture Trustee to the extent required
by law and under this Indenture.  The Indenture Trustee shall be under no
liability for interest on any funds received by it except as otherwise agreed
with the Issuer.  Any funds deposited with the Indenture Trustee for the
payment of principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on, the Notes, and
remaining unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such principal,
premium or interest became due and payable, shall be repaid to the Issuer by
the Indenture Trustee upon demand, and any Noteholder to which such deposit
related previously entitled to receive payment thereof shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for the payment thereof,
and all liability of the Indenture Trustee with respect to such funds shall
thereupon cease.

                 Section 11.10.  Forwarding of Notices.  If the Indenture
Trustee shall receive any notice, demand or other written communication from
any Noteholder pursuant or related to this Indenture, the Notes or any other
Transaction Documents, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly forward a copy of
such notice, demand or other written communication to the Issuer.

                 Section 11.11.  Notes Held by the Indenture Trustee; Rights of
Indenture Trustee.  The Indenture Trustee, in its individual or other capacity,
may become the owner or pledgee of the Notes with the same rights it would have
if it were not acting as Indenture Trustee under this Indenture.  The Indenture
Trustee may become a creditor, directly or indirectly, of the Issuer or any of
its Affiliates or agencies, make any loan or loans thereto, hold or become a
pledgee of any form of indebtedness thereof (including without limitation the
Notes), own, accept or negotiate any drafts, bills of exchange, acceptances or
obligations thereof, make disbursements therefor and enter into any commercial
or business arrangement therewith without limitation, all without any liability
on the part of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture for any real or
apparent conflict of interest by reason of any such dealing.

                 Section 11.12.  Inspection.  Upon reasonable notice to the
Indenture Trustee, the Issuer may, at its sole cost and expense, during normal
business hours, inspect and photocopy any Notes held by the Indenture Trustee,
any books of registration and transfer relating to the Notes, and any other
books and records maintained by the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture or
any other Transaction Document.  Upon reasonable notice to the Indenture
Trustee, the Noteholders may, at their sole cost and expense, during normal
business hours, inspect and photocopy all relevant books, records and notices
furnished to or available to the Indenture Trustee under or in connection with
this Indenture.

                 Section 11.13.  Indenture Trustee; Resignation; Removal;
Successors.  The Issuer agrees, for the benefit of the Noteholders, that there
shall at all times be a Indenture Trustee under this Indenture until such time
as there are no longer any Notes outstanding under this Indenture, which
Indenture Trustee (1) shall be a bank or trust company organized, doing
business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America or
of the State of New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least $250
million, (2)  shall have a long-term debt rating not less than BBB by Standard
& Poor's and, if rated by Duff & Phelps, BBB by Duff & Phelps, or shall

New York and




                                       61
<PAGE>   69

(4) shall be authorized under the laws of the United States of America or of the
State of New York to exercise corporate trust powers.  The Indenture Trustee may
at any time resign by giving written notice to the Issuer and the Noteholders of
its resignation (which notice shall also be delivered to each Rating Agency),
specifying the date on which its resignation shall become effective (which shall
not be less than sixty (60) days after the date on which such notice is given
unless the Issuer and the Majority Noteholders shall agree to a shorter period);
provided that, no resignation shall take effect until the appointment of a
successor Indenture Trustee and the acceptance of such appointment by such
successor Indenture Trustee in accordance with this Section 11.13.  The
Indenture Trustee may at any time be removed by the Majority Noteholders by
written notice (which notice shall also be delivered to each Rating Agency) from
the Majority Noteholders to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee specifying the
date on which such removal shall become effective; provided that, no removal
shall take effect until the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee and the
acceptance of such appointment by such successor Indenture Trustee in accordance
with this Section 11.13.  If at any time the Indenture Trustee shall resign, or
shall be removed, or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent, or shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or make
an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or consent to the appointment of
a receiver or conservator of all or any substantial part of its property, or
shall generally not be paying its debts as they become due, or if an order of
any court shall be entered approving any petition filed by or against it under
the provisions of Chapter 7 or 11 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code or under
the provisions of any similar legislation, or if a receiver or custodian of it
or of all or any substantial part of its property shall be appointed, or if any
public officer shall have taken charge or control of the Indenture Trustee or of
its property or affairs, for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, a successor Indenture Trustee, qualified as aforesaid, shall be
appointed as follows:

         (a)     (1)      so long as no Early Amortization Event shall have
                          occurred and be continuing at the time of receipt by
                          the Issuer of such resignation notice or removal
                          notice, or the time of such incapability of acting,
                          adjudication, filing, assignment, consent, nonpayment
                          of debts, entry of court order, appointment, or
                          taking of charge or control, as the case may be, the
                          successor Indenture Trustee shall be appointed by the
                          Issuer, with the consent of the Majority Noteholders
                          (which consent shall not be





                                       62
<PAGE>   70

                          unreasonably withheld); provided that, if the Issuer
                          and the Majority Noteholders fail to agree on a
                          successor Indenture Trustee within thirty (30) days
                          after such receipt, incapability of acting,
                          adjudication, filing, assignment, consent, nonpayment
                          of debts, entry of court order, appointment, or taking
                          of charge or control, as the case may be, the
                          successor Indenture Trustee shall be appointed by the
                          Majority Noteholders; and

                 (2)      so long as an Early Amortization Event shall have
                          occurred and be continuing at the time of receipt by
                          the Issuer of such resignation notice or removal
                          notice, or the time of such incapability of acting,
                          adjudication, filing, assignment, consent, nonpayment
                          of debts, entry of court order, appointment, or
                          taking of charge or control, as the case may be, the
                          successor Indenture Trustee shall be appointed by the
                          Majority Noteholders; and

         (b)     the successor Indenture Trustee shall accept its appointment
                 as Indenture Trustee under this Indenture by the execution and
                 delivery of an instrument of appointment, acceptance and
                 succession, whereupon (1) the predecessor Indenture Trustee
                 shall (A) cease to be Indenture Trustee under this Indenture
                 and (B) at the written direction of the Issuer and the
                 Majority Noteholders deliver and pay over to the successor
                 Indenture Trustee any and all securities, moneys and any other
                 properties then in its possession as Indenture Trustee, and
                 execute all such documents and take all such other actions as
                 may be necessary or advisable to effect the succession and (2)
                 the successor Indenture Trustee, without any further act, deed
                 or conveyance, shall succeed to and become vested with all the
                 authority, rights, powers, trusts, immunities, duties and
                 obligations of such predecessor Indenture Trustee, with like
                 effect as if originally named as such Indenture Trustee under
                 this Indenture.

If no successor Indenture Trustee shall have been so appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment within sixty (60) days after the receipt by the
Issuer of the predecessor Indenture Trustee's notice of resignation, the
predecessor Indenture Trustee may, on behalf of the Majority Noteholders,
appoint a successor Indenture Trustee, which shall be qualified as required in
this Section





                                       63
<PAGE>   71

11.13.  Upon any succession of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture
(notice of which shall be provided to each Rating Agency), the predecessor
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to the payment of compensation and
reimbursement agreed to under this Indenture for services rendered and expenses
incurred.  After any succession of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture,
the provisions of Section 11.04 of this Indenture shall inure to the benefit of
the predecessor Indenture Trustee as to any action taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Indenture Trustee under this Indenture.  The Majority
Noteholders shall give prompt written notice of the appointment of a successor
Indenture Trustee to all of the Noteholders.  No Indenture Trustee under this
Indenture shall be personally liable for any action or omission of any
successor Indenture Trustee.

                 Section 11.14.  Merger and Consolidation.  Any corporation
into which the Indenture Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion
or consolidation to which the Indenture Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Indenture Trustee, shall be the successor of the Indenture
Trustee under this Indenture, without the execution or filing of any paper or
any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto and shall be required
to meet the requirements of Section 11.13 of this Indenture.  In case any Notes
shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Indenture Trustee then
in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such
authenticating Indenture Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the
Notes so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Indenture
Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.

                 Section 11.15.  Separate Indenture Trustees or Co-Trustees.
For purposes of meeting the legal requirements of certain local jurisdictions,
the Indenture Trustee shall have the power to appoint a co-trustee or separate
trustees of all or any part of the Issuer.  In the event of such appointment,
all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the
Indenture Trustee by the Indenture shall be conferred or imposed upon the
Indenture Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly, or, in any
jurisdiction in which the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified
to perform certain acts, singly upon such separate trustee or co-trustee who
shall exercise and perform such rights, powers, duties and obligations solely
at the direction of the Indenture Trustee.

principal (and premium, if any) of this Note.

dated as of July 1, 1994 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and Bankers
Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee which, among other things contains
provisions for the acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the occurrence of
certain events, for the optional redemption of this Note by the Issuer and for
the amendment or waiver of certain provisions of the Indenture, all upon the
terms and conditions therein specified.  Capitalized terms which are used
herein that are not defined shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in
the Indenture.  Upon written request, the Indenture Trustee shall provide a
copy of such Indenture to the holder of this Note.  This Note shall not be

of principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on, the Notes, and remaining
unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such principal, premium or
interest became due and payable, shall be repaid to the Issuer by the Indenture
Trustee upon demand, and any Noteholder to which such deposit related
previously entitled to receive payment thereof shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for the payment thereof,
and all liability of the Indenture Trustee with respect to such funds shall
thereupon cease.

applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby
would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of the State of
Delaware and the laws of the United States of America), then, in that event,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement entered into in
connection with this Note, it is agreed as follows:  (i) the aggregate of all
consideration that constitutes interest, if any, under applicable law that is
taken, reserved, contracted for, charged or received under this Note or any
other agreement or document executed in connection with this Note shall under
no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable
law, and any excess shall be credited to other amounts due under this Note by
the holder hereof (or if this Note shall have been paid in full, refunded to
the Issuer); and (ii) in the event that maturity of this Note is accelerated by
reason of any election by the holder hereof resulting from any default
hereunder or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted
prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include
more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law, and excess interest, if
any, provided for in this Note or otherwise shall be cancelled automatically as
of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore prepaid,
shall be credited to other amounts due under this Note (or if this Note shall
have been paid in full, refunded to the Issuer).  In the event that applicable
law provides for a ceiling on the rate of interest, if any, chargeable
hereunder, that ceiling shall be the indicated rate ceiling.

purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been manually
signed by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.

WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SERIES TERMINATION DATE:  March 15, 2003
CLASS C NOTE RATE:  8.15% Per Annum

<PAGE>   95

                 ZALE FUNDING TRUST (the "Issuer"), for value received, hereby
promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or its registered assigns, the principal amount
of Twenty Million Four Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars (as may be reduced by any
payment of Monthly Principal), on the Series Termination Date.  The Issuer
agrees to pay the principal amount, if any, which is the Monthly Principal, on
the fifteenth day of each calendar month or, if such fifteenth day is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day (each, a "Payment Date"),
commencing with the Amortization Commencement Date, until the outstanding
principal amount hereof is paid or reduced to zero pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture or payment therefor is made available pursuant to the Indenture (as
referred to below).  The Issuer further agrees to pay interest at the rate of
8.15% per annum (the "Class C Note Rate"), calculated on the basis of a 360-day
year consisting of twelve 30-day months on each Payment Date, commencing with
August 15, 1994, equal to the interest that accrued during the preceding Fixed
Rate Interest Period on the principal balance of this Note outstanding during
such calendar month after giving effect to payments of principal, if any, made
on the preceding Payment Date.  Interest on this Note will accrue from and
including the 15th day of the month preceding the month in which such Payment
Date occurs (or, in the case of the first Payment Date, from and including the
Issuance Date) to and including the 14th day of the month in which such Payment
Date occurs.

                 Interest for any Payment Date due but not paid on such Payment
Date will be due on the next succeeding Payment Date together with additional
interest on such amount at the Class C Note Rate.

                 The principal of, premium if any, and interest on this Note
are payable in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the
time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.  All
payments made by the Issuer with respect to this Note shall be applied first to
interest due and payable on this Note as provided above and then to the unpaid
principal (and premium, if any) of this Note.

                 This Note is one of the Notes referred to in the Indenture
dated as of July 1, 1994 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and Bankers
Trust Company, as Indenture Trustee which, among other things contains
provisions for the acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the occurrence of
certain events, for the optional redemption of this Note by the Issuer and for
the amendment or waiver of certain provisions of the Indenture, all upon the
terms and conditions therein specified.  Capitalized terms which are used
herein that are not defined shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in
the Indenture.  Upon written

<PAGE>   96

request, the Indenture Trustee shall provide a copy of such Indenture to the
holder of this Note.  This Note shall not be subject to optional prepayment
except as provided in the Indenture.

                 Any funds deposited with the Indenture Trustee for the payment
of principal of, and premium (if any) or interest on, the Notes, and remaining
unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such principal, premium or
interest became due and payable, shall be repaid to the Issuer by the Indenture
Trustee upon demand, and any Noteholder to which such deposit related
previously entitled to receive payment thereof shall thereafter, as an
unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for the payment thereof,
and all liability of the Indenture Trustee with respect to such funds shall
thereupon cease.

                 It is the intention of the Issuer to conform strictly to
applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby
would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of the State of
Delaware and the laws of the United States of America), then, in that event,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement entered into in
connection with this Note, it is agreed as follows:  (i) the aggregate of all
consideration that constitutes interest, if any, under applicable law that is
taken, reserved, contracted for, charged or received under this Note or any
other agreement or document executed in connection with this Note shall under
no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable
law, and any excess shall be credited to other amounts due under this Note by
the holder hereof (or if this Note shall have been paid in full, refunded to
the Issuer); and (ii) in the event that maturity of this Note is accelerated by
reason of any election by the holder hereof resulting from any default
hereunder or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted
prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest may never include
more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law, and excess interest, if
any, provided for in this Note or otherwise shall be cancelled automatically as
of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore prepaid,
shall be credited to other amounts due under this Note (or if this Note shall
have been paid in full, refunded to the Issuer).  In the event that applicable
law provides for a ceiling on the rate of interest, if any, chargeable
hereunder, that ceiling shall be the indicated rate ceiling.

                 This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any
purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been manually
signed by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.

         to funds available therefor on such Purchase Date pursuant to Section
         5.01 of the Indenture; provided that, in no event shall cash payments
         be made to the extent such payments would cause a Borrowing Base

         amount of the Subordinated Note in an aggregate amount equal to the
         excess, if any, of the Purchase Price to be paid to the Seller on such

                 Section 2.05.  Adjustments for Ineligible Receivables.  In the
event of a breach of the representation and warranty set forth in Section
4.03(a) hereof, then promptly upon the earlier to occur of the discovery of
such breach by the Seller or Servicer or receipt by the Seller of written
notice from the Indenture Trustee of such breach, the Purchase Price for
Receivables to be purchased from the Seller on such day shall be reduced by the
outstanding principal amount of the Receivables with respect to which such
breach occurred and the Servicer shall deduct the outstanding principal amount
of such Receivables from the Pool Balance.  In the event such reduction of the
Pool Balance would cause the Trust's Participation Amount to be less than the
Aggregate Available Subordinated Amount, on the date of such reduction the
Seller shall make a deposit (the "Transfer Deposit Amount") to the Collateral
Account in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the amount by
which the Trust's Participation Amount would otherwise be reduced below the
Aggregate Available Subordinated Amount.  The obligation of the Seller to
accept adjustment of the Purchase Price as herein provided or to deposit the
Transfer Deposit Amount shall be the sole remedy respecting breach of the
representations and warranties identified in the first sentence of this Section
2.05 available to the noteholders of any Series or the Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the noteholders of any Series.

                 Section 2.06.  Returns.  The Seller may accept returns of
goods for full or partial credit (a "Credit Return") or make a daily adjustment
in the principal amount or finance or other charges accrued or payable with
respect to an Account if such adjustment is permitted by and made in accordance
with the Credit Card Guidelines (a "Credit Adjustment").  Each Credit Return
and Credit Adjustment (including any Credit Adjustment required by any
Requirement of Law) shall be made by the Seller on the applicable Date of
Processing.  All Credit Returns and Credit Adjustments on any Date of
Processing shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all such
returns and adjustments made with respect to the Purchased Receivables on such
Date of Processing (the "Return Amount").  The Servicer shall deduct the Return
Amount from the Pool Balance on such Date of Processing.  To the extent such
reduction reduces the Trust's Participation Amount below the Aggregate
Available Subordinated Amount for the immediately preceding Determination Date
(after giving effect to the allocations, distributions, withdrawals and
deposits to be made on the Payment Date immediately following such
Determination Date),





                                       5
<PAGE>   11





the Seller will deposit a cash amount equal to such deficiency into the
Collateral Account in immediately available funds (an "Adjustment Payment") on
the day on which such adjustment occurs.

                 Section 2.07.  Finance Charges.  Finance Charges, whenever
created and whenever received, accrued in respect of Purchased Receivables,
shall be the property of the Issuer and all Collections with respect thereto
shall be allocated and treated as Collections in respect of Purchased
Receivables.

                 Section 2.08.  Allocations Between Purchased and Non-Purchased
Receivables.  The Seller, the Issuer and the Servicer agree that the Servicer
shall apply Collections on an Account by Account basis between Purchased
Receivables and Non-Purchased Receivables as set forth below:

                          (a)     Collections.  All Collections of Finance
Charges received in respect of an Account containing both Purchased Receivables
and Non-Purchased Receivables shall be allocated for the purposes of this
Agreement on a pro rata basis (based on Purchase Prices) between Purchased
Receivables and Non-Purchased Receivables in the Account.  All other
Collections received in respect of an Account containing both Purchased
Receivables and Non-Purchased Receivables shall be allocated for the purposes
of this Agreement (1) first, to pay Purchased Receivables in the Account until
such Purchased Receivables are paid in full and (2) second, to pay
Non-Purchased Receivables in the Account.  All Collections in respect of any
Account that contains only Purchased Receivables shall be paid in respect of
Purchased Receivables and all Collections in respect of any Account that
contains only Non-Purchased Receivables shall be paid in respect of
Non-Purchased Receivables.

                          (b)     Credits; Returns.  All credits and returns
made after the Purchase Termination Date shall be applied to the Receivable to
which such credit or return relates, whether with respect to a Purchased
Receivable or a Non-Purchased Receivable.

                          (c)     Gross Charge-Offs.  Gross Charge-Offs of any
Account shall be made for all Receivables in the Account, with a pro rata
reduction (based on Purchase Prices) in Purchased Receivables and Non-Purchased
Receivables in the Account.

<PAGE>   12





                          (d)     Recoveries.  Recoveries with respect to any
Account shall be applied (1) first, in respect of Gross Charge-Offs of
Purchased Receivables in the Account until such Recoveries equal the amount of
such Gross Charge-Offs of Purchased Receivables in full and (2) second, in
respect of Gross Charge-Offs of Non-Purchased Receivables in the Account.

                 Section 2.09. Recovery of Sales Tax.  The Seller may, at its
option, repurchase any Purchased Receivables from the Issuer that have been
charged off in accordance with the Credit Card Guidelines to the extent
necessary to recover state sales tax related to such Purchased Receivables, at
a price equal to the sum of (a) the amount of Recoveries with respect to such
Purchased Receivables plus (b) the proceeds from such state sales tax.  Upon
any such repurchase, the Seller (1) agrees, to the extent not paid at the time
of repurchase, to pay promptly to the Issuer the amount of any Recoveries
received in respect of such repurchased charged-off Purchased Receivables and,
immediately upon crediting of such amount to the Seller by offset or otherwise,
the amount of state sales tax recovered with respect thereto, and (2) shall
grant a security interest to the Issuer in such repurchased Receivables and any
proceeds thereof (including any Recoveries therefrom) to secure the repurchase
price of such Receivables.

                 Section 2.10. Addition of Sellers.  Any Subsidiary of Zale
Corp. may sell its Receivables hereunder to the Issuer if the Rating Agency
Condition is satisfied with respect to such addition.  Zale Corp. and its
Subsidiary that is proposed to sell Receivables shall give to the Issuer and
the Rating Agencies not less than thirty days' prior written notice of the
effective date of the addition of such Subsidiary as a seller of Receivables.
Once such notice has been given, any addition of a Subsidiary of Zale Corp. as
a seller of Receivables pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall become effective on
the first Business Day following the expiration of such thirty-day period (or
such later date as may be specified in such notice) on which (i) the Rating
Agency Condition has been satisfied, (ii) such Subsidiary and the parties
hereto shall have executed and delivered such agreements, instruments and other
documents and such amendments or other modifications to the Transaction
Documents, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee, that the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee reasonably
determine are necessary or appropriate to effect such addition.

with respect thereto.

related asset by the Issuer from it constitutes a fraudulent transfer or
fraudulent conveyance under the United States Bankruptcy Code or applicable
state bankruptcy or insolvency laws or is otherwise void or voidable or subject
to subordination under similar laws or principles or for any other reason.

                          (o)     The Seller does not have any defined benefit

of the Seller and the Servicer shall (1) duly fulfill all obligations on its

                                   ARTICLE VI

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                            OF PURCHASED RECEIVABLES

                 Section 6.01.  Appointment of and Acceptance by the Servicer
of Servicing Obligations.  The Issuer hereby appoints JFS as Servicer of the
Purchased Receivables.  JFS agrees to act as the Servicer under this Agreement,
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Indenture, on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, it being
understood that the relationship of the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee is
intended by the parties to be that of an independent contractor and not that of
a joint venturer, partner or agent.  The Servicer shall (1) service and
administer each Account and collect and enforce the Purchased Receivables due
thereunder, (2) except as otherwise limited by this Agreement, exercise all
discretionary powers involved in such management, administration and collection
and (3) bear all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith that may
be necessary or advisable and permitted for carrying out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Indenture.  Servicing activities to be
performed by the Servicer include collecting and recording payments,
communicating with Cardholders, investigating payment delinquencies and
maintaining internal records with respect to each Cardholder.  Managerial
services performed by the Servicer on behalf of the Issuer include providing
related data processing and reporting services for noteholders of any Series
and on behalf of the Indenture Trustee and performing certain services required
pursuant to Sections 5.07, 9.05 and 9.06 of the Indenture.  Although physical
possession of the agreements, documents and files relating to the Receivables
will be held by the respective stores generating the Accounts, the Servicer,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, will be responsible for maintaining
custody of such documents relating to the Receivables.  In





                                       25
<PAGE>   31





the servicing and administration of the Accounts and the collection and
enforcement of the Purchased Receivables due thereunder, the Servicer shall
exercise a degree of skill and care consistent with those of a reasonable and
prudent servicer of retail credit card receivables, but in any event at least
comparable with the policies and procedures and the degree of skill and care
that it has exercised in servicing Receivables of the Seller and Affiliates of
the Seller, and the Servicer shall comply and perform in accordance with the
Credit Card Guidelines, except to the extent that failure to so comply or
perform (1) would not have a material adverse effect on the rights and remedies
of the Indenture Trustee and the noteholders of any Series under any
Transaction Document or (2) is necessary under any Requirement of Law.  The
Servicer shall be permitted to subcontract its obligations under this Section
6.01 to any Person satisfactory to the Seller, the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee who agrees to perform such obligations in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Credit Card Guidelines; provided that, the Servicer
shall remain fully responsible to the Issuer for any and all acts or failures
to act of any such subcontractor to the same extent as if the Servicer were
fully and directly responsible for such subcontractor's duties and
responsibilities.  In the ordinary course of business, the Servicer may at any
time delegate any of its duties under this Section 6.01 to any Person who
agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Credit Card Guidelines; provided that, such delegation shall not
relieve the Servicer of any of its liabilities and responsibilities with
respect to such duties, and shall not constitute a resignation within the
meaning of Section 6.10(a) of this Agreement.

                 Section 6.02.  Servicing Compensation.  As compensation for
its servicing activities hereunder and reimbursement for its expenses incurred
as the Servicer, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each Payment Date
(i) the Monthly Servicing Fee, pursuant to Section 5.02(iv) of the Indenture
and (ii) from the Issuer, an amount equal to one-twelfth of the Servicing Fee
less the Monthly Servicing Fee.  The Servicer shall bear all costs and expenses
(without right of reimbursement other than the Servicing Fee) incurred in
connection with performing its servicing activities under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of the Indenture Trustee
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and independent
accountants, fees and expenses incurred in collecting Purchased Receivables and
generating Recoveries, and all





                                       26
<PAGE>   32





other expenses incurred by the Servicer in connection with its servicing
activities under this Agreement; provided that, in no event shall the Servicer
be liable for any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax, or any
interest or penalties with respect thereto, assessed on the Indenture Trustee,
any noteholder of any Series or the Issuer.  The Servicer shall be required to
pay such costs and expenses for its own account, and shall not be entitled to
any payment therefor other than the Servicing Fee.

                 Section 6.03.  Reports and Statements.

                          (a)     Daily Report.  On each Business Day, the
Servicer shall prepare a Daily Report substantially in the form of Exhibit A to
this Agreement, on the basis of the sales and collections figures reported the
previous day or days from the Servicer's central computer processing center.
The Daily Report shall report, among other things, the dollar amount of
Receivables originations reported to the Servicer since the preceding Daily
Report and the dollar amount of Collections and Recoveries received in the
Collateral Account for the Applicable Day or Applicable Days covered by such
Daily Report (or, in the case of a Daily Report delivered on a day following a
Saturday, Sunday or other non-Business Day, the aggregate such activity for the
preceding Business Day and such non-Business Days).  The Servicer shall also
determine the Noteholder Default Amount on each Business Day and reflect such
amounts in the Daily Report.  By 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on each
Business Day, the Servicer shall deliver the Daily Report to the Issuer, the
Seller and the Indenture Trustee, which Daily Report shall be certified by a
Financial Officer of the Servicer; provided that, if a Force Majeure or a
"system failure" or other similar technical failure in the operations of the
Servicer shall occur that prevents the preparation or delivery of any Daily
Report within such time, the Servicer shall use its best efforts to recreate
Daily Reports for each Applicable Day missed as a result thereof or, if the
Servicer is unable to recreate such Daily Reports, the Servicer shall prepare a
composite Daily Report for each such missed Applicable Day and, in either case,
the Servicer shall deliver such Daily Reports to the Issuer, the Seller and the
Indenture Trustee within three Business Days of the date such Daily Report(s)
were otherwise required to be delivered.  Upon the discovery of any error in
any Daily Report by the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer or the Indenture
Trustee, the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer and the Indenture Trustee shall
confer and shall agree upon any necessary adjustments to correct any such
error.  Unless





                                       27
<PAGE>   33





the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee have received actual notice of any such
error, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee may rely on any Daily Report for
all purposes under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

                          (b)     Monthly Settlement Statement.  The Servicer
shall on each Determination Date, by 12:00 Noon (New York City time), prepare
and deliver to the Issuer, the Seller, the Indenture Trustee, each Rating
Agency and Bear Stearns, the Monthly Settlement Statement for the related
Settlement Period substantially in the form of Exhibit B to this Agreement,
certified by a Financial Officer of the Servicer; provided that, with respect
to any Monthly Settlement Statement, if a Force Majeure or a "system failure"
or other similar technical failure in the operations of the Servicer shall
occur that prevents the preparation or delivery of any Monthly Settlement
Statement, a Monthly Settlement Statement containing all information for each
day required to be included therein shall be prepared and delivered to the
Issuer, the Seller and the Indenture Trustee within three Business Days of the
date such Monthly Settlement Statement was otherwise required to be delivered.

                          (c)     Annual Independent Public Accountant's
Servicing Report.  The Servicer shall, no later than July 31 of each year
(commencing July 31, 1995), cause either Arthur Andersen & Co., Price
Waterhouse, Coopers & Lybrand, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young or KPMG Peat
Marwick (or any of their successors in interest) (which firm may also render
other services to the Servicer or any Affiliate thereof) to furnish a report,
as of April 30 of such year, to the Issuer, the Seller, each Rating Agency and
the Indenture Trustee, performing certain agreed upon procedures with respect
to certain documents and records relating to the servicing of the Receivables
and that, based upon such agreed-upon procedures, no matters came to their
attention that caused them to believe that such servicing was not conducted in
compliance with certain applicable terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement except for such exceptions or errors as such firm shall believe to be
immaterial and such other exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement.
Each such accountants' report shall state  that the accountants have compared
the amounts contained in one randomly selected Daily Report from each fiscal
quarter and two randomly selected Monthly Settlement Statements delivered by
the Servicer during the period covered by such report with the records from
which such amounts were derived and that, on the basis of such comparison, such
accountants are of the opinion





                                       28
<PAGE>   34





that the amounts are in agreement with such records, except for such exceptions
as they believe to be immaterial and such other exceptions as shall be set
forth in such report.

                          (d)     Compliance Statements.  The Servicer shall
deliver to the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee, on or before July 31 of
each year (beginning July 31, 1995) a certificate signed by a Financial Officer
stating that (1) a review of its activities relating to the servicing of the
Accounts during the prior year ending April 30 and performance under this
Agreement and the Indenture has been made under such officer's supervision, and
(2) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, it has
fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement throughout the period
covered by such certificate, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment
of any such obligations, specifying each such default known to such officer and
the nature and status thereof.

                 Section 6.04.  Collection Procedures.

                          (a)     Collection Deposits and Transfers.  On or
before the Issuance Date, the Servicer, the Seller and the Issuer shall have
established and shall maintain thereafter the system of collecting and
processing Collections of Purchased Receivables set forth in this Section 6.04.
The Obligors may make payments on Purchased Receivables only (1) by check
mailed to the Post Office Boxes (such payments, upon receipt in the Post Office
Boxes being referred to as "Mail Payments") or (2) by cash or check to the
Servicer or at stores operated by the Originators as the case may be (such
payments, upon receipt by such stores, being referred to as "Store Payments").
With respect to all Mail Payments, the Servicer shall (A) remove such Mail
Payments, or cause such Mail Payments to be removed, from the Post Office Boxes
on each Business Day, and process such payments by recording the amount of the
payment received from each Obligor and the applicable Account number, (B) no
later than one Business Day following the receipt of any Mail Payments in the
Post Office Boxes, deposit such Mail Payments, or cause such Mail Payments to
be deposited, in a Collection Deposit Account and (C) transfer, or cause to be
transferred, such Mail Payments to the Collateral Account (excluding, with
certain exceptions, certain portions thereof allocable to the Seller) on the
same day that such funds become available.  With respect to all Store Payments,
the Servicer and the Seller shall (1) cause all Store Payments to be (A)
processed as soon as possible after such payments are received by the





                                       29
<PAGE>   35





Seller or the Servicer and (B) deposit in Local Store Bank Accounts no later
than one local (with respect to the location of the applicable Local Store Bank
Account) business day following the day of such receipt, (2) no later than two
local (with respect to the location of the applicable Local Store Bank Account)

identified as such on Schedule I to the Indenture, or any successor
concentration account, which successor concentration account may be established
solely at the option of the Seller or any Affiliate thereof, referred to as the
"Concentration Account") and (3) transfer, or cause to be transferred, such
Store Payments from such Concentration Account to the Collateral Account
(excluding, with certain exceptions, certain portions thereof allocable to the
Seller) on the same day.

                          (b)     Force Majeure.  If any deposits or transfers
prescribed by Section 6.04(a) of this Agreement cannot be made within the time
period specified in such Section 6.04(a) as a result of a Force Majeure or a
depository institution's failure to so deposit or transfer, so long as such
deposits or transfers are made promptly after the cessation of such Force
Majeure or a depository institution's failure to so deposit or transfer, but in
no event later than three Business Days or local business days (with respect to
the location of the applicable Local Store Bank Account), as the case may be,
after such time period specified, the provisions of such Section 6.04(a) shall
be deemed to have been fully complied with.

                          (c)     Deposit of Recoveries.  The Servicer shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, all Recoveries in accordance with Section
6.04(a) of this Agreement.

                          (d)     Funds Held in Trust.  Any funds held by the
Seller or the Servicer representing Collections of Purchased Receivables shall,
until deposited in a Collection Deposit Account or the Collateral Account, be
held in trust by the Seller or the Servicer, as the case may be, for and as the
Indenture Trustee's property pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, and,
except as provided in Section 6.04(a) of this Agreement with respect to Store
Payments, shall not be commingled with the Seller's or the Servicer's other
funds or property.

<PAGE>   36





                          (e)     Waiver of Set-off.  The Seller and the
Servicer irrevocably waives any right to set off against, or otherwise deduct
from, any Collections.

                          (f)     Bank Accounts.  The Seller agrees that it
shall have no bank account, deposit account or trust account for the collection
of Purchased Receivables other than the Local Store Bank Accounts and the
Concentration Account, and that it shall not make or maintain any deposits from
Collections in any bank account, deposit account or trust account other than
the Local Store Bank Accounts and the Concentration Account and Collection
Deposit Accounts.

coverage by the Servicer, (5) maintain disaster recovery systems and back-up
computer and other information management systems that, in the Servicer's
reasonable judgment, are sufficient to protect its business as Servicer against
material interruption or loss in the event of damage to, or loss or destruction
of, its primary computer and information management systems and (6) furnish to
the Issuer and to the Indenture Trustee, acting at the written direction of the
Majority Noteholders, upon written request, full information as to such
disaster recovery systems and back-up computer and information management
systems, except, in the case of clause (1) of this Section 6.06, to the extent
failure to keep or maintain would not have a material adverse effect on the
rights and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the noteholders of any Series
under the Transaction Documents.

Purchased Receivables.  The Servicer shall provide the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee, and their respective representatives, access to the documentation
regarding the Accounts and the Purchased Receivables in such cases where the
Issuer is required, in connection with the enforcement of the rights of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any noteholder of any Series, or by applicable
statutes or regulations, to review such documentation, such access being
afforded without charge but only (1) upon two Business Days prior notice
(provided that, no such prior notice shall be required if an Early Amortization
Event has occurred and is continuing), (2) during normal business hours, (3)
subject to the Servicer's normal security and confidentiality procedures and
(4) at offices designated by the Servicer.  The obligation of the Servicer to
provide access to such documentation shall survive the Servicer's termination
as Servicer.  Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall derogate from any obligation
to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding
the Obligors, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access as provided in
this Section 6.07 as a result of any such obligation shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 6.07.

                 Section 6.08.  Certain Responsibilities of the Servicer and
the Seller.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1)
the Seller shall perform all its obligations under the Credit Card Guidelines
related to the Purchased Receivables to the same extent as if such Purchased
Receivables had not been transferred to the Issuer hereunder, (2) the exercise
by the Issuer of any of its rights under this Agreement shall not relieve the
Seller or the Servicer from such of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect to such Purchased Receivables (other than the obligations of any
predecessor Servicer under this Agreement with respect to which the Issuer has
terminated the appointment of such Servicer as the Servicer) and (3) except as
provided by law, the Issuer shall not have any obligation or liability with
respect to any Purchased Receivables or the underlying Credit Card Agreements,

stockholder, shareholder, employee, officer or director, in its capacity as
such, past, present or future, of any party hereto or of any successor party,
either directly or through such party, whether by virtue of any constitution or
statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or
otherwise, it being expressly understood that this Agreement and the
obligations issued hereunder are solely corporate obligations, and that no such
personal liability whatever shall attach to, or is or shall be incurred by the
incorporators, stockholders, shareholders, employees, officers or directors, as
such, of any such party or of any successor party, or any of them, because of
the creation of the obligations hereby authorized, or under or by reason of the
obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or in the

liability, either at common law or in equity or by constitution or statute, of,

respective directors, officers or employees may rely in good faith on any
document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person

                 Section 6.10.  Successor Servicer.

                          (a)     Servicer Resignation.  The Servicer shall not
resign from its obligations and duties under this Agreement except upon a
determination that the performance of its duties hereunder is no longer
permissible under applicable law.  Any such determination permitting the
resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced as to the immediately preceding
sentence by an opinion of counsel to such effect delivered to the Issuer, the
Seller and the Indenture Trustee.  No such resignation shall become effective
until a Successor Servicer shall have assumed the responsibilities and
obligations of the Servicer in accordance with Section 6.10 of this Agreement.

                          (b)     Servicer Default.  Any of the following events
shall constitute a "Servicer Default":





                                       33
<PAGE>   39





                 (i)  failure by the Servicer to make any payment, transfer or
         deposit, or to give instructions to the Indenture Trustee to make
         certain payments, transfers or deposits, on the date the Servicer is
         required to do so under this Agreement or any Series Supplement (or
         within the applicable grace period, which shall not exceed five
         Business Days);

                 (ii)  failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or
         perform in any respect any other covenants or agreements of the
         Servicer which has a material adverse effect on the noteholders of any
         Series issued and outstanding and which continues unremedied for a
         period of sixty days after written notice and continues to have a
         material adverse effect on such noteholders of any Series then
         outstanding; or the delegation by the Servicer of its duties under
         this Agreement, except as specifically permitted thereunder;

                 (iii)  any representation, warranty or certification made by
         the Servicer in this Agreement, or in any certificate delivered
         pursuant to this Agreement, proves to have been incorrect when made
         which has a material adverse effect on the noteholders of any Series
         then outstanding, and which continues to be incorrect in any material
         respect for a period of sixty days after written notice and continues
         to have a material adverse effect on such noteholders; or

                 (iv)  one of the events set forth in subsections 10.01(e) or
         (f) of the Indenture shall have occurred with respect to the Servicer.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance
referred to in clause (i) above for a period of ten Business Days, or referred
to under clause (ii) or (iii) for a period of sixty Business Days (in addition
to any period provided in (i), (ii) or (iii)), shall not constitute a Servicer
Default until the expiration of such additional ten or sixty Business Days,
respectively, if such delay or failure could not be prevented by the exercise
of reasonable diligence by the Servicer and such delay or failure was caused by
a Force Majeure.  Upon the occurrence of any such event, the Servicer shall not
be relieved from using its best efforts to perform its obligations in a timely
manner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Servicer shall
provide the Indenture Trustee, any provider of Enhancement, the Seller and
noteholders of each Series issued





                                       34
<PAGE>   40





and outstanding prompt notice of such failure or delay by it, together with a
description of the cause of such failure or delay and its efforts to perform
its obligations.

         In the event of any Servicer Default, either the Indenture Trustee or
the Majority Noteholders, by written notice to the Servicer (and to the
Indenture Trustee if given by the noteholders of each Series), may terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer as servicer under this
Agreement and in and to the Receivables and the proceeds thereof and the
Indenture Trustee may appoint a new Servicer (a "Service Transfer"), provided
that, notwithstanding any such termination, such terminated Servicer shall
remain responsible for any acts or omissions to act by it as Servicer prior to
such termination.  On and after the receipt by the Servicer of a Servicer
Termination Notice, the Servicer shall continue to perform all servicing
functions under this Agreement until the date specified in the Servicer
Termination Notice or, if no such date is specified in the Servicer Termination
Notice, until a date mutually agreed upon by the Servicer and the Issuer.

                          (c)     Appointment of Successor Servicer; Optional
Repurchase of Purchased Receivables.  As promptly as possible after the giving
of a notice to the Servicer of the termination of its rights and obligations of
the Servicer as servicer under this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.10(b)
hereof, the Indenture Trustee shall, acting at the written direction of the
Majority Noteholders, appoint a successor servicer (the "Successor Servicer")
and such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written
assumption in a form acceptable to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee.  On
the date that a Successor Servicer shall have been so appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment, all authority and power of the Servicer under this
Agreement shall pass to and be vested in such Successor Servicer.  The
Indenture Trustee, acting at the written direction of the Majority Noteholders,
is hereby authorized and empowered to (1) upon the failure of the predecessor
Servicer to cooperate, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the predecessor
Servicer as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments
upon the failure of the predecessor Servicer to execute or deliver such
documents or instruments and (2) do and accomplish all other acts or things
necessary or appropriate, in either case to effect the purposes of such
transfer of servicing rights.  If no such Servicer has been appointed and has
accepted such appointment by the time the Servicer ceases to act as Servicer,
all





                                       35
<PAGE>   41





authority, power and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement shall
pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee.  The Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee may obtain bids from any potential successor servicer.  If the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee are unable to obtain any bids from any potential
successor servicer and the Servicer delivers to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee an officer's certificate to the effect that it cannot in good faith
cure the Servicer Default which gave rise to a transfer of servicing, and if
the Indenture Trustee is legally unable to act as successor Servicer, then the
Indenture Trustee shall give the Seller the right of first refusal to purchase
the Purchased Receivables on terms equivalent to the best purchase offer as
determined by the Indenture Trustee.

                          (d)     Agreement to Cooperate; Servicing Transfer.
In connection with any succession of servicing under this Agreement, the
predecessor Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee and the Successor Servicer in effecting such succession under this
Agreement, including without limitation (1) the transfer to the Successor
Servicer of all authority of the Servicer to service the Accounts provided for
under this Agreement (including without limitation all authority over all
Collections which shall on the date of transfer be held by the predecessor
Servicer for deposit, or which shall thereafter be received by the predecessor
Servicer with respect to the Accounts) and (2) the prompt transfer by the
predecessor Servicer to the Successor Servicer of (a) the predecessor
Servicer's electronic records relating to the Accounts and the Purchased
Receivables in such electronic form as the Successor Servicer may reasonably
request and (b) all other records, correspondence and documents necessary for
the continued servicing of the Accounts in the manner and at such times as the
Successor Servicer shall reasonably request.  To the extent that compliance
with this Section 6.10(d) shall require the predecessor Servicer to disclose to
the Successor Servicer information of any kind which the predecessor Servicer
reasonably deems to be confidential, the Successor Servicer shall be required
to enter into such customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as the
predecessor Servicer shall deem necessary to protect its interests.  All costs
and expenses incurred in connection with a transfer of servicing under this
Agreement shall be borne by the predecessor Servicer.  The Seller shall, upon
request at all times, provide such information and assistance to the
predecessor Servicer or the Successor Servicer as shall be required for the
predecessor Servicer or the





                                       36
<PAGE>   42





Successor Servicer to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

                          (e)     Successor Servicer.  Upon its appointment,
any Successor Servicer shall be the successor in all respects to the
predecessor Servicer with respect to all servicing functions under this
Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, and all references in this Agreement to the Servicer shall
be deemed to refer to the Successor Servicer.  The Successor Servicer shall
expressly be authorized to delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to
the predecessor Servicer on and after the date of any transfer of servicing
pursuant to Section 6.01 of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Successor Servicer, as Servicer hereunder, shall continue to be fully
responsible for the performance of any duties so delegated.

                 Section 6.11.  Termination of Authority.  All authority and
power granted to the Servicer under this Agreement shall automatically cease
and terminate upon termination of this Agreement and the Indenture and shall
pass to and be vested in the Seller, and the Seller is hereby authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments, and to do
and accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the
purposes of such transfer of servicing rights.  The Servicer agrees to
cooperate with the Seller in effecting the termination of the responsibilities
and rights of the Servicer to conduct servicing of the Purchased Receivables,
including without limitation the transfer by the Servicer to the Seller, in the
manner and at such times as the Seller shall request, of (1) the Servicer's
electronic records relating to the Accounts and the Purchased Receivables
therein in such electronic form as the Seller may request and (2) all other
records, correspondence and documents relating to the Purchased Receivables.
To the extent that compliance with this Section 6.11 shall require the Servicer
to disclose to the Seller information of any kind which the Servicer deems to
be confidential, the Seller shall be required to enter into such customary
licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Servicer shall reasonably deem
necessary to protect its interests.

protected against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of any such person in the
performance of their duties or by reason of reckless disregard of their
obligations and duties thereunder.

                          (e)     In addition, the Servicer is not under any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not
incidental to its servicing responsibilities under this Agreement, nor is any
Successor Servicer liable for any acts of any of its predecessor Servicers.
The Servicer may, in its sole discretion, undertake any such legal action which
it may deem necessary or desirable for the benefit of noteholders of any Series
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereto
and the interest of the noteholders of any Series thereunder.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                    SUBORDINATED NOTE; CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION

                 Section 9.01.  Subordinated Note.

                          (a)     Issuance and Principal Amount.  On the
Issuance Date, the Issuer shall issue a subordinated note (the "Subordinated
Note") to the Seller in substantially the form of Exhibit C to this Agreement.
The principal amount of the Subordinated Note shall be calculated pursuant to
the Daily Report.  In no event shall the principal amount of the Subordinated
Note calculated pursuant to the Daily Report at any date of determination
exceed the excess of (a) the amount of Eligible Receivables at such time less
(b) the Net Note Principal Amount at such date.  If the principal amount of the
Subordinated Note decreases as a result of the preceding sentence, no cash
shall be paid to the Seller as a result of such decrease.  Other than with
respect to any payments by the Seller to the Issuer expressly required herein,
the Issuer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to offset or adjust
the Subordinated Note by any amounts owed by the Seller to the Issuer under
this Agreement.

                          (b)     Payments of Interest and Principal;
Subordination.  Interest on the principal amount of the Subordinated Note shall
accrue at the rate of 8.15% per annum, computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed and a 360-day year from and including the initial
Purchase Date to but excluding the date, after reduction of the outstanding
principal amount of the Notes and the notes of each other outstanding Series to
zero, immediately preceding the date on which the remaining outstanding
principal amount of the Subordinated Note is paid in full.  Subject to the
subordination provisions set forth in





                                       42
<PAGE>   48





subsection (c) below (the "Subordination Provisions"), the Issuer may pay
accrued interest on the Subordinated Note on any Business Day and on the Final
Maturity Date.  Subject to the Subordination Provisions, the Issuer shall also
pay accrued interest on the principal amount of each prepayment of the
Subordinated Note on the date of each such prepayment.  Subject to the
Subordination Provisions, any unpaid principal of the Subordinated Note shall
be paid on the Final Maturity Date.  Subject to the Subordination Provisions,
the principal amount of the Subordinated Note may be prepaid on any Business
Day without premium or penalty.

                          (c)     Upon any distribution of all or any of the
assets of the Issuer to creditors of the Issuer upon the dissolution, winding
up, total or partial liquidation, arrangement, reorganization, adjustment,
protection, relief, or composition of the Issuer or its debts, any payment or
distribution of any kind (including without limitation cash, property,
securities and any payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable
by reason of the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Issuer being
subordinated to the payment of the Subordinated Note) in respect of the
Subordinated Note that otherwise would be payable or deliverable upon or with
respect to the Subordinated Note, directly or indirectly, by set-off or in any
other manner (including without limitation from or by way of Collateral) shall
be paid or delivered directly to the Indenture Trustee for application (in the
case of cash) to, or as Collateral (in the case of non-cash property or
securities) for the payment or prepayment in full of, the Notes until all
principal of (as such principal amount may have been reduced by the allocation
thereto of noteholder charge-offs in accordance with the applicable Indenture)
and interest on the Notes and the notes of each other outstanding Series shall
have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  The Indenture Trustee is
irrevocably authorized and empowered (in its own name or in the name of the
Seller or otherwise), but shall have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect
and receive every payment or distribution referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence to give acquittance therefor, to file claims and proofs of
claim with respect thereto and to take such other action (including without
limitation voting the Subordinated Note and enforcing any security interest or
other lien securing payment of the Subordinated Note) as the Indenture Trustee
may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise or enforcement of any of the
rights or interest of the noteholders of any Series pursuant to and in
accordance with the Transaction Documents.  The Seller shall duly and





                                       43
<PAGE>   49





promptly take such action as the Indenture Trustee, acting at the written
direction of the Majority Noteholders, may request, consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, to (1) collect the
Subordinated Note for the account of the noteholders of any Series and to file
appropriate claims or proofs of claim in respect of the Subordinated Note, (2)
execute and deliver to the Indenture Trustee such powers of attorney,
assignments or other instruments as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably
request in order to enable the Indenture Trustee to enforce any and all claims
with respect to, and any security interests and other liens securing payment
of, the Subordinated Note and (3) collect and receive any and all payments or
distributions which may be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the
Subordinated Note.  All payments or distributions upon or with respect to the
Subordinated Note that are received by the Seller contrary to the provisions of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be received in trust
for the benefit of the noteholders of all Series, shall be segregated from
other funds and property held by the Seller and shall be forthwith paid over to
the Indenture Trustee in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement), to be applied (in the case of cash) to, or held as collateral (in
the case of non-cash property or securities) for the payment or prepayment in
full of, the Notes until the Notes shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in
cash.  The Seller agrees that no payment or distribution to the noteholders of
any Series with respect to the Subordinated Note pursuant to the provisions of
the Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall entitle the Seller to
exercise any rights or subrogation in respect thereof against the Issuer until
all principal of (as such principal amount may have been reduced by the
allocation of noteholder charge-offs in accordance with the applicable
Indenture) and interest on the Notes and the notes of each other outstanding
Series shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Each of the Seller
and the Issuer hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and
any other notice with respect to the Subordinated Note and any requirement that
the Indenture Trustee protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest
or lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action
against the Issuer or any other Person with respect thereto.

                          (d)     Unsecured Obligations.  The Subordinated Note
represents solely an obligation of the Issuer to make certain payments to the
extent, in the manner and at the





                                       44

times set forth in this Agreement, and does not represent a security interest
in the Purchased Receivables or the proceeds thereof.

                 Section 9.02.  Restrictions on Transfer of Subordinated Note.
Without the prior written consent of the Majority Noteholders, the Subordinated
Note or any right of the Seller to receive payments thereunder may not be
assigned, transferred, exchanged, pledged, hypothecated, participated or
otherwise conveyed, except (1) to the Working Capital Lenders or (2) to an
Affiliate of the Seller other than the Issuer.  Upon such transfer, the
Indenture Trustee will receive written notice of the new holder of the
Subordinated Note and shall provide notice of such transfer to each Rating
Agency.

                 Section 9.03.  Initial Capital Contribution.  On the initial
Purchase Date, the Seller shall contribute as capital to the Issuer, cash in an
amount equal to $[40,000,000].  The Issuer shall use such capital contribution
to pay the Seller and DFC, as applicable, for the Purchased Receivables
purchased on the initial Purchase Date.

                  2.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

       2.1. COMMITMENT TO LEND. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Credit Agreement, each of the Lenders severally agrees to lend to the
Borrowers, or either of them, and the Borrowers, or either of them, may borrow,
repay, and reborrow from time to time between the Closing Date and the Maturity
Date upon notice by the Borrowers, or either of them, to the Agent given in
accordance with Section 2.6, such sums as are requested by the Borrowers, or
either of them, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding (after giving
effect to all amounts requested) at any one time equal to such Lender's
Commitment minus such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the sum of the Maximum
Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, provided that the sum
of the outstanding amount of the Loans (after giving effect to all amounts
requested) plus the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment
and (ii) the Borrowing Base. The Loans shall be made pro rata in accordance with
each Lender's Commitment Percentage. Each request for a Loan hereunder shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrowers that the conditions
set forth in Section 11 and Section 12, in the case of the initial Loans to be
made on the Closing Date, and Section 12, in the case of all other Loans, have
been satisfied on the date of such request.

       2.2. COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to
the Agent for the accounts of the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages a commitment fee calculated at the Commitment Fee Rate
per annum on the average daily amount during each calendar quarter or portion
thereof from the Closing Date to the Maturity Date by which the Total Commitment
<PAGE>   30
                                      -24-


exceeds the sum of the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement
Obligations plus the outstanding amount of Loans during such calendar quarter.
The commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of
each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding calendar quarter commencing
on the first such date following the date hereof, and on the date of any
reduction in the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.3, and with a final payment
on the Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Commitments shall
terminate.

       2.3. REDUCTION OF TOTAL COMMITMENT. The Borrowers shall have the right at
any time and from time to time upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice
to the Agent to reduce by $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof or terminate entirely the Total Commitment whereupon the
Commitments of the Lenders shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with their
respective Commitment Percentages of the amount specified in such notice or, as
the case may be, terminated. Promptly after receiving any notice of the
Borrowers delivered pursuant to this Section 2.3, the Agent will notify the
Lenders of the substance thereof. Upon the effective date of any such reduction
or termination, the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the respective accounts
of the Lenders the full amount of any commitment fee then accrued on the amount
of the reduction. No reduction or termination of the Commitments may be
reinstated, provided, that the foregoing shall not restrict the ability of the
Borrowers to obtain any Additional Commitment Amount from a New Lender or, as
the case may be, an Increasing Lender in accordance with the provisions of
Section 19.10 hereof.

       2.4. THE NOTES. The Loans shall be evidenced by separate promissory notes
of the Borrowers in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (each a "Note"),
dated as of the Closing Date and completed with appropriate insertions. A Note
shall be payable to the order of each Lender in a principal amount equal to such
Lender's Commitment or, if less, the outstanding amount of all Loans made by
such Lender, plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth below. Each of the
Borrowers irrevocably authorizes each Lender to make or cause to be made, at or
about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Loan or at the time of receipt of any
payment of principal on such Lender's Note, an appropriate notation on such
Lender's Record reflecting the making of such Loan or (as the case may be) the
receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Loans set forth on such
Lender's Record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof
owing and unpaid to such Lender, but the failure to record, or any error in so
recording, any such amount on such Lender's Record shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or under any Note to make
payments of principal of or interest on any Note when due.

       2.5. INTEREST ON LOANS. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.11,

              (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period
       commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of
       the Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the
       Base Rate Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate.

              (b) Each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest for the period
       commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of
       the Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the
       Eurodollar Applicable Margin plus the Eurodollar Rate determined for such
       Interest Period.

              (c) The Borrowers jointly and severally promise to pay interest on
       each Loan in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

       2.6.  REQUESTS FOR LOANS.

              (a) The Borrowers, or either of them, shall give to the Agent
       written notice in the form of Exhibit C hereto (or telephonic notice
       confirmed in a writing in the form of Exhibit C hereto) of each Loan
       requested hereunder (a "Loan Request") no later than (i) 11:30 a.m.
       (Boston time) on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Base Rate Loan and
       (ii) 10:00 a.m. (Boston time) at least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days
       prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Eurodollar Rate Loan. Each
       such notice shall specify (A) the principal amount of the Loan requested,
       (B) the proposed Drawdown Date of such Loan, (C) the Interest Period for
       such Loan and (D) the Type of such Loan. Promptly upon receipt of any
       such notice, the Agent shall notify each of the Lenders thereof. Each
       Loan Request shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers and shall
       obligate the Borrower requesting the Loan to accept the Loan requested
       from the Lenders on the proposed Drawdown Date. Each Loan Request for a
       Base Rate Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000, and
       each Loan Request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be in a minimum
       aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in
       excess thereof.

              (b) Notwithstanding the notice and minimum amount requirements set
       forth in Section 2.6(a) but otherwise in accordance with the terms and
       conditions of this Credit Agreement, the Agent may, in its sole
       discretion and without conferring with the Lenders, make Loans hereunder
       (i) by entry of credits to Zale Delaware's operating account (No.
       551-49011) or other account(s) with the Agent (the "Operating Accounts")
       to cover checks or other charges which Zale Delaware has drawn or made
       against such account or (ii) in an amount as otherwise requested by the
       Borrowers. Each of the Borrowers hereby requests and authorizes the Agent
       to make from time to time such Loans by means of 
<PAGE>   32
                                      -26-


       appropriate entries of such credits sufficient to cover checks and other
       charges then presented. Each of the Borrowers acknowledges and agrees
       that the making of such Loans shall, in each case, be subject in all
       respects to the provisions of this Credit Agreement as if they were Loans
       covered by a Loan Request including, without limitation, the limitations
       set forth in Section 2.1 and the requirements that the applicable
       provisions of Sections 11 and 12, in the case of Loans made on the
       Closing Date, and Section 12, in the case of all Loans, be satisfied. All
       actions taken by the Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section
       2.6(b) shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers absent the
       Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Loans made pursuant to
       this Section 2.6(b) shall be Base Rate Loans until converted in
       accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and, prior to a
       Settlement, such interest shall be for the account of the Agent.

       2.7.  CONVERSION OPTIONS.

              2.7.1. CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF LOAN. The Borrowers may
       elect from time to time to convert any outstanding Loan to a Loan of
       another Type, provided that (i) with respect to any such conversion of a
       Loan to a Base Rate Loan, the Borrowers shall give the Agent, no later
       than 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the proposed date of such conversion,
       prior written notice of such election; (ii) with respect to any such
       conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrowers
       shall give the Agent, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Boston time) at least
       three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior to the proposed date of such
       conversion, written notice of such election; (iii) with respect to any
       such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan into a Loan of another Type,
       such conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period
       with respect thereto and (iv) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar
       Rate Loan when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
       continuing. On the date on which such conversion is being made each
       Lender shall take such action as is necessary to transfer its Commitment
       Percentage of such Loans to its Domestic Lending Office or its Eurodollar
       Lending Office, as the case may be. All or any part of outstanding Loans
       of any Type may be converted into a Loan of another Type as provided
       herein, provided that any partial conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan to
       a Base Rate Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least
       $100,000, and any partial conversion of a Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar
       Rate Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount of at least
       $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each
       Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Loan to a Eurodollar
       Rate Loan shall be irrevocable by the Borrowers.

              2.7.2. CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF LOAN. Any Loan of any Type may be
       continued as a Loan of the same Type upon the expiration of an Interest
<PAGE>   33
                                      -27-


       Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrowers with the
       notice provisions contained in Section 2.7.1; provided that no Eurodollar
       Rate Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default
       has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically converted to a
       Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating
       thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default
       of which officers of the Agent active upon the Borrowers' account have
       actual knowledge. In the event that the Borrowers fail to provide any
       such notice with respect to the continuation of any Eurodollar Rate Loan
       as such, then such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be automatically converted
       to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating
       thereto. The Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly when any such
       automatic conversion contemplated by this Section 2.7 is scheduled to
       occur.

              2.7.3. EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS. Any conversion to or from Eurodollar
       Rate Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such
       elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal
       amount of all Eurodollar Rate Loans having the same Interest Period shall
       not be less than $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess
       thereof. The Borrower may not have more than five (5) Eurodollar Rate
       Loans outstanding at any time.

       2.8.  FUNDS FOR LOANS.

              2.8.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES. Not later than 1:30 p.m. (Boston time)
       on the proposed Drawdown Date of any Loan, each of the Lenders will make
       available to the Agent, at the Agent's Head Office, in immediately
       available funds, the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the
       amount of the requested Loans. Upon receipt from each Lender of such
       amount, and upon receipt of the documents required by Sections 11
       and 12 and the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth therein, to
       the extent applicable, the Agent will make available to the Borrowers the
       aggregate amount of such Loans made available to the Agent by the
       Lenders. The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the
       Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any Drawdown Date the amount of
       its Commitment Percentage of the requested Loans shall not relieve any
       other Lender from its several obligation hereunder to make available to
       the Agent the amount of such other Lender's Commitment Percentage of any
       requested Loans.

              2.8.2. ADVANCES BY AGENT. The Agent may, unless notified to the
       contrary by any Lender on or prior to a Drawdown Date, assume that such
       Lender has made available to the Agent on such Drawdown Date the amount
       of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the Loans to be made on such
       Drawdown Date, and the Agent may (but it shall not be required to), in
<PAGE>   34
                                      -28-


       reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a
       corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the Agent such
       amount on a date after such Drawdown Date, such Lender shall pay to the
       Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the average
       computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the
       weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent for federal funds
       acquired by the Agent during each day included in such period, times (ii)
       the amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Loans, times
       (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that
       elapse from and including such Drawdown Date to the date on which the
       amount of such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Loans shall become
       immediately available to the Agent, and the denominator of which is 360.
       A statement of the Agent submitted to such Lender with respect to any
       amounts owing under this paragraph shall be prima facie evidence of the
       amount due and owing to the Agent by such Lender. If the amount of such
       Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Loans is not made available to the
       Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such
       Drawdown Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from
       the Borrowers on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum
       applicable to the Loans made on such Drawdown Date.

       2.9.  SETTLEMENTS; FAILURE TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE.

              (a) On each Settlement Date, the Agent shall, not later than 10:00
       a.m. (Boston time), give telephonic or facsimile notice (i) to the
       Lenders and the Borrowers of the respective outstanding amount of Loans
       made by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders from the immediately preceding
       Settlement Date through the close of business on the prior day and the
       amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made (following the giving of
       notice pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(ii)) on such date pursuant to a Loan
       Request and (ii) to the Lenders of the amount (a "Settlement Amount")
       that each Lender (the "Settling Lender") shall pay to effect a Settlement
       of any Loan. A statement of the Agent submitted to the Lenders and the
       Borrowers with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.9 shall
       be prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing. The Settling Lender
       shall, not later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on such Settlement Date,
       effect a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Agent in the
       amount of the Settlement Amount. All funds advanced by any Lender as a
       Settling Lender pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall for all purposes be
       treated as a Loan made by such Settling Lender to the Borrowers and all
       funds received by any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall for all
       purposes be treated as repayment of amounts owed with respect to Loans
       made by such Lender. In the event that any bankruptcy, reorganization,
       liquidation, receivership or similar cases or proceedings in which either
       of the Borrowers is a debtor prevent a Settling Lender from making any
       Loan to effect a Settlement as contemplated hereby, such Settling Lender
       will make such disposition and 
<PAGE>   35
                                      -29-


       arrangements with the other Lenders with respect to such Loans, either by
       way of purchase of participations, distribution, pro tanto assignment of
       claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender's share
       of the outstanding Loans being equal, as nearly as may be, to such
       Lender's Commitment Percentage of the outstanding amount of the Loans.

              (b) The Agent may, unless notified to the contrary by any Lender
       prior to a Settlement Date, assume that such Lender has made or will make
       available to the Agent on such Settlement Date the amount of such
       Lender's Settlement Amount, and the Agent may (but it shall not be
       required to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
       Borrowers a corresponding amount. If any Lender makes available to the
       Agent such amount on a date after such Settlement Date, such Lender shall
       pay to the Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the
       average computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the
       weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent for federal funds
       acquired by such Agent during each day included in such period, times
       (ii) the amount of such Settlement Amount, times (iii) a fraction, the
       numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including
       such Settlement Date to the date on which the amount of such Settlement
       Amount shall become immediately available to such Agent, and the
       denominator of which is 360. A statement of the Agent submitted to such
       Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
       prima facie evidence of the amount due and owing to the Agent by such
       Lender. If such Lender's Settlement Amount is not made available to the
       Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days following such
       Settlement Date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount from
       the Borrowers on demand, with interest thereon at the rate per annum
       applicable to the Loans as of such Settlement Date.

              (c) The failure or refusal of any Lender to make available to the
       Agent at the aforesaid time and place on any Settlement Date the amount
       of its Settlement Amount (i) shall not relieve any other Lender from its
       several obligations hereunder to make available to the Agent the amount
       of such other Lender's Settlement Amount and (ii) shall not impose upon
       such other Lender any liability with respect to such failure or refusal
       or otherwise increase the Commitment of such other Lender.

       2.10. CHANGE IN BORROWING BASE. The Borrowing Base shall be determined
monthly by the Agent by reference to the Borrowing Base Report delivered to the
Lenders and the Agent pursuant to Section 8.4(f).

                      3.  REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS.

       3.1. MATURITY. The Borrowers jointly and severally promise to pay on the
Maturity 
<PAGE>   36
                                      -30-


Date, and there shall become absolutely due and payable on the Maturity Date,
all of the Loans outstanding on such date, together with any and all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

       3.2. MANDATORY REPAYMENTS OF LOANS. If at any time the sum of the
outstanding amount of the Loans, the Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid
Reimbursement Obligations exceeds the lesser of (i) the Total Commitment and
(ii) the Borrowing Base, then the Borrowers shall immediately pay the amount of
such excess to the Agent for the respective accounts of the Lenders for
application: first, to any Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations; second, to the
Loans; and third, to provide to the Agent cash collateral for Reimbursement
Obligations as contemplated by Section 4.2(b) and (c). Each payment of any
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations or prepayment of Loans shall be allocated among
the Lenders, in proportion to each Reimbursement Obligation or (as the case may
be) the respective unpaid principal amount of each Lender's Note, with
adjustments to the extent practicable to equalize any prior payments or
repayments not exactly in proportion.

       3.3. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF LOANS. The Borrowers shall have the right, at
their election, to repay the outstanding amount of the Loans, as a whole or in
part, at any time and from time to time without penalty or premium, provided
that any full or partial prepayment of the outstanding amount of any Eurodollar
Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 3.3 may be made only on the last day of the
Interest Period relating thereto. The Borrowers shall give the Agent written
notice of any proposed prepayment no later than (i) 2:00 p.m., Boston time, on
the date of any proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.3 of Base Rate
Loans, and (ii) 10:00 a.m., Boston time, at least three (3) Eurodollar Business
Days prior to any proposed prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.3 of Eurodollar
Rate Loans, in each case specifying the proposed date of prepayment of Loans and
the principal amount to be prepaid. Each such partial prepayment of Base Rate
Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000, and each such partial prepayment
of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof and shall be accompanied by the
payment of accrued interest on the principal prepaid to the date of prepayment.
In the absence of instruction by the Borrowers, each such partial prepayment of
the Loans shall be applied first to the principal of Base Rate Loans and then to
the principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Each partial prepayment shall be
allocated among the Lenders, in proportion to the respective unpaid principal
amount of each Lender's Note, with adjustments to the extent practicable to
equalize any prior repayments not exactly in proportion. Notwithstanding the
notice and minimum requirements set forth in this Section 3.3, the Agent may, in
its sole discretion, allow the Borrowers to repay Base Rate Loans made by the
Agent in amounts as otherwise requested by the Borrowers.

                         4.  LETTERS OF CREDIT.
<PAGE>   37
                                      -31-


       4.1. LETTER OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS.

              4.1.1. COMMITMENT TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the terms
       and conditions hereof and the execution and delivery by the Borrowers, or
       either of them, of a letter of credit application on the Agent's
       customary form (a "Letter of Credit Application"), the Agent on behalf of
       the Lenders and in reliance upon the agreement of the Lenders set forth
       in Section 4.1.4 and upon the representations and warranties of the
       Borrowers contained herein, agrees, in its individual capacity, to issue,
       extend and renew from time to time from the date hereof until but not
       including the then scheduled Maturity Date, for the account of the
       Borrowers, one or more standby or documentary letters of credit
       (individually, a "Letter of Credit"), in such form as may be requested
       from time to time by the Borrowers and agreed to by the Agent; provided,
       however, that, after giving effect to such request, (a) the sum of the
       aggregate Maximum Drawing Amount and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations
       shall not exceed $30,000,000 at any one time and (b) the sum of (i) the
       Maximum Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, (ii) all Unpaid
       Reimbursement Obligations, and (iii) the amount of all Loans outstanding
       shall not exceed the lesser of (A) the Total Commitment and (B) the
       Borrowing Base. The letters of credit, if any, issued by the Agent for
       the account of the Borrowers pursuant to the Prior Agreement and listed
       on Schedule 4.1.1 hereto, shall, from and after the Closing Date,
       constitute a Letter of Credit for all purposes of this Credit Agreement.
       No Letter of Credit shall be issued, extended or renewed with an
       expiration date occurring after the date which is 180 days following the
       then scheduled Maturity Date or which provides for drafts which may be
       paid after the date which is 180 days following the then scheduled
       Maturity Date.

              4.1.2. LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATIONS. Each Letter of Credit
       Application shall be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the
       Agent. In the event that any provision of any Letter of Credit
       Application shall be inconsistent with any provision of this Credit
       Agreement, then the provisions of this Credit Agreement shall, to the
       extent of any such inconsistency, govern.

              4.1.3. TERMS OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Letter of Credit issued,
       extended or renewed hereunder shall, among other things, be denominated
       in Dollars and shall provide for the payment of sight drafts for honor
       thereunder when presented in accordance with the terms thereof and when
       accompanied by the documents described therein. Each Letter of Credit so
       issued, extended or renewed shall be subject to the Uniform Customs.

              4.1.4. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS OF LENDERS. Each Lender severally
       agrees that it shall be absolutely liable, without regard to the
<PAGE>   38
                                      -32-


       occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any other condition
       precedent whatsoever, to the extent of such Lender's Commitment
       Percentage, to reimburse the Agent on demand for the amount of each draft
       paid by the Agent under each Letter of Credit to the extent that such
       amount is not reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 4.2 (such
       agreement for a Lender being called herein the "Letter of Credit
       Participation" of such Lender).

              4.1.5. PARTICIPATIONS OF LENDERS. Each such payment made by a
       Lender shall be treated as the purchase by such Lender of a participating
       interest in the Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligation under Section 4.2 in
       an amount equal to such payment. Each Lender shall share in accordance
       with its participating interest in any interest which accrues pursuant to
       Section 4.2.

       4.2. REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWERS. In order to induce the
Agent to issue, extend and renew each Letter of Credit and the Lenders to
participate therein, each of the Borrowers hereby jointly and severally agrees
to reimburse or pay to the Agent, for the account of the Agent or (as the case
may be) the Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued, extended or
renewed by the Agent hereunder,

              (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4.2(b) and
       (c), no later than the Business Day following each date that any draft
       presented under such Letter of Credit is honored by the Agent (or, if
       later, one day after the Agent has notified the Borrowers of its
       intention to honor such draft), or the Agent otherwise makes a payment
       with respect thereto, (i) the amount paid by the Agent under or with
       respect to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) the amount of any taxes, fees,
       charges or other reasonable costs and expenses whatsoever incurred by the
       Agent or any Lender in connection with any payment made by the Agent or
       any Lender under, or with respect to, such Letter of Credit,

              (b) upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total
       Commitment to an amount less than the Maximum Drawing Amount, an amount
       equal to such difference, which amount shall be held by the Agent for the
       benefit of the Lenders and the Agent as cash collateral for all
       Reimbursement Obligations, and

              (c) upon the termination of the Total Commitment, or the
       acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with respect to all Letters
       of Credit in accordance with Section 13, an amount equal to the then
       Maximum Drawing Amount on all Letters of Credit, which amount shall be
       held by the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders and the Agent as cash
       collateral for all Reimbursement Obligations.

Each such payment shall be made to the Agent at the Agent's Head Office in
immediately available funds. Interest on any and all amounts remaining unpaid by
<PAGE>   39
                                      -33-


the Borrowers under this Section 4.2 at any time from the date such amounts
become due and payable (whether as stated in this Section 4.2, by acceleration
or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or after judgment) shall be
payable to the Agent on demand at the rate specified in Section 5.11 for overdue
principal on the Loans.

       4.3. LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented or other
demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit, the Agent shall
notify the Borrowers of the date and amount of the draft presented or demand for
payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or honor such
demand for payment. If the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Agent as provided in
Section 4.2 on or before the Business Day following the date that such draft is
paid or other payment is made by the Agent, the Agent may at any time thereafter
notify the Lenders of the amount of any such Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation. No
later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston time) on the Business Day next following the
receipt of such notice, each Lender shall make available to the Agent, at the
Agent's Head Office, in immediately available funds, such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, together with an amount
equal to the product of (i) the average, computed for the period referred to in
clause (iii) below, of the weighted average interest rate paid by the Agent for
federal funds acquired by the Agent during each day included in such period,
times (ii) the amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such
Unpaid Reimbursement Obligation, times (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days that elapse from and including the date the Agent paid the
draft presented for honor or otherwise made payment to the date on which such
Lender's Commitment Percentage of such Unpaid Reimbursement obligation shall
become immediately available to the Agent, and the denominator of which is 360.
The responsibility of the Agent to the Borrowers and the Lenders shall be only
to determine that the documents (including each draft) delivered under each
Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in conformity in
all material respects with such Letter of Credit.

       4.4. OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrowers' obligations under this Section
4 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
irrespective of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any
condition precedent whatsoever or any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which the Borrowers may have or have had against the Agent, any Lender or any
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit. Each of the Borrowers further agrees with the
Agent and the Lenders that the Agent and the Lenders shall not be responsible
for, and the Borrowers' Reimbursement Obligations under Section 4.2 shall not be
affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of
any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or
among the Borrowers, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing
institution or other party to which any Letter of Credit may be transferred or
any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrowers against the beneficiary of
any Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Agent and the 
<PAGE>   40
                                      -34-


Lenders shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit. Each of the Borrowers
agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Agent or any Lender under or in
connection with each Letter of Credit and the related drafts and documents, if
done in good faith and without gross negligence, shall be binding upon the
Borrowers and shall not result in any liability on the part of the Agent or any
Lender to the Borrowers.

       4.5. RELIANCE BY ISSUER. To the extent not inconsistent with Section 4.4,
the Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying
upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document believed by it in good faith to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders
as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the
Majority Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders and all future holders of the
Notes or of a Letter of Credit Participation.

       4.6. LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent (in each
case, a "Letter of Credit Fee") (a) for the accounts of the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages, a commission on the
average daily aggregate Maximum Drawing Amount of all Letters of Credit then
outstanding at the Letter of Credit Fee Rate per annum payable quarterly in
arrears on the first Business Day of each quarter in which any Letters of Credit
shall have been or remain outstanding, and on the Maturity Date (including
Letter of Credit Fees relating to Letters of Credit expiring after the Maturity
Date), and (b) for the Agent's own account, such customary commissions, issuance
fees, transfer fees and other fees and charges in connection with the issuance
or administration of each Letter of Credit as the Borrowers and the Agent shall
agree.

       4.7. CASH COLLATERAL FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT. Thirty days prior to the then
scheduled Maturity Date, the Borrowers shall, with respect to each Letter of
Credit then outstanding and pursuant to a cash collateral agreement (the "Cash
Collateral Agreement") in substantially the form of Exhibit D, (a) pay to the
Agent in cash for deposit into an interest bearing cash collateral account
established with the Agent (the "Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account") an
amount equal to one hundred and 
<PAGE>   41
                                      -35-


two percent (102%) of the Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit as of
such date, which amount shall be held by the Agent as cash collateral for any
Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations incurred with respect to such
Letter of Credit, or (b) deliver to the Agent a "back-to-back" letter of credit,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, issued by a
financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and naming the Agent
as beneficiary in an amount equal to one hundred and two percent (102%) of the
Maximum Drawing Amount of such Letter of Credit as of such date. Any cash sums
deposited into the Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account pursuant to clause
(a) and naming the Agent as beneficiary of this Section 4.7 shall be reduced or
released, and any back-to-back letter of credit issued pursuant to clause (b)
and naming the Agent as beneficiary of this Section 4.7 shall be reduced in
amount or returned, if and to the extent that the Maximum Drawing Amount with
respect to the applicable Letter of Credit has been reduced or such Letter of
Credit has expired or been cancelled and all Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations
and other amounts due or to become due with respect thereto have been paid.

                  5.  CERTAIN GENERAL PROVISIONS.

       5.1. FEE LETTERS. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay (a)
all fees in accordance with the terms of the fee letter dated as of August 11,
1995 (the "FNBB Fee Letter"), among the Borrowers and FNBB, and (b) all fees in
accordance with the terms of each of the other fee letters entered into
separately by each of the other Lenders and the Borrowers on or about the
Closing Date (such other fee letters, together with the FNBB Fee Letter, the
"Fee Letters").

       5.2. AGENT'S FEE. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent annually in
advance, for the Agent's own account, on the Closing Date and on each
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Agent's fee in accordance with the terms of
the FNBB Fee Letter.

       5.3. FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

              5.3.1. PAYMENTS TO AGENT. All payments of principal, interest,
       Reimbursement Obligations, commitment fees, Letter of Credit Fees and any
       other amounts due hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
       shall be made to the Agent, for the respective accounts of the Lenders
       and the Agent, at the Agent's Head Office or at such other location in
       the Boston, Massachusetts, area that the Agent may from time to time
       designate, in each case in immediately available funds in Dollars.

              5.3.2. NO OFFSET, ETC. All payments by the Borrowers hereunder and
       under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or
       counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes,
       levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings,
       compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or
       hereafter imposed or levied by 
<PAGE>   42
                                      -36-


       any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other
       authority therein unless the Borrowers are compelled by law to make such
       deduction or withholding, excluding, (i) in the case of each Lender and
       the Agent, taxes imposed on its gross or net income, and franchise taxes
       imposed on it by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or
       the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or by any political
       subdivision thereof or, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its
       gross or net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it by the
       jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office, or any political
       subdivision thereof and (ii) in the case of each Lender, United States
       income tax or withholding (a "withholding tax") payable with respect to
       payments hereunder or under the other Loan Documents under laws
       (including, without limitation, any statute, treaty, ruling, court
       decision, determination or regulation) in effect and being applied on the
       Reference Date (as hereinafter defined); provided, however, that any
       United States withholding tax payable as a result of any change in such
       laws occurring after the Reference Date shall not be so excluded; and
       provided further that if any payment by the Borrowers to the Agent or the
       Lenders is charged with any United States withholding tax not in effect
       on the Reference Date or if such withholding tax is increased subsequent
       to the Reference Date, such withholding tax or increased withholding tax
       shall not be deemed to result from a change in law within the meaning of
       the preceding proviso if such payment is effectively connected with a
       United States trade or business of the recipient subject to United States
       income taxes thereon (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
       duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings and liabilities being
       hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). For purposes of this Section 5.3.2,
       the term "Reference Date" shall mean, in the case of each Lender on the
       Closing Date, the Closing Date and, in the case of each party who
       subsequently becomes a Lender, the effective date of the Assignment and
       Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender and, in the case of any
       Lender that at any time changes its Applicable Lending Office for Base
       Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans to a different nation from the nation
       in which the Applicable Lending Office from which such Loans were made
       prior to such time is located, the date of such change. If any Taxes
       shall be required by law to be deducted from any amount payable hereunder
       or under any other Loan Document, the Borrowers will pay to the Agent for
       the account of the Lenders, on the date on which such amount is due and
       payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such additional
       amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable such Lenders or the
       Agent to receive the same net amount which such Lenders or the Agent
       would have received on such due date had no such deduction been imposed
       upon the Borrowers; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be
       required to pay any amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence to the
       Agent with respect to any Lender organized under the laws of a
       jurisdiction outside of the United States, if such deductions are caused
       by the failure of such Lender to execute and deliver to 
<PAGE>   43
                                      -37-


       the Borrowers any certificates, forms or other documents reasonably
       requested by the Borrowers, which can be furnished consistent with the
       facts and which are reasonably necessary to assist the Borrowers in
       applying for refunds of taxes remitted hereunder or determining amounts
       payable by the Borrowers under this Section 5.3.2. If the Borrowers have
       paid any increased amounts to any Lender pursuant to this Section 5.3.2,
       each Lender agrees that to the extent such Lender receives a refund
       attributed to the taxes remitted by the Borrowers hereunder, such Lender
       shall forward such refund to the Borrowers within thirty (30) days after
       receipt by the Lender. The Borrowers will deliver promptly to the Agent
       certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges
       deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Borrowers
       hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

              5.3.3. FOREIGN LENDERS. (a) Each Lender that is a party to this
       Credit Agreement on the date hereof and that is not incorporated under
       the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof agrees that
       it will deliver to each of the Borrowers and the Agent, within seven (7)
       Business Days after the Closing Date or, in the case of each Lender which
       becomes a Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, on the date
       which such Assignment and Acceptance becomes effective, and only if it
       can do so consistent with the facts, two duly completed copies of United
       States Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224 (or other applicable
       form prescribed by the United States Internal Revenue Service), in each
       case certifying whether such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
       this Credit Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
       any United States federal income taxes or at reduced withholding rates,
       as applicable. Each such Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 (or
       other applicable form prescribed by the United States Internal Revenue
       Service), and any lender that hereafter becomes a party to this Credit
       Agreement, further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrowers and the
       Agent two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or
       before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or as soon as
       practicable after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
       most recent form so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or
       extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the
       Borrowers or the Agent, in each case certifying whether such Lender is
       entitled to receive payments under this Credit Agreement and the Notes
       without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
       taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in
       treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any
       such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
       inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
       delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the
       Borrowers and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
       without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
       Unless the Borrowers and 
<PAGE>   44
                                      -38-


       the Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them
       indicating that payments hereunder or under any of the other Loan
       Documents are not subject to United States withholding tax or are subject
       to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrowers
       or the Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable
       statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender organized
       under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States. If the
       Borrowers or the Agent have received such forms or other documents
       satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Agent, the Borrowers or the Agent
       shall withhold United States withholding taxes from such payments to such
       Lender only to the extent appropriate.

              (b) Each Lender which is not incorporated under the laws of the
       United States of America or a state thereof shall deliver to the
       Borrowers on the Closing Date and prior to the last day of each calendar
       year thereafter a duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9
       or other appropriate Internal Revenue Service form, effective for the
       succeeding calendar year.

              5.3.4. APPLICABLE LENDING OFFICE. Any Lender claiming any
       additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall, to the
       extent it can do so without incurring material additional costs, endeavor
       (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
       jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a
       change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such
       additional amounts which may thereafter accrue.

       5.4. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Loans and of
commitment fees, Letter of Credit Fees or other fees shall, unless otherwise
expressly provided herein, be based on a 365 day year and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed; provided, however, that computations of interest on
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be based on a 360 day year and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of the
term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, whenever a payment
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is
not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such extension. The
outstanding amount of the Loans as reflected on the records of the Agent from
time to time shall be considered prima facie evidence of the outstanding amount
of the Loans owing by the Borrowers to the Lenders.

       5.5. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event, prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period relating to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Agent shall determine that adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate that would otherwise determine the rate of
interest 
<PAGE>   45
                                      -39-


to be applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan during any Interest Period, the
Agent shall forthwith give notice of such determination (which shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Lenders) to the Borrowers and
the Lenders. In such event (i) any Loan Request or Conversion Request with
respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be automatically withdrawn and shall be
deemed a request for Base Rate Loans, (ii) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will
automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period relating
thereto, become a Base Rate Loan, and (iii) the obligations of the Lenders to
make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Agent determines that
the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon the
Agent shall so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders.

       5.6. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any
present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation
or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall forthwith give notice of such
circumstances to the Borrowers and the other Lenders and thereupon (i) the
commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert Loans of
another Type to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall forthwith be suspended and (ii) such
Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Rate Loans, if any, shall be
converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the last day of each Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier period as
may be required by law. Each of the Borrowers hereby agrees promptly to pay the
Agent for the account of such Lender, upon demand by such Lender, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs reasonably incurred by
such Lender in making any conversion in accordance with this Section 5.6,
including any interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder;
provided, however, that the Borrowers shall have no obligation to pay any
portion of such costs incurred by the Agent or (as the case may be) such Lender
more than sixty (60) days prior to any notice, given by the Agent or (as the
case may be) such Lender to the Borrowers, of the incurrence of such costs.

       5.7. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable law,
which expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations
thereunder and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any
governmental or other regulatory body or official charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to any Lender or the Agent by any central bank or other fiscal,
monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

              (a) subject any Lender or the Agent to any tax, levy, impost,
       duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to
       this Credit Agreement, any Letters of Credit, the other Loan Documents,
       such Lender's 
<PAGE>   46
                                      -40-


       Commitment or the Loans (other than taxes based upon or measured by the
       income or profits of such Lender or the Agent), or

              (b) materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in
       taxes on income or profits) of payments to any Lender of the principal of
       or the interest on any Loans or any other amounts payable to any Lender
       or the Agent under this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
       Documents, or

              (c) impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the
       extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Credit Agreement) any
       special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or
       other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law)
       against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans
       by, or letters of credit issued by, or commitments of an office of any
       Lender, or

              (d) impose on any Lender or the Agent any other conditions or
       requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, any Letters of
       Credit, the other Loan Documents, the Loans, such Lender's Commitment, or
       any class of loans, letters of credit or commitments of which any of the
       Loans or such Lender's Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of
       the foregoing is

                     (i)   to increase the cost to any Lender of making, 
              funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of the
              Loans or such Lender's Commitment or any Letter of Credit, or

                     (ii)  to reduce the amount of principal, interest,
              Reimbursement Obligation or other amounts payable to such Lender
              or the Agent hereunder on account of such Lender's Commitment, any
              Letter of Credit or any of the Loans, or

                     (iii) to require such Lender or the Agent to make any
              payment or to forego any interest or Reimbursement Obligation or
              other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or
              foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum is
              calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable
              or deemed received by such Lender or the Agent from the Borrowers
              hereunder,

then such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) shall so notify the Borrowers
(which notice shall include a brief statement of the basis for the determination
thereof), and, to the extent that the costs of such change are not reflected in
the Base Rate, or other amounts charged to the Borrowers hereunder, the
Borrowers and such Lender or the Agent shall thereafter attempt to negotiate an
adjustment to the compensation payable hereunder which will adequately
compensate such Lender or the Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment
or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum. If the Borrowers
and such Lender or the 
<PAGE>   47
                                      -41-


Agent (as the case may be) are unable to agree to such adjustment within
forty-five (45) days following the day on which the Borrowers receive such
notice (but not earlier than the effective date of any such change), then
commencing on the date of such notice, the amounts payable by the Borrowers
hereunder shall increase by an amount which will, in such Lender's or (as the
case may be) the Agent's reasonable determination, provide adequate compensation
for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or
Reimbursement Obligation or other sum. In making any determinations contemplated
by this Section 5.7, any Lender or the Agent may make such reasonable estimates,
assumptions, allocations and the like as such Lender or the Agent in good faith
determines to be appropriate, and such Lender's or the Agent's selection thereof
and the determination made by it on the basis thereof, shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the Borrowers except, in the case of such determination, for
manifest errors in computations or transmission.

       5.8. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If after the date hereof any Lender or the Agent
determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any
change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or governmental
authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii) compliance by such Lender or
the Agent or any corporation controlling such Lender or the Agent with any law,
governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such entity regarding capital adequacy, has the
effect of reducing the return on such Lender's or the Agent's commitment with
respect to any Loans to a level below that which such Lender or the Agent could
have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's or the Agent's then existing policies with respect
to capital adequacy and assuming full utilization of such entity's capital) by
any amount deemed by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent to be
material, then such Lender or the Agent may notify the Borrowers of such fact.
To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not
reflected in the Base Rate or in other amounts payable hereunder, the Borrowers
agree to pay such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent for the amount of
such reduction in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined
upon presentation by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent of a
certificate in accordance with Section 5.9 hereof (but not earlier than the
effective date of any reduction). Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall be
deemed to require the Borrowers to pay the amount of any reduction in the return
on capital to the extent that the Borrowers have compensated such Lender or the
Agent for such reduction by paying additional costs pursuant to Section 5.7;
provided, further, that the Borrowers shall have no obligation to pay any
portion of the amount of any reduction in the return on capital incurred by such
Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent more than sixty (60) days prior to any
notice, given by such Lender or (as the case may be) the Agent to the Borrowers,
of the incurrence of such reduction in the return on capital.
<PAGE>   48
                                      -42-


       5.9.  CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to Section Section 5.7 or 5.8 and a brief explanation of such
amounts which are due, submitted by any Lender or the Agent to the Borrowers,
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing.

       5.10. INDEMNITY. The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to indemnify
each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from and against any loss, cost or
expense (including loss of anticipated profits) that such Lender may sustain or
incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrowers in payment of the
principal amount of or any interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loans as and when due
and payable, including any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees
payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain
its Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) default by the Borrowers in making a borrowing
or conversion after the Borrowers have given (or are deemed to have given) a
Loan Request or a Conversion Request relating thereto in accordance with Section
2.6 or Section 2.7 or (iii) the making of any payment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan
or the making of any conversion of any such Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day
that is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto,
including interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained
by it in order to maintain any such Loans.

       5.11. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. During the continuance of an Event of
Default, overdue principal on the Loans, (to the extent permitted by applicable
law) interest on the Loans, other overdue amounts payable hereunder, and
principal of the Loans not overdue shall, until such Event of Default has been
cured or remedied or such Event of Default has been waived by the Majority
Lenders pursuant to Section 26, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two
percent (2%) above the Base Rate.

       5.12. INTEREST LIMITATION. Notwithstanding any other term of this Credit
Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Documents, the maximum amount of interest
which may be charged to or collected from any Person liable hereunder or under
any Note by the Lenders, shall be absolutely limited to, and shall in no event
exceed, the maximum amount of interest (the "Maximum Rate") which could lawfully
be charged or collected under applicable law (including, to the extent
applicable, the provisions of Section 5197 of the Revised Statutes of the United
States of America, as amended, 12 U.S.C. Section 85, as amended), so that the
maximum of all amounts constituting interest under applicable law, howsoever
computed, shall never exceed as to any Person liable therefor the Maximum Rate,
and any term of this Credit Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document which
could be construed as providing for interest in excess of such lawful maximum
shall be and hereby is made expressly subject to and modified by the provisions
of this paragraph. If, in any month, the effective interest rate on any amounts
owing pursuant to this Credit Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents, absent the Maximum Rate limitation contained herein, would have
exceeded the Maximum Rate, and if in any future month, such effective interest
rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, 
<PAGE>   49
                                      -43-


then the effective interest rate for such month shall be increased to the
Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid hereunder equals the
amount of interest which would have been paid if the same had not been limited
by the Maximum Rate. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction shall,
notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.12, determine that the Lenders
have received interest hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents in excess of
the Maximum Rate, such excess shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
be applied first to any interest not in excess of the Maximum Rate then due and
not yet paid, then to the outstanding principal of the Loans (without premium or
penalty), then to fees and any other unpaid Obligations and thereafter shall be
refunded to the Borrowers or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise
order. In the event that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, the total
amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Credit Agreement is
less than the total amount of interest which would have been paid or accrued had
the interest not been limited hereby to the Maximum Rate, then the Borrowers
shall, to the extent permitted by such applicable federal, state or other law,
pay to the Lenders hereunder or under the Notes an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have been
charged if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect with respect to
the Obligations hereunder or under the Notes and (ii) the amount of interest
which would have accrued had the applicable effective interest rate not been
limited hereunder by the Maximum Rate over (b) the amount of interest actually
paid or accrued under this Credit Agreement.

       5.13. PERFORMANCE ADJUSTMENTS. Based upon, and following receipt by the
Lenders of (a) beginning with the Borrowers' financial statements as hereafter
described for the fiscal quarter of the Borrowers ending closest to July 31,
1996, (i) with respect to the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year,
the Borrowers' quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to
Section 8.4(b) and (ii) with respect to the last fiscal quarter of each fiscal
year, the Borrowers' annual audited consolidated financial statements pursuant
to Section 8.4(a), and (b) a certificate of the Borrowers setting forth
calculations of the financial information set forth below, (the Borrowers also
hereby agreeing to provide to the Agent, simultaneously with the delivery of
such certificate, telephonic notice of any Performance Adjustments based upon
such calculations), the Base Rate Applicable Margin, the Eurodollar Applicable
Margin, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate and the Commitment Fee Rate shall be
subject to possible adjustment in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph (each such adjustment, a "Performance Adjustment"). Performance
Adjustments shall be effective (the date of the effectiveness of any Performance
Adjustment, a "Performance Adjustment Date") with respect to adjustments to the
Base Rate Applicable Margin, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Letter of
Credit Fee Rate and the Commitment Fee Rate, three (3) Business Days following
receipt by the Agent of (x) (i) with respect to the first three fiscal quarters
of each fiscal year, the Borrowers' 
<PAGE>   50
                                      -44-


quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements pursuant to Section 8.4(b)
and (ii) with respect to the last fiscal quarter of each fiscal year, the
Borrowers' annual audited consolidated financial statements pursuant to Section
8.4(a), and (y) a certificate of the Borrowers setting forth calculations of the
financial information set forth below (the Borrowers also hereby agreeing to
provide to the Agent, simultaneously with the delivery of such certificate,
telephonic notice of any Performance Adjustments based upon such calculations).
The Base Rate Applicable Margin, the Eurodollar Applicable Margin, the Letter of
Credit Fee Rate and the Commitment Fee Rate with respect to any period following
any Performance Adjustment Date until the next succeeding Performance Adjustment
Date shall be as set forth in the table below on the line furthest down in such
table with respect to which the Borrowers shall have equaled or exceeded, for
the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended, both the
minimum amount of Consolidated EBITDA and the minimum ratio of Consolidated
EBITDA to Consolidated Total Debt Service, set forth on such line in such table:

       5.14. CONCERNING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF THE BORROWERS.

              (a) Each of the Borrowers is accepting joint and several liability
       hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the
       financial accommodations to be provided by the Lenders and the Agent
       under this Credit Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and
       indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in consideration of the
       undertakings of the other Borrower to accept joint and several liability
       for the Obligations.

              (b) Each of the Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby
       irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also
       as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrower, with
       respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations
       (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under this
       Section 5.14), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the
       Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the
       Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.

              (c) If and to the extent that either of the Borrowers shall fail
       to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when
       due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms
       thereof, then in each such event the other Borrower will make such
       payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.
<PAGE>   51
                                      -45-


              (d) The Obligations of each of the Borrowers under the provisions
       of this Section 5.14 constitute the full recourse Obligations of each of
       the Borrowers enforceable against each such corporation to the full
       extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity,
       regularity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement or the other Loan
       Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever as to the other Borrower.

              (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Borrower
       hereby waives promptness, diligence, presentment, demand, protest, notice
       of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any and all
       advances of the Loans made under this Credit Agreement and the Notes,
       notice of occurrence of any Default or Event of Default (except to the
       extent notice is expressly required to be given pursuant to the terms of
       this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents), or of any
       demand for any payment under this Credit Agreement, and notice of any
       action at any time taken or omitted by the Agent or the Lenders under or
       in respect of any of the Obligations hereunder. Each Borrower hereby
       waives all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,
       stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any
       right to require the marshaling of assets of the Borrowers and any other
       entity or Person primarily or secondarily liable with respect to any of
       the Obligations, and all suretyship defenses generally. Each Borrower
       hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of
       the time for the payment, or place or manner for payment, compromise,
       refinancing, consolidation or renewals of any of the Obligations
       hereunder, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver,
       consent or other action or acquiescence by the Agent and the Lenders at
       any time or times in respect of any default by either Borrower in the
       performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision
       of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any and all other
       indulgences whatsoever by the Agent and the Lenders in respect of any of
       the Obligations hereunder, and the taking, addition, substitution or
       release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for
       any of such Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in
       whole or in part, of either Borrower or any other entity or Person
       primarily or secondarily liable for any Obligation. Such Borrower further
       agrees that its Obligations shall not be released or discharged, in whole
       or in part, or otherwise affected by the adequacy of any rights which the
       Agent or any Lender may have against any collateral security or other
       means of obtaining repayment of any of the Obligations, the impairment of
       any collateral security securing the Obligations, including, without
       limitation, the failure to protect or preserve any rights which the Agent
       or any Lender may have in such collateral security or the substitution,
       exchange, surrender, release, loss or destruction of any such collateral
       security, any other act or omission which might in any manner or to any
       extent vary the risk of such Borrower, or otherwise operate as a release
       or 
<PAGE>   52
                                      -46-


       discharge of such Borrower, all of which may be done without notice to
       such Borrower; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way be
       deemed to create commercially unreasonable standards as to the Agent's
       duties as secured party under the Loan Documents (as such rights and
       duties are set forth therein). If for any reason either of the Borrowers
       has no legal existence or is under no legal obligation to discharge any
       of the Obligations, or if any of the Obligations have become
       irrecoverable from either of the Borrowers by reason of such Borrower's
       insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization or by other operation of law or
       for any reason, this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
       which it is a party shall nevertheless be binding on the other Borrower
       to the same extent as if such Borrower at all times had been the sole
       obligor on such Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the
       foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting
       or failure to act on the part of the Agent and the Lenders, including,
       without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any
       right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or
       regulations thereunder which might, but for the provisions of this
       Section 5.14, afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving
       such Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under
       this Section 5.14, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long
       as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the obligations
       of such Borrower under this Section 5.14 shall not be discharged except
       by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The
       Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 5.14 shall not be
       diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization,
       arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with
       respect to either Borrower, or any of the Lenders. The joint and several
       liability of the Borrowers hereunder shall continue in full force and
       effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other
       change whatsoever in the name, ownership, membership, constitution or
       place of formation of either Borrower or the Lenders. Each of the
       Borrowers acknowledges and confirms that it has itself established its
       own adequate means of obtaining from the other Borrower on a continuing
       basis all information desired by such Borrower concerning the financial
       condition of the other Borrower and that each such Borrower will look to
       the other Borrower and not to the Agent or any Lender in order for such
       Borrower to keep adequately informed of changes in the other Borrower's
       financial condition.

              (f) The provisions of this Section 5.14 are made for the benefit
       of the Lenders and the Agent and their respective successors and assigns,
       and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against either or
       both of the Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without
       requirement on the part of the Lenders or the Agent or such successor or
       assign first to marshall any of its or their claims or to exercise any of
       its or their rights against the other Borrower or to exhaust any remedies
       available to it or them 
<PAGE>   53
                                      -47-


       against the other Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of
       obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any
       other remedy. The provisions of this Section 5.14 shall remain in effect
       until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise
       fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made
       in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be
       restored or returned by any Lender or the Agent upon the insolvency,
       bankruptcy or reorganization of either of the Borrowers, or otherwise,
       the provisions of this Section 5.14 will forthwith be reinstated in
       effect, as though such payment had not been made.

              (g) Each of the Borrowers hereby agrees that it will not enforce
       any of its rights of reimbursement, contribution, subrogation or the like
       against the other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it
       hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by
       it to any of the Lenders or the Agent with respect to any of the
       Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of
       the Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash. Any claim
       which either Borrower may have against the other Borrower with respect to
       any payments to the Lenders or the Agent hereunder or under any other
       Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right
       of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations
       arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full of the
       Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
       receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding
       under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to either Borrower, its debts
       or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations
       shall be paid in full before any payment or distribution of any
       character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made
       to the other Borrower therefor.

              (h) Each of the Borrowers hereby agrees that the payment of any
       amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by either Borrower to
       the other Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in
       cash of the Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the
       occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default,
       such Borrower will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect
       any indebtedness of the other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the
       Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the
       foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any
       amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected,
       enforced and received by such Borrower as trustee for the Agent and be
       paid over to the Agent for the pro rata accounts of the Lenders to be
       applied to repay the Obligations.

                  6.  COLLATERAL SECURITY.

       6.1. SECURITY OF BORROWERS. The Obligations shall be secured by a
perfected first priority security interest (subject only to Permitted Liens
entitled to priority under applicable law) in the following assets, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents:
(a) at all times prior to the payment in full in cash of all of the Debenture
Debt, substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers and the Designated
Subsidiaries, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, but excluding (i)
inventory on consignment from trade vendors and proceeds of such inventory in
which such trade vendors have a perfected security interest, up to the cost
thereof to such Borrower or such Designated Subsidiary, (ii) subject to the
requirements of Section 6.2 below, all ZFT Receivables transferred by such
Borrower or such Designated Subsidiary to ZFT pursuant to the Receivables
Securitization Facility Documents, and (iii) retail store leases, and (b) at all
times following the payment in full in cash of all of the Debenture Debt, (i)
all inventory of the Borrowers (but excluding inventory on consignment from
trade vendors and proceeds of such inventory in which such trade vendors have a
perfected security interest, up to the cost thereof to the Borrowers), (ii) all
accounts, including accounts receivable, of the Borrowers (but excluding,
subject to the requirements of Section 6.2 below, all ZFT Receivables
transferred by the Borrowers to ZFT pursuant to the Receivables Securitization
Facility Documents) and (iii) all Indebtedness of the Designated Subsidiaries to
the Borrowers. In addition, without in any way limiting the foregoing, the
Borrowers may elect to have the Obligations secured, following the payment in
full in cash of the Debenture Debt, by first priority (subject only to Permitted
Liens entitled to priority under applicable law) perfected security interests in
the inventory of Zale Puerto Rico and/or Dobbins pursuant to collateral security
arrangements and documents reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Agent, including without limitation, such documents which the Agent shall deem
necessary or advisable to obtain or perfect such security interests under the
laws of Puerto Rico and/or Guam, and the Agent agrees to take all reasonable
steps to cooperate with the Borrowers in establishing such collateral security
arrangements.

the Lenders shall have no right, title or interest in or to any ZFT Receivables
which, prior to the occurrence of a Receivables Release Termination Date, have
been transferred to ZFT or any Receivables Securitization Subsidiary; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein or in the Security Documents shall be
deemed to constitute a release of or in any way negate the security interest of
the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, in (a) any rights which the Borrowers
may have under the Receivables Securitization Facility Documents, and (b) any
accounts, or any proceeds or products thereof, transferred to ZFT following the
occurrence of any Receivables Release Termination Date; and provided, further,
that the foregoing shall in no way limit the Agent's rights to, and the Agent
shall have a security interest in, all proceeds from the sale of ZFT Receivables
to ZFT or any other Receivables Securitization

Securitization Facility Documents.

       be continuing, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to the
       Borrowers all such documents, agreements, instruments and releases and
       take such other and further action as the Borrowers, or either of them,
       may reasonably request and as are necessary to evidence the full and
       final release of all liens, claims, charges, security interests,
       mortgages and encumbrances which the Collateral Agent has in any property
       of any of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries other than the
       property which is intended to constitute security following the payment
       in full of the Debenture Debt as provided by Section 6.1 hereof and by
       the Lender Security Agreement, including, without limitation, execution,
       delivery and filing of partial releases or amendments of Uniform

       Date") of the occurrence of either of the following events:
<PAGE>   56
                                      -50-


                     (i)  the Borrowers shall have an implied Senior Debt Rating
              of either BBB-, if rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, or
              Baa3, if rated by Moody's Investors Services, Inc.; or

                     (ii) as of two consecutive fiscal quarter ending dates,
              with respect to the respective periods of four consecutive fiscal
              quarters of Zale and its Subsidiaries ending on such fiscal

              Consolidated Total Debt Service of at least 3.5 to 1.0 for each of
              such two periods of four consecutive fiscal quarters.

       Following the occurrence of the Collateral Release Date, within thirty
       (30) days of any request therefor of the Borrowers, or either of them,
       the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to the Borrowers all such
       documents, agreements, instruments and releases and take such other and
       further action as the Borrowers, or either of them, may reasonably
       request and as are necessary to evidence the full and final release of
       all liens, claims, charges, security interests, mortgages and
       encumbrances which the Collateral Agent has in any property of any of the
       Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries, including, without limitation,
       execution, delivery and filing of termination statements with respect to
       Uniform Commercial Code financing statements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, following any such
releases of collateral security pursuant to this Section 6.3, the prohibition on
the Borrowers' and the Designated Subsidiaries' ability to grant liens or
encumbrances on any of their assets, as set forth more fully in Section 9.2
below, shall continue to apply.

       on the business, assets or financial condition of the Borrowers and the

       7.4. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PROJECTIONS.

              7.4.1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. There have been furnished to each of
       the Lenders (a) a consolidated balance sheet of Zale and its Subsidiaries
       as at the Balance Sheet Date, and a consolidated statement of income and
       consolidated statement of cash flow of Zale and its Subsidiaries for the
       fiscal year then ended, certified by Arthur Andersen & Co. and (b) an
       unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Zale and its Subsidiaries as at
       April 30, 1995, and an unaudited consolidated statement of income and
       consolidated statement of cash flow of Zale and its Subsidiaries for the
       period of three fiscal quarters then ended. Such balance sheets,
       statements of income and statements of cash flow have been prepared in
       accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and fairly
       present the financial condition of Zale and its Subsidiaries as at the
       close of business on the dates thereof and the results of operations for
       the periods then ended, subject, in the case of such unaudited
       consolidated balance sheet, unaudited consolidated statement of income
       and unaudited consolidated statement of cash flow, to year-end
       adjustments, and except that there are no notes to such financial
       statements. There are no contingent liabilities of Zale or any of its
       Subsidiaries as of such dates involving material amounts, known to the
       officers of either of the Borrowers, which were not disclosed in such
       balance sheets and the notes related thereto.

              7.4.2. PROJECTIONS. The projections of the annual operating
       budgets of Zale and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, balance
       sheets and cash flow statements for the 1996 to 1998 fiscal years, copies
       of which have been delivered to each Lender, have been prepared in good
       faith, are based upon estimates and assumptions which the Borrowers deem
       reasonable as of the date hereof, have been prepared on the basis of the
       assumptions stated therein and reflect the reasonable estimates of Zale
       and its Subsidiaries of the results of operations and other information
       projected therein.

       7.5. NO MATERIAL CHANGES, ETC. Since the Balance Sheet Date there has
occurred no materially adverse change in the financial condition or business of
the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries as shown on or reflected in the
consolidated balance sheet of Zale and its Subsidiaries as at the Balance Sheet
Date, or the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year then ended,
other than changes in the ordinary course of business that have not had any
materially adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the
Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries considered as a whole. Except as
contemplated by the Plan and with respect to the Litigation Entity, since the
Balance Sheet Date, none of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries has
made any Distribution other than Distributions permitted by the Prior Credit
Agreement or by Section 9.4 hereof.
<PAGE>   59
                                      -53-


       7.6. FRANCHISES, PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, ETC. Each of the Borrowers and the
Designated Subsidiaries possesses all franchises, patents, copyrights,
trademarks, trade names, licenses and permits, and rights in respect of the
foregoing, adequate for the conduct of its business substantially as now
conducted without known conflict with any rights of others except where the
failure to possess any such franchise, patent, copyright, trademark, trade name,
license, permit or right, or where such conflict, would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the business or financial
condition of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries considered as a
whole.

       7.7. LITIGATION. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.7 hereto or as
otherwise disclosed in writing by the Borrowers to the Agent and the Lenders,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations of any kind pending
or threatened against any of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries before
any court, tribunal or administrative agency or board that, if adversely
determined, (i) would reasonably be expected to, either in any case or in the
aggregate, materially adversely affect the properties, assets, financial
condition or business of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries,
considered as a whole, or materially impair the right of the Borrowers and the
Designated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, to carry on business
substantially as now conducted by them, or (ii) would reasonably be expected to
result in the making of any cash payments by any of the Borrowers or the
Designated Subsidiaries or any combination of any of the Borrowers or the
Designated Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 in any single case or $5,000,000
in the aggregate, which payment or payments is or are (A) not adequately covered
by insurance, (B) not adequately reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Zale and its Subsidiaries, or (C) not able to be discharged in any
manner other than through the making of a cash payment, or (iii) which question

action taken or to be taken pursuant hereto or thereto.

       7.8. NO MATERIALLY ADVERSE CONTRACTS, ETC. None of the Borrowers or any
Designated Subsidiary is subject to any charter, corporate or other legal
restriction, or any judgment, decree, order, rule or regulation that has or is
expected in the future to have a materially adverse effect on the business,
assets or financial condition of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries,
considered as a whole. None of the Borrowers or any Designated Subsidiary is a
party to any contract or agreement that has or is expected, in the judgment of
the Borrowers' officers, to have any materially adverse effect on the business
of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries considered as a whole.

       7.9. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS, LAWS, ETC. None of the Borrowers
or any Designated Subsidiary is in violation of any provision of its charter
documents, bylaws, or any agreement or instrument to which it may be subject or
by which it or any of its properties may be bound or any decree, order,
judgment, 
<PAGE>   60
                                      -54-


statute, license, rule or regulation, in any of the foregoing cases in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
financial condition, properties or business of the Borrowers and the Designated
Subsidiaries considered as a whole.

       7.10. TAX STATUS. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.10 hereto, each of
the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries (i) have made or filed all federal
and state income and all other tax returns, reports and declarations required by
any jurisdiction to which any of them is subject, except where the failure to so
file would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries
considered as a whole, (ii) have paid all taxes and other governmental
assessments and charges shown or determined to be due on such returns, reports
and declarations, except those being contested in good faith and by appropriate

which such returns, reports or declarations apply. Except as set forth on
Schedule 7.10 hereto, and except for those being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings for which adequate reserves have been taken, there are
no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority
of any jurisdiction, and the officers of the Borrowers know of no basis for any
such claim.

       7.11. NO EVENT OF DEFAULT. No Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing.

       7.12. HOLDING COMPANY AND INVESTMENT COMPANY ACTS. None of the Borrowers
or any Designated Subsidiary is a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", or an affiliate" of a "holding company", as such terms
are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935; nor is it an
"investment company", or an "affiliated company" or a "principal underwriter" of
an "investment company", as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act
of 1940.

       7.13. ABSENCE OF FINANCING STATEMENTS, ETC. Except with respect to
Permitted Liens, there is no financing statement signed by any of the Borrowers
or the Designated Subsidiaries, security agreement, chattel mortgage, real
estate mortgage or other document filed or to be filed following the Closing
Date or recorded with any filing records, registry or other public office, that
purports to cover, affect or give notice of any present or possible future lien
on, or security interest in, any assets or property of any of the Borrowers or
the Designated Subsidiaries or any rights relating thereto.

       7.14. PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTEREST. Other than filings, notices or
other actions which may be required to perfect the security interests granted by
the Security Documents in deposit accounts which are not Store Concentration
Accounts, 
<PAGE>   61
                                      -55-


all filings, assignments, pledges and deposits of documents or instruments have
been made and all other actions have been taken that are necessary, under
applicable law, to establish and perfect the Collateral Agent's security
interest in the Collateral. The Collateral and the Collateral Agent's rights
with respect to the Collateral are not subject to any setoff, claims,
withholdings or other defenses, except, with respect to Collateral consisting of
accounts or "layaway inventory", for setoffs, claims, withholdings or other
defenses in the ordinary course of the Borrowers' business. The Borrowers and/or
the Designated Subsidiaries are the owners of the Collateral free from any lien,
security interest, encumbrance and any other claim or demand, except for
Permitted Liens.

       7.15. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Except for transactions set forth on Schedule
7.15 hereto and other arm's length transactions pursuant to which any of the
Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries makes payments in the ordinary course
of business upon terms no less favorable than such Borrower or such Designated
Subsidiary could obtain from third parties, none of the officers, directors, or
employees of any of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries is presently a
party to any transaction with any of the Borrowers or the Designated
Subsidiaries (other than for services as employees, officers and directors),
including any contract, agreement or other arrangement providing for the
furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal
property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any officer,
director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the Borrowers, any
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in which any officer, director,
or any such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director,
trustee or partner.

       7.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

              7.16.1. IN GENERAL. Each Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained
       and operated in compliance in all material respects with the provisions
       of ERISA and, to the extent applicable, the Code, including but not
       limited to the provisions thereunder respecting prohibited transactions.
       The Borrowers have heretofore delivered to the Agent the most recently
       completed, prior to the date hereof, annual report, Form 5500, with all
       required attachments, and actuarial statement required to be submitted
       under Section 103(d) of ERISA, with respect to each Guaranteed Pension
       Plan.

              7.16.2. TERMINABILITY OF WELFARE PLANS. Under each Employee
       Benefit Plan which is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning
       of Section 3(1) or Section 3(2)(B) of ERISA, no benefits are due unless
       the event giving rise to the benefit entitlement occurs prior to plan
       termination (except as required by Title I, Part 6 of ERISA). One of the
       Borrowers or an ERISA Affiliate, as appropriate, may terminate each such
       Employee Benefit Plan at any time (or at any time subsequent to the
       expiration of any applicable bargaining 
<PAGE>   62
                                      -56-


       agreement) in the discretion of such Borrower or such ERISA Affiliate
       without liability to any Person, except for benefit entitlements which
       have occurred prior to such termination.

              7.16.3. GUARANTEED PENSION PLANS. Each contribution required to be
       made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan to avoid the incurrence of an
       accumulated funding deficiency or the notice or lien provisions of
       Section 302(f) of ERISA, and each other material contribution required to
       be made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan, has been timely made. No waiver of
       an accumulated funding deficiency or extension of amortization periods
       has been received with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan. No
       liability to the PBGC (other than required insurance premiums, all of
       which have been paid) has been incurred by either of the Borrowers or any
       ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan and there has
       not been any ERISA Reportable Event, or any other event or condition
       which presents a material risk of termination of any Guaranteed Pension
       Plan by the PBGC. Based on the latest valuation of each Guaranteed
       Pension Plan (which in each case occurred within twelve months of the
       date of this representation), and on the actuarial methods and
       assumptions employed for that valuation, the aggregate benefit
       liabilities of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans within the meaning of
       Section 4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of
       all such Guaranteed Pension Plans, disregarding for this purpose the
       benefit liabilities and assets of any Guaranteed Pension Plan with assets
       in excess of benefit liabilities, by more than $1,000,000.

              7.16.4. MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. Neither the Borrowers nor any ERISA
       Affiliate has incurred any material liability (including secondary
       liability) to any Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
       withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan under Section 4201 of ERISA or as
       a result of a sale of assets described in Section 4204 of ERISA. Neither
       the Borrowers nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified that any
       Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or insolvent under and within the
       meaning of Section 4241 or Section 4245 of ERISA or that any
       Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has been terminated under
       Section 4041A of ERISA.

       7.17. REGULATIONS U AND X. The proceeds of the Loans shall be used to
refinance the Borrowers' obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement, for
repurchasing certain warrants with respect to the capital stock of Zale as
permitted hereby, for working capital and general corporate purposes, and, to
the extent necessary, to pay all or a portion of the outstanding amounts due in
respect of the Debentures (including prepayment premiums). The Borrowers will
obtain Letters of Credit solely for working capital and general corporate
purposes. Except with respect to repurchases by Zale of certain warrants with
respect to its capital stock as permitted by Section 9.4(b) hereof, no portion
of 
<PAGE>   63


                                      -57-



any Letter of Credit is to be obtained, for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any "margin security" or "margin stock" as such terms are used in
Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12
C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224.

         7.18.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.

         The Borrowers have taken all reasonable steps to investigate the past
and present condition and usage of the Real Estate and the operations conducted
thereon and, based upon such diligent investigation, has determined that:

                  (a) none of the Borrowers, the Designated Subsidiaries or any
         operator of the Real Estate or any operations thereon is in violation,
         or alleged violation, of any judgment, decree, order, law, license,
         rule or regulation pertaining to environmental matters, including
         without limitation, those arising under the Resource Conservation and
         Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response,

         engaged in similar activities in similar geographic areas and in 
         amounts, containing such terms, in such forms and for such periods as 
         may be reasonable and prudent and in accordance with the terms of the

                  8.7.2. EVIDENCE OF INSURANCE. Contemporaneously with the 
         execution of this Credit Agreement, and within fifteen (15) days of any
         date when any additional or replacement insurance coverage is obtained
         to the extent provided in the Lender Security Agreement, each of the
         Borrowers and each of the Designated Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
         shall deliver to the Collateral Agent true copies of certificates of
         insurance with respect to such additional insurance or replacement
         policies and, upon request and to the extent not previously delivered
         to the Collateral Agent, copies of the original insurance policies
         evidencing such additional or replacement insurance, which certificates
         and policies (i) in the case of property and casualty policies, shall
         contain an endorsement or rider naming the Collateral Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lenders and the Agent, as a loss payee and additional
         insured, and (ii) in the case of liability policies, shall contain an
         endorsement or rider naming the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of

         without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Collateral Agent.

         8.8.  TAXES.  Except as to amounts which, in the aggregate, are not 
material in amount, each of the Borrowers will, and will cause each of the
Designated Subsidiaries to, duly pay and discharge, or cause to be paid and
discharged, before the same shall become overdue, all federal, state, local and
foreign taxes, levies, assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon
it and its real properties, sales and activities, or any part thereof, or upon
the income or profits therefrom, as well as all claims for labor, materials, or
supplies that if unpaid might by law become a lien or charge upon any of its
property; provided that any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim need not
be paid if the validity or amount thereof shall currently be contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings and if such Borrower or such Designated
Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto; and provided further that, unless a stay is in effect, each of the
Borrowers and each Designated Subsidiary will pay all such taxes, assessments,
charges, levies or claims forthwith upon the commencement of proceedings to
foreclose any lien that may have attached as security therefor.

         8.9.  INSPECTION OF PROPERTIES AND BOOKS, ETC.

                  8.9.1.  GENERAL.  Each of the Borrowers will permit the Agent

         to visit the premises of any of the Borrowers or the Designated
         Subsidiaries, confer with officers of any of the Borrowers or the
         Designated Subsidiaries and representatives of any of the Borrowers or
         the Designated Subsidiaries, review all of the books and records of any
         of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries (to the extent not
         privileged, and if any materials are privileged, subject to the Agent's

<PAGE>   72

                                      -66-


         Designated Subsidiaries and their professional advisors the matters

                  8.9.2.  COLLATERAL REPORTS.  No more frequently than once 
         each calendar year, or more frequently as reasonably determined by the
         Agent if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
         upon the request of the Agent, the Borrowers will obtain and deliver 
         to the Agent a report of an independent collateral auditor or appraiser
         satisfactory to the Agent (which auditor or appraiser may be affiliated
         with one of the Lenders) with respect to the inventory components
         included in the Borrowing Base, which report shall indicate (i) whether
         or not the information set forth in the Borrowing Base Report most
         recently delivered is accurate and complete in all material respects
         based upon a review by such auditor of the inventory (including
         verification as to the value, location and respective types) or (ii) in
         the case of an appraisal report by a collateral appraiser, shall state
         the then current fair market, orderly liquidation and forced
         liquidation values of all or any portion of the inventory owned by the
         Borrowers. All such collateral value reports shall be conducted and
         made at the expense of the Borrowers.

                  8.9.3.  COMMUNICATIONS WITH ACCOUNTANTS.  Each of the 
         Borrowers authorizes the Agent and, if accompanied by the Agent, the

         disclose to the Agent and the Lenders any and all financial statements
         and other supporting financial documents and schedules including copies

         8.10.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, CONTRACTS, LICENSES, AND PERMITS.
Each of the Borrowers will, and will cause each of the Designated Subsidiaries

regulations wherever its business is conducted, including all Environmental
Laws, (ii) all agreements and instruments by which it or any of its properties
may be bound and (iii) all applicable decrees, orders, and judgments, and (b)

required in order that either of the Borrowers may fulfill any of its
obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents to which either
of the Borrowers is a party, the Borrowers will promptly take or cause to be

such Borrower, such Designated Subsidiary or such Affiliate, (b) transactions
pursuant to documents and agreements contemplated by the Plan, (c) transactions
with ZFT or any other Receivables Securitization Subsidiary pursuant to the

extend, the terms of any of the Receivables Securitization Facility Documents as
in effect as of the Closing Date without the prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of, and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to, the Agent; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall restrict or be deemed to restrict the issuance by the Borrowers or the
Designated Subsidiaries, or any of them, of additional tranches of Indebtedness
under the Receivables Securitization Facility Documents as in the form delivered
to the Agent on the date hereof; and provided, further, that so long as no
Default or Event of Default shall exist and be continuing, and so long as none
would result therefrom, with prior written notice given to the Agent, the
Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries may enter into such amendments,
supplements or other modifications to the Receivables Securitization Facility
Documents which do not have any adverse effect on the Agent and the Lenders'
collateral security and which are otherwise no less favorable to the Borrowers
and the Designated Subsidiaries. The parties to this Credit Agreement intend it
to refinance the obligations under the Prior Credit Agreement and agree that an
acceleration of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof shall constitute an
Early Amortization Event (as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement).

         9.12.  ZALE PUERTO RICO; JFS.  Notwithstanding anything contained 
herein to the contrary, the Borrowers will not permit the aggregate amount of

Zale Puerto Rico may incur Indebtedness permitted by Section 9.1(d) and (g) in
respect of obligations owed to customers arising out of layaway transactions.
All obligations of Zale Puerto Rico to either of the Borrowers shall be
evidenced by promissory notes which shall be pledged to the Lenders and
delivered to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Security
Documents. The Borrowers will not permit JFS to have assets with an aggregate
book value in excess of $300,000 in Puerto Rico.

         9.13.  NEGATIVE PLEDGES.  The Borrowers will not, and will not permit 
any of the Designated Subsidiaries to, enter into any agreement or instrument
which shall prohibit any of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries from
granting security interests, mortgages, pledges or liens on, or otherwise
encumbering, any of its property or assets to secure the Borrowers' obligations
under this Credit Agreement or any refinancing, replacement, restatement,
modification, supplement or amendment of this Credit Agreement.

         9.14.  INDENTURE.  Neither of the Borrowers will amend, supplement or 
otherwise modify the terms of the Indenture or any of the Debentures; provided,
that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Borrowers, so long as no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, from redeeming, in whole
or in part, the Debentures and terminating the Indenture.

             10. FINANCIAL COVENANTS OF THE BORROWERS.

become known to any of the Lenders or the Agent any materially adverse change in

substance to the Agent and the Lenders, and the Agent and the Lenders shall
have received all such information and documents or papers reasonably requested

         12.2.  NO LEGAL IMPEDIMENT.  No change shall have occurred in any law 
or regulations thereunder or interpretations thereof that in the reasonable
opinion of any Lender would make it illegal for such Lender to make such Loan or

in the reasonable opinion of the Agent would make it illegal for the Agent to
issue, extend or renew such Letter of Credit.

         12.3.  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION.  Each Lender shall have received such

         of maturity or at any other date fixed for payment;

                  (c) the Borrowers shall fail to comply with (i) any of their

         Security Documents; or (ii) any of their covenants contained in
         Sections 9.1, 9.3, 9,7, 9.8 or 9.9 for more than five (5) days after
         the occurrence of such failure to comply;

         Indenture and Debentures, or in respect of any Consolidated Capitalized
         Leases, or fail to observe or perform any material term, covenant or
         agreement contained in any agreement by which it is bound, evidencing
         or securing borrowed money or credit received in excess of $5,000,000
         in the aggregate, including, without limitation, the Indenture and
         Debentures, or in respect of any Consolidated Capitalized Leases for
         such period of time as would permit (assuming the giving of appropriate
         notice if required) the holder or holders thereof or of any obligations
         issued thereunder to accelerate the maturity thereof;

                  (g) either of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of Zale shall
         make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or admit in writing

         petition or apply for the appointment of a trustee or other custodian,
         liquidator or receiver of such Borrower, or such Subsidiary of Zale or
         of any substantial part of the assets of such Borrower, or such
         Subsidiary of Zale or shall commence any case or other proceeding
         relating to such Borrower, or such Subsidiary of Zale under any
         bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of
         debt, dissolution or liquidation or similar law of any jurisdiction,
         now or hereafter in effect, or shall take any action to authorize or in
         furtherance of any of the foregoing, or if any such petition or
         application shall be filed or any such case or other proceeding shall
         be commenced against such Borrower, or such Subsidiary of Zale and such
         Borrower, or such Subsidiary of Zale shall indicate its written
         approval thereof, written consent thereto or formal acquiescence
         therein;

                  (h) a decree or order is entered appointing any such trustee,
         custodian, liquidator or receiver or adjudicating either of the
         Borrowers or any Subsidiary of Zale bankrupt or insolvent, or approving
         a petition in any such case or other proceeding, or a decree or order
         for relief is entered in respect of either of the Borrowers or any
         Subsidiary of Zale in any involuntary case under federal bankruptcy
         laws as now or hereafter constituted or, if earlier, sixty (60) days
         shall pass from the date of filing of such involuntary case without the
         dismissal thereof;

                  (i) there shall remain in force, undischarged, unsatisfied and
         unstayed, for more than sixty (60) days, whether or not consecutive,
         any final judgment against either of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of
         Zale that, with other outstanding final judgments, undischarged,
         against either of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of Zale exceeds in
         the aggregate $1,000,000;

                  (j) if any of the Loan Documents shall be canceled,
         terminated, revoked or rescinded otherwise than in accordance with the
         terms thereof or Section 6.3 hereof or with the express prior written
         agreement, consent or approval of the requisite Lenders in accordance
         with Section 26, or any action at law, suit or in equity or other legal
         proceeding to cancel, revoke or rescind any of the Loan Documents shall
         be commenced by or on behalf of either of the Borrowers party thereto
         or any of their respective stockholders, or any court or any other

         one or more of the Loan Documents is illegal, invalid or unenforceable
         in accordance with the terms thereof;

                  (k) with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan, an ERISA
         Reportable Event shall have occurred and such event would reasonably be
         expected to result in liability of either Borrower or any Designated
         Subsidiary

                                      -91-



         to the PBGC or such Guaranteed Pension Plan in an aggregate amount
         exceeding $1,000,000 and such event in the circumstances occurring
         reasonably would constitute grounds for the termination of such
         Guaranteed Pension Plan by the PBGC or for the appointment by the
         appropriate United States District Court of a trustee to administer
         such Guaranteed Pension Plan; or a trustee shall have been appointed by
         the United States District Court to administer such Guaranteed Pension

         Guaranteed Pension Plan;

                  (l) either of the Borrowers or any Designated Subsidiary shall

         States and such order shall continue in effect for more than thirty
         (30) days;

                  (m) there shall occur any material damage to, or loss, theft
         or destruction of, any Collateral, whether or not insured, or any
         strike, lockout, labor dispute, embargo, condemnation, act of God or
         public enemy, or other casualty, which in any such case causes, for
         more than fifteen (15) consecutive days, the cessation or substantial
         curtailment of revenue producing activities at any facility of either
         of the Borrowers or any Designated Subsidiary if such event or
         circumstance is not covered by business interruption insurance and
         would have a materially adverse effect on the business or financial
         condition of the Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries taken as a
         whole;

                  (n) there shall occur the loss, suspension or revocation of,
         or failure to renew, any license or permit now held or hereafter
         acquired by either of the Borrowers or any Designated Subsidiary if
         such loss, suspension, revocation or failure to renew would have a
         materially adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the
         Borrowers and the Designated Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

                  (o) either of the Borrowers or any Designated Subsidiary shall
         be indicted for a federal crime, a punishment for which, assuming a
         conviction, would reasonably be expected to include the forfeiture of
         any assets of Zale Delaware included in the Borrowing Base or any
         assets of either Borrower or any Designated Subsidiary not included in
         the Borrowing Base but having a fair market value in excess of

                  (p) Zale shall, at any time, legally or beneficially own less
         than one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of
         the capital stock of Zale Delaware (unless Zale and Zale Delaware are
         merged or consolidated as permitted by Section 9.5.1 hereof);

                  (q) there shall occur, with respect to any of the Receivables
         Securitization Facility Documents, any Purchase Termination Date, or
         Amortization Commencement Date;

                  (r) any and all payments and other amounts to which any of the
         Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries is entitled pursuant to the
         Receivables Securitization Facility Documents (which shall not include
         proceeds of ZFT Receivables not due to the Borrowers or the Designated
         Subsidiaries), including amounts in respect of Zale Delaware's interest
         in ZFT or any other Receivables Securitization Subsidiary or amounts
         under the Subordinated Notes, shall not have been paid directly into
         the FNBB Concentration Accounts or other depository accounts maintained
         by the Borrowers, or either of them, and subject to agency agreements
         reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Agent, in accordance
         with the terms and conditions of the Receivables Purchase Payment
         Instructions; provided however, that no Event of Default shall occur
         under this Section 13.1(r) if, within one (1) Business Day following
         any unintended failure to pay such payments or other amounts into the
         FNBB Concentration Accounts or such other accounts subject to such
         agency agreements, all such amounts have been deposited into the FNBB
         Concentration Accounts or such other accounts subject to such agency
         agreements; or

                  (s) Any of the Borrowers or the Designated Subsidiaries shall
         make Distributions during any fiscal year in excess of the limitations
         set forth in Section 9.4(d), whether or not such Distributions were
         permitted by the terms of such clause at the time when made; provided,
         however, that any Distribution with respect to any fiscal year shall
         not be an Event of Default because of losses occurring after the end of
         the fiscal year in which such Distribution was made.

then, in any such event, so long as the same may be continuing, the Agent may,
and upon the request of the Majority Lenders shall, by notice in writing to the
Borrowers, declare all amounts owing with respect to this Credit Agreement, the
Notes and the other Loan Documents and all Reimbursement Obligations to be, and
they shall thereupon forthwith become, immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by each of the Borrowers; provided that in the event of
any Event of Default specified in Sections 13.1(g) or 13.1(h), or if any of the
obligations of the Borrowers under the Debentures shall be declared due and
payable before the stated maturity thereof (other than pursuant to a voluntary
redemption thereof by the Borrowers, or either of them), all such amounts shall
become immediately due and payable automatically and without any requirement of
notice from the Agent or any Lender (any such requirement for payment pursuant
to this Section 13.1 being an "Acceleration").


<PAGE>   99

                                      -93-



         13.2.  TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.  If any one or more of the Events 
of Default specified in Section 13.1(g) or Section 13.1(h) shall occur, or if 
any of the obligations of the Borrowers under the Debentures shall be declared 
due and payable before the stated maturity thereof (other than pursuant to a
voluntary redemption thereof by the Borrowers, or either of them), any unused
portion of the credit hereunder shall forthwith terminate and each of the
Lenders shall be relieved of all further obligations to make Loans to the
Borrowers and the Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations to issue,
extend or renew Letters of Credit. If any other Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Agent may and, upon the request of the Majority
Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrowers specifying the applicable Event of
Default or Events of Default, terminate the unused portion of the credit
hereunder, and upon such notice being given such unused portion of the credit
hereunder shall terminate immediately and each of the Lenders shall be relieved
of all further obligations to make Loans and the Agent shall be relieved of all
further obligations to issue, extend or renew Letters of Credit. No termination
of the credit hereunder shall relieve the Borrowers of any of the Obligations
or, without in any way limiting any rights of any of the Agent or the Lenders
to exercise any remedies available to them hereunder or under any of the other
Loan Documents or at law or in equity, any Lender of common law, if any, or
contractual confidentiality obligations to the Borrowers.

         13.3.  REMEDIES.  In case any one or more of the Events of Default 
shall have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not the Lenders shall have
accelerated the maturity of the Loans pursuant to Section 13.1, each Lender, if
owed any amount with respect to the Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations, may,
with the consent of the Majority Lenders but not otherwise, proceed to protect
and enforce its rights by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any
instrument pursuant to which the Obligations to such Lender are evidenced,
including as permitted by applicable law the obtaining of the ex parte
appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount shall have become due, by
declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment thereof or any other
legal or equitable right of such Lender. No remedy herein conferred upon any
Lender or the Agent or the holder of any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of
Credit Participation is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each
and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by
statute or any other provision of law.

         13.4.  CASH COLLATERAL TO SECURE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT.  In 
case any one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
and whether or not the Lenders shall have accelerated the maturity of the Loans
pursuant to Section 13.1, the Agent may, or at the request of the Majority
Lenders shall, require the Borrowers to furnish upon one day's notice cash
collateral to secure the Borrowers'

<PAGE>   100

                                      -94-



Obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit at the time outstanding in an
amount equal to one hundred and two percent (102%) of the Maximum Drawing Amount
of each such Letter of Credit as of such date and according to a Cash Collateral
Agreement and such other terms as the Agent shall reasonably require.

         13.5.  REPAYMENTS OF LOANS AND DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS 
AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. In the event that following the occurrence and during 
the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any
Lender, as the case may be, receives any monies (other than Excluded Proceeds),
whether pursuant to Section 8.13 or Section 13.4 or otherwise with respect to
the realization upon any of the Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for
application as follows:

                  (a) First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
         reimbursement of the Agent and the Collateral Agent for or in respect
         of all reasonable costs, expenses, disbursements and losses which shall
         have been incurred or sustained by the Agent and the Collateral Agent
         in connection with the collection of such monies by the Agent and the
         Collateral Agent, for the exercise, protection or enforcement by the
         Agent and the Collateral Agent of all or any of the rights, remedies,
         powers and privileges of the Agent and the Collateral Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lenders, under this Credit Agreement or any of the other
         Loan Documents or in respect of the Collateral or in support of any
         provision of adequate indemnity to the Agent and the Collateral Agent
         against any taxes or liens which by law shall have, or may have,
         priority over the rights of the Agent and the Collateral Agent to such
         monies;

                  (b) Second, to all other Obligations in such order or
         preference as the Majority Lenders may determine; provided, however,
         that distributions in respect of such obligations shall be made (i)
         pari passu among Obligations with respect to the Agents' fees payable
         pursuant to Section 5.2 and all other Obligations and (ii) Obligations
         owing to the Lenders with respect to each type of Obligation such as
         interest, principal, fees and expenses, shall be made among the Lenders
         pro rata; and provided, further, that the Agent may in its discretion
         make proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not then due
         and payable;

                  (c) Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
         provisions for payment in full satisfactory to each of the Lenders, the
         Collateral Agent and the Agent of all of the Obligations, to the
         payment of any obligations required to be paid pursuant to Section
         9-504(1)(c) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of
         Massachusetts, including, so long as the Debentures are outstanding,
         obligations to the Trustee for the benefit of the holders of
         Debentures; and

<PAGE>   101

                                      -95-



                  (d) Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to the
         Borrowers or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

                                   14. SETOFF.

         Regardless of the adequacy of any collateral, during the continuance of
any Event of Default, any deposits or other sums credited by or due from any of
the Lender or the Agent to the Borrowers (but specifically excluding any
Excluded Proceeds which may come into the possession of any Lender or the Agent)
may be applied to or set off by such Lender against the payment of Obligations
and any and all other liabilities, direct, or indirect, absolute or contingent,
due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising, of the Borrowers to
such Lender. Each of the Lenders agrees with each other Lender that (a) if an
amount to be set off is to be applied to Indebtedness of the Borrowers to such
Lender, other than Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes held by such Lender or,
as the case may be, constituting Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Lender,
such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the
Indebtedness evidenced by all such Notes held by such Lender or, as the case may
be, constituting Reimbursement Obligations owed to such Lender, and (b) if such
Lender shall receive from either of the Borrowers, whether by voluntary payment,
exercise of the right of setoff, counterclaim, cross action, enforcement of the
claim evidenced by the Notes held by, or, as the case may be, constituting
Reimbursement Obligations owed to, such Lender, by proceedings against the
Borrowers at law or in equity in accordance with the terms of this Credit
Agreement, or by proof thereof in bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation,
receivership or similar proceedings, or otherwise, and shall retain and apply to
the payment of the Note or Notes held by or, as the case may be, Reimbursement
Obligations owed to, such Lender any amount in excess of its ratable portion of
the payments received by all of the Lenders with respect to the Notes held by
or, as the case may be, Reimbursement Obligations owed to, all of the Lenders,
such Lender will make such disposition and arrangements with the other Lenders
with respect to such excess, either by way of distribution, pro tanto assignment
of claims, subrogation or otherwise as shall result in each Lender receiving in
respect of the Notes held by it or, as the case may be, Reimbursement
Obligations owed it, its proportionate payment as contemplated by this Credit
Agreement; provided that if all or any part of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such Lender, such disposition and arrangements shall be rescinded
and the amount restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

                                 15. THE AGENT.

         15.1.  AUTHORIZATION.

                  (a) The Agent is authorized to take such action on behalf of
         each of the Lenders and to exercise all such powers as are hereunder
         and under any of the other Loan Documents and any related documents
         delegated to the Agent, 

<PAGE>   102

                                      -96-



         together with such powers as are reasonably incident thereto, provided
         that no duties or responsibilities not expressly assumed herein or
         therein shall be implied to have been assumed by the Agent.

                  (b) The relationship between the Agent and each of the Lenders
         is that of an independent contractor. The use of the term "Agent" is
         for convenience only and is used to describe, as a form of convention,
         the independent contractual relationship between the Agent and each of
         the Lenders. Nothing contained in this Credit Agreement nor the other
         Loan Documents shall be construed to create an agency, trust or other
         fiduciary relationship between the Agent and any of the Lenders.

                  (c) As an independent contractor empowered by the Lenders to
         exercise certain rights and perform certain duties and responsibilities
         hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent is nevertheless
         a "representative" of the Lenders, as that term is defined in Article 1
         of the Uniform Commercial Code, for purposes of actions for the benefit
         of the Lenders and the Agent with respect to all collateral security
         and guaranties contemplated by the Loan Documents. Such actions include
         the designation of the Agent as "secured party", "mortgagee" or the
         like on all financing statements and other documents and instruments,
         whether recorded or otherwise, relating to the attachment, perfection,
         priority or enforcement of any security interests, mortgages or deeds
         of trust in collateral security intended to secure the payment or
         performance of any of the Obligations, all for the benefit of the
         Lenders and the Agent.

         15.2.  EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.  The Agent may exercise its powers and 
execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to
take, and to rely on, advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to its
rights and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The
Agent may utilize the services of such Persons as the Agent in its sole
discretion may reasonably determine, and all reasonable fees and expenses of any
such Persons shall be paid by the Borrowers.

         15.3.  NO LIABILITY.  Neither the Agent nor any of its shareholders, 
directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their
duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver,
consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good
faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any
oversight or error of judgment whatsoever, except that the Agent or such other
Person, as the case may be, may be liable for losses due to its willful
misconduct or gross negligence.

         15.4.  NO REPRESENTATIONS.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the 
execution or validity or enforceability of this Credit Agreement, the Notes, the

<PAGE>   103

                                      -97-



Letters of Credit, any of the other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time
constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or
for the value of any such collateral security or for the validity,
enforceability or collectability of any such amounts owing with respect to the
Notes, or for any recitals or statements, warranties or representations made
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in any certificate or instrument
hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of the Borrowers, or be bound to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
conditions, covenants or agreements herein or in any instrument at any time
constituting, or intended to constitute, collateral security for the Notes or to
inspect any of the properties, books or records of the Borrowers or any of their
Subsidiaries. The Agent shall not be bound to ascertain whether any notice,
consent, waiver or request delivered to it by the Borrowers or any holder of any
of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and complete.
The Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or warranties,
express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders, with
respect to the credit worthiness or financial conditions of the Borrowers or any
of their Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such
information and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Credit Agreement.

         15.5.  PAYMENTS.

                  15.5.1.  PAYMENTS TO AGENT.  A payment by the Borrowers to 
         the Agent hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents for the 
         account of any Lender shall constitute a payment to such Lender. The 
         Agent agrees promptly to distribute to each Lender such Lender's pro 
         rata share of payments received by the Agent for the account of the 
         Lenders except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in any of the
         other Loan Documents.

                  15.5.2.  DISTRIBUTION BY AGENT.  If in the opinion of the 
         Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in such capacity
         hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents
         might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making distribution
         until its right to make distribution shall have been adjudicated by a
         court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction
         shall adjudge that any amount received and distributed by the Agent is
         to be repaid, each Person to whom any such distribution shall have been
         made shall either repay to the Agent its proportionate share of the
         amount so adjudged to be repaid or shall pay over the same in such
         manner and to such Persons as shall be determined by such court.

                  15.5.3.  DELINQUENT LENDERS.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
         contrary contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan

<PAGE>   104

                                      -98-



         Documents, any Lender that fails (i) to make available to the Agent its
         pro rata share of any Loan or to purchase any Letter of Credit
         Participation or (ii) to comply with the provisions of Section 14 with
         respect to making dispositions and arrangements with the other Lenders,
         where such Lender's share of any payment received, whether by setoff or
         otherwise, is in excess of its pro rata share of such payments due and
         payable to all of the Lenders, in each case as, when and to the full
         extent required by the provisions of this Credit Agreement, shall be
         deemed delinquent (a "Delinquent Lender") and shall be deemed a
         Delinquent Lender until such time as such delinquency is satisfied. A
         Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have assigned any and all payments
         due to it from the Borrowers, whether on account of outstanding Loans,
         Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, interest, fees or otherwise, to the
         remaining nondelinquent Lenders for application to, and reduction of,
         their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid
         Reimbursement Obligations. The Delinquent Lender hereby authorizes the
         Agent to distribute such payments to the nondelinquent Lenders in
         proportion to their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans
         and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. A Delinquent Lender shall be
         deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency when and if, as a result
         of application of the assigned payments to all outstanding Loans and
         Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations of the nondelinquent Lenders, the
         Lenders' respective pro rata shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid
         Reimbursement Obligations have returned to those in effect immediately
         prior to such delinquency and without giving effect to the nonpayment
         causing such delinquency.

         15.6.  HOLDERS OF NOTES.  The Agent may deem and treat the payee of 
any Note or the purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participation as the absolute
owner or purchaser thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have been
furnished in writing with a different name by such payee or by a subsequent
holder, assignee or transferee.

         15.7.  INDEMNITY.  The Lenders ratably agree hereby to indemnify and 
hold harmless the Agent and the Collateral Agent from and against any and all
claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses, damages,
costs, expenses (including any expenses for which the Agent or the Collateral
Agent has not been reimbursed by the Borrowers as required by Section 16), and
liabilities of every nature and character arising out of or related to this
Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated or evidenced hereby or thereby, or the Agent's or the
Collateral Agent's actions taken hereunder or thereunder, except to the extent
that any of the same shall be directly caused by the Agent's willful misconduct
or gross negligence.

         15.8.  AGENT AS LENDER.  In its individual capacity, FNBB shall have 
the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to
its Commitment 

<PAGE>   105

                                      -99-



and the Loans made by it, and as the holder of any of the Notes and as the
purchaser of any Letter of Credit Participations, as it would have were it not
also the Agent and the Collateral Agent.

         15.9.  RESIGNATION; REMOVAL.  The Agent may resign at any time by 
giving sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor Agent. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, such successor Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Borrowers. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after
the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a
financial institution having a rating of not less than A or its equivalent by
Standard & Poor's Corporation and which, unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Agent's resignation, the provisions of this Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent. The
Agent may be removed by a vote of the Majority Lenders for cause or in the event
that FNBB shall have entered into assignments of its interest under this Credit
Agreement resulting in its Commitment being reduced to an amount less than
$10,000,000. In the event of any such removal of the Agent pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, the provisions of this Section 15.9 shall apply to the
appointment of a successor.

         15.10.  NOTIFICATION OF DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  Each Lender 
hereby agrees that, upon learning of the existence of a Default or an Event of
Default, it shall promptly notify the Agent thereof, but it shall have no
liability for failure to do so. The Agent hereby agrees that upon receipt of any
notice under this Section 15.10 it shall promptly notify the other Lenders of
the existence of such Default or Event of Default.

         15.11.  DUTIES IN THE CASE OF ENFORCEMENT.  In case one of more Events 
of Default have occurred and shall be continuing, and whether or not
acceleration of the Obligations shall have occurred, the Agent shall, if (i) so
requested by the Majority Lenders and (ii) the Lenders have provided to the
Agent such additional indemnities and assurances against expenses and
liabilities as the Agent may reasonably request, proceed to enforce the
provisions of the Security Documents authorizing the sale or other disposition
of all or any part of the Collateral and exercise all or any such other legal
and equitable and other rights or remedies as it may have in respect of such
Collateral. The Majority Lenders may direct the Agent in writing as to the
method 

<PAGE>   106

                                     -100-



and the extent of any such sale or other disposition, the Lenders hereby
agreeing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from all liabilities incurred
in respect of all actions taken or omitted in accordance with such directions,
provided that the Agent need not comply with any such direction to the extent
that the Agent reasonably believes the Agent's compliance with such direction to
be unlawful or commercially unreasonable in any applicable jurisdiction.

                                  16. EXPENSES.

         The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay (i) the reasonable
costs of producing and reproducing this Credit Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and the other agreements and instruments mentioned herein, (ii) any
taxes (including any interest and penalties in respect thereto) payable by the
Agent or any of the Lenders (other than taxes based upon the Agent's or any
Lender's net income) on or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Credit Agreement (the Borrowers hereby agreeing to indemnify the Agent and each
Lender with respect thereto), (iii) the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of the Agent's Special Counsel or any local counsel to the Agent
incurred in connection with the preparation, administration or interpretation of
the Loan Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, each closing
hereunder, and amendments, modifications, approvals, consents or waivers hereto
or hereunder, (iv) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of the Agent
and the Collateral Agent incurred by the Agent and the Collateral Agent in
connection with the preparation, administration or interpretation of the Loan
Documents and other instruments mentioned herein, (v) any reasonable fees,
costs, expenses and bank charges, including bank charges for returned checks,
incurred by the Agent or the Collateral Agent in establishing, maintaining or
handling the FNBB Concentration Accounts and any agency accounts, lock box
accounts and other accounts for the collection of any of the Collateral; (vi)
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or the Collateral
Agent or any Lender in connection with periodic field examinations, monitoring
of Collateral and other assets, and otherwise in maintaining and monitoring the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Credit Agreement; (vii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, which attorneys may be
employees of any Lender or the Agent or the Collateral Agent, and reasonable
consulting, accounting, appraisal, investment banking and similar professional
fees and charges) incurred by the Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection
with (A) the enforcement of or preservation of rights under any of the Loan
Documents against the Borrowers or the administration thereof after the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default and (B) any litigation, proceeding
or dispute whether arising hereunder or otherwise, in any way related to the
Agent's or the Collateral Agent's relationship with the Borrowers or any of
their Subsidiaries and (viii) all reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of
the Agent and the Collateral Agent incurred in connection with 

<PAGE>   107

                                     -101-



UCC searches or UCC filings. The covenants of this Section 16 shall survive
payment or satisfaction of all other Obligations.

                              17. INDEMNIFICATION.

         The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders from and against any
and all claims, actions and suits whether groundless or otherwise, and from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages and expenses of every nature
and character arising out of (a) this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or any actual or proposed use
by the Borrowers of the proceeds of any of the Loans or Letters of Credit, (b)
the reversal or withdrawal of any provisional credits granted by the Agent upon
the transfer of funds to the FNBB Concentration Accounts from Corestates Bank,
N.A. or any other depository institution satisfactory to the Agent or in
connection with the provisional honoring of checks or other items, (c) the
Borrowers entering into or performing this Credit Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, (d) with respect to the Borrowers, the Designated Subsidiaries
and their respective properties and assets, the violation of any Environmental
Law, the presence, disposal, escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, discharge,
emission, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substances or any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought or threatened with respect to
any Hazardous Substances (including, but not limited to, claims with respect to
wrongful death, personal injury or damage to property), or (e) any sales, use,
transfer, documentary and stamp taxes (but excluding any taxes based upon or
measured by the income or profits of any Lender, the Collateral Agent or the
Agent) and any recording and filing fees paid by the Agent, the Collateral Agent
or the Lenders and which arise by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
or by any of the Loan Documents, in each case including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal
counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other
proceeding; provided, however, that such indemnity shall not apply to the
portion, if any, of any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses of any Person seeking indemnification that is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Person seeking
indemnification; and provided further that such indemnity shall not apply to the
portion, if any, of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
of any Lender resulting solely and directly from any breach by such Lender of
its obligations under this Credit Agreement. In litigation, or the preparation
therefor, the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Agent shall be entitled to
select counsel to act on behalf of the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the
Agent and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, the Borrowers jointly and
severally agree to pay promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel; provided, however, that in the event of any conflict of interest
between or among any Lender, the Collateral Agent and the Agent, the Person or
Persons with such conflict 

<PAGE>   108

                                     -102-



of interest shall be entitled to select its or their own counsel (which counsel
may be the employee of such Person or Persons), and, in addition to the
foregoing indemnity, the Borrowers also jointly and severally agree to pay
promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. If, and to the extent
that the obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 17 are unenforceable
for any reason, each of the Borrowers hereby agrees to make the maximum
contribution to the payment in satisfaction of such obligations which is
permissible under applicable law. The covenants contained in this Section 17
shall survive payment or satisfaction in full of all other Obligations.

                         18. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, ETC.

         All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein,
in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or in any documents or other
papers delivered by or on behalf of the Borrowers or any of the Designated
Subsidiaries pursuant hereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the
Lenders and the Agent, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter
made by any of them, and shall survive the making by the Lenders of any of the
Loans and the issuance, extension or renewal of any Letters of Credit, as herein
contemplated, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as any Letter
of Credit or any amount due under this Credit Agreement or the Notes or any of
the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or any Lender has any obligation to
make any Loans or the Agent has any obligation to issue, extend or renew any
Letter of Credit, and for such further time as may be otherwise expressly
specified in this Credit Agreement. All statements contained in any certificate
or other paper delivered to any Lender or the Agent at any time on or after the
Closing Date by or on behalf of the Borrowers or any of the Designated
Subsidiaries pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by such Borrower or such
Designated Subsidiary hereunder.

                        19. ASSIGNMENT AND PARTICIPATION.

         19.1.  CONDITIONS TO ASSIGNMENT BY LENDERS.  Except as provided 
herein, each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a 
portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement 
(including all or a portion of its Commitment Percentage and Commitment and the
same portion of the Loans at the time owing to it, the Notes held by it and its
participating interest in the risk relating to any Letters of Credit); provided
that (a) the Agent shall have given its prior written consent to such
assignment, (b)(i) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, the Borrowers shall have given their prior written consent to
such assignment, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
and (ii) during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, the
Borrowers shall have given their prior written consent in the case of any such
assignment to an Excluded Assignee, (c) each such assignment shall be of a
constant, and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender's rights
and obligations 

<PAGE>   109

                                     -103-



under this Credit Agreement, (d) each assignment shall be in an amount that is
at least equal to $10,000,000, (e) no Lender shall enter into an assignment
which would result in such Lender's Commitment being reduced to less than
$10,000,000, except that any Lender may assign all of its rights and obligations
under this Credit Agreement and reduce its Commitment to $0, and (f) the parties
to such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for recording in the
Register (as hereinafter defined), an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially
in the form of Exhibit F hereto (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), together with
any Notes subject to such assignment. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance
and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five (5) Business Days
after the execution thereof, (i) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (ii) the assigning Lender shall, to
the extent provided in such assignment and upon payment to the Agent of the
registration fee referred to in Section 19.3, be released from its obligations
under this Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assigning Lender
shall retain its rights to be indemnified pursuant to Section 17 hereof with
respect to claims, actions and suits arising from events or circumstances
occurring prior to the date of such assignment.

         19.2.  CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; LIMITATIONS; COVENANTS.
By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the parties to the 
assignment thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other 
parties hereto as follows:

         legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free
         and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Lender makes no
         representation or warranty, express or implied, and assumes no
         responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
         representations made in or in connection with this Credit Agreement or
         the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
         sufficiency or value of this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents
         or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or the
         attachment, perfection or priority of any security interest or
         mortgage,

                  (b) the assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty
         and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition
         of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries or any other Person primarily
         or secondarily liable in respect of any of the Obligations, or the
         performance or observance by the Borrowers or any other Person
         primarily or secondarily liable in respect of any of the Obligations of
         any of their obligations under this Credit Agreement or any of the
         other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished
         pursuant hereto or thereto;

<PAGE>   110

                                     -104-



                  (c) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
         Credit Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
         statements referred to in Section 7.4 and Section 8.4 and such other

         credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
         Acceptance;

                  (d) such assignee will, independently and without reliance
         upon the assigning Lender, the Agent or any other Lender and based on
         such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
         time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
         action under this Credit Agreement;

                  (e)  such assignee represents and warrants that it is an 
         Eligible Assignee;

                  (f) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
         such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under
         this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to
         the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as
         are reasonably incidental thereto;

                  (g) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance
         with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
         Credit Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender;

                  (h)  such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally 
         authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; and

                  (i) such assignee acknowledges that it has made arrangements
         with the assigning Lender satisfactory to such assignee with respect to
         its pro rata share of Letter of Credit Fees in respect of outstanding
         Letters of Credit.

         19.3.  REGISTER. The Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment 
and Acceptance delivered to it and a register or similar list (the "Register") 
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment
Percentage of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to and Letter of Credit
Participations purchased by, the Lenders from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and
the Lenders at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice. Upon each such recordation, the assigning Lender agrees to pay to the
Agent a registration fee in the sum of $3,500.

         19.4.  NEW NOTES.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance 
executed by the parties to such assignment, together with each Note subject to
such assignment, the Agent shall (i) record the information contained therein in
the Register, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers and the
Lenders (other than the assigning Lender). Within five (5) Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Agent, in exchange for each surrendered Note, a new Note to the
order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the amount assumed by such
Eligible Assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
assigning Lender has retained some portion of its obligations hereunder, a new
Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the amount
retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall provide that they are
replacements for the surrendered Notes, shall be in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the surrendered Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be substantially in the form of the assigned Notes. Within five (5)
days of issuance of any new Notes pursuant to this Section 19.4, the Borrowers
shall deliver an opinion of counsel, addressed to the Lenders and the Agent,
relating to the due authorization, execution and delivery of such new Notes and
the legality, validity and binding effect thereof, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Lenders. The surrendered Notes shall be canceled and
returned to the Borrowers.

         19.5.  PARTICIPATIONS.  Each Lender may sell participations to one or 
more banks or other entities in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided
that (i) each such participation shall be in an amount of not less than
$10,000,000, (ii) any such sale or participation shall not affect the rights and
duties of the selling Lender hereunder to the Borrowers, (iii) such participants
shall not be entitled to the benefits of the yield protection and
indemnification provisions contained in Sections 5.3, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.10 hereof,
and (iv) the only rights granted to the participant pursuant to such
participation arrangements with respect to waivers, amendments or modifications
of the Loan Documents shall be the rights to approve waivers, amendments or
modifications that would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any
Loans, extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment of such Lender
as it relates to such participant, reduce the amount of any commitment fees or
Letter of Credit Fees to which such participant is entitled or extend any
regularly scheduled payment date for principal or interest.

         19.6.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each of the Lenders and the Agent agrees (on 
behalf of itself and each of its directors, officers, employees and
representatives) that it will treat in confidence the information obtained
pursuant to this Credit Agreement which is designated by the Borrowers, or
either of them, as confidential and will not, without the consent of the
Borrowers, disclose such information to any third party other than any employee,
director, agent, attorney, accountant or other professional 

<PAGE>   112

                                     -106-



advisor of such Lender or the Agent who has agreed to keep such information
confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Borrowers hereby
authorizes each of the Agent and the Lenders to disclose information obtained
pursuant to this Credit Agreement (a) to the Agent or any other Lender; (b) to
other banks or financial institutions who are assignees, participants or
potential assignees or participants in the Obligations, so long as each such
assignee or participant (or potential assignee or participant) first executes
and delivers to the Agent or, as the case may be, such Lender, for the benefit
of the Borrowers, a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit G hereto; (c) in response to any request or order of any court or other
governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Agent or such
Lender or as may be otherwise required pursuant to any statute, rule,
regulation, judicial process or other requirement of law; (d) to bank examiners,
auditors and accountants, or (e) where such information has been publicly
disclosed other than in breach of this Credit Agreement.

         19.7.  ASSIGNEE OR PARTICIPANT AFFILIATED WITH THE BORROWERS.  If any 
assignee Lender is an Affiliate of either of the Borrowers, then any such
assignee Lender shall have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for
purposes of agreeing to amendments or other modifications to any of the Loan
Documents or for purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section
13.1 or Section 13.2, and the determination of the Majority Lenders shall for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents be made without
regard to such assignee Lender's interest in any of the Loans. If any Lender
sells a participating interest in any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations
to a participant, and such participant is either of the Borrowers or an
Affiliate of either of the Borrowers, then such transferor Lender shall promptly
notify the Agent of the sale of such participation. A transferor Lender shall
have no right to vote as a Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents for purposes of granting consents or waivers or for purposes of
agreeing to amendments or modifications to any of the Loan Documents or for
purposes of making requests to the Agent pursuant to Section 13.1 or Section
13.2 to the extent that such participation is beneficially owned by either of
the Borrowers or any Affiliate of either of the Borrowers, and the determination
of the Majority Lenders shall for all purposes of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents be made without regard to the interest of such transferor Lender
in the Loans to the extent of such participation.

         19.8.  MISCELLANEOUS ASSIGNMENT PROVISIONS.  Any assigning Lender 
shall retain its rights to be indemnified pursuant to Section 17 with respect 
to any claims or actions arising prior to the date of such assignment. Anything
contained in this Section 19 to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may at
any time pledge all or any portion of its interest and rights under this Credit
Agreement (including all or any portion of its Notes) to any of the twelve
Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12
U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or the enforcement thereof

<PAGE>   113

                                     -107-



shall release the pledgor Lender from its obligations hereunder or under any of
the other Loan Documents.

         19.9.  ASSIGNMENT BY BORROWERS.  Neither of the Borrowers shall assign 
or transfer any of its rights or obligations under any of the Loan Documents
without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

         19.10.  ADDITIONAL COMMITMENT AMOUNTS.  (a) Upon request by the Agent, 
the Borrowers, and the applicable New Lender (as defined below) at any time and
from time to time, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, (i) any Person who would then qualify as an Eligible Assignee
hereunder may, prior to the Maturity Date, join this Credit Agreement as an
additional Lender (such Person being herein referred to as a "New Lender") and
be entitled to all the rights and interests and obligated to perform all of the
obligations and duties of a Lender with respect to a specified additional
Commitment hereunder and (ii) any existing Lender may increase the amount of its
Commitment hereunder (such Person being herein referred to as an "Increasing
Lender"), provided that (A) each of the Agent and the Borrowers shall, in its
reasonable discretion, have given its prior written consent to the addition of
such New Lender as a party to this Credit Agreement or, as the case may be, the
increasing of the Commitment of such Increasing Lender, (B) each New Lender or,
as the case may be, Increasing Lender, the Agent, and the Borrowers shall have
executed and delivered an instrument of adherence in the form of Exhibit H
hereto (the "Instrument of Adherence") pursuant to which such New Lender or, as
the case may be, Increasing Lender, shall agree to be bound as a Lender by the
terms and conditions hereof and the other Loan Documents, and to make Loans to
the Borrowers in accordance with this Credit Agreement, and which Instrument of
Adherence shall specify the new Commitment of such New Lender or, as the case
may be, Increasing Lender, (C) the additional Commitment provided by any New
Lender or, as the case may be, Increasing Lender (such additional Commitment,
the "Additional Commitment Amount") must be at least $10,000,000 for any New
Lender and $5,000,000 for any Increasing Lender, (D) such Additional Commitment
Amount, when aggregated with each other Additional Commitment Amount provided by
a New Lender or an Increasing Lender pursuant to this Section 19.10, shall not
exceed $30,000,000, and (E) such New Lender or Increasing Lender, as the case
may be, and the Agent shall have received such opinions of counsel to the
Borrowers, such evidence of proper corporate organization, existence, authority,
and appropriate corporate proceedings with respect to the Borrowers, and such
other certificates, instruments, and documents, as they shall have reasonably
requested in connection with such Instrument of Adherence.

         (b) Upon any New Lender's or Increasing Lender's, as the case may be,
execution of an Instrument of Adherence and the Borrowers' and the Agent's
consent thereto, the Commitment Percentage of each Lender shall be recalculated
and the aggregate Total Commitment shall be adjusted appropriately so as to
reflect the 

<PAGE>   114

                                     -108-



addition of the Additional Commitment Amount. Promptly thereafter, the Agent
shall notify each of the Lenders of the joinder hereunder of such New Lender,
or, as the case may be, of the increase of the Commitment of such Increasing
Lender, the resulting increase in the Total Commitment and each Lender's new
Commitment Percentage, and shall also make appropriate notations in the Register
in accordance with Section 19.3 hereof.

         (c) Upon the effective date of any Instrument of Adherence, the New
Lender, or, as the case may be, the Increasing Lender shall make all (if any)
such payments to the Agent, for delivery to the other Lenders as may be
necessary to result in the Loans made by such New Lender, or, as the case may
be, Increasing Lender, being equal to such New Lender's, or, as the case may be,
Increasing Lender's, Commitment Percentage (as then in effect) of the aggregate
principal amount of all Loans outstanding to the Borrowers as of such date. Each
of the Borrowers hereby agrees that any New Lender or Increasing Lender so
paying any such amount to the other Lenders pursuant to this Section 19.10 shall
be entitled to all the rights of a Lender hereunder and such payments to the
other Lenders shall constitute Loans held by such New Lender or, as the case may
be, Increasing Lender, hereunder and that such New Lender or, as the case may
be, Increasing Lender, may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all
of its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
amounts as fully as if such New Lender or, as the case may be, Increasing
Lender, had initially advanced the Borrowers the amount of such payments.

<PAGE>   117

                                     -111-



interest accruing pursuant to Section 5.11 following the effective date of any

                 AMENDED AND RESTATED LENDER SECURITY AGREEMENT

("Zale Delaware"), ZALE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Zale" and
together with Zale Delaware, the "Companies"), and THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF
BOSTON, a national banking association, as collateral agent (hereinafter, in
such capacity and for the benefit of the parties listed below, the "Secured
Party") for the benefit of (a) itself and other lending institutions
(hereinafter, collectively, the "Lenders") which are or may become parties to a
Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of August 11, 1995 (as amended, modified,
restated or supplemented and in effect from time to time, the "Credit
Agreement"), among the Companies, the Lenders, and The First National Bank of
Boston, as agent for itself and the Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent" and
together with the Lenders, collectively, the "Creditors") and (b) the Agent.

         WHEREAS, in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement (as defined in
the Credit Agreement), the Companies, certain of their affiliates, and The
First National Bank of Boston, as agent for itself and the other lenders under
the Prior Credit Agreement (in such capacity, the "Prior Secured Party"),
previously executed and delivered a certain Lender Security Agreement dated as
of July 30, 1993 (the "Prior Lender Security Agreement") pursuant to which the
Companies and such affiliates granted to the Prior Secured Party a security
interest in certain collateral;

         WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the Lenders' making any loans

substantially the form hereof relating to Lender Collateral (as defined
herein);

         WHEREAS, each of the Companies wishes to grant security interests in
the Lender Collateral in favor of the Secured Party, as herein provided, it
being intended that the Trustee (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the
holders of the Debentures (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have no
interest in the Lender Collateral and that the Collateral Agency Agreement (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) shall have no application to the Lender
Collateral;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which

         2.      Grant of Security Interest.

                          (a)     Each of the Companies hereby grants to the
         Secured Party, to secure the payment and performance in full of all of
         the Obligations, a security interest in and so pledges and assigns to
         the Secured Party, the Lender Collateral.

                          (b)     Pursuant to the terms hereof, each of the
         Companies has endorsed, assigned and delivered to the Secured Party
         all negotiable or non-negotiable instruments (including certificated
         securities) and chattel paper pledged by it under Section 2(a) hereof,
         together with instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in
         blank as the Secured Party may have specified. In the event that
         either of the Companies shall, after the date of this Agreement,
         acquire any other negotiable or non-negotiable instruments (including
         certificated securities) or chattel paper to be pledged by it under
         Section 2(a) hereof, such Company shall forthwith endorse, assign and
         deliver the same to the Secured Party, accompanied by such instruments
         of transfer or assignment duly executed in blank as the Secured Party
         may from time to time specify. To the extent that any securities are
         uncertificated, appropriate book-entry transfers reflecting the pledge
         of such securities created hereby have been or, in the case of
         uncertificated securities hereafter acquired by either of the
         Companies, will at the time of such acquisition be, duly made for the
         account of the Secured Party or one or more nominees of the Secured
         Party with the issuer of such securities or other appropriate
         book-entry facility or financial intermediary, with the Secured Party
         having at all times the right to obtain definitive certificates (in
         the Secured Party's name or in the name of one or more nominees of the
         Secured Party) where the issuer customarily or otherwise issues
         certificates, all to be held as Lender Collateral hereunder. Each of
         the Companies hereby acknowledges that the Secured Party may, in its
         discretion, appoint one or more financial institutions to act as the
         Secured Party's agent in holding in custodial account instruments or
         other financial assets in which the Secured Party is granted a
         security interest hereunder, including, without limitation,
         certificates of deposit and other instruments evidencing short term
         obligations.

         3.      Status of Certain Lender Collateral.

                          (a)     Notwithstanding the Companies' grant to the
         Secured Party of a security interest in accounts hereunder, the
         Secured Party hereby agrees, subject to the limitation set forth in
         the immediately following provisos hereinbelow, that it shall have no
         right, title or interest in or to any Securitization Subsidiary
         Receivables which, prior to the occurrence of any Receivables Release
         Termination Date, have been transferred to ZFT or any other
         Receivables Securitization Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing
         contained herein shall be deemed to constitute a release of or in any
         way negate the security interest of the Secured Party, for the benefit
         of the Creditors, in (i) prior to the Debenture Termination Date, Zale
         Delaware's rights under the Subordinated Notes or the Trust
         Certificates or Zale Delaware's interest in ZFT or any other
         Receivables Securitization Subsidiary, and any other rights which the
         Companies may have under the Receivables Securitization Facility
         Documents and (ii) any accounts, or in any proceeds or products
         thereof, transferred to ZFT or any Receivables Securitization
         Subsidiary following the occurrence of any Receivables Release
         Termination Date; and provided, further, that the Secured Party's
         security interest shall extend to, and the term Lender Collateral
         shall include, all accounts of the Companies, whether now existing or
         hereafter acquired, which shall not have become Securitization
         Subsidiary Receivables or which shall have been repurchased by,
         reassigned to, reconveyed to or reacquired by either Company, except
         pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Receivables Purchase Agreement (as the
         same may be from time to time amended in compliance with Section 9.11
         of the Credit Agreement). The foregoing shall in no way limit the
         Secured Party's rights to, and the Secured Party shall have a security
         interest in, all proceeds from the sale of Securitization Subsidiary
         Receivables to ZFT or any other Receivables Securitization Subsidiary
         to which Zale Delaware is entitled under the Receivables
         Securitization Facility Documents; provided, however, that following
         the Debenture Termination Date, nothing herein shall be construed as
         granting the Secured Party a security interest in the Subordinated
         Notes or the Trust Certificates or any other equity interest of the
         Borrowers, or either of them, in ZFT or any other Receivables
         Securitization Subsidiary.

                          (b)     The Secured Party acknowledges that (a) prior
         to its enforcement of its rights hereunder, ZFT and the Receivables
         Purchase Agent shall have no obligation to the Lenders or the Agent
         except as set forth in the Receivables Purchase Payment Instructions,
         and (b) so long as ZFT and the Receivables Purchase Agent are
         complying with the provisions of the Receivables Purchase Payment
         Instructions and the Receivables Securitization Facility Documents,
         Zale Delaware shall have no cause of action against ZFT or the
         Receivables Purchase Agent. Further, the Agent shall only exercise its
         remedies with respect to Zale Delaware's and Zale's rights under the
<PAGE>   6
                                      -6-

         Receivables Securitization Facility Documents in accordance with the
provisions of the Security Documents.

                          (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lenders
         and the Agent are aware that any security interest granted by the
         Security Documents in the Local Depository Accounts, the Corporate
         Depository Accounts and the Store Concentration Accounts may not, to
         the extent that such amounts represent Securitization Subsidiary
         Receivables, be perfected first priority security interests.

         4.      Status of Lender Collateral, etc. None of the Lender
Collateral constitutes, or is the proceeds of, "farm products" as defined in
Section 9-109(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. None of the account debtors in respect of any accounts arising
from the sale of Eligible Inventory and none of the obligers in respect of any
instruments included in the Lender Collateral which have been received by the
Companies as a result of the sale of Eligible Inventory is a governmental
authority subject to the Federal Assignment of Claims Act (unless there has
been compliance with such Act to give the Secured Party a perfected lien
therein).

         5.      Continuous Perfection. Each of the Companies' respective place
of business or, if more than one, chief executive office is indicated on the
Perfection Certificates delivered by each of the Companies to the Secured Party
herewith (the "Perfection Certificates"). Neither of the Companies will change
the same, or its name, identity or corporate structure in any manner, without
providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Secured Party.
Except for Lender Collateral having a value in the aggregate not in excess of
$500,000, the Lender Collateral, to the extent not delivered to the Secured
Party pursuant to Section 2(b), will be kept at those locations listed on the
Perfection Certificates and neither of the Companies will remove the Lender
Collateral from such locations, without providing at least thirty (30)    days'
prior written notice to the Secured Party.

         6.      No Liens. Except for the security interest herein granted and
liens permitted under the Credit Agreement, the Companies shall be the owners
of the Lender Collateral free from any other lien, security interest or other
encumbrance, and the Companies shall defend the same against all claims and
demands of all persons at any time claiming the same or any interests therein
adverse to the Secured Party or any of the Creditors. Neither of the Companies
shall pledge, mortgage or create, or suffer to exist a security interest in the
Lender Collateral in favor of any person other than the Secured Party except as
expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement.

         7.      No Transfers. Neither of the Companies will sell or offer to
sell or otherwise transfer the Lender Collateral or any interest therein except
for sales permitted by Section 9.5 of the Credit Agreement.

                                      -7-

         8.      Insurance.

                          (a)     Each of the Companies will maintain with
         financially sound and reputable insurers insurance with respect to its
         properties and business against such casualties and contingencies as
         shall be in accordance with general practices of businesses engaged in
         similar activities in similar geographic areas. Such insurance shall
         be in such minimum amounts and with such commercially reasonable
         deductibles that neither Company will be deemed a co-insurer under
         applicable insurance laws, regulations and policies and otherwise
         shall be in such amounts, contain such terms, be in such forms and be
         for such periods as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Secured
         Party. In addition, all such insurance shall be payable to the Secured
         Party as loss payee under a "standard" or "New York" loss payee
         clause. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Companies will (i)
         keep all of its physical property insured with casualty or physical
         hazard insurance on an "all risks" basis, with broad form flood and
         earthquake overages and electronic data processing coverage, with a
         full replacement cost endorsement and an "agreed amount" clause in an
         amount equal to 100% of the full replacement cost of such property
         (except inventory, which shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the
         cost of such inventory), (ii) maintain all such workers' compensation
         or similar insurance as may be required by law and (iii) maintain, in
         amounts and with deductibles equal to those generally maintained by
         businesses engaged in similar activities in similar geographic areas,
         general public liability insurance against claims of bodily injury,
         death or property damage occurring, on, in or about the properties of
         such Company; and product liability insurance.

                          (b)     The proceeds of any casualty insurance in
         respect of any casualty loss of any property of the Companies shall,
         subject to the rights, if any, of other parties with a prior interest
         in the property covered thereby, (i) so long as no Default or Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing and to the extent that the
         amount of such proceeds is less than $5,000,000, be disbursed directly
         to either of the Companies for direct application by such Company
         solely to the repair or replacement of such Company's property so
         damaged or destroyed and (ii) in all other circumstances, at the
         election of the Companies, either (A) be applied to the outstanding
         Obligations (in which case, the Total Commitment shall be reduced by
         the amount of such proceeds), or (B) be held by the Secured Party as
         cash collateral for the Obligations and disbursed from time to time
         upon such terms and conditions as the Secured Party and the Companies
         may agree upon; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall
         have occurred and be continuing, such proceeds shall be held by the
         Secured Party as cash collateral for the Obligations.

                          (c)     All policies of insurance shall provide for
         at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of cancellation or
         amendment to the Secured Party. In the
<PAGE>   8
                                      -8-

         event of failure by either of the Companies to provide and maintain
         insurance as herein provided, the Secured Party may, at its option,
         provide such insurance and charge the amount thereof to such Company.
         Each of the Companies shall furnish the Secured Party with
         certificates of insurance and policies evidencing compliance with the
         foregoing insurance provision.

         9.      [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

     10.     Lender Collateral Protection Expenses: Preservation of Lender
                                  Collateral.

                          (a)     In its discretion, following the occurrence
         of any Event of Default, the Secured Party may discharge taxes and
         other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on any of the Lender
         Collateral, make repairs thereto reasonably deemed necessary or
         appropriate by the Secured Party and pay any necessary filing fees.
         Each of the Companies agrees to reimburse the Secured Party on demand
         for any and all reasonable expenditures so made. The Secured Party
         shall have no obligation to such Company to make any such
         expenditures, nor shall the making thereof relieve such Company of any
         default.

                          (b)     Anything herein to the contrary
         notwithstanding, each of the Companies shall remain liable under each
         contract or agreement comprised in the Lender Collateral to be
         observed or performed by such Company thereunder. Neither the Secured
         Party nor any of the Creditors shall have any obligation or liability
         under any such contract or agreement by reason of or arising out of
         this Agreement or the receipt by the Secured Party or any of the
         Creditors of any payment relating to any of the Lender Collateral, nor
         shall the Secured Party or any of the Creditors be obligated in any
         manner to perform any of the obligations of either of the Companies
         under or pursuant to any such contract or agreement, to make inquiry
         as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Secured
         Party or any of the Creditors in respect of the Lender Collateral or
         as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any such
         contract or agreement, to present or file any claim, to take any
         action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any
         amounts which may have been assigned to the Secured Party or to which
         the Secured Party or any of the Creditors may be entitled at any time
         or times. The Secured Party's sole duty with respect to the custody,
         safe keeping and physical preservation of the Lender Collateral in its
         possession, under Section 9-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the
         Commonwealth of Massachusetts or otherwise, shall be to deal with such
         Lender Collateral in the same manner as the Secured Party deals with
         similar property for its own account.

         11.     Securities: Settlement: Deposits. Following the occurrence of
any Event of Default, the Secured Party may at any time, at its option,
transfer to itself or
<PAGE>   9
                                      -9-

any nominee any securities constituting Lender Collateral, receive any income
thereon and hold such income as additional Lender Collateral or apply it to the
Obligations. At all times prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Companies shall be entitled to receive any such income. When any Obligations
are due and after an occurrence of an Event of Default, the Secured Party may
demand, sue for, collect, or make any settlement or compromise which it deems
desirable with respect to the Lender Collateral. Regardless of the adequacy of
Lender Collateral or any other security for the Obligations, any deposits or
other sums at any time credited by or due from the Secured Party or any of the
Creditors to either of the Companies may at any time be applied to or set off
against any of the Obligations.

         12.     Notification to Account Debtors and Other Obligers.

                          (a)     If an Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be continuing, each of the Companies shall, at the request of the
         Secured Party, notify account debtors on accounts, chattel paper and
         general intangibles of such Company and obligers on instruments for
         which such Company is an obligee of the security interest of the
         Secured Party in any such account, chattel paper, general intangible
         or instrument and that payment thereof is to be made directly to the
         Secured Party, to the FNBB Concentration Accounts or to any financial
         institution designated by the Secured Party as the Secured Party's
         agent therefor, and the Secured Party may itself, if an Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, without notice to or
         demand upon either of the Companies, so notify account debtors and
         obligers. After the making of such a request or the giving of any such
         notification, each of the Companies shall hold any proceeds from
         collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles and
         instruments received by such Company as trustee for the Secured Party,
         without commingling the same with other funds of such Company and
         shall turn the same over to the Secured Party in the identical form
         received, together with any necessary endorsements or assignments. The
         Secured Party shall apply the proceeds of collection of accounts,
         chattel paper, general intangibles and instruments received by the
         Secured Party to the Obligations, such proceeds to be immediately
         entered after final payment in cash or solvent credits of the items
         giving rise to them.

                          (b)     Anything to the contrary contained herein
         notwithstanding, the Secured Party shall not, so long as the
         Receivables Securitization Facility Documents are in effect, notify
         any account debtors on Securitization Subsidiary Receivables of its
         security interest in any account with such account debtor or direct
         that payment thereof is to be made directly to the Secured Party, and
         nothing contained in this Section 12 shall be deemed to alter the
         provisions of Section 2.08 of the Receivables Purchase Agreement with
         respect to Securitization Subsidiary Receivables and Non-Purchased
         Receivables (as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement). If the
         Secured Party obtains
<PAGE>   10
                                      -10-

         any proceeds of collection from Securitization Subsidiary Receivables,
         the Secured Party shall hold such proceeds as trustee for the
         Receivables Securitization Subsidiary, and shall promptly turn the
         same over to the Receivables Securitization Subsidiary in the
         identical form received, together with any necessary endorsements or
         assignments on a non-recourse basis.

         13.     Further Assurances. Each of the Companies, at its own expense,
shall do, make, execute and deliver all such additional and further acts,
things, deeds, assurances and instruments as the Secured Party may reasonably
require more completely to vest in and assure to the Secured Party its rights
hereunder or in any of the Lender Collateral, including, without limitation,
(a) executing, delivering and, where appropriate, filing financing statements
and continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code, (b) obtaining
governmental and other third party consents and approvals and (c) taking all
actions required by Sections 8-313 and 8321 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as
applicable in each relevant jurisdiction, with respect to certificated and
uncertificated securities.

         14.     Power of Attorney.

                          (a)     Each of the Companies hereby irrevocably
         constitutes and appoints the Secured Party and any officer or agent
         thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful
         attorneys-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the
         place and stead of such Company or in the Secured Party's own name,
         for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take
         any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents
         and instruments that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the
         purposes of this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the
         foregoing, hereby gives said attorneys the power and right, on behalf
         of such Company, without notice to or assent by such Company, to do
         the following:

                                        (i)     upon the occurrence and during
                          the continuance of an Event of Default, generally to
                          sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with
                          respect to or otherwise deal with any of the Lender
                          Collateral in such manner as is consistent with the
                          Uniform Commercial Code of the Commonwealth of
                          Massachusetts and as fully and completely as though
                          the Secured Party were the absolute owner thereof for
                          all purposes, and to do at the Companies' expense, at
                          any time, or from time to time, all acts and things
                          which the Secured Party deems necessary to protect,
                          preserve or realize upon the Lender Collateral and
                          the Secured Party's security interest therein, in
                          order to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as
                          fully and effectively as such Company might do,
                          including, without limitation, the execution,
                          delivery and recording, in connection with any sale
                          or other disposition of any Lender Collateral, of the
                          endorsements, assignments or other
<PAGE>   11
                                      -11-

  instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect to such Lender Collateral-,
                                                                             and

                                        (ii)    to file such financing
                          statements with respect hereto, with or without such
                          Company's signature, or a photocopy of this Agreement
                          in substitution for a financing statement, as the
                          Secured Party may deem appropriate and to execute in
                          such Company's name such financing statements and
                          amendments thereto, and continuation statements which
                          may require such Company's signature.

                          (b)     To the extent permitted by law, each of the
         Companies hereby ratifiers all that said attorneys shall lawfully do
         or cause to be done by virtue hereof, except for the Secured Party's
         or such attorney's own gross negligence or willful misconduct or any
         breach by it of this Agreement. This power of attorney is a power
         coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

                          (c)     The powers conferred on the Secured Party
         hereunder are solely to protect the interests of the Secured Party and
         each of the Creditors in the Lender Collateral and shall not impose
         any duty upon the Secured Party to exercise any such powers. The
         Secured Party shall be accountable only for the amounts that it
         actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers and
         neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents
         shall be responsible to either of the Companies for any act or failure
         to act, except for the Secured Party's own gross negligence or willful
         misconduct or solely as a result of the Secured Party's breach of this
         Agreement.

         15.     Remedies. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Secured Party may, without notice to or demand upon either of
the Companies, declare this Agreement to be in default, and the Secured Party
shall, subject to its agreements contained in Section 12(b) hereof, thereafter
have in any jurisdiction in which enforcement hereof is sought, in addition to
all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies of a secured party under
the Uniform Commercial Code, including, without limitation, the right to take
possession of the Lender Collateral, and for that purpose the Secured Party
may, so far as either of the Companies can give authority therefor, enter upon
any premises on which the Lender Collateral may be situated and remove the same
therefrom. The Secured Party may in its discretion require either of the
Companies to assemble all or any part of the Lender Collateral at such location
or locations within the state(s) or territory(ies) of such Company's principal
office(s) or at such other locations as the Secured Party may designate. Unless
the Lender Collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value
or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Secured Party
shall give to each of the Companies at least ten (10) Business Days' prior
written notice of the time and place of any public sale of Lender Collateral or
of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition is
to be made. Each of the Companies hereby
<PAGE>   12
                                      -12-

acknowledges that ten (IO) Business Days' prior written notice of such sale or
sales shall be reasonable notice. In addition, each of the Companies waives any
and all rights that it may have to a judicial hearing in advance of the
enforcement of any of the Secured Party's rights hereunder, including, without
limitation, its right following an Event of Default to take immediate
possession of the Lender Collateral and to exercise its rights with respect
thereto.

         16.     No Waiver, etc. Each of the Companies waives demand, notice,
protest, notice of acceptance of this Agreement, notice of loans made, credit
extended, Lender Collateral received or delivered or other action taken in
reliance hereon. With respect to both the Obligations and the Lender
Collateral, each of the Companies assents to any extension or postponement of
the time of payment or any other indulgence, to any substitution, exchange or
release of Lender Collateral, to any failure to perfect any security interest,
to the addition or release of any party or person primarily or secondarily
liable, to the acceptance of partial payment thereon and the settlement,
compromising or adjusting of any thereof, all in such manner and at such time
or times as the Secured Party may deem advisable. The Secured Party shall have
no duty as to the collection or protection of the Lender Collateral or any
income thereon, nor as to the preservation of rights against prior parties, nor
as to the preservation of any rights pertaining thereto beyond the safe custody
thereof as set forth in Section 10(b). The Secured Party shall not be deemed to
have waived any of its rights upon or under the Obligations or the Lender
Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the Secured
Party with the written consent of the Agent and the Majority Lenders. No delay
or omission on the part of the Secured Party in exercising any right shall
operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver on any one
occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any
future occasion. All rights and remedies of the Secured Party with respect to
the Obligations or the Lender Collateral, whether evidenced hereby or by any
other instrument or papers, shall be cumulative and may be exercised
singularly, alternatively, successively or concurrently at such time or at such
times as the Secured Party deems expedient.

         17.     Marshalling. None of the Secured Party or the Creditors shall
be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but
not limited to this Agreement and the Lender Collateral) for, or other
assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such
collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and
all of the rights of the Secured Party hereunder and of the Secured Party or
any of the Creditors in respect of such collateral security and other
assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights,
however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, each of the
Companies hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the
marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement
of the Secured Party's rights under this Agreement or under any other
instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of
the Obligations
<PAGE>   13
                                      -13-

is outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof
is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each of the
Companies hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.

         18.     Proceeds of Dispositions, Expenses. The Companies shall pay to
the Secured Party on demand any and all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by the Secured
Party in protecting, preserving or enforcing the Secured Party's rights under
or in respect of any of the Obligations or any of the Lender Collateral. After
deducting all of said expenses, the residue of any proceeds of collection or
sale of the Obligations or Lender Collateral shall, to the extent actually
received in cash, be applied to the payment of the Obligations in such order or
preference as is provided in the Credit Agreement, proper allowance and
provision being made for any Obligations not then due. Upon the final payment
and satisfaction in full of all of the Obligations and after making any
payments required by Section 9-504(l)(c) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, any excess shall be returned to the Companies,
and the Companies shall remain liable for any deficiency in the payment of the
Obligations.

         19.     Overdue Amounts. Until paid, all amounts due and payable by
either of the Companies hereunder shall be a debt secured by the Lender
Collateral and shall bear, whether before or after judgment, interest at the
rate of interest for overdue amounts set forth in Section 5.11 of the Credit
Agreement.

         20.     Secured Party. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that the Secured Party is acting in its capacity as collateral agent and
secured party for the benefit solely of the Creditors. Nothing contained herein
or in any other document, instrument or agreement shall be deemed to indicate
that the Secured Party is acting as collateral agent or secured party for any
other Person, including, without limitation, the Trustee and the holders of the
Debentures, or to extend the grant of the security interest in the Lender
Collateral to or for the benefit of the Trustee, the holders of the Debentures
or any other Person (other than the Creditors). Nothing contained herein or in
the Joint Collateral Security Agreement shall be deemed to extend to or create
in the Secured Party, in its capacity as Secured Party hereunder, any
obligations or duties under the Joint Collateral Security Agreement or with
respect to the Joint Collateral.

         21.     Governing Law: Consent to Jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT IS
INTENDED TO TAKE EFFECT AS A SEALED INSTRUMENT AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.
Each of the Companies agrees that any suit for the enforcement of this
Agreement may be brought in the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or
any federal court sitting therein and consents to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of such court. Each of
<PAGE>   14
                                      -14-

the Companies hereby waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such suit or any such court or that such suit is brought in an
inconvenient court.

         22.     Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE COMPANIES WAIVES ITS RIGHT
TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE
PERFORMANCE OF ANY SUCH RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS. Except as prohibited by law,
each of the Companies waives any right which it may have to claim or recover in
any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to,
actual damages. Each of the Companies (a) certifies that neither the Secured
Party nor any of the Creditors nor any representative, agent or attorney of the
Secured Party or any of the Creditors has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that the Secured Party or any of the Creditors would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waivers and (b) acknowledges that, in
entering into the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the
Secured Party or any of the Creditors is a party, the Secured Party and each of
the Creditors are relying upon, among other things, the waivers and
certifications contained in this Section 22.

         23.     Prior Agreement Superseded. This Agreement shall, on and as of
the date hereof, amend and restate in its entirety the Prior Lender Security
Agreement. From and after the date hereof, the rights and obligations of the
parties under the Prior Lender Security Agreement shall be subsumed within and
governed by this Agreement.

         24.     Miscellaneous. The headings of each section of this Agreement
are for convenience only and shall not define or limit the provisions thereof.
This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon
each of the Companies and its respective successors and assigns, and shall
inure to the benefit of the Secured Party, each of the Creditors and their
respective successors and assigns. If any term of this Agreement shall be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity of all other terms hereof
shall in no way be affected thereby, and this Agreement shall be construed and
be enforceable as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term had not been
included herein. Each of the Companies acknowledges receipt of a copy of this
Agreement. All obligations of the Companies hereunder shall be joint and
several.

                           INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT


                 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT dated as of July 21, 1993, between
ZALE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and the Person
named on Annex A hereto (the "Indemnitee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                 WHEREAS, the Corporation has been a debtor in possession in
proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code since January
1, 1992;

                 WHEREAS, the Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code (the "Code") for Zale Corporation and Its Affiliated Debtors
dated March 24, 1993, as modified, has been confirmed by order, entered May 20,
1993, of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas,
Dallas Division (as so confirmed, the "Plan");

                 WHEREAS, the Plan of Reorganization is expected to be
consummated on or about July 28, 1993 or as soon thereafter as practicable;

                 WHEREAS, it is essential to the Corporation to attract as
directors the most capable persons available;

                 WHEREAS, the Corporation has requested that the Indemnitee
become a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation effective as of
8:00 a.m. on July 21 (the "Commencement Time") and the Indemnitee has agreed so
to serve in part upon the basis of the indemnification and other agreements
provided for and referred to in this Agreement, including Section 10 hereof;

                 WHEREAS, both the Corporation and the Indemnitee recognize the
increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors
of public companies in today's environment and take account especially of the
Corporation's recent history as a debtor-in-possession;

                 WHEREAS, the Corporation's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation requires the Corporation to indemnify its directors as set forth
therein and expressly authorizes the Corporation to enter into agreements with
its directors for the purpose of providing for such indemnification, and the
Indemnitee has agreed to serve as a director of the Corporation in part in
reliance on such provisions;
<PAGE>   2
                 WHEREAS, in recognition of the Indemnitee's need for
substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance the
Indemnitee's commencement and continued service to the Corporation in an
effective manner, the difficulty of finding adequate director and officer
liability insurance coverage and the Indemnitee's reliance on the aforesaid
provisions in the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and, in
part to provide the Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the
protection promised by such provisions will be available to the Indemnitee
(regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, future financial difficulties
of the Corporation, any change in the composition of the Corporation's board of
directors or the occurrence of any acquisition transaction relating to the
Corporation); and

                 WHEREAS, the Corporation wishes to provide in this Agreement
for the effective indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to the
Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement;

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
Indemnitee agreeing to serve the Corporation directly or, at its request, with
another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

                 1.       Indemnification

                 (a)      Agreement to Indemnify.  Subject to Section 3 hereof,
the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee to the full extent permitted by
law against expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals' fees and
other out-of-pocket expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative in nature ("Proceeding") in which the
Indemnitee was or is or is threatened to be made a party or in which the
Indemnitee testifies by reason of (i) the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent at any time after the Commencement Time of
the Corporation or is or was at any time after the Commencement Time serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, trustee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise and (ii) any acts or omissions by the
Indemnitee in such capacity that occurred after the Commencement Time, so long





                                       2
<PAGE>   3
as the Indemnitee acted or omitted to act in good faith and in a manner that
the Indemnitee (x) reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and (y) with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe was lawful; provided, however, that
if a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals
therefrom, adjudges the Indemnitee to be liable to the Corporation for any
amount or if the Indemnitee pays an amount in settlement to the Corporation,
the Corporation may indemnify the Indemnitee for such amount only with the
approval of such court.

                 (b)      Exclusions.  The Corporation shall not be liable
under this Agreement to make any payment to the Indemnitee:

                    (i)   for which payment has previously been actually made
         to the Indemnitee under a valid and collectible insurance policy,
         except in respect of any excess beyond the amount of payment under
         such insurance;

                    (ii)  for which payment has previously been actually made
         to the Indemnitee by the Corporation other than pursuant to this
         Agreement, except in respect of any excess beyond the amount of such
         payment; and

                   (iii)  for an accounting of profits made from the purchase
         or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation within the
         meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
         amended, or similar provisions of any state law;

                 (c)      Standards of Indemnification.  In connection with any
determination as to whether the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified or
advanced expenses hereunder, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the burden
of proof shall be on the Corporation to establish that Indemnitee is not so
entitled.  In connection with any action by the Indemnitee to enforce this
Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by law, neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any
action by the Indemnitee under Section 5 hereof that indemnification of the
claimant is proper under the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of





                                       3
<PAGE>   4
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.  For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any
Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation or with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to
believe that the conduct of the Indemnitee was unlawful.

                 2.       Indemnification Against Expenses of Successful Party.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, after the Indemnitee
has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including the dismissal of a
Proceeding without prejudice or the settlement of a Proceeding without
admission of liability, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, the Corporation, in accordance with Section
145(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, shall indemnify
the Indemnitee against all expenses (including attorneys' and other
professionals' fees and other out-of-pocket expenses) actually and reasonably
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection therewith.

                 3.       Determination of Right of Indemnification.  Any
indemnification under Section 1 (unless otherwise ordered by a court) shall be
made by the Corporation only following receipt of a written demand by the
Indemnitee and only (x) if, in the specific case there has been no
determination that indemnification of the Indemnitee is not proper in the
circumstances because the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 1 or (y) if (but only if) required by Delaware
law, upon a determination that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 1.  Any such determination shall be made within
thirty (30) days from the date the written request of the Indemnitee is
received by the Corporation either (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority
vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not or were not parties to
such Proceeding, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable
if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, or, if a change in control
(as defined below) has occurred subsequent to the Effective Date of the Plan of
Reorganization, by the written opinion of independent legal





                                       4
<PAGE>   5
counsel selected by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (or if a change
of control has so occurred, selected by the Indemnitee with the consent of the
Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (iii) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

                 A "change in control" shall be deemed to have occurred if (i)
any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), other than a Trustee or other
fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Corporation
or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the
Corporation in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock
in the Corporation, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under such Act), directly or indirectly of securities of the Corporation
representing 51% or more of the total voting power represented by the
Corporation's then outstanding Voting Securities, (ii) during any period of two
consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute
the board of directors of the Corporation and any new director whose election
by the board of directors or nomination for election by the Corporation's
stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors
then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period
or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease
for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of
the Corporation approve a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any
other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in
the Voting Securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto
continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted
into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least 80% of the total
voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Corporation or such
surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or
the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation and
dissolution of the Corporation or an agreement for the sale or disposition by
the Corporation of all or substantially all the Corporation's assets; provided,
however, that any transaction that would otherwise be a change in control under
clause (iii) hereof which is approved and recommended in advance by the
Corporation's board of directors shall not be deemed a change in control.  For
purpose of the definition of change in control, the term "Voting Securities"
shall mean any securities of the Corporation which vote generally in the
election of directors.





                                       5
<PAGE>   6
                 The term "independent legal counsel" as used herein, means a
law firm, an attorney or a member of a law firm that is experienced in matters
of corporate law and neither at the time of engagement is, nor at any time
during the five (5) years preceding the date of the engagement by the
Indemnitee has been, retained to represent (i) either the Corporation or the
Indemnitee in any matter material to either party or (ii) any other party to a
Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.  The term
"independent legal counsel" shall not include any person who, under the
applicable standards of professional conduct prevailing at the time of the
representation, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the
Corporation or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights
under the provisions of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws
or any agreement upon which the Indemnitee relies to establish the Indemnitee's
right to indemnification or advancement of expenses.

                 The Corporation agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the
independent legal counsel and to indemnify fully such independent legal counsel
against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities
and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the engagement of
such independent legal counsel pursuant hereto.

                 4.       Advances of Expenses.  Expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any Proceeding shall be paid by
the Corporation upon written request of the Indemnitee in advance of the final
disposition of such Proceeding if the Corporation has received an undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Annex B.  The obligation of the Corporation to advance expenses pursuant to
this Section 4 shall be subject to the condition that if, when and to the
extent a determination is made as provided under Section 3 hereof that the
Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified as provided therein, then
the Corporation shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnitee as
provided in Annex B for all amounts theretofore paid in advance; provided,
however, that if Indemnitee has commenced legal proceedings in a court of
competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that the Indemnitee should be
indemnified under applicable law, any determination made pursuant to this
Agreement that the Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under
applicable law shall not be binding and the Indemnitee shall not be required to
reimburse the Corporation for any advances hereunder until a final judicial
determination is





                                       6
<PAGE>   7
made with respect thereto (as to which all appeals therefrom have been
exhausted).

                 In any event, the obligation of the Indemnitee to reimburse
the Corporation for advances shall be unsecured and no interest will be charged
thereon.

                 5.       Procedure for Making Demand.

                 (a)      Payments for any indemnification to which the
Indemnitee is entitled pursuant to Section 1 hereof shall be made by the
Corporation no later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of a written
demand made by the Indemnitee as provided in Section 3 hereof.

                 (b)      Payments of expenses to which the Indemnitee is
entitled pursuant to Section 2 hereof shall be made by the Corporation no later
than ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of the written demand for
payment from the Indemnitee.

                 (c)      Advancement of expenses to the extent provided by
Section 4 hereof shall be made by the Corporation no later than thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Corporation of the written undertaking referred to in
Section 4 hereof.

                 (d)      The right to indemnification or advances hereunder
shall be enforceable by each Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction
if the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders improperly
denies the claim, in whole or in part or if indemnification or advancement of
expenses is not made within the time specified herein.  In any such event, or
if there has been no determination under Section 3, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to commence litigation in any such court in the States of Delaware or
New York or the state(s) of director's residence or employment, having subject
matter jurisdiction thereof, and in which venue is proper, seeking an initial
determination by the court or challenging any such determination under this
Agreement or any aspect thereof, and the Corporation hereby consents to service
of process and to appear in any such proceeding.  Any determination as to the
right to indemnification, including expense reimbursement, hereunder shall
otherwise be conclusive and binding on the Corporation and the Indemnitee.

                 (e)      The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee
against any and all expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals'
fees and other





                                       7
<PAGE>   8
out-of-pocket expenses) and, if requested by the Indemnitee, shall, within ten
(10) days of such request, advance such expenses to Director which are incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with any claim asserted against or action
brought by the Indemnitee for (i) indemnification hereunder or advance payment
of expenses by the Corporation under this Agreement (or the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws now or hereafter in effect) and/or (ii)
recovery under any director and officer liability insurance policies maintained
by the Corporation, regardless of whether the Indemnitee ultimately is
determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or
insurance recovery, as the case may be.

                 6.       Subrogation.  In the event of payment under this
Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to
all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

                 7.       Effect of Changes in Law or Corporate Documents.  No
change in the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the
Delaware General Corporation Law subsequent to the date first above written
shall have the effect of limiting or eliminating the indemnification available
under this Agreement as to any act, omission or capacity for which this
Agreement provides indemnification at the time of such act, omission or
capacity.  If any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable
law, statute or rule expands the power of the Corporation to indemnify the
Indemnitee, such change shall be within the purview of the Indemnitee's rights
and the Corporation's obligations under this Agreement.  If any change in
applicable law, statute or rule narrows the right of the Corporation to
indemnify the Indemnitee, such change, except to the extent otherwise required
by law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect
on this Agreement or the parties' rights or obligations hereunder.

                 8.       Definition of "Corporation."  For purposes of this
Agreement, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting or surviving corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if
its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person
who is





                                       8
<PAGE>   9
or was a director of such constituent corporation after the Effective Date or
is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise after the Effective
Date, shall stand in the same position under this Agreement with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

                 9.       Partial Indemnity.  If the Indemnitee is entitled
under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion thereof
to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

                 10.      Security for Obligations of the Corporation; Trust
Fund.  The Corporation and the Indemnitee agree that in light of the recent
history of the Corporation and its emergence from reorganization proceedings
under the Code, as well as the terms of the insurance policies obtained by the
Corporation with respect to director and officer liability coverage, it is
appropriate that the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement
be secured in a manner satisfactory to the Indemnitee.  Consequently, as
promptly as practicable, but not later than October 1, 1993, Zale Delaware,
Inc. and the Corporation will establish a Trust Fund ("Fund") pursuant to a
Trust Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, which
shall provide for the deposit by Zale Delaware, Inc. and the Corporation as the
Fund, for the benefit of the Indemnitee and any other directors from time to
time of Zale Delaware, Inc. and the Corporation (collectively, the
"Beneficiaries"), of at least $500,000 plus if such amount is less than
$1,000,000 an additional pro rata amount for each of the next ten months
thereafter until the Fund aggregates $1,000,000 (the "Minimum Balance") in the
aggregate for Zale Delaware, Inc. and the Corporation, in cash or cash
equivalents or, at the Corporation's option with the consent of a majority of
the Beneficiaries, a standby letter of credit from The First National Bank of
Boston or other institution acceptable to a majority of the Beneficiaries;
provided that the form of any such standby letter must be satisfactory to each
Indemnitee.  Initially, the terms of the Trust Agreement shall provide, among
other things, that (i) the Trust Fund shall be used, when





                                       9
<PAGE>   10
requested by any Beneficiary, to satisfy the obligations of the Corporation
pursuant to this Agreement and other like agreements of Zale Delaware, Inc. and
the Corporation with Beneficiaries with respect to any and all payments
provided for hereunder or thereunder; (ii) the Fund shall not be revoked or the
principal thereof invaded for any other purpose without the written consent of
the Indemnitee; (iii) the Fund shall continue to be funded by Zale Delaware,
Inc. and the Corporation, jointly and severally, as necessary to maintain the
Minimum Balance, once established; and (iv) the Trustee under the Trust
Agreement shall be chosen by a majority of the Beneficiaries.  Nothing in the
Trust Agreement shall relieve the Corporation of any of its obligations under
this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be amended as necessary to be
consistent with the terms of the Trust Agreement as ultimately executed.

                 11.      Successors.  The indemnification and advancement of
expenses and other rights granted and obligations undertaken pursuant to this
Agreement shall continue after the Indemnitee has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent as referred to in clause (i) of Section 1(a) hereof
and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Corporation and
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives of the Indemnitee and the Corporation.

                 12.      Contract Rights Not Exclusive.  The contract rights
conferred by this Agreement shall be in addition to, but not exclusive of, any
other right which the Indemnitee may have or may hereafter acquire under any
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, any
agreement by the vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the
Corporation or otherwise, both as to action in the Indemnitee's official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  The
rights granted in this Agreement supersede any similar right granted under any
previous Agreement between the Corporation and the Indemnitee with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

                 13.      The Indemnitee's Obligations.  The Indemnitee shall

Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and the Person named
on Annex A hereto, a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the
"Indemnitee").

                 WHEREAS, the Indemnitee has become involved in investigations,
claims, actions, suits or proceedings (collectively, "Proceedings") which have
arisen as a result of the Indemnitee's service to the Corporation;

                 WHEREAS, the Indemnitee desires that the Corporation pay any
and all expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and court
costs) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the
Indemnitee's behalf in defending or investigating any such Proceedings and that
such payment be made in advance of the final disposition of such Proceedings to
the extent that the Indemnitee has not been previously reimbursed by insurance;

                 WHEREAS, the Corporation is willing to make such payments but,
in accordance with Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, the Corporation may make such payments only if it receives an
undertaking to repay from the Indemnitee; and

                 WHEREAS, the Indemnitee is willing to give such an undertaking.

                 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, the Corporation and the Indemnitee
agree as follows:

                 1.       In regard to any advance payments made by the
Corporation to the Indemnitee pursuant to the terms of the Indemnification
Agreement dated as of July 21, 1993, between the Corporation and the Indemnitee
(the "Indemnification Agreement") or pursuant to Article Seventh of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Indemnitee hereby
undertakes and agrees to repay to the Corporation any and all amounts so paid
promptly and in any event within thirty (30) days after the disposition,
including exhaustion of all appeals therefrom of any litigation or threatened
litigation on account of which payments were made if it is determined that the
Indemnitee

is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement,
the Certificate of Incorporation or the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

                 2.       This Agreement shall not affect in any manner the
rights which the Indemnitee may have against the Corporation, any insurer or
any other person to seek indemnification for or reimbursement of any expenses
referred to herein or any judgment which may be rendered in any litigation or
proceeding.

                 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
as of the day and year first written above.

1.0   BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

Both Parties desire to continue their current relationship, to extend this
Agreement, and to migrate from its current information services configuration
to a downleveled configuration in support of Zale's current and future business
needs.  The Parties are entering Amendment #1 for the purpose of achieving
these goals.

Thus, this Amendment #1:
1)    extends the Term to July 31, 1997, while simultaneously granting Zale the
      right to terminate for convenience on or after August 1, 1996; and
2)    provides for ISSC and Zale to progressively migrate to a downleveled
      configuration of Host CPU, DASD, Tape Utilization, and Print Utilization
      in two stages, one effective August 1994 and the second effective August
      1995; and
3)    concurrently reduces Zale's Annual Services Charges; eliminates ARCs and
      RRCs for CPU, DASD, Tape Utilization, and Print Utilization; and provides
      for ISSC's agreement to pass through to Zale certain additional cost
      savings on selected hardware and software.

This Amendment #1 reflects changes to the base Agreement as follows:
1)    underscored text is new text added by this Amendment; and
2)    text marked with overstrikes is deleted from the base Agreement by this
      Amendment; and 
3)    text without underscores or overstrikes is either already agreed upon in 
      the base Agreement or explanatory information for this Amendment.

2.0   DEFINITIONS, DOCUMENTS AND TERMS

2.3   Associated Contract Documents

b)    Amend Schedule E, Section (V) (D), as follows:

      monitoring of systems to measure, analyze and report on the best approach
      to attain committed Performance Standards and Minimum Service Levels
      ("Service Level Standards").  If at any time ISSC believes Zale's
      migration to a downleveled configuration may impact ISSC's ability to
      meet or exceed the Service Level Standards, ISSC will promptly notify
      Zale of the situation and discuss what course of action may alleviate
      such impact.  Zale shall have the option to: 
      1)   implement, or request ISSC to implement subject to Section 6.5 
           ("New Services"), such course(s) of action to allow ISSC to meet or 
           exceed the existing Service Level Standard(s); and/or 
      2)   agree with ISSC on new Service Level Standard(s) by either 
           benchmarking ISSC's Services with the downleveled configuration for 
           an appropriate period of time or by discussion and mutual agreement; 
           and/or 
      3)   relieve ISSC of the affected Service Level Standard(s) and the 
           obligation to pay Performance Credits, if any, to the extent, and 
           for the period of time during which, ISSC's ability to meet such 
           Service Level Standard(s) is affected by the migration to the 
           downleveled configuration or by Zale's decision not to implement the 
           course(s) of action.

c)    Amend Schedule J as follows:

      i)   Replace the first paragraph on page 1 of Schedule J with the

      a.   Host CPU Utilization;
      b.   Allocated DASD;
      c.   Tape Utilization; and
      d.   Print Utilization;

With respect to these categories, resource utilization during the planned
migration to the downleveled configuration will be within the Baselines set
forth in the Supplement, and such utilization is included within the Annual
Services Charge.  Additional utilization beyond such Baselines will be provided
subject to Section 6 ("Charges and Expenses") and the Supplement.

      ii)  Revise the first sentence in section 1, page 1 of Schedule J as
           follows: As of August 1, 1994, ISSC will measure and track RUs in

       iv) Revise the first sentence of section (2) on page 4 of Schedule J as 
           follows:

date of Amendment #1, ISSC will calculate ARCs and RRCs for Network and
Microfiche utilization as follows.

                          AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE

         This Agreement and General Release ("Agreement") is made and entered
into by and between Zale Corporation and Dolph Simon.

                                   DEFINITIONS

         As used throughout this Agreement and General Release:

         1.      "Executive" refers to Dolph Simon, his heirs, executors, 
administrators, agents, successors, assigns and dependents.

         2.      "Zale" refers to Zale Corporation, its past and present
parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and divisions, and each of their respective
past and present officers, directors, agents, employees, successors and assigns.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, Executive has been employed by Zale as General Counsel.

         WHEREAS, Executive's employment with Zale is being terminated in
accordance with the attached letter ("Letter"); and

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to settle fully any and all claims and
controversies arising out of the employment relationship between Executive and
Zale and the termination thereof;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and in the Letter, and intending to be and being legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         1.      Executive represents that he does not have any claim, action or
 proceeding pending against Zale.

         2.      Except as necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement and
General Release and the Letter, and in exchange for and in consideration of the
promises, covenants and agreements set forth herein, Executive hereby releases
Zale from any and all manner of claims, demands, causes of action, obligations,
damages, or liabilities whatsoever of every kind and nature, at law or in
equity, known or unknown, and whether or not discoverable, which he has or may
have for any period prior to and including the date of the execution of this
Agreement and General Release, including, but not limited to, any claim of
defamation, wrongful discharge, breach of an express or implied contract, and
claims of discrimination under the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967
and all other federal, state and local laws, and any claim for attorneys' fees
or costs.
<PAGE>   6

         3.      Executive promises never to file or participate in a lawsuit,
arbitration or other legal proceeding asserting any claims that are released
pursuant to this Agreement and General Release. If Executive breaches his
promise and files or participates in a legal proceeding based on claims he has
released, he agrees to pay for all costs incurred by Zale, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, in defending against his claim.

                 Zale asserts that it does not have any present knowledge of a
factual basis for, and has no present intention of filing, a lawsuit or other
legal proceeding against you.

         4.      The parties (and persons acting on their behalf) shall not
disclose, and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent the disclosure, to
any person or entity the existence, terms and/or subject matter of this
Agreement and General Release, except as required by law. This provision does
not prohibit Executive from providing this information to his spouse or to his
attorneys or accountants for purposes of obtaining legal, tax or financial
advice or as otherwise required by law.

         5.      On or before June 15, 1995, Executive shall return to Zale all
of Zale's property in his possession, custody or control; provided, however,
that (1) Executive may have the use of his company car until August 1, 1995.

         6.      In executing this Agreement and General Release, neither Zale
nor Executive is admitting any liability or wrongdoing, and the considerations
exchanged herein do not constitute an admission of any liability, error,
contract violation, or violation of any federal, state, or local law or
regulation.

         7.      This Agreement and General Release shall be binding upon and 
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

         8. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision or provisions of
this Agreement and General Release shall not render any other provision or
provisions hereof unenforceable or invalid.

         9.      This Agreement and General Release and the accompanying Letter
constitute the entire agreement between the parties and cannot be altered except
in a writing signed by the parties. The parties acknowledge that they entered
into this Agreement and General Release voluntarily, that they fully understand
all of its provisions, and that no representations were made to induce execution
of this Agreement and General Release which are not expressly contained herein.

         10.     The parties agree that any disputes concerning the 
interpretation or application of the Agreement and General Release shall be
governed by Texas Law in a state or federal court located in Texas, without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

         11.     Executive has been afforded an opportunity to take at least
twenty-one (21) days to consider this Agreement and General Release and has been
advised to consult with the attorneys of his choice prior to executing this
Agreement and General Release. The parties understand and acknowledge that
Executive will have a period of seven (7) calendar days
<PAGE>   7

following his execution of this Agreement and General Release in which to revoke
his consent, and that the Agreement and General Release will not become
effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement and
General Release on the dates indicated below.

                                ZALE CORPORATION
                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
"Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
Company (and the related notes thereto) included elsewhere in this Annual
Report. The "Selected Financial Data" presented below are derived from the
audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, unless otherwise
indicated.

GENERAL

         On July 30, 1993, the Company completed a comprehensive restructuring
of its debt through implementation of its Plan of Reorganization as confirmed on
May 20, 1993 by the Bankruptcy Court. As a result of the restructuring
transaction and the implementation of fresh-start financial reporting, the
Company's results of operations subsequent to July 31, 1993 are not comparable
to results of operations for prior periods. The most significant effects of
fresh-start financial reporting on results of operations are the reduction in
amortization and depreciation expense from the write-off of substantially all
the Company's fixed assets and the amortization of the "Excess of Revalued Net
Assets Over Stockholders' Investment." See the note to the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company entitled "REORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION" included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on
consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and implementation of fresh-start
financial reporting.

         On December 13, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized
the change in the Company's fiscal year end to July 31. Such change was
effective as of April 1, 1994. To facilitate a comparison of the Company's
operating performance for the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, the four
months ended July 31, 1993 and the year ended March 31, 1993, the following
table includes a presentation of historical income statement data for twelve
months ended July 31, 1993. This includes the four month period ended July 31,
1993 and the eight months ended March 31, 1993. This twelve month period ended
July 31, 1993 will be referred to as "pro forma year ended July 31, 1993" and is
unaudited.

OPERATING RESULTS -- YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED JULY 31,
1994

         Net Sales

         Net Sales for the year ended July 31, 1995 increased by $115.8 million
to $1,036.1 million, a 12.6 percent increase compared to the previous year. The
increase is primarily the result of new management's implementation of a key
item merchandising strategy, product-focused marketing and improved execution in
the stores. Sales for stores open for comparable periods increased by
approximately 12.8 percent.

         Costs and Expenses

         Cost of Sales was 50.6 percent and 50.0 percent of sales for the years
ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The percentage increase resulted
primarily from higher markdowns during the last half of the year for clearance
of discontinued merchandise.

         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, which increased by $32.4
million, were 41.9 percent and 43.7 percent of sales for the years ended July
31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Store expenses decreased by 1.7 percent of
sales as store occupancy costs and payroll increased at a lower rate than sales.
Promotional expenditures decreased as both a percentage of sales and in total
dollars. Corporate expenses decreased by 1.2 percent of sales principally as a
result of lower costs for management information systems and insurance. These
improvements were offset by a decrease in net credit income principally from
reduced finance charge income on a lower average receivables portfolio in
relation to the prior year. The reduction in the average receivables portfolio
resulted from the decrease of accounts from significant store closings in 1992
and 1993, coupled with faster cash collections of customer balances than in the
prior year.

Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense
(credit) were $78.0 million and $58.5 million for the years ended July 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively, an increase of 33.4 percent.

         Depreciation and Amortization Expense increased by $4.8 million.
Amortization of the Excess of Revalued Net Assets Over Stockholders' Investment
was $5.9 million in both periods. However, depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment increased from $1.4 million to $6.2 million as new assets
have been purchased since the fresh-start reporting write-off of substantially
all fixed assets of the Company at July 31, 1993.

         Interest

         Interest Expense, Net was $29.8 million and $28.1 million for the years
ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The increase was principally due to
the refinancing of the Receivables Securitization Facility in July 1994 at a
higher amount, partially offset by an increase in investment income. The current
year also includes $1.2 million of interest income on funds escrowed for
bankruptcy matters which are not expected to continue at this level.

         Income Taxes

         Income Taxes for the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994 were $16.4
million and $10.6 million, respectively, reflecting an effective tax rate of
34.2 percent and 32.9 percent, respectively. As a result of guidelines regarding
accounting for income taxes of companies utilizing Fresh-Start reporting, the
Company reports earnings on a fully-taxed basis even though it does not expect
to pay any significant income taxes for the near future. As of July 31, 1995,
the Company had a tax net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward (after
limitations) of approximately $378 million. The Company will be able to offset
taxes that would ordinarily be paid this year and in future years through
utilization of this tax NOL.

         As the Company develops a longer-term earnings record, it may determine
that a portion of the valuation reserve on the Company's deferred tax asset will
not be required as such asset will more likely than not be realizable. Any
reduction in the valuation reserve will increase Additional Paid-in Capital
directly.

OPERATING RESULTS -- YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 1994 COMPARED TO PRO FORMA YEAR ENDED
JULY 31, 1993

         Net Sales

         Net Sales for the year ended July 31, 1994 decreased by $36.1 million
or 3.8 percent when compared with the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993. The
significant decrease in Net Sales in fiscal 1994 is primarily the result of
closing approximately 175 locations in January through March 1993 as part of the
Company's operational restructuring.

         Costs and Expenses

         Cost of Sales was 50.0 percent of sales for fiscal year 1994 and 55.7
percent of sales for the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993. A reserve against
merchandise inventory of approximately $43.0 million was provided in Cost of
Sales during the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993 for estimated shrinkage,
markdowns, damage or other loss in value caused by closing approximately 175
locations. Excluding the reserve provision, Cost of Sales as a percentage of
sales was 51.2 percent. The primary reason for the 1.2 percent decrease in Cost
of Sales was a higher initial merchandise margin partially offset by increased
markdowns.

         Selling, General and Administrative Expenses as a percentage of sales
were 43.7 percent for fiscal year 1994 and 42.0 percent for the pro forma year
ended July 31, 1993. The percentage increase in fiscal 1994 resulted primarily
from higher promotional and employee benefit costs incurred during the year
relative to sales.

         Depreciation and Amortization Expense decreased by $30.8 million
principally due to the fresh-start reporting write-off of substantially all
fixed assets of the Company at July 31, 1993.

         Unusual Items

         The unusual items in the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993 relate to
provisions made to reduce the value of certain non-operating assets, including
properties held for sale and a large diamond held for investment, to their
estimated net realizable values. A provision was also made for the valuation of
customer receivables. See the note to the Consolidated Financial Statements
"UNUSUAL ITEMS -- PROVISIONS FOR VALUATION OF ASSETS."

         Reorganization and Restructure Costs

         Reorganization and Restructure Costs are segregated from normal
operations in the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993 Consolidated Statement of
Operations and reflect the costs incurred by the Company in the implementation
of its operational and financial restructuring plan as well as costs related
directly to the bankruptcy filing.

         Interest

         Interest Expense, Net was $28.1 million for fiscal year 1994 and $23.5
million for the pro forma year ended July 31, 1993. The increase in fiscal 1994
primarily represents interest incurred on the 11% $60.0 million Second Priority
Senior Secured Notes which were issued in conjunction with the Company's
emergence from bankruptcy and a reduction in interest income due to lower
average balances in short-term investments as a result of payment of bankruptcy
obligations in July 1993.

         Income Taxes

         Income Taxes for the year ended July 31, 1994 were $10.6 million. An
income tax benefit was not provided in the period ended July 31, 1993 because
all operating losses would have to be carried forward to future years and the
realization of a tax benefit for those losses was not assured. As a result of
guidelines regarding accounting for income taxes of companies utilizing
Fresh-Start reporting, the Company reports earnings on a fully-taxed basis even
though it does not expect to pay any significant income taxes for the near
future. The Company will be able to offset taxes that would ordinarily be paid
this year and in future years through utilization of the NOL.

OPERATING RESULTS --- FOUR MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 1993

         Net Sales for the four months ended July 31, 1993 were $244.5 million.
Cost of Sales was 52.1 percent of sales and Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses were 49.0 percent of sales for the four month period ended July 31,
1993. Due to the seasonality of the business, these results were not
representative of results expected for a full year. Reorganization and
Restructure Costs are segregated from normal operations in the Four Months Ended
July 31, 1993 Consolidated Statement of Operations and primarily represent
professional fees incurred in conjunction with the Chapter 11 reorganization.
Reorganization and Restructure Costs, the Fresh-Start Revaluation and Gain on
Debt Discharge all relate to the Company's reorganization under Chapter 11 and
are described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
"REORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" and "REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURE
COSTS."

OPERATING RESULTS --- YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1993

         Net Sales for the year ended March 31, 1993 were $980.8 million. Cost
of Sales was 54.5 percent of sales for the year ended March 31, 1993. A reserve
against merchandise inventory of approximately $43.0 million was provided in
Cost of Sales for estimated shrinkage, markdowns, damage or other loss in value
caused by closing approximately 175 locations. Excluding the reserve provision,
Cost of Sales as a percentage of sales was 50.1 percent. Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses were 42.6 percent of sales for the year ended March 31,
1993.

         The unusual items in the year ended March 31, 1993 relate to provisions
made to reduce the value of certain non-operating assets, including properties
held for sale and a large diamond held for investment, to their estimated net
realizable values. A provision was also made for the valuation of customer
receivables. See the note to the Consolidated Financial Statements "UNUSUAL
ITEMS -- PROVISIONS FOR VALUATION OF ASSETS."

         Reorganization and Restructure Costs are segregated from normal
operations in the March 31, 1993 Consolidated Statement of Operations and
reflect the costs incurred by the Company in the implementation of its
operational and financial restructuring plan as well as costs related directly
to the bankruptcy filing. The major components are described in the notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements "REORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION" and
"REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURE COSTS."

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         The Company's cash requirements consist principally of funding
inventory and receivables growth, capital expenditures primarily for renovations
and new store growth, and debt service. As of July 31, 1995, the Company had
cash and cash equivalents of $154.9 million, including $51.4 million restricted
primarily by the collateral requirements under the Receivables Securitization
Facility. The retail jewelry business is highly seasonal, with a significant
proportion of sales and operating income being generated in November and
December of each year. Approximately 41.2 percent and 40.1 percent of the
Company's annual sales were made during the three months ended January 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively, which includes the Christmas selling season. The
Company's working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing
substantially during the fall season as a result of higher planned seasonal
inventory levels.

         Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company entered into a three-year
revolving credit and gold consignment agreement (the "Working Capital
Facility"). See the note to the Consolidated Financial Statements "CREDIT
ARRANGEMENTS". At July 31, 1995 and 1994, there were no loans outstanding under
the Working Capital Facility and no borrowings were made during the current year
under this facility. There were approximately $7.3 million and $5.9 million of
letters of credit outstanding at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

         On August 11, 1995, Zale Corporation ("Zale") and Zale Delaware, Inc.
("ZDel"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zale, (the "Borrowers") entered into a
new three-year revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement")
which provides for revolving credit loans in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0
million, with a $30.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. At no time may the
total amount of revolving credit loans outstanding exceed a defined borrowing
base (based on a fixed percentage of eligible inventory, as defined). See the
note to the Consolidated Financial Statements "CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS".

                                       5

         In July 1994, Zale Funding Trust ("ZFT"), a limited purpose Delaware
business trust and wholly-owned by ZDel, was formed to finance customer accounts
receivable. ZFT established an accounts receivable securitization facility (the
"ZFT Securitization"), pursuant to which it issued approximately $380.6 million,
net of discount, aggregate principal amount of Receivables Backed Notes ("ZFT
Receivables Notes"). The ZFT Receivables Notes are secured by a lien on all
customer accounts receivable. See the note to the Consolidated Financial
Statements "LONG-TERM DEBT".

         When the Company refinanced its accounts receivable securitization
program in July 1994, it increased liquidity under the securitization program by
$50 million to $90 million dependent on seasonal balances of customer
receivables. A substantial portion of this increased liquidity is being used in
the capital expenditure program over a three-year period which began in August
1994. It also allowed the Company to redeem the $60.0 million Second Priority
Senior Secured Notes in September 1995. As part of the Company's business
strategy, it has embarked on a store remodeling and refurbishment program. This
program will enable the Company to enhance its stores in certain key markets
relative to its competition. Additionally, the Company plans significant
upgrades to its management information systems over the next two years. The
Company anticipates spending approximately $50.0 million on capital expenditures
in fiscal 1996. Capital expenditures are typically scheduled for the late spring
through early fall in order to have new or renovated stores ready for the
Christmas selling season. During the year ended July 31, 1995, the Company made
approximately $42.3 million in capital expenditures principally to enhance the
appearance of 411 stores. The Company intends to open 250 new locations over the
next three years.

         The Company had approximately $60.0 million of Second Priority Senior
Secured Notes due 2000 bearing interest at 11.0 percent per annum that were
issued upon exit from bankruptcy. These notes were redeemed on September 11,
1995 utilizing cash on hand. Upon redemption, the Company paid an early
redemption premium and other costs associated with the redemption of
approximately $1.7 million. An extraordinary item of $1.0 million, net of an
income tax benefit of $0.7 million, will be recorded in the first quarter of
fiscal year 1996. See the note to the Consolidated Financial Statements
"LONG-TERM DEBT".

         On August 31, 1995, Zale redeemed the Series B Warrants and acquired
all Swarovski International Holding, A.G. ("Swarovski") rights, title and
interest under the warrant agreement and paid $9.3 million to Swarovski in
consideration of the redemption. As a result of this, the Series B Warrants were
cancelled and are no longer outstanding. See the note to the Consolidated
Financial Statements "CAPITAL STOCK".

         Management believes that operating cash flow, amounts available under
the Revolving Credit Agreement and amounts available under the Receivables
Securitization Facility should be sufficient to fund the Company's operating,
debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.

INFLATION

         In management's opinion, changes in net sales and earnings (loss)
before income taxes that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have
not been material.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT

To the Stockholders of Zale Corporation:

The integrity and consistency of the financial statements and financial
statement schedules of Zale Corporation (the "Company"), which were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are the responsibility
of management and properly include some amounts that are based upon estimates
and judgments.

The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which is
supported by a program of internal audits with appropriate management follow-up
action, to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Company's
assets are protected and transactions are properly recorded. Additionally, the
integrity of the financial accounting system is based on careful selection and
training of qualified personnel, organizational arrangements which provide for
appropriate division of responsibilities and communication of established
written policies and procedures.

The financial statements of the Company have been audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP, independent public accountants. Their reports express their opinions as to
the fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial statements and
are based upon their independent audit conducted in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.

The Audit Committee, composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically
with the independent public accountants, the internal auditors and
representatives of management to discuss auditing and financial reporting
matters. In addition, the independent public accountants meet periodically with
the Audit Committee without management representatives present and have free
access to the Audit Committee at any time. The Audit Committee is responsible
for recommending to the Board of Directors the engagement of the independent
public accountants, which is subject to stockholder approval, and the general
oversight review of management's discharge of its responsibilities with respect
to the matters referred to above.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Zale Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zale Corporation
(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (subsequent to emergence from
bankruptcy - See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - "Reorganization
and Basis of Presentation" for discussion) as of July 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders'
investment for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Zale Corporation and
subsidiaries as of July 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Zale Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows, and stockholders' investment of Zale Corporation (a Delaware corporation)
and subsidiaries for the four month period ended July 31, 1993, and for the year
ended March 31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - "Reorganization
and Basis of Presentation," the Company emerged from bankruptcy on July 30,
1993, and adopted fresh-start reporting as of July 31, 1993.  The effects
resulting from the adoption of fresh-start reporting and the forgiveness of debt
have been reflected in the statement of operations for the four month period
ended July 31, 1993.  As such, results of operations through July 31, 1993, are
not comparable with results of operations subsequent to that date.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Zale
Corporation and subsidiaries for the four month period ended July 31, 1993, and
for the year ended March 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on April 1,
1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for post-retirement benefits
other than pensions and its method of accounting for income taxes.

ZALE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are those of Zale
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company").  The
classifications in use at July 31, 1995 have been applied to the financial
statements for July 31, 1994, July 31, 1993 and March 31, 1993.

         CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION.  On July 30, 1993 (the "Effective Date"),
Zale Corporation ("Zale") consummated its plan of reorganization under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan") and emerged from
bankruptcy.  The Plan terminated the former direct or indirect ownership of the
Company by Peoples Jewellers Limited and Swarovski International Holding, A.G.
("Swarovski").  See discussion of Swarovski warrants in the note to the
Consolidated Financial Statements "CAPITAL STOCK".  On the Effective Date, the
Company consolidated substantially all its retail operations into Zale Delaware,
Inc. ("ZDel"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zale.  ZDel, in turn, is
the parent company for several subsidiaries, including three that are engaged
primarily in providing credit insurance to credit customers of the Company.  The
Plan resulted in the elimination, through merger or liquidation, of seventeen
former Zale subsidiaries.

         In connection with the consummation of the Plan, the Company
distributed shares of its common stock to various classes of its pre-bankruptcy
creditors.  The Plan provided for, among other things, cash payments of
approximately $55.0 million (including $45.0 million paid in settlement of
certain senior and subordinated bondholder claims), the issuance of
approximately $60.0 million of secured notes and the distribution of the common
stock of reorganized Zale.

         The value of the cash, other assets, new debt and equity securities
distributed under the Plan was approximately $1.1 billion less in total value
than the allowed claims being settled, and the resulting gain was recorded as an
extraordinary item in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the four
month period ended July 31, 1993.

         FRESH-START REPORTING.  Pursuant to the guidance provided by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Statement of Position
90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy
Code" ("SOP 90-7"), the Company adopted fresh-start reporting as of the close of
business on July 31, 1993.  Fresh-start reporting resulted in a revaluation of
the Company's assets and liabilities as of the Effective Date to reflect
allocation of the reorganization value based upon the estimated fair market
values of those assets and liabilities.

         The resulting charge of $246.2 million from all fresh-start
adjustments, including the write-off of most  noncurrent assets, is presented as
"Fresh-Start Revaluation" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
four month period ended July 31, 1993.

         In accordance with fresh-start reporting guidelines, certain noncurrent
assets  were reduced to zero  because the fair value of the Company's assets
exceeded the fair value of its liability and stockholders' investment.  After
reducing the value of certain noncurrent assets to zero, the excess of the fair
value of the remaining assets over the fair value of liabilities and
stockholders' investment was recorded as a deferred credit, "Excess of Revalued
Net Assets Over Stockholders' Investment".  This balance is being amortized over
15 years.

         In connection with the adoption of fresh-start reporting, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS"), No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes", which had no impact on the statement of
operations.  See the note to the Consolidated Financial Statements "INCOME
TAXES" for further discussion.

         As a result of fresh-start reporting being used to reflect the fair
values of assets, liabilities and stockholders' investment of the reorganized
Company at July 31, 1993, the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
Consolidated Statements of  Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Investment for the fiscal years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, are
not comparable in certain material respects to such predecessor statements for
any prior periods.  The Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods after
July 31, 1993, are those of the reorganized entity.

ZALE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS consists principally of the retail sale of fine
jewelry merchandise.

         CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS include all subsidiaries including
ZDel and Zale Funding Trust ("ZFT"), a limited purpose Delaware business trust,
wholly-owned by ZDel and formed in July 1994 to finance customer accounts
receivable, and the Company's insurance subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

         CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS includes cash on hand, deposits in banks and
short-term marketable securities at varying interest rates with maturities of
three months or less.  The carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments.  At July 31, 1995, $51.4 million was
restricted of which $50.8 million was restricted based on collateral
requirements under the Receivables Securitization Facility.

         CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES are classified as current assets, including
amounts which are due after one year, in accordance with industry practices. The
allowance for doubtful accounts was $42.6 million and $42.7 million at July  31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.  Finance charge income of $79.3 million and $82.4
million for the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, $29.2 million
for the four months ended July 31, 1993 and $92.1 million for the year ended
March 31, 1993 has been reflected as a reduction of Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses.

         MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES are stated at the lower of cost or market,
which is determined primarily in accordance with the retail inventory method.
Substantially all inventories represent finished goods which are valued using
the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method.  Since July 31, 1993 the Company has
employed a methodology which provides better inventory turnover and
profitability information in order to identify and determine the appropriate
merchandising action for problem merchandise on a more timely basis and ensure
that such inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market.

         DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION are computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or remaining lease life.
Estimated useful lives of the assets range from three to forty years.  Original
cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the
accounts in the year assets become retired.  Gains or losses on dispositions of
property and equipment are included in operations in the year of disposal.
Computer software costs related to the development of major systems are
capitalized as incurred and are amortized over their useful lives.

         EXCESS OF REVALUED NET ASSETS OVER STOCKHOLDERS' INVESTMENT is being
amortized over fifteen years.  Amortization was $5.9 million for the years ended
July 31, 1995 and 1994.  Accumulated amortization was $11.8 million and $5.9
million at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

         STORE PREOPENING COSTS are charged to results of operations in the
period in which the store is opened.  Store closing costs are estimated and
recognized in the period in which the Company makes the decision that the store
will close.  Such costs include the present value of estimated future rentals
net of anticipated sublease income, loss on retirement of property and equipment
and other related occupancy costs.

         ADVERTISING EXPENSES are charged against operations when incurred.
Amounts charged against operations were $35.2 million and $36.9 million  for the
years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, $9.6 million for the four
months ended July 31, 1993 and $33.3 million for the year ended March 31, 1993.
The amounts of prepaid advertising at July 31, 1995 and 1994 are $1.8 million
and $0.3 million, respectively.

         YEAR-END CHANGE.  On December 13, 1993, the Board of Directors of the
Company authorized the change in the Company's fiscal year end to July 31.  Such
change was effective as of April 1, 1994.  The Company's determination to change
its fiscal year was based on several considerations.  By changing to a July 31
fiscal year end, the Company has established quarterly reporting periods that
are more consistent with other companies in the retail industry.  Additionally,
a July 31 year end coincides with the Company's emergence from bankruptcy
proceedings, thereby providing for greater comparability of historical financial
data in the future, and, it makes the Company's planning process more effective.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

         The Company uses the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of accounting
for inventory, which results in a matching of current costs with current
revenues.  The estimated cost of replacing the Company's inventories exceeds its
net LIFO cost by approximately $9.9 million and $7.1 million at July 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively.  Inventories on a first-in, first-out ("FIFO") basis
were $385.3 million and $408.1 million at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Company also maintained consigned inventory at its retail locations of
approximately $85.9 million and $111.4 million at July 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  This consigned inventory and related contingent obligation are
not reflected in the Company's financial statements.  At the time of sale, the
Company records the purchase liability in accounts payable and the related cost
of merchandise in Cost of Sales.

         Upon implementation of fresh-start reporting, the LIFO reserve as of
July 31, 1993 was eliminated for financial reporting purposes when merchandise
inventories were revalued at their fair market value.  The Company began
reporting, for financial reporting purposes, its LIFO inventories using a new
base period starting July 31, 1993.

         The Company's property and equipment consists of the following:

         POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  The Company provides medical and dental
insurance benefits for all eligible retirees and spouses with benefits to the
latter continuing after the death of the retiree for a maximum of thirty-six
months.  Substantially all of the Company's full-time employees, who were hired
on or before November 14, 1994,  become eligible for those benefits upon
reaching age 55 while working for the Company and having ten years of continuous
service.  The medical and dental benefits are provided under a single plan.  The
lifetime maximum on medical benefits is $500,000 up to the age of 65 and $50,000
thereafter.  These benefits include deductibles, retiree contributions and
co-insurance provisions that are assumed to grow with the health care cost trend
rate.

         Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions".
This standard requires that the costs of the postretirement benefits described
in the preceding paragraph be recognized in the financial statements over an
employee's active working career on an accrual basis.  In previous years, the
Company recognized the costs on a cash basis.

         The accumulated postretirement benefits obligation ("APBO"), which
represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee
service rendered as of July 31, 1995 and 1994 for the unfunded plan, include the
following components (amounts in thousands):

         The APBO of approximately $14.8 million was recognized as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change at April 1, 1993.  In addition to the one-time
cumulative effect adjustment, the annual expense relating to postretirement
benefits is approximately $2.5 million.  The components of such annual expense,
which are reflected in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, are as
follows (amounts in thousands):

</TABLE>

         This represents a $1.4 million increase over the annual expense that
would have been recognized under the old accounting method.

         The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the APBO at July
31, 1994 was 8.0 percent.  At July 31, 1995, this rate was lowered to 7.75
percent.  The weighted-average annual assumed rates of increase in the cost of
covered medical and dental benefits at July 31, 1994 are 14.0 percent and 8.75
percent, respectively, and are assumed to decrease gradually to 7.0 percent in
the year 2001 and remain at that level thereafter.  At July 31, 1995, the
initial medical and dental trend rates are 13.0 percent and 8.5 percent,
respectively, and are assumed to gradually decrease to 6.0 percent in the year
2003.  The effect of a one percent increase in the health care cost trend rate
on the APBO and the net periodic expense would be an increase of approximately
$1.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

         WORKING CAPITAL FINANCING.  On July 30, 1993, ZDel, as borrower, and
Zale and certain of ZDel's subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a
three-year revolving credit and gold consignment agreement (the "Working Capital
Facility").  The Working Capital Facility provided for (a) revolving credit
loans in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million, with a $20.0 million
sublimit for letters of credit and (b) loans or advances ("Gold Loans") in an
aggregate amount of up to $50.0 million under a gold consignment facility.  At
July 31, 1995 and 1994, there were no loans outstanding under the Working
Capital Facility and no borrowings were made during the current year under this
facility.  There were approximately $7.3 million and $5.9 million of letters of
credit outstanding at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

         On August 11, 1995, Zale and ZDel (the "Borrowers") entered into a new
three-year revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving Credit Agreement") which
provides for revolving credit loans in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0
million, with a $30.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.  At no time may
the total amount of revolving credit loans outstanding exceed a defined
borrowing base (based on a fixed percentage of eligible inventory, as defined). 

         The Borrowers' obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are
primarily secured by a first lien on and security interest in all inventory
(excluding inventory on consignment).

         The revolving credit loans bear interest at floating rates, currently
LIBOR  +  2.0 percent or the agent's adjusted base rate + 0.75 percent, at the
Borrowers' option, and can be adjusted based on certain future performance
levels attained by the Borrowers.  The Borrowers incur letter of credit fees and
also pay a commitment fee of 3/8 percent per annum on the preceding month's
unused Revolving Credit Agreement commitment.  The Borrowers may repay the
revolving credit loans at any time without penalty.

         The Revolving Credit Agreement  contains certain restrictive covenants,
which, among other things, keeps within certain limits the Borrowers ability to
pay dividends and make other restricted payments, incur additional indebtedness,
engage in certain transactions with affiliates, incur liens, make investments
and sell assets.  The Revolving Credit Agreement also requires the Borrowers to
maintain certain financial ratios and specified levels of net worth.

         RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION FACILITIES.   In November 1992, Diamond
Funding Corp. ("DFC") established an accounts receivable securitization facility
(the "DFC Securitization") pursuant to which it issued approximately $284.6
million, net of discount, aggregate principal amount of 6.35 percent Receivables
Backed Notes ("DFC Receivables Notes").  The proceeds from the DFC Receivables
Notes were used to buy the revolving credit card accounts receivable of ZDel and
other Zale affiliates.

         The Company refinanced its DFC Receivables Notes effective July 15,
1994 through a new securitization program discussed below.  Upon consummation of
the new securitization program, the DFC Receivables Notes were redeemed.  The
Company was required to pay a special redemption premium in the amount of
approximately $2.6 million upon early redemption of the DFC Receivables Notes.
This amount, net of an income tax benefit of $1.0 million, has been classified
as an extraordinary item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as of July
31, 1994.

LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)

         In connection with the refinancing, ZFT established an accounts
receivable securitization facility (the "ZFT Securitization"), pursuant to which
it issued approximately $380.6 million, net of discount, aggregate principal
amount of Receivables Backed Notes ("ZFT Receivables Notes").  The proceeds from
the ZFT Receivables Notes were used to buy the revolving credit card accounts
receivable of DFC, ZDel and other affiliates.  Collections from those
receivables are used in part to pay interest on the ZFT Receivables Notes and to
purchase daily ZDel's customer accounts receivable.  The ZFT Receivables Notes
are secured by a lien on all customer accounts receivable and are nonrecourse
with regard to Zale and Zdel.

         The ZFT Receivables Notes bear interest at the following rates, payable
monthly in arrears (amounts in thousands):

</TABLE>

         The effective interest rate, including amortization of debt issuance
costs, will approximate 7.6 percent based on the current LIBOR rate of 6.0
percent, with a maximum of 8.1 percent.

         Jewelers Financial Services, Inc. (the "Servicer"), a subsidiary of
ZDel, is the servicing entity for the collection of the customer accounts
receivable and its servicing obligations are guaranteed by ZDel.

         The ZFT Receivables Notes will be subject to redemption at the option
of ZFT in whole but not in part, on the Scheduled Redemption Date of July 15,
1999 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount of the ZFT
Receivables Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the
applicable interest rates.   If ZFT has not given notice by June 15, 1999 that
it will redeem the ZFT Receivables Notes in full on the scheduled payment date
occurring in July 1999, the Servicer will promptly solicit bids for the purchase
of all or a portion of the receivables.  If the Servicer is unable to sell the
receivables for a price such that the proceeds of such sale, together with other
available funds, is sufficient to pay in full the outstanding principal amount
of the ZFT Receivables Notes and interest thereon to the Scheduled Redemption
Date, the ZFT Receivables Notes will remain outstanding and will begin
amortizing based on collections of customer accounts receivable beginning in
August 1999.

         The ZFT Securitization imposes certain reporting obligations on the
Company and limits ZFT's ability, among other things, to grant liens, incur
certain indebtedness, or enter into other lines of business.  Additionally,
under certain conditions as defined, including among other things, failure to
pay principal or interest when due, failure to cure a borrowing base deficiency
and breach of any covenant that is not cured, the ZFT Securitization is subject
to an early amortization whereby the ZFT Receivables Notes may be declared due
and payable immediately.  The restricted cash balance shown on the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows as of July 31, 1995 and 1994 primarily represents the
restricted cash of ZFT which is based on the relationship between the ZFT
Receivables Notes outstanding and gross accounts receivable as of July 31, 1995
and 1994.

         11.0 PERCENT SECOND PRIORITY SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2000.  The 11.0
Percent Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2000 (the "Notes") were issued
by ZDel under an indenture dated as of July 30, 1993 among ZDel, as issuer,
Zale, as guarantor and IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company, as trustee.  At July
31, 1995 and 1994, there was approximately $60.0 million principal amount of
Notes outstanding. The Notes were guaranteed by Zale and were secured by second
liens on substantially all the assets of Zale and ZDel.

         The terms of the new Revolving Credit Agreement allowed the Company to
redeem the Notes on September 11, 1995 utilizing cash on hand.  The Notes were
optionally redeemable by ZDel at a redemption price equal to 102 percent of
their principal amount together with accrued interest to the redemption date.
Upon redemption, the Company paid an early redemption premium and other costs
associated with the redemption of approximately $1.7 million.  An extraordinary
item of $1.0 million, net of an income tax benefit of $0.7 million, will be
recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 1996.

         CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION.  The Company entered into a capital lease
effective April 1, 1993 for certain store point-of-sale equipment in the amount
of approximately $10.3 million with a borrowing rate of 11.0 percent.  The
related debt is payable monthly over a three-year period.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

         The Company rents most of its retail space under leases that generally
range from five to fifteen years and may contain minimum rent escalations and
renewal options for consecutive one-to-five year periods.  In addition, the
corporate headquarters is leased under a five-year agreement that began on
August 1, 1992 after the original lease agreement was rejected in the
reorganization process.  All existing real estate leases are treated as
operating leases.  Sublease rental income under noncancellable leases is not
material.

         Rent expense, exclusive of lease rejection provisions which are
recorded in Reorganization and Restructure Costs in the year ended March 31,

         Contingent rentals paid to lessors of certain store facilities are
determined principally on the basis of a percentage of sales in excess of
contractual limits.

         Future minimum rent commitments as of July 31, 1995, for all
noncancellable leases of ongoing operations were as follows: 1996 - $54.3
million; 1997 - $48.2 million; 1998 - $39.4 million; 1999 - $33.2 million; 2000
- - $28.1 million; thereafter - $81.6 million; for a total of $284.8 million.

INTEREST

         Interest expense for the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, for the
four months ended July 31, 1993 and for the year ended March 31, 1993 was
approximately $37.5 million, $30.3 million, $8.0 million and $25.7 million,
respectively.

         Interest income for the years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994, for the
four months ended July 31, 1993 and for the year ended March 31, 1993 was $7.7
million, $2.1 million,  $1.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

         Generally, interest expense on prepetition debt did not accrue after
the commencement of bankruptcy.  If the prepetition debts were secured by
property with a value that was greater than the amount of the debt, interest was
accrued up to the value of the collateral.  For financial statement purposes
prior to the Effective Date, the Company accrued interest expense on secured
debt. The Company ceased accruing interest expense on its unsecured prepetition
debt.

INCOME TAXES

         Effective April 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
estimated future tax effects of the difference between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect. There
was no cumulative effect on income taxes related to this change in method of
accounting.

         An income tax benefit was not provided in the four month period ended
July 31, 1993 or the year ended March 31, 1993 because all operating losses
would have to be carried forward to future years and the realization of a tax
benefit for those losses was not assured.

         In connection with the adoption of fresh-start reporting, the net book
values of substantially all non-current assets existing at the Effective Date
were eliminated.  As a consequence, SFAS No. 109, in conjunction with SOP 90-7,
requires that any tax benefits realized for book purposes after the Effective
Date, from the reduction of the valuation allowance existing as of the Effective
Date be reported in the future as an addition to additional paid-in capital
rather than as a reduction in the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.  However, the Company will realize the cash benefit from
utilization of the tax net operating loss ("NOL") against current and future tax
liabilities.

         As of July 31, 1995, the Company has a NOL carryforward (after
limitations) of approximately $378 million.  A majority of the tax basis NOL
carryforward, which will be available to offset future taxable income of the
Company, was determined based upon the initial equity valuation of the Company
as determined upon the Effective Date.  The utilization of this asset is subject
to limitations.  The most restrictive is the Internal Revenue Code Section 382
annual limitation.  Until the Company develops a longer term earnings record,
the NOL carryover and other assets are fully reserved to the extent there are no
long-term deferred liabilities to offset.  The NOL carryforward will begin to
expire in fiscal year 2002 but can be utilized through 2009.

         As of July 31, 1995, all years through fiscal year 1988 have been
settled with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and all income tax liabilities
thereon have been paid.  In addition, the IRS did not file any income tax claims
in the bankruptcy case; therefore, the Company believes that under the
bankruptcy laws any potential income tax liabilities have been discharged
through the Effective Date

CAPITAL STOCK

         COMMON STOCK.  At July 31, 1995 and 1994, 70,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, par value of $0.01 per share, were authorized and 34,983,258 shares and
34,965,481 shares, respectively, were outstanding.  The Company held 35,942 and
34,519 treasury shares at July 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

         PREFERRED STOCK.  At July 31, 1995 and 1994, 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value of $0.01, were authorized. None are issued or
outstanding.

         WARRANTS.  Pursuant to the Plan, Zale had authorized 2,000,000 Series A
Warrants to purchase common stock.  At July 31, 1995 and 1994, 1,999,550 and
2,000,000 Series A Warrants, respectively, were outstanding.  Each Series A
Warrant entitles the holder to purchase, for $10.368 per share, one share of
Zale common stock (subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments).  The Series A
Warrants are exercisable on or before July 30, 1998, although their expiration
date may be shortened if the market value of Zale's common stock increases to at
least 150.0 percent of the warrant exercise price for a specified number of days
and less than 5.0 percent of the Series A Warrants originally issued under the
Plan are outstanding on the date on which Zale gives the acceleration notice.

         As part of its settlement of certain litigation with Swarovski, Zale
issued its Series B Warrants to purchase common stock. Each Series B Warrant
entitled the holder to purchase for $10.368 per share, one share of Zale common
stock (subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments).  The Series B Warrants
were presently exercisable and, if not previously exercised, would expire on
September 9, 1998, subject to the Company's right to accelerate the expiration
date of the Series B Warrants if certain conditions were met.  At July 31, 1995,
the Series B Warrants issued entitled the holders to purchase an aggregate of
1,852,884 shares of Zale common stock.  Zale, at its expense, filed and
maintained effective a shelf registration statement covering the resale of the
Series B Warrants and the issuance and sale of shares of common stock upon
exercise of the Series B Warrants (the "Shelf Registration").

         On August 31, 1995, Zale redeemed the Series B Warrants and acquired
all Swarovski's rights, title and interest under the warrant agreement and paid
$9.3 million to Swarovski in consideration of the redemption.  As a result of
this, the Series B Warrants were cancelled and are no longer outstanding.

         STOCK OPTION PLAN.  As of the Effective Date, the Company adopted a
stock option plan (the "Stock Option Plan") to enable the Company to attract,
retain and motivate officers and key employees by providing for proprietary
interest of such individuals in the Company.  Options to purchase an aggregate
of 3,055,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted under the Stock Option Plan
to eligible employees.  Options granted under the Stock Option Plan (i) must be
granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares
of Common Stock into which such options are exercisable, (ii) vest over a
four-year vesting period and (iii) expire ten years from the date of grant.

         Stock option transactions are summarized as follows:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

         JEWEL RECOVERY, L.P.  Pursuant to the Plan, Zale assigned certain
claims and causes of action and advanced $3.0 million to Jewel Recovery, L.P., a
limited partnership ("Jewel Recovery") which was formed upon Zale's emergence
from bankruptcy.  The sole purpose of Jewel Recovery is to prosecute and settle
such assigned claims and causes of action.  The general partner of Jewel
Recovery is Jewel Recovery, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company.  Its limited
partners are holders of various prior unsecured claims against Zale.

         There is a possibility that the Company may recover the $3.0 million
advance made to Jewel Recovery as well as other amounts related to the
finalization of the Chapter 11 claims settlement process.  It is likely that
these matters will be resolved by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 1996.
The Company does not expect these recoveries to be material to its financial
position or recurring operations.

          In addition, the Company and ZDel have agreed to indemnify certain
parties to litigation settlements entered into by the Company in connection with
the Plan against cross-claims, similar third-party claims or costs of defending
such claims brought against such parties as a result of litigation instigated by
the Company, ZDel or Jewel Recovery.  At September 12, 1995, no material claims
had been asserted against the Company or ZDel for such indemnification.

         OTHER.  The Company is involved in certain other legal actions and
claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such
litigation and claims will be resolved without material effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

         The Company has an operations services agreement for management
information systems with a third-party servicer.  The agreement, which
originally began in February 1993, was amended on August 1, 1994 and, requires
payments totaling $31.5 million over a thirty-six month term and is paid monthly
on a straight-line basis.

PROFIT SHARING PLAN

         At July 31, 1995, the Company maintains The Zale Corporation Savings &
Investment Plan.  Substantially all employees who are at least age 21 are
eligible to participate in the plan.  Each employee can contribute from one
percent to fifteen percent of their annual salary.  Under this plan, the Company
will match 50 cents in Zale stock for every dollar an employee contributes up to
two percent of annual earnings.  In order for an employee to be eligible for the
Company match, the employee must have worked at least 1,000 hours during the
plan year and be employed on the last day of the plan year.

         An employee is 33.3 percent vested in the Zale stock after one year of
service, 66.7 percent vested after two years of service and 100 percent vested
after three years of service.  As of July 31, 1995 approximately 2,100
employees participated in The Zale Corporation Savings & Investment Plan.

         Also, under this plan, the Company may make a profit sharing
contribution at its sole discretion.  To be eligible for such discretionary
profit sharing contributions, an employee must have at least twelve consecutive
months of service, have worked at least 1,000 hours during the plan year and be
employed on the last day of the plan year.

         An employee is 20 percent vested in the profit sharing contributions
after three years of service, 40 percent vested after four years of service, 60
percent vested after five years of service, 80 percent vested after six years of
service and 100 percent vested after seven years of service.  The Company's
contribution to the plan was  $2.5 million  and $2.2 million for fiscal years
1995 and 1994, respectively.

ZALE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

         Effective April 1, 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts" and SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities". Debt and equity securities are classified as
available for sale under SFAS No. 115.  The effects of these standards on the
consolidated financial position and results of operations are not material.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         In fiscal 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 107 "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments" which extends existing fair value
disclosure practices by requiring all entities to disclose the fair value of
financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.

         As cash and short-term cash investments, customer receivables, trade
payables and certain other short-term financial instruments are all short-term
in nature, their carrying amount approximates fair value.  The carrying amount
of the $380.6 million, net of discount, Receivables Securitization Facility also
approximates fair value.  The carrying amount of the $60.0 million 11.0 Percent
Second Priority Senior Secured Notes which were secured by second liens on
substantially all the assets of Zale and ZDel were redeemed on September 11,
1995 for 102 percent of face value.  The investments of the Company's insurance
subsidiaries, primarily stocks and bonds in the amount of $28.8 million,
approximate market value at July 31, 1995 and are reflected in Other Assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

         CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.  Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash investments and customer receivables.  The Company maintains
cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments and certain other
financial instruments with various financial institutions.  These financial
institutions are located throughout the country.  Concentrations of credit risk
with respect to customer receivables are limited due to the Company's large
number of customers and their dispersion across many regions.  As of July 31,
1995 and 1994, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         One of the Company's directors serves as a director of a company from
which the Company purchased approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million of
jewelry merchandise during fiscal year 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The Company
believes the terms were equivalent to those of unrelated parties.

REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURE COSTS

         Reorganization and Restructure Costs are shown on a separate line item
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and reflect the costs incurred by
the Company in the implementation of its restructuring plan as well as costs
related directly to its bankruptcy case.  No Reorganization and Restructure
Costs, for which the Company had not previously provided, were incurred in the
years ended July 31, 1995 and 1994.  During January through March 1993, the
Company closed approximately 130 under-performing store locations as it
continued to focus operations in its most profitable locations.  These store
closings were primarily in the Company's Guild division.  In addition,
approximately 45 of the Company's leased locations with one landlord in its
Diamond Park division were closed at the end of January 1993 in department
stores that no longer carry fine jewelry.

UNUSUAL ITEMS -- PROVISIONS FOR VALUATION OF ASSETS

         There were no unusual items recognized during the years ended July 31,
1995 and 1994 or the four months ended July 31, 1993.  The unusual items
recognized during the year ended March 31, 1993 were as follows (amounts in
thousands):

<TABLE>

Write-off of favorable lease rights and property             $ 4,200 
Provision for valuation of customer receivables               12,500 
Provision for valuation of diamond held for investment         3,500
                                                             -------
                                                             $20,200
                                                             =======
</TABLE>

         The Company determined during the March 31, 1993 year-end closing
process that the methodology used to calculate its allowance for doubtful
customer receivables, which had been applied consistently since the early
1980's, did not provide a sufficient allowance for doubtful accounts.  The $12.5
million shortfall was an accumulation of individual amounts during certain prior
years, none of which was material to a specific prior year, and, accordingly,
the cumulative effect has been reflected as an unusual item in the year ended
March 31, 1993.  There was no material effect to the March 31, 1993 operating
results.

         Additionally, the Company made provisions to reduce the value of
certain non-operating assets, including properties held for sale and a large
diamond held for investment, to their estimated net realizable values.

QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)

         Unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended July 31,
1995 and 1994 were as follows (amounts in thousands except per share data):
