                                   PART I
                                   ------

     ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

     United Industrial Corporation ("United" or the "Company") was
     incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 14,
     1959 under the name Topp Industries Corporation.  On December 31,
     1959, the name of the corporation was changed to United Industrial
     Corporation.

     The operations of United consist of three principal industry segments: 
     defense, energy systems and plastic products, conducted through four
     wholly-owned subsidiaries.

     Defense
     -------
     AAI Corporation

     AAI Corporation ("AAI") is engaged in research, development and
     manufacture in the following major areas: (1) training and simulation
     systems; (2) automatic test equipment for electronic systems and
     components; (3) ordnance systems; (4) mechanical support systems for
     industrial, military, and marine applications; (5) unmanned air
     vehicle systems; (6) automated weather monitoring systems; and (7) 
     transportation systems.  Since its inception, AAI's business has been
     primarily in support of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD").  Since
     1990, the Company has emphasized diversification into other markets to
     reduce its dependence on the DOD.  The United States defense budget
     has been significantly reduced in recent years and this trend is
     expected to continue.  In 1995 approximately 64% of the sales volume
     of AAI consisted of research, development and production of military
     items under defense contracts compared to 74% in 1994.  Certain of the
     contracts currently being worked on by AAI involve testing systems for
     U.S. Navy aircraft, training equipment for the U.S. Air Force and U.S.
     Navy, and weapons handling systems for the U.S. Army.

     The balance of AAI's business consists of work performed in the non-
     Department of Defense markets.  These areas include hydraulic test
     equipment, transportation equipment and weather systems.  AAI was
     awarded a contract for 1,096 weather systems to be installed in
     certain government airports throughout the country.  This contract was
     recently restructured and extended through 1997.  New orders were
     received in 1995 for 53 additional systems.  In 1995, 144 weather
     systems were installed bringing total systems installed since
     inception of the contract to 677.

     Because of the variety of its activities, it is not possible to state
     precisely the competitive position of AAI with respect to each of its
     product lines.  In the area of training and simulation systems, AAI is
     one of approximately ten leading organizations developing equipment
     for the U.S. Government.  AAI's ability to obtain orders for training
     and simulation systems is dependent principally on the ability,
     expertise and training of its

                                       2

     employees and the level of funding by the DOD and foreign military
     users.  A number of large and small companies produce automatic test
     equipment that compete with AAI for market share.  In the area of
     weapons and munitions, AAI ranks among approximately ten leading
     companies engaged in development work.  However, AAI's production
     activity in this field is less significant.  AAI began development in
     the Unmanned Air Vehicle business in 1986.  The Company produced the
     highly successful Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle employed by the United
     States during Operation Desert Storm, and presently is pursuing
     contracts with foreign countries.  AAI is one of several large and
     small competitors in this field.

     On January 16, 1992, AAI acquired, through a newly-formed subsidiary
     AAI/ACL Technologies, Inc. ("AAI/ACL"), substantially all of the
     assets and business of ACL Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer of
     hydraulic test equipment for the commercial airline and defense
     markets.  Business results of AAI/ACL have been less than anticipated
     because of the continued unfavorable economic situation of the
     commercial airline industry in the U.S. and worldwide.  However,
     activity in this market is beginning to recover.

     On March 29, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan of
     reorganization and restructuring whereby, in light of existing
     circumstances such as the declining Department of Defense budget and
     the continuing financial problems of the airline industry and in order
     to position itself for both short and long-term growth, it took a one-
     time restructuring charge.  The charge covered the anticipated cost of
     organizational and product-line changes, the consolidation of
     facilities, and work force reductions of approximately 300 in AAI and
     its four subsidiaries.  The non-recurring charge of $22.5 million
     ($14,370,000 or $1.17 per share, net of tax benefit) was taken during
     1993.  As at December 31, 1993, the restructuring program was
     substantially completed.  During 1994, $750,000 was expended.  A major
     portion of the charge resulted from the discontinuance of operations
     of AAI/MICROFLITE.  AAI/MICROFLITE, acquired in 1991, was formerly the
     commercial division of Singer-Link Corporation, a manufacturer of
     flight simulators and training devices for commercial aircraft.   All
     of the remaining assets of AAI/MICROFLITE were sold in 1994.

     AAI's administrative offices and the major part of its manufacturing
     and engineering facilities are located in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

     Symtron Systems, Inc.

     On January 18, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
     shares of Symtron Systems, Inc. ("Symtron"), a producer of firefighter
     training simulators for the government, military and commercial
     markets.  The purchase price consisted of initial cash payments of
     $2,000,000, assumption of certain liabilities of approximately
     $5,900,000 and a contingent payment, not to exceed $1,000,000, based
     on the profits on contracts existing at the acquisition date.  In
     1995, the Company made the contingent payment of $1,000,000 which was
     classified as selling and administrative expense in the 1995 financial
     statements. 
                                       3
<PAGE>


     Additionally, contingent amounts are payable if certain pretax
     profits, as defined in the purchase agreement, are earned for each of
     the years in the four year period ending December 31, 1998.  Funds
     generated from operations and an existing line of credit were utilized
     to finance the purchase of Symtron.  The acquisition was accounted for
     as a purchase, accordingly, the operations of Symtron are included in
     the Company's 1994 financial statements.   In 1995 approximately
     $11,500,000 of the sales volume of  Symtron consisted of production
     for the Navy and commercial customers.  The main office and plant of
     Symtron are located in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

     Energy Systems
     --------------

     Detroit Stoker Company

     Detroit Stoker Company ("Detroit Stoker") is engaged in the design,
     manufacture and sale of industrial stokers, gas/oil burners, municipal
     solid waste combustion systems for waste to energy plants, rotary seal
     feeders for the metering of granular materials, replacement parts and
     aftermarket services.  Its products are used for the generation of
     process steam and electric power in a wide range of industrial and
     municipal applications.  Principal customers include public utilities,
     industrial manufacturing plants, universities, pulp and paper mills,
     sugar mills and independent power producers (non-utility generators). 
     Its waste to energy technology is used extensively in both public and
     private plants which generate steam and power from municipal waste. 
     Its solid fuel combustion technologies are particularly well suited to
     the burning of biomass fuels.  The primary raw materials used by
     Detroit Stoker are iron and steel which are available from many
     sources.  The main office and plant of Detroit Stoker are located in
     Monroe, Michigan.

     The products of Detroit Stoker compete with those of several other
     manufacturers.  Detroit Stoker is presently marketing a liquid and
     gaseous fuel burning product line with low emissions for the power
     industry, primarily for boiler applications.  Potential customers for
     these products consist of original boiler manufacturers as well as all
     major industrial and institutional energy consumers.  Competition is
     based on several factors including price, features and performance.

     In 1995, Detroit Stoker withdrew from the bulk material handling
     systems business in a strategic move to allow better use of resources
     in more profitable areas.

     Midwest Metallurgical Laboratory, Inc. ("Midwest"), a subsidiary of
     Detroit Stoker, is a foundry engaged in the manufacture of grey and
     ductile iron, stainless steel and special alloy iron castings. 
     Approximately 85% of the sales of Midwest are to Detroit Stoker. 
     Midwest's plant and offices are located in Marshall, Michigan.

     Plastic Products
     ----------------

     Neo Products Co.

     Neo Products Co. ("Neo") engineers and fabricates thermoplastic
     products to the specifications submitted by its customers.  Neo also
     manufactures items for point of purchase display advertising and
     consumer products related primarily to infants, food service equipment
     for a major airline and fuel tank reservoirs for the auto industry.

     Sales to customers of items for point of  purchase display advertising
     represented approximately 30% of sales in 1995.  These sales
     principally consisted of display racks and trays.  Sales of consumer
     end use items represented 63% of sales in 1995.  These sales primarily
     included carrier cradles, chairs and waste baskets.  Sales to the auto
     industry represented approximately 7% of sales in 1995.  The largest
     customer of Neo accounted for approximately 54% of sales in 1995
     compared to 39% and 32% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Neo's main
     office and plant are located in Chicago, Illinois.

     Neo is engaged in the highly competitive field of thermoplastic
     fabrication.  Neo's operations are in potential and actual competition
     with fabrication facilities of some of its own customers as well as
     other thermoplastic fabricators.  Neo has improved its competitive
     position by increasing the size of its larger injection molding
     presses to accommodate larger size molded parts.  Although it is not
     possible to estimate the position of Neo among competitors in this
     field, it is believed to hold less than 1% market share.  The primary
     raw material used by Neo is plastic resin, which is available from
     many sources.

     For additional information concerning United's subsidiaries reference
     is made to information set forth in the sections entitled "AAI
     Corporation", "Symtron Systems, Inc.", "Detroit Stoker Company" and
     "Neo Products Company" commencing on page 5 of United's 1995 Annual
     Report to Shareholders (the "Annual Report"), which sections are
     incorporated herein by reference.

     General
     -------

     Employees

     As of March 1, 1996 United and its subsidiaries had approximately
     2,000 employees.  Approximately 200 of these employees are represented
     by several unions under contracts expiring between July 1997 and March
     1999.  United considers its employee relationships to be satisfactory.

     Patents

     United and its subsidiaries own more than 100 United States patents
     relating to various products, including stokers, marine equipment,
     ordnance and electronic equipment, and
                                       5
<PAGE>


     firefighter trainers.  In addition, United has numerous pending
     applications for patents.  There is no assurance as to how many
     patents will be issued pursuant to these pending applications.  The
     applications relate to a wide variety of fields, including automation
     control systems, ordnance devices, and electronic developments.  No
     patent is considered to be of material importance to United.

     Research and Development

     During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the subsidiaries of United (exclusive of
     AAI) expended approximately $194,000, $98,031, and $126,300,
     respectively, on the development of new  products and the improvement
     of existing products.  All of the programs and the funds to support
     such programs are sponsored by the subsidiary involved.  In addition
     to the above amount, AAI is substantially engaged in research and
     development for the U.S. Government.

     Backlog

     The backlog of orders by industry segment at December 31, 1995 and
     1994 was as follows:

     Energy Systems         5,070,000                4,627,000        

     Plastic Products       2,349,000                1,281,000        

</TABLE>

     The defense contract backlog decrease more than offsets the increase
     in commercial backlog of the defense segment.  The increase in backlog
     for energy systems was due to the increased level of new contracts
     being awarded.  Except for approximately $66,000,000 of research and
     development backlog, substantially all of the backlog orders at
     December 31, 1995 are expected to be filled in 1996.

     Government Contracts

     No single customer other than the U.S. Government, principally the
     Department of Defense, accounted for 10% or more of net sales during
     the year.  Sales to the Government normally carry a lesser margin of
     profit than commercial sales and may be subject to price
     redetermination under certain circumstances.  Contracts for such sales
     can be terminated for the convenience of the Government.

     Financial Information Relating to Industry Segments

     For financial information with respect to industry segments of United,
     reference is made to the information set forth in Note 13 of the Notes
     to Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report, which Note
     is incorporated herein by reference.

     Foreign Operations and Export Sales

     United and its subsidiaries have no significant foreign operations. 
     During  1993  export sales by United and its subsidiaries amounted to
     approximately  $31,258,000.   Export sales in 1995 and 1994 amounted
     to less than 10% of net sales for these years.

     ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company, along with numerous other parties, has been named in five
     tort actions relating to environmental matters based on allegations
     partially related to a predecessor's operations.  These tort actions
     seek recovery for personal injury and property damage among other
     damages.   One tort claim is a certified property and medical class
     action.

     The Company owned and operated a small facility at a site in the State
     of Arizona that manufactured semi-conductors between 1959 and 1960. 
     All such operations of the Company were sold by 1961.  Although this
     facility may have used trichloroethylene ("TCE") in small quantities,
     there is no evidence that this facility released or disposed of TCE at
     this site.

     On May 18, 1993, the State of Arizona filed suit against the Company
     seeking the recovery of investigative costs, injunctive relief to
     require the Company to perform a Remedial Investigation and
     Feasibility Study ("RI/FS"), and ultimately to require the remediation
     of alleged soil and groundwater contamination at and near a certain
     industrial site.  Since then the State has brought in co-defendants
     whose operations at the site were substantially larger than those of
     the Company. 

     On June 20, 1995 the Company and the State of Arizona executed an
     agreement in principle to settle the litigation.  In exchange for a
     full release from liability by the State and the Arizona Department of
     Environmental Quality, the Company, without admitting liability, has
     agreed to the following:

     *    Undertake and pay for the costs of an RI/FS Work Plan, estimated
          at $1,300,000.

     *    Pay $125,000 towards past costs incurred by the State of Arizona
          and the Department of Environmental Quality.

     *    Pay $125,000 towards costs of future remediation and clean-up of
          the site.  In addition, at the time the State selects a remedy,
          the Company agrees to an additional contribution in the amount of
          a percentage of the total estimated clean-up cost not to exceed
          an additional $1,120,000.

     *    The Company reserves all rights to seek contribution from other
          responsible parties.

     The Company and the State have signed a Consent Decree and Work Plan
     incorporating these terms and conditions.  The Consent Decree has been
     lodged with the United States District Court for the District of
     Arizona for a 30-day public comment period, at the conclusion of which
     the parties will seek court approval of the settlement.  Resolution of
     this matter will not have a materially adverse effect on the
     consolidated financial position of the Company.  The Company has
     provided approximately $1,900,000 based on estimates of the total cost
     for the RI/FS, estimates of amounts specified for past costs and
     estimates of future remediation and clean-up costs.

     On February 11, 1992 a complaint was filed against the Company and ten
     other named and ten unnamed entities in the Maricopa County Superior
     Court of Arizona by seven individuals seeking to represent a class.  A
     class in excess of 10,000 was originally alleged.  The plaintiffs have
     amended their complaint to separate the larger property damage and
     medical monitoring classes into smaller subclasses based on geographic
     location and alleged exposure to solvents.  In the process of
     amendment, the overall sizes of the respective classes have been
     significantly reduced.  This suit alleges that the members of the
     class have been exposed to contaminated groundwater in the Phoenix/
     Scottsdale, Arizona area and suffer increased risk of disease and
     other physical effects.  They also assert property damages under
     various theories; seek to have certain scientific studies performed
     concerning health risks, preventative measures and long-term effects;
     and seek incidental and consequential damages, punitive damages and an
     injunction against actions causing further exposures.  The property
     and medical classes recently were certified.  The Company has joined
     with the other defendants and appealed the class certification issue
     to the Arizona Supreme Court.  The Company intends to vigorously
     contest these actions and believes that the resolution of these
     actions will not be material to the Company.

     Four additional lawsuits were filed on April 7, 1993, December 20,
     1993, June 10, 1994 and July 18, 1995 in the Maricopa County Superior
     Court of Arizona.  These matters allege personal injury and wrongful
     death by multiple plaintiffs arising from the alleged contamination in
     the Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona area.  The Company intends to
     aggressively defend against these claims; however, at this time, no
     estimate can be made as to the amount or range of potential loss, if
     any, to the Company with respect to these matters.  In comparison to
     the other defendants, the operations of the Company were very limited
     in time and size.

     In January 1993, Detroit Stoker was named a third-party defendant in
     four lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the
     Northern District of Ohio.  The third-party plaintiffs are ship owners
     who have been sued by Great Lakes maritime workers who allege personal
     injuries and disease as a result of exposure to asbestos while working
     aboard the ships.  The ship owners claim that Detroit Stoker and other
     suppliers to the ship owners furnished products, supplies or
     components of the ships that contained asbestos.  These cases are now
     consolidated in the multi-district litigation proceeding currently
     pending in the United States District Court in Philadelphia.  Detroit
     Stoker intends to aggressively defend these claims, however, at this
     time, no estimate can be made as to the amount or range of potential
     loss, if any, to Detroit Stoker with respect to this action.

     Detroit Stoker was notified in March 1992 by the Michigan Department of
     Natural Resources (MDNR) that it is a potentially responsible party in
     connection with the clean-up of a former industrial landfill located in
     Port of Monroe, Michigan. MDNR is treating the Port of Monroe landfill site
     as a contaminated facility within the meaning of the Michigan Environmental
     Response Act (MERA), MCLA Section 299.601 et seq. Under MERA, if a
                                               -- --- 
     release or a potential release of a discarded hazardous substance is or may
     be injurious to the environment or to the public health, safety, or
     welfare, MDNR is empowered to undertake or


                                       10
<PAGE>


     compel investigation and response activities in order to alleviate any
     contamination threat.  Detroit Stoker intends to aggressively defend
     these claims, however, at this time, no estimate can be made as to the
     amount or range of potential loss, if any, to Detroit Stoker with
     respect to this action.

     In May 1995, AAI Systems Management, Inc. (the "subsidiary"), an
     indirect subsidiary of the Company, submitted to the U.S. Government
     (the "customer") a Request for Equitable Adjustment ("REA") totaling
     approximately $11,800,000 in connection with a certain contract with
     the subsidiary.  The REA seeks monetary damages based on costs
     incurred by the subsidiary arising out of or in connection with
     customer directed suspension of work and resulting schedule delays,
     additional work directives, and other actions by the customer in
     connection with the contract for which contractors are allowed
     recovery under the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  On July 14, 1995,
     the subsidiary received the final decision of the customer rejecting
     the REA in its entirety.  To fully protect the Company's interest, on
     October 10, 1995, a Notice of Appeal of the final decision was filed
     with the Armed Services Board of  Contract Appeals seeking monetary
     damages plus interest.  While the Company believes that the formal
     claims asserted against the customer are meritorious and the Company
     will vigorously pursue recovery of the monies claimed, the customer
     has asserted substantive defenses to these claims.  Because the
     proceedings are currently in the discovery phase, it is not possible
     at this time to determine the ultimate amount of recovery of these
     costs.

     The Company is involved in various other lawsuits and claims,
     including certain other environmental matters, arising out of the
     normal course of its business.  In the opinion of management, the
     ultimate amount of liability, if any, under pending litigation,
     including claims described above, will not have a materially adverse
     effect on the Company.

     Report of Independent Auditors

     BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS
     UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
     Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
     1994, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
     1995. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
     listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and
     schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
     and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
     to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
     are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
     a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
     financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
     principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
     as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
     that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
     above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
     financial position of United Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries
     at December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the consolidated results of their
     operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
     period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted
     accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
     statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
     financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
     respects the information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial
     statements, effective January 1, 1993 the Company changed its method
     of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and
     income taxes.

     A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     In the parent-company-only financial statements, the Company's
     investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost plus equity
     in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries since the date of
     acquisition. The Company's share of the net income of its
     unconsolidated subsidiaries is reflected using the equity method.
     Parent-company-only financial statements should be read in conjunction
     with the Company's consolidated financial statements.


     B. EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF SUBSIDIARIES

     In 1993, included in the equity in net loss of subsidiaries  is a
     restructuring charge of $22,500,000 ($14,370,000, net of tax benefit)
     regarding the Company's defense industry subsidiary. A major portion
     of the charge resulted from the termination of the operations of
     AAI/MICROFLITE, a manufacturer of flight simulators and training
     devices, due to a lack of new orders. Also, in 1993 the Company
     changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other
     than pensions and income taxes. The implementation of these accounting
     changes resulted in a cumulative effect charge against income of
     $12,890,000, net of tax benefit and a cumulative effect of $13,884,000
     which reduced the 1993 net loss, respectively. Consequently, the net
     cumulative effect of these accounting changes resulted in a $994,000
     reduction of the net loss in 1993.

or offices, and keep the books and records of the Corporation, except as may
otherwise be required by law, at such other place or places, either within or

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

               SECTION 1. Place of Meeting. All meetings of the stockholders of

               SECTION 3. Special Meetings. Except as otherwise required by law
or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (the
"Certificate"), special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes
may be called by the majority of the entire Board or by stockholders holding
together at least twenty percent (20%) of all the shares of the Corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting and shall be held only for such business and at
such date and time, within or without the State of Delaware, as is specified in
the notice of any such special meeting of the stockholders.

               SECTION 4. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by
law, written notice of each meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or
special, shall be given, either by personal delivery or by mail, not less than
10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of
record entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed
given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. Each such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Notice of
any meeting of stockholders shall not be required to be given to any stockholder
who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy without protesting, prior to
or at the commencement of the meeting, the lack of proper notice to such
stockholder, or who shall sign a written waiver of notice thereof, whether
before or after such meeting. Notice of adjournment of a meeting of stockholders
need not be given if the time and place to which it is adjourned are announced

               SECTION 5. Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the
Certificate, the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the
stockholders entitled to vote generally, present in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the
stockholders. At all meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present,
all matters, except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate, shall be
decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote
thereat present in person or by proxy. If there be no such quorum, the holders
of a majority of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the meeting
from time to time, without further notice, until a quorum shall have been
obtained. When a quorum is once present it is not broken by the subsequent
withdrawal of any stockholder.

               SECTION 6. Order of Business. (a) At each meeting of the stock-
holders, the Chairman of the Board, if any, or if none or in the absence of the
Chairman of the Board, the Vice-Chairman, if any, or if none or in the absence
of the Vice-Chairman, such person as shall be selected by the Board shall act as
chairman of



                                         2



<PAGE>

the meeting. The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined
by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right
and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the
meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the
maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to questions
or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such
meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof, and the opening
and closing of the voting polls.

               (b) At any annual meeting of stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the annual meeting (i) by
or at the direction of the chairman of the meeting, (ii) pursuant to the notice
provided for in Section 4 of this Article II or (iii) by any stockholder who is
a holder of record at the time of the giving of such notice provided for in this
Section 6, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the
procedures set forth in this Section 6.

               (c) For business properly to be brought before an annual meeting
by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in
proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation (the "Secretary") and
such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under the Delaware
General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days
prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by
the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 90th day
prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. To
be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth in writing as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the
annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the
annual meeting; (ii) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such
business and all persons or entities acting in concert with the stockholder;
(iii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are beneficially
owned by the stockholder and all persons or entities acting in concert with such
stockholder; and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.
The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if
the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present
a proposal at an annual meeting and such stockholder's proposal has been
included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the
Corporation to solicit proxies



                                         3



<PAGE>

for such annual meeting; provided, however, that if such stockholder does not
appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such
annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at
such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been
received by the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the
contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6. The chairman of an
annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not
properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6 and, if the chairman should so determine, the chairman shall so
declare to the annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before
the annual meeting shall not be transacted.

               SECTION 7. List of Stockholders. It shall be the duty of the
Secretary or other officer who has charge of the stock ledger to prepare and
make, at least 10 days before each meeting of the stockholders, a complete list
of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered
in such stockholder's name.

               SECTION 8. Voting. (a) At each meeting of stockholders, every
stockholder shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy appointed by
instrument in writing, subscribed by such stockholder or by such stockholder's
duly authorized attorney-in-fact (but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon
after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period),
and, unless the Certificate provides otherwise, shall have one vote for each
share of stock entitled to vote registered in the name of such stockholder on
the books of the Corporation on the applicable record date fixed pursuant to
these Bylaws. At all elections of directors the voting may but need not be by
ballot and a plurality of the votes cast shall elect. Except as otherwise
required by law or the Certificate, any other action shall be authorized by a
majority of the votes cast.

               (b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting
of stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate, be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent
in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation having a
majority of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and
the writing or writings are filed with the permanent records of the Corporation.
Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

               SECTION 9. Inspectors. The Board, in advance of any meeting, may,
but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting
or any adjournment thereof. If an inspector or inspectors are not so appointed,
the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more
inspectors. In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to
appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board in
advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat. Each
inspector, if any, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at
such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.
The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares of stock
outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock represented at the
meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and effect of proxies, and
shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and
questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all
votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper
to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. On request of
the person presiding at the meeting, the inspector or inspectors, if any, shall
make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by such
inspector or inspectors and execute a certificate of any fact found by such
inspector or inspectors.


                                   ARTICLE III

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

               SECTION 1. General Powers. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may
exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be
exercised or done by the stockholders.

               SECTION 2. Number and Tenure. The Board of Directors shall be six
(6) in number, which number may be changed only pursuant to an amendment to
these Bylaws adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than
eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote on such amendment. Each director shall be elected to a term of
office to expire at such future annual meeting of stockholders as is appropriate
for the class of directors to which he is elected. The Board shall keep full and
fair records of its acts and proceedings and transactions. Directors need not be
stockholders.

               SECTION 3. Notification of Nomination. Nominations for the
election of directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder who is a
stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice of nomination provided
for in this Section 3 of this Article III and who is entitled to vote for the
election of directors. Any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the
election of directors at a meeting may nominate persons for election as
directors only if timely written notice of such stockholder's intent to make
such nomination is given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail,
postage prepaid, to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of
stockholders, not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days
prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by
the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 90th day
prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made and
(ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders
for the election of directors, not earlier than the 90th day prior to such
special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and
of the nominees proposed by the Board to be selected at such meeting. Each such
notice shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the stockholder who intends
to make the nomination, of all persons or entities acting in concert with the
stockholder, and of the person or persons to be nominated; (ii) a representation
that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) a
description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and
each nominee and any other person or entities acting in concert with the
stockholder (naming such person or entities) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (iv) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by the stockholder as would have been required
to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended
to be nominated, by the Board; (v) the class and number of shares of the
Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder and all persons or
entities acting in concert with the stockholder; and (vi) the consent of each
nominee to being named in a proxy statement as nominee and to serve as a
director of the Corporation if so elected. The chairman of the meeting may
refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with
the foregoing procedure. Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with
the procedures



                                        6



<PAGE>


set forth in this Section 3 of this Article III shall be eligible to serve as
directors of the Corporation.

               Notwithstanding anything in the third sentence of this Section 3
of Article III to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be
elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement naming all
of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made
by the Corporation at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by these Bylaws
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is
first made by the Corporation.

               For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated
Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by
the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13,
14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

               SECTION 4. Quorum and Manner of Acting. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate or these Bylaws, a majority of the entire Board
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the
Board, and, except as so provided, the vote of a majority of the directors
present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the
Board. The chairman of the meeting or a majority of the directors present may
adjourn the meeting to another time and place whether or not a quorum is
present. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
called.

               SECTION 5. Place of Meeting. The Board may hold its meetings at
such place or places within or without the State of Delaware as the Board may
from time to time determine or as shall be specified or fixed in the respective
notice or waivers of notice thereof.

               SECTION 6. Annual Meeting. Following the annual meeting of
stockholders, the newly elected Board shall meet for the purpose of the election
of officers and the transaction of such other business as may properly come
before the meeting. Such meeting may be held without notice immediately after
the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such stockholders'
meeting is held



                                         7

or at such other place as the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the Board shall
determine.

               SECTION 7. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board shall
be held at such times and places as the Chairman of the Board, if any, or the
Board shall from time to time by resolution determine.

               SECTION 8. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board shall
be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board or by a majority of the
directors then in office.

               SECTION 9. Notice of Meetings. Notice need not be given of
regular meetings of the Board held at times and places fixed by resolution of
the Board or of any adjourned meeting thereof. Notice of each special meeting of
the Board shall be given by overnight delivery service or mailed to each
director, in either case addressed to such director at such director's residence
or usual place of business, at least two days before the day on which the
meeting is to be held or shall be sent to such director at such place by
telegraph or telecopy or be given personally or by telephone, not later than the
day before the meeting is to be held, but notice need not be given to any
director who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a signed waiver
of such notice or who shall attend such meeting other than for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. Every such
notice shall state the time and place but need not state the purpose of the
meeting.

               SECTION 10. Organization. At all meetings of the Board, the
Chairman, if any, or if none or in the Chairman's absence or inability to act,
the Vice-Chairman, if any, or if none or in the Vice-Chairman's absence or
inability to act, a chairman chosen by the directors, shall preside. The
Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary at all meetings of the Board
when present, and, in the Secretary's absence, the presiding officer may appoint
any person to act as secretary.

               SECTION 11. Rules and Regulations. The Board may adopt such rules
and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of law, the Certificate or
these Bylaws for the conduct of its meetings and management of the affairs of
the Corporation as the Board may deem proper.

               SECTION 12.  Participation in Meeting by Means of Communication
Equipment.  Any one or more members of the Board or any committee thereof may
participate in any meeting of the Board or of any such committee by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all



                                         8



<PAGE>

persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation
in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

               SECTION 13. Action without Meeting. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or any committee thereof may
be taken without a meeting if all of the members of the Board or of any such
committee consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with
the minutes or proceedings of the Board or of such committee.

               SECTION 14. Resignations. Any director of the Corporation may at
any time resign by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, if any,
the Vice-Chairman, if any, the President or the Secretary. Such resignation
shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time be not specified
therein, upon receipt thereof; and, unless otherwise specified therein, the
acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

               SECTION 15. Removal of Directors. Any director (including all
members of the Board) may be removed from office at any time, with or, except as
otherwise required by law or the Certificate, without cause, by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of
capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors.

               SECTION 16. Vacancies. Except as otherwise required by law, the
Certificate or these Bylaws, any vacancy in the Board for any reason and any
newly created directorship resulting by reason of any increase in the number of
directors may be filled only by the Board, by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even
though less than a quorum (or by a sole remaining director); provided, however,
that if the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of
the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), upon
application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent
(10%) of the total number of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation at
the time outstanding having the right to vote for directors, an election to fill
any such vacancy or vacancies or newly created directorship, or to replace the
director or directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid may be
held as provided in Section 223 of the DGCL. If not so filled, any such vacancy
shall be filled by the stockholders at the next annual meeting or at a special
meeting called for that purpose. Any director so appointed shall hold office
until such future annual meeting of stockholders as is appropriate for the class
of directors to which he or she is elected and until his or her successor shall
be duly elected and qualified.

               SECTION 17. Compensation. Each director, in consideration of such
person serving as a director, shall be entitled to receive from the Corporation
such amount per annum and such fees for attendance at meetings of the Board or
of committees of the Board, or both, as the Board shall from time to time
determine. In addition, each director shall be entitled to receive from the
Corporation reimbursement for the reasonable expenses incurred by such person in
connection with the performance of such person's duties as a director. Nothing
contained in this Section 17 of this Article III shall preclude any director
from serving the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries in any other capacity
and receiving proper compensation therefor.


                                      ARTICLE IV

                         COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

               SECTION 1. Establishment of Committees of the Board of Directors.
The Board may, in accordance with and subject to the DGCL, from time to time
establish committees of the Board to exercise such powers and authorities of the
Board, and to perform such other functions, as the Board may from time to time

such committee of the Board may deem proper. A majority of the members of any
committee of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business

to be a director of the Corporation, such person shall simultaneously therewith

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

               SECTION 1. Scope of Indemnification. (a) Each person who was or
is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or



                                         13



<PAGE>


agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or
agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
(but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment
permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted
prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys'
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VI with respect
to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

               (b) If an indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification with
respect to a portion of any liabilities to which such person may be subject, the
Corporation shall nonetheless indemnify such indemnitee to the maximum extent
for the remaining portion of the liabilities.

               (c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the indemnitee is not entitled
to indemnification.

               (d) To the extent permitted by law, the payment of
indemnification provided for by this Article, including the advancement of
expenses pursuant to Section 2 of this Article VI, with respect to proceedings
other than those brought by or in the right of the Corporation, shall be subject
to the conditions that the indemnitee shall give the Corporation prompt notice
of any proceeding, that the Corporation shall have complete charge of the
defense of such proceeding and the right to select counsel for the indemnitee,
and that the indemnitee shall assist and cooperate fully in all matters
respecting the proceeding and its defense or settlement. The Corporation may
waive any or all of the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence. Any such
waiver shall be applicable only to the specific payment for which the waiver is
made and shall not in any way obligate the Corporation to grant such waiver at
any future time. In the event of a conflict of interest between the indemnitee
and the Corporation that would disqualify the Corporation's counsel from
representing the indemnitee under the rules of professional conduct applicable
to attorneys, it shall be the policy of the Corporation to waive any or all of
the foregoing conditions subject to such limitations or conditions as the
Corporation shall deem to be reasonable in the circumstances.



                                         14



<PAGE>

               SECTION 2. Advancing Expenses. The right to indemnification
conferred in Section 1 of this Article VI shall include the right to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding for which such
right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its final disposition
(hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if required
by the DGCL, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of
such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise. No advance
shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly
made by a majority vote of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested
directors constitute less than a quorum, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable
or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs) by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that, based upon the facts known
to the Board or counsel at the time such determination is made, the indemnitee
has acted in such a manner as to permit or require the denial of indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 of this Article VI.

               SECTION 3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2
of this Article VI shall be contract rights. If a claim under Sections 1 and 2
of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days
after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case
of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period
shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful
in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In any suit brought by (a) the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct; and (b) the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such



                                         15



<PAGE>


suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of
directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that
the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Section or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

               SECTION 4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VI
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, the Certificate, bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

               SECTION 5. Insurance, Contracts and Funding. The Corporation may
purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any indemnitee against any
expenses, judgments, fines and amounts payable as specified in this Article VI,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect. The
Corporation may enter into contracts with any indemnitee in furtherance of the
provisions of this Article VI and may create a trust fund, grant a security
interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit)
to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect
indemnification as provided in this Article VI.

               SECTION 6. Effects of Amendments. Neither the amendment or repeal
of, nor the adoption of a provision inconsistent with, any provision of this
Article VI (including, without limitation, this Section 6) shall adversely
affect the rights of any indemnitee under this Article VI with respect to any
proceeding commenced or threatened prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption
of an inconsistent provision.

               SECTION 7. Severability. If any provision or provisions of this
Article VI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation, all portions of
any paragraph of this Article VI containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to
the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VI (including,
without limitation, all portions of any paragraph of this Article VI



                                         16



<PAGE>


containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that
are not themselves invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as
to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  CAPITAL STOCK

               SECTION 1. Share Ownership. (a) Holders of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be recorded on the books of the Corporation and ownership of
such stock shall be evidenced by a certificate or other form as shall be
approved by the Board. Certificates representing shares of stock of each class
shall be signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation by the President or any
Vice President and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer
or any Assistant Treasurer of the Corporation, and sealed with the seal of the
Corporation, which may be a facsimile thereof. Any or all such signatures and
the signatures of any transfer agent or registrar may be facsimiles. Although
any officer, transfer agent or registrar whose manual or facsimile signature is
affixed to such a certificate ceases to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar before such certificate has been issued, the certificate may
nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
officer, transfer agent or registrar were still such at the date of its issue.

               (b) The stock ledger and blank share certificates shall be kept
by the Secretary or by a transfer agent or by a registrar or by any officer or
agent designated by the Board.

               SECTION 2. Transfer of Shares. Transfers of shares of stock of
each class of the Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation
by the holder thereof, or by such holder's attorney thereunto authorized by a
power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or a transfer agent
for such stock, if any, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates, if
any, for such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock
transfer power (or by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to
transfer) and the payment of any taxes thereon; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall be entitled to recognize and enforce any lawful restriction on
transfer.

               SECTION 3. Registered Stockholders and Addresses of Stockholders.
(a) The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a
person registered on its records as the owner of shares of stock to receive
dividends and to vote as such owner, and shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim



                                         17



<PAGE>


to, or interest in, such share or shares of stock on the part of any other
person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise provided by applicable law.

               (b) Each stockholder shall designate to the Secretary or transfer
agent of the Corporation an address at which notices of meetings and all other
corporate notices may be delivered or mailed to such person, and, if any
stockholder shall fail to designate such address, corporate notices may be
delivered to such person by mail directed to such person at such person's post
office address, if any, as the same appears on the stock record books of the
Corporation or at such person's last known post office address.

               SECTION 4. Lost, Stolen, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates.
The Corporation may issue to any holder of shares of stock the certificate for
which has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated a new certificate or
certificates for shares, upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or, in
the case of loss, theft or destruction of the certificate, upon satisfactory
proof of such loss, theft or destruction. The Board, or a committee designated
thereby, or the transfer agents and registrars for the stock, may, in their
discretion, require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or
such person's legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond in such sum
and with such surety or sureties as they may direct to indemnify the Corporation
and said transfer agents and registrars against any claim that may be made on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate.

               SECTION 5. Regulations. The Board may make such additional rules
and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue and transfer of
certificates representing shares of stock of each class of the Corporation and
may make such rules and take such action as it may deem expedient concerning the
issue of certificates in lieu of certificates claimed to have been lost,
destroyed, stolen or mutilated.

               SECTION 6. Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record. (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall
not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no
record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders



                                         18



<PAGE>

entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new
record date for the adjourned meeting.

               (b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date
shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the Board. Any stockholder of record seeking to
have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent
shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board to fix a record
date. The Board shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date
on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date.
If no record date has been fixed by the Board within 10 days of the date on
which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no
prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date
on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in
the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent
of the Corporation having custody of the books in which proceedings of meetings
of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the
Board is required by applicable law, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board adopts
the resolution taking such prior action.

               (c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and
which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no
record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts
the resolution relating thereto.

               SECTION 7. Transfer Agents and Registrars. The Board may appoint,
or authorize any officer or officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents and
one or more registrars.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    DIVIDENDS

               Subject always to the provisions of law and the Certificate, the
Board shall have full power to determine whether any, and, if any, what part of
any, funds legally available for the payment of dividends shall be declared as
dividends and paid to stockholders; the division of the whole or any part of
such funds of the Corporation shall rest wholly within the lawful discretion of
the Board, and it shall not be required at any time, against such discretion, to
divide or pay any part of such funds among or to the stockholders as dividends
or otherwise; and before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
Board from time to time, in its absolute discretion, thinks proper as a reserve
or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing
or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the
Board shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the Board
may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

               The Board shall provide a corporate seal which shall have
inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation and the year of its incorporation,
and shall be in such form and contain such other words and/or figures as the
Board shall determine. The corporate seal may be used by printing, engraving,
lithographing, stamping or otherwise making, placing or affixing, or causing to
be printed, engraved, lithographed, stamped or otherwise made, placed or
affixed, upon any paper or document, by any process whatsoever, an impression,
facsimile or other reproduction of said corporate seal.

                                WAIVER OF NOTICE

               Whenever notice is required to be given by these Bylaws, by the
Certificate or by law, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person or persons
entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall
be deemed equivalent to notice.


                                   ARTICLE XII

                     BANK ACCOUNTS, DRAFTS, CONTRACTS, ETC.

               SECTION 1. Bank Accounts and Drafts. In addition to such bank
accounts as may be authorized by the Board, the primary financial officer or any

appropriate, payments from such bank accounts to be made upon and according to
the check of the Corporation in accordance with the written instructions of said
primary financial officer, or other person so designated by the Treasurer.

               SECTION 2. Contracts. The Board may authorize any person or
persons, in the name and on behalf of the Corporation, to enter into or execute
and deliver any and all deeds, bonds, mortgages, contracts and other obligations
or instruments, and such authority may be general or confined to specific
instances.

               SECTION 3. Proxies; Powers of Attorney; Other Instruments. The

                                         21



<PAGE>


incident to the ownership of stock by the Corporation. The Chairman, if any, the
President or any other person authorized by proxy or power of attorney executed

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------

               AGREEMENT made this 26th day of March, 1996, by and between
     UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation having an
     address at 18 East 48th Street, New York, New York 10017 (hereinafter
     called "Employer"), and RICHARD R. ERKENEFF (hereinafter called
     "Employee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
                              -------------------

               In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter
     contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               1.  Employment.  Employer agrees to employ Employee and
                   ----------
     Employee agrees to serve Employer upon the terms and conditions
     hereinafter set forth.

               2.  Term.  The employment of Employee hereunder shall be
                   ----
     effective and shall commence on January 1, 1996 (the "Effective Date")
     and shall terminate as of the close of business on the date three (3)
     years after the Effective Date (the "Termination Date").  The period
     from the Effective Date through the Termination Date is referred to as
     the term of this Agreement.

               3.  Duties and Extent of Services.  Employee agrees to serve
                   -----------------------------
     Employer and its subsidiary companies faithfully and to the best of
     his ability under the direction of the Board of Directors of Employer,
     devoting his entire business time, energy and skill






<PAGE>
     

     to his duties hereunder.  The principal place of employment of
     Employee shall be at the offices of AAI Corporation ("AAI"), a
     subsidiary of Employer, which are currently located in Hunt Valley,
     Maryland.  Employee understands and agrees, however, that in
     connection with his employment hereunder, he may be required from time
     to time to travel on behalf of Employer.

               The principal duties of Employee shall be to serve as
     President and Chief Executive Officer of Employer and AAI and, in such
     capacity, to render such managerial, administrative and other services
     to Employer and AAI and their subsidiaries as normally are associated
     with and incident to such positions as Employer from time to time may
     require of him.  If, during the term of this Agreement, the Board of
     Directors of Employer so determines, in its absolute discretion, to
     elect Employee to any additional office of Employer or its subsidiary
     companies consistent with his position, or a director of Employer or
     its subsidiary companies, Employee agrees to accept and serve in such
     office or capacity, for no additional compensation or remuneration.

               4.   Compensation.
                    ------------

                    (a)  Salary.  Employer agrees to pay (or to cause AAI
                         ------
     to pay) to Employee, as compensation for all of the services to be
     rendered by Employee under or pursuant to this Agreement, a salary at
     the rate of four hundred forty thousand dollars ($440,000) per annum,
     commencing as of the Effective Date,
    
                                       2

<PAGE>
     

     payable in accordance with Employer's normal payroll practices.  Such
     salary shall be subject to annual review by Employer's Board of
     Directors and, at the discretion of the Board, may be increased, but
     not decreased below such amount.  Employee shall also be eligible to
     receive annual discretionary bonuses as may be granted by Employer's
     Board of Directors, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of his then
     annual base salary.

                    (b)  Employee Benefit Plans.  During the term of this
                         ----------------------
     Agreement, Employee shall be eligible to participate in any life
     insurance, medical, retirement, pension or profit-sharing, disability
     or other benefit plans or arrangements now or hereafter generally made
     available by Employer or AAI to executive employees of Employer or AAI
     to the extent Employee qualifies under the provisions of any such
     plans. Subject to the foregoing, Employer and AAI shall have the right
     to change insurance companies and modify insurance policies covering
     employees of Employer and AAI.  Employer agrees to provide (or to
     cause AAI to provide) medical coverage to Employee after retirement at
     age 65 consistent with such coverage then provided to Employer's or
     AAI's executive employees.  Such coverage shall be provided either
     through Employer's or AAI's plan or a private plan, at Employer's
     option, but only if and to the extent Employee does not receive such
     coverage from another source.  Employer shall purchase and keep in
     effect during the term of this Agreement a key man life insurance
     policy with respect to Employee in the

                                       3
<PAGE>
     

     amount of not less than $200,000, provided that Employer is able to
     obtain a policy in the amount of $5,000,000 and that Employee is
     insurable at normal premium rates for such a policy.  Employee shall
     designate the beneficiary as to $200,000 of such policy, and Employer
     shall be the beneficiary as to any portion of such policy in excess of
     such amount.  For purposes of Employee's participation in the AAI
     Pension Plan (the "Plan"), Employee shall be deemed vested in the Plan
     as of the Effective Date, provided, however, if he is not vested under
     the terms of the Plan, Employer shall make (or shall cause AAI to
     make) the payments to him that he otherwise would have received under
     the Plan had be been vested under the terms of the Plan.  This
     provision shall have no impact, however, on the Plan and shall not be
     deemed an amendment of the Plan.  This provision shall not apply,
     however, if Employee's employment by Employer is terminated prior to
     the third anniversary of the Effective Date either voluntarily by him
     or by Employer for cause as provided in Section 12 hereof.

                    (c)  Stock Options.  Employer shall grant to Employee
                         -------------
     on the date hereof options to acquire 150,000 shares of common stock
     of Employer pursuant to the terms of Employer's 1994 Stock Option Plan
     (the "Plan") and the grant letter in the form annexed hereto as
     Exhibit A.  The exercise price of such options shall be equal to the
     fair market value of such common stock as of the grant date.  Employer
     shall grant to Employee (i) one year

                                       4
<PAGE>
     

     after the date hereof additional options to acquire 75,000 shares and
     (ii) two years after the date hereof additional options to acquire
     75,000 shares, all pursuant to the Plan, provided that he is employed
     hereunder on such dates.  If for any reason the proposed amendment to
     increase the number of shares covered by the Plan and the number of
     shares subject to options any one individual may receive is not
     approved by Employer's stockholders at Employer's 1996 Annual Meeting,
     Employee shall not receive such additional options and a portion of
     such 150,000 options granted on the date hereof shall be terminated as
     provided in Exhibit A.  Employer and Employee agree to consider in
     good faith alternative arrangements to compensate Employee for any
     such terminated options which are not granted or are terminated.

                    (d)  Sale of House.  Employer agrees to pay or
                         -------------
     reimburse Employee for the real estate broker's commission and other
     customary closing costs in connection with the sale of Employee's
     house in Virginia, subject to appropriate gross-up for federal and
     state income tax purposes.  If Employee sells such house for less than
     $408,000, Employer shall reimburse Employee for such short-fall up to
     a maximum amount of $33,000.

                    (e)  Vacation.  Employee shall be entitled to four (4)
                         --------
     weeks vacation with pay per year.

                    (f)  Taxes.  Employee understands that any and all
                         -----
     payments described in this Agreement will be subject to such tax

                                       5
<PAGE>
     

     treatment as applies thereto, and to such withholding as may be
     required under applicable tax laws.

               5.  No Competition.  Employee agrees that during the term of
                   --------------
     this Agreement he will not, within the continental United States,
     directly or indirectly, engage or participate or make any financial
     investments in or become employed by or render advisory or other
     services to or for any person, firm or corporation, or in connection
     with any business activity, other than that of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies, directly or indirectly in competition with any
     of the business operations or activities of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies.  Nothing herein contained, however, shall
     restrict Employee from making any investments in any company whose
     stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded
     in the over-the-counter market, so long as such investment does not
     give him the right to control or influence the policy decisions of any
     such business or enterprise which is or might be directly or
     indirectly in competition with any of such business operations or
     activities of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies.

               6.  Confidentiality; etc.
                   ---------------------

                    (a)  Employee will not divulge, furnish or make
     accessible to anyone (other than in the regular course of business of
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies) any knowledge or
     information with respect to confidential or secret methods, processes,
     plans or materials of Employer or any of its

                                        6

<PAGE>
     

     subsidiary companies, or with respect to any other confidential or
     secret aspects of the business of Employer or any of its subsidiary
     companies.

                    (b)  Employee agrees to communicate and to make known
     to Employer all knowledge possessed by him relating to any methods,
     developments, inventions and/or improvements, whether patented,
     patentable or unpatentable which concerns in any way the business of
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies or the general industry of
     which they are a part, from the time of entering upon employment until
     the termination thereof, and whether acquired by Employee before or
     during the term of his employment; provided, however, that nothing
                                        --------  -------
     herein shall be construed as requiring any such communication where
     the method, development, invention and/or improvement is lawfully
     protected from disclosure as the trade secret of a third party,
     including, without limitation, any former employer of Employee or by
     any other lawful bar to such communication.

                    (c)  Any methods, developments, inventions and/or
     improvements, whether patentable or unpatentable, along the lines of
     the business of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, which
     Employee may conceive of or make while in the employ of Employer,
     shall be and remain the property of Employer.  Employee agrees
     promptly to communicate and disclose all such methods, developments,
     inventions and/or improvements to Employer and to execute and deliver
     to Employer any instruments deemed necessary

                                       7

<PAGE>
     

     by Employer to effect disclosure and assignment thereof to it. 
     Employee further agrees, on request of Employer, to execute patent
     applications based on such methods, developments, inventions and/or
     improvements, including any other instruments deemed necessary by
     Employer for the prosecution of such patent applications or the
     acquisition of Letters Patent in the United States and/or any foreign
     countries.

                    (d)  Employee agrees that for a period of three (3)
     years from and after the termination or expiration of his employment
     by Employer, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or
     otherwise, he will not:

     or induce any employee of Employer or of any of its subsidiary
     companies to be employed by any person, firm or corporation which is,
     directly or indirectly, in competition with the business or activities
     of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies; or

                        (ii)  directly or indirectly approach any such
     employee for these purposes; or

                       (iii)  authorize or knowingly approve the taking of
     such actions by other persons on behalf of any such person, firm or
     corporation, or assist any such person, firm or corporation in taking
     such action; or

     or induce any person, firm or corporation (other than the

     customer of Employer or of any of its subsidiary companies to become a
     customer for the same or similar products which it purchased from
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, of any other person, firm
     or corporation, and Employee shall not approach any such customer for
     such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of such

                    (e)  Employee agrees that during the term of his
     employment by Employer, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, he
     will not at any time enter into, on behalf of Employer or any of its
     subsidiary companies, or cause Employer or any of its subsidiary com-
     panies to enter into, directly or indirectly, any transactions with
     any business organization in which he or any member of his immediate
     family may be interested as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
     employee, shareholder, lender of money or guarantor.

               7.  Injunctive Relief.  Employee acknowledges that the
                   -----------------
     services to be rendered by him hereunder are of a special, unique and
     extraordinary character and that it would be very difficult or
     impossible to replace such services and further that irreparable

     the event of a violation by Employee of any of the provisions of this
     Agreement, and by reason thereof Employee

     hereof through the date of such termination and to reimburse, pursuant

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------

               AGREEMENT made this 8th day of January, 1996, by and between
     UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation having an
     address at 18 East 48th Street, New York, New York 10017 (hereinafter
     called "Employer"), and SUSAN FEIN ZAWEL (hereinafter called
     "Employee").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :
                              -------------------
               In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter
     contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               1.  Employment.  Employer agrees to employ Employee and
                   ----------
     Employee agrees to serve Employer upon the terms and conditions
     hereinafter set forth.

               2.  Term.  The employment of Employee hereunder shall be
                   ----
     effective and shall commence on December 1, 1995 (the "Effective
     Date") and shall terminate as of the close of business on the date
     three (3) years after the Effective Date (the "Termination Date").

     and President of Employer, devoting her entire business time, energy
     and skill to her duties hereunder.  The principal place of employment
     of Employee shall be at the offices of Employer which are currently
     located in New York, New York.  Employee understands and agrees,
     however, that in connection with her employment hereunder, she may be
     required from time to time to travel on behalf of Employer.  If the
     principal place of employment of the Employee shall change because of
     a change in Employer's offices to a location which is more than 50
     miles from the offices presently located in New York, New York, the
     Employee shall have the option to terminate this Agreement by sending
     written notice of termination to Employer, and thereupon her
     employment pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate and Employee
     shall be entitled to no further payments hereunder, other than (i) for
     any compensation due pursuant to Section 4 hereof through the date of
     such termination, (ii) the reimbursements pursuant to Section 9
     hereof, of any expenses incurred prior to the date of such
     termination, and (iii) the continuation of Employee's base salary

     President-Corporate Communications, Secretary and Associate General
     Counsel of Employer and, in such capacity, to render such
    
                                       2

<PAGE>
     

     managerial, administrative and other services to Employer and its
     subsidiaries as normally are associated with and incident to such
     positions as Employer from time to time may require of her.  If,
     during the term of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Employer
     so determines, in its absolute discretion, to elect Employee to any
     additional office of Employer or its subsidiary companies consistent
     with her position, or a director of its subsidiary companies, Employee
     agrees to accept and serve in such office or capacity, as well as a

     thirty-two thousand dollars ($132,000) per annum, commencing as of the
     Effective Date, payable in accordance with Employer's normal payroll
     practices.  Such salary shall be subject to annual review by
     Employer's Board of Directors and, at the discretion of the Board, may
     be increased, but not decreased below such amount.  Employee shall
     also be eligible to receive annual discretionary bonuses as may be
     granted by Employer's Board of Directors.

                    (b)  Employee Benefit Plans.  During the term of this
                         ----------------------
     Agreement, Employee shall be eligible to participate in any

                                       3

     life insurance, medical, retirement, pension or profit-sharing,
     disability or other benefit plans or arrangements now or hereafter
     generally made available by Employer to executive employees of

                    (e)  Taxes.  Employee understands that any and all
                         -----
     payments described in this Agreement will be subject to such tax
     treatment as applies thereto, and to such withholding as may be
     required under applicable tax laws.

               5.  No Competition.  Employee agrees that during the term of
                   --------------
     this Agreement she will not, within the continental United States,
     directly or indirectly, engage or participate or make any financial
     investments in or become employed by or render advisory or other
     services to or for any person, firm or corporation, or in connection
     with any business activity, other than that of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies, directly or
 
                                       4

<PAGE>
     

     indirectly in competition with any of the business operations or
     activities of Employer and its subsidiary companies.  Nothing herein
     contained, however, shall restrict Employee from making any
     investments in any company whose stock is listed on a national
     securities exchange or actively traded in the over-the-counter market,
     so long as such investment does not give her the right to control or
     influence the policy decisions of any such business or enterprise
     which is or might be directly or indirectly in competition with any of
     such business operations or activities of Employer or any of its
     subsidiary companies.

               6.  Confidentiality; etc.
                   ---------------------

                    (a)  Employee will not divulge, furnish or make
     accessible to anyone (other than in the regular course of business of
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies) any knowledge or
     information with respect to confidential or secret methods, processes,
     plans or materials of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, or
     with respect to any other confidential or secret aspects of the
     business of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies.

                    (b)  Employee agrees to communicate and to make known
     to Employer all knowledge possessed by her relating to any methods,
     developments, inventions and/or improvements, whether patented,
     patentable or unpatentable which concerns in any way the business of
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies or
 
                                       5

<PAGE>
     

     the general industry of which they are a part, from the time of
     entering upon employment until the termination thereof, and whether
     acquired by Employee before or during the term of her employment;
     provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring
     --------  -------
     any such communication where the method, development, invention and/or
     improvement is lawfully protected from disclosure as the trade secret
     of a third party, including, without limitation, any former employer
     of Employee or by any other lawful bar to such communication.

                    (c)  Any methods, developments, inventions and/or
     improvements, whether patentable or unpatentable, along the lines of
     the business of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, which
     Employee may conceive of or make while in the employ of Employer,
     shall be and remain the property of Employer.  Employee agrees
     promptly to communicate and disclose all such methods, developments,
     inventions and/or improvements to Employer and to execute and deliver
     to Employer any instruments deemed necessary by Employer to effect
     disclosure and assignment thereof to it.  Employee further agrees, on
     request of Employer, to execute patent applications based on such
     methods, developments, inventions and/or improvements, including any
     other instruments deemed necessary by Employer for the prosecution of
     such patent applications or the acquisition of Letters Patent in the
     United States and/or any foreign countries.

     companies to be employed by any person, firm or corporation which is,
     directly or indirectly, in competition with the business or activities
     of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies; or

                        (ii)  directly or indirectly approach any such
     employee for these purposes; or

                       (iii)  authorize or knowingly approve the taking of
     such actions by other persons on behalf of any such person, firm or
     corporation, or assist any such person, firm or corporation in taking
     such action; or

                        (iv)  directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice
     or induce any person, firm or corporation (other than the U.S.
     Government or its agencies) who or which on the date hereof is, or at
     any time during the period of employment hereunder shall be, a
     customer of Employer or of any of its subsidiary companies to become a
     customer for the same or similar products which it purchased from
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, of any other person, firm
     or corporation, and Employee

     shall not approach any such customer for such purpose or authorize or

     panies to enter into, directly or indirectly, any transactions with
     any business organization in which she or any member of her immediate
     family may be interested as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
     employee, shareholder, lender of money or guarantor.

               7.  Injunctive Relief.  Employee acknowledges that the
                   -----------------
     services to be rendered by her hereunder are of a special, unique and
     extraordinary character and that it would be very difficult or
     impossible to replace such services and further that irreparable
     injury would be sustained by Employer and its subsidiary companies in
     the event of a violation by Employee of any of the provisions of this
     Agreement, and by reason thereof Employee consents and agrees that if
     she violates any of the provisions of this Agreement, Employer shall
     be entitled to an injunction to be issued by any court of competent
     jurisdiction restraining her from committing or continuing any
     violation of this Agreement.

               10.  Disability.  If Employee shall be incapacitated by
                    ----------
     reason of mental or physical disability or otherwise during the term
     of this Agreement so that she is prevented from performing her

     Employer shall have no further obligations hereunder, other than to
     pay to Employee's estate any compensation due pursuant to Section 4
     hereof through the date of such termination and to reimburse, pursuant
     to Section 9 hereof, any expenses incurred by Employee through the
     date of such termination.

                                                                   ----

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
                              --------------------

               AGREEMENT made this 29th day of February, 1996, by and
     between UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation having

     (hereinafter called "Employer"), and JAMES H. PERRY (hereinafter called
     "Employee").

                              -------------------

               In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter
     contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

               1.  Employment.  Employer agrees to employ Employee and
                   ----------
     Employee agrees to serve Employer upon the terms and conditions
     hereinafter set forth.

               2.  Term.  The employment of Employee hereunder shall be
                   ----
     effective and shall commence on December 1, 1995 (the "Effective
     Date") and shall terminate as of the close of business on the date two
     (2) years after the Effective Date (the "Termination Date").  The
     period from the Effective Date through the Termination Date is
     referred to as the term of this Agreement.

               3.  Duties and Extent of Services.  Employee agrees to serve

     and President of Employer, devoting his entire business time, energy
     and skill to his duties hereunder.  The principal place of employment
     of Employee shall be at the offices of Employer which are currently
     located in New York, New York.  Employee understands and agrees,
     however, that in connection with his employment hereunder, he may be
     required from time to time to travel on behalf of Employer.  If the
     principal place of employment of the Employee shall change because of
     a change in Employer's offices to a location which is more than 50
     miles from the offices presently located in New York, New York, the
     Employee shall have the option to terminate this Agreement by sending
     written notice of termination to Employer, and thereupon his
     employment pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate and Employee
     shall be entitled to no further payments hereunder, other than (i) for
     any compensation due pursuant to Section 4 hereof through the date of
     such termination, (ii) the reimbursements pursuant to Section 9
     hereof, of any expenses incurred prior to the date of such
     termination, and (iii) the continuation of Employee's base salary and
     employee benefits pursuant to Sections 4(a) and (b) hereof for a
     period of six (6) months from the date of such termination, but not
     beyond the Termination Date.

               The principal duties of Employee shall be to serve as
     Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of Employer and, in such

     
                                       2

     capacity, to render such managerial, administrative and other services
     to Employer and its subsidiaries as normally are associated with and
     incident to such positions as Employer from time to time may require
     of him.  If, during the term of this Agreement, the Board of Directors
     of Employer so determines, in its absolute discretion, to elect
     Employee to any additional office of Employer or its subsidiary
     companies consistent with his position, or a director of its
     subsidiary companies, Employee agrees to accept and serve in such
     office or capacity, as well as a director of Employer, for no addi-
     tional compensation or remuneration.

               4.   Compensation.

     twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) per annum, commencing as of
     the Effective Date, payable in accordance with Employer's normal

     be increased, but not decreased below such amount.  Employee shall
     also be eligible to receive annual discretionary bonuses as may be
     granted by Employer's Board of Directors.

                         ----------------------
     Agreement, Employee shall be eligible to participate in any life
     insurance, medical, retirement, pension or profit-sharing, disability

     treatment as applies thereto, and to such withholding as may be
     required under applicable tax laws.

               5.  No Competition.  Employee agrees that during the term of
                   --------------
     this Agreement he will not, within the continental United States,
     directly or indirectly, engage or participate or make any financial
     investments in or become employed by or render advisory or other
     services to or for any person, firm or corporation, or in connection
     with any business activity, other than that of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies, directly or indirectly in competition with any
     of the business operations or activities of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies.  Nothing herein contained,

     however, shall restrict Employee from making any investments in any
     company whose stock is listed on a national securities exchange or
     actively traded in the over-the-counter market, so long as such
     investment does not give him the right to control or influence the
     policy decisions of any such business or enterprise which is or might
     be directly or indirectly in competition with any of such business
     operations or activities of Employer or any of its subsidiary
     companies.

               6.  Confidentiality; etc.
                   ---------------------

     information with respect to confidential or secret methods, processes,
     plans or materials of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, or
     with respect to any other confidential or secret aspects of the
     business of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies.

                    (b)  Employee agrees to communicate and to make known
     to Employer all knowledge possessed by him relating to any methods,
     developments, inventions and/or improvements, whether patented,
     patentable or unpatentable which concerns in any way the business of
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies or the general industry of
     which they are a part, from the time of entering upon employment until
     the termination thereof, and
     
                                       5

<PAGE>
     

     whether acquired by Employee before or during the term of his
     employment; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed
                 --------  -------
     as requiring any such communication where the method, development,
     invention and/or improvement is lawfully protected from disclosure as
     the trade secret of a third party, including, without limitation, any
     former employer of Employee or by any other lawful bar to such
     communication.

                    (c)  Any methods, developments, inventions and/or
     improvements, whether patentable or unpatentable, along the lines of
     the business of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, which

     promptly to communicate and disclose all such methods, developments,
     inventions and/or improvements to Employer and to execute and deliver
     to Employer any instruments deemed necessary by Employer to effect
     disclosure and assignment thereof to it.  Employee further agrees, on
     request of Employer, to execute patent applications based on such
     methods, developments, inventions and/or improvements, including any
     other instruments deemed necessary by Employer for the prosecution of
     such patent applications or the acquisition of Letters Patent in the
     United States and/or any foreign countries.

     years from and after the termination or expiration of his

     employment by Employer, whether pursuant to the terms of this
     Agreement or otherwise, he will not:

                         (i)  directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice
     or induce any employee of Employer or of any of its subsidiary
     companies to be employed by any person, firm or corporation which is,
     directly or indirectly, in competition with the business or activities
     of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies; or

                        (ii)  directly or indirectly approach any such
     employee for these purposes; or

                       (iii)  authorize or knowingly approve the taking of
     such actions by other persons on behalf of any such person, firm or
     corporation, or assist any such person, firm or corporation in taking
     such action; or

                        (iv)  directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice
     or induce any person, firm or corporation (other than the U.S.
     Government or its agencies) who or which on the date hereof is, or at
     any time during the period of employment hereunder shall be, a
     customer of Employer or of any of its subsidiary companies to become a
     customer for the same or similar products which it purchased from
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, of any other person, firm
     or corporation, and Employee shall not approach any such customer for
     such purpose or autho-

     rize or knowingly approve the taking of such actions by any other
     person.

                    (e)  Employee agrees that during the term of his 
     employment by Employer, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, he
     will not at any time enter into, on behalf of Employer or any of its
     subsidiary companies, or cause Employer or any of its subsidiary com-
     panies to enter into, directly or indirectly, any transactions with
     any business organization in which he or any member of his immediate
     family may be interested as a partner, trustee, director, officer,
     employee, shareholder, lender of money or guarantor.

               7.  Injunctive Relief.  Employee acknowledges that the
                   -----------------
     services to be rendered by him hereunder are of a special, unique and
     extraordinary character and that it would be very difficult or
     impossible to replace such services and further that irreparable
     injury would be sustained by Employer and its subsidiary companies in
     the event of a violation by Employee of any of the provisions of this
     Agreement, and by reason thereof Employee consents and agrees that if
     he violates any of the provisions of this Agreement, Employer shall be
     entitled to an injunction to be issued by any court of competent
     jurisdiction restraining him from committing or continuing any
     violation of this Agreement.

               10.  Disability.  If Employee shall be incapacitated by
                    ----------

     Employee, and thereupon his employment pursuant to this Agreement

     hereof through the date of such termination and to reimburse, pursuant
     to Section 9 hereof, any expenses incurred by Employee through the

To Our Shareholders
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     United Industrial Corporation's net income in 1995 was $888,000 (7(cents)
     per share) compared with $5,212,000 (43(cents) per share) in 1994. Sales
     were $227 million in 1995 compared with $210 million in 1994. Business
     backlog at the end of 1995 was $206 million compared with $218 million at
     the end of 1994. During the year quarterly cash dividends of 7(cents),
     7(cents), 7(cents), and 5(cents) were paid, totaling 26(cents) a share.

          After a long and distinguished tenure that began in 1960, Bernard Fein
     retired as President and Chairman of the Board of United Industrial
     Corporation. Harold S. Gelb, a private investor and a former senior partner
     of Ernst & Young, was elected Chairman. In the latter part of 1995, I
     accepted the position of UIC's President and Chief Executive Officer. I
     will continue to serve as President and CEO of AAI Corporation, UIC's
     largest subsidiary.

          United Industrial Corporation in 1995 experienced a year of both
     disappointment and promise. The disappointments are evident from the
     figures above, which show a steep decline in earnings. Profits were
     depleted by a number of charges arising largely from reserves taken on
     several contracts. The primary problem is an ongoing AAI program to upgrade
     four SH-60 helicopter training simulators for the U.S. Navy. This program
     has a long history going back to 1991. Over the years, substantial cost
     overruns have occurred principally as a result of actions by the customer,
     including requests for the performance of additional work and expensive
     schedule delays. We have filed a legal claim in the Armed Services Board of
     Contract Appeals, seeking monetary damages plus interest. While awaiting
     the outcome of this appeal, we have set aside reserves that we estimate
     will be adequate to finish the program in 1998. This has resulted in a
     pretax charge to 1995 earnings of approximately $6.6 million, which
     includes amounts to cover the costs of consolidating our helicopter
     simulator operations from Florida and North Carolina to our main facility
     at Hunt Valley, Maryland. To minimize the potential financial risk on
     future contracts, AAI has improved its processes for the acquisition of new
     business and the management of ongoing programs.

          AAI's crucial Defense Systems business increased this year despite
     massive industry consolidation. There was steady growth in sales for
     Pioneer unmanned air vehicles and for the widely used Moving Target
     Simulator (MTS II). The value of the JointSTARS simulator project was
     augmented. AAI's subsidiary Engineering Support, Inc. (ESI) had a notable
     competitive win in 1995, with the attainment of a contract for support of
     the Army's Gunnery Maintenance Trainer. ACL Technologies, an AAI subsidiary
     that manufactures fluid test systems, garnered strong bookings and sales.

          Weather Systems scored successes not only with its well-known ASOS,
     which has been installed at hundreds of U.S. airports, but also with its
     newer NEXWOS and ASOS II systems. The latter chalked up sales in both Saudi
     Arabia and Latvia. Transportation Systems progressed towards its goal of
     becoming a leading American producer of transit components, expanding its
     position in both overhaul and manufacturing. However, when the Los Angeles
     Transit Authority reduced by 25 percent its order for light rail cars from
     Siemens Transportation Systems, it became unprofitable for AAI to produce
     the car shells for this project. Consequently, in line with our
     determination to ensure profitability, we agreed with Siemens to terminate
     our subcontracting arrangement.

          In an auspicious event this year, the International Standards
     Organization granted AAI its highest level of certification, ISO 9001. This
     quality standard is recognized by more than 100

2

<PAGE>

     countries, and thus is vital to AAI's effort to grow its international
     sales. Moreover, since the U.S. military is urging defense contractors to
     use commercial standards, AAI's top ISO ranking will strengthen our
     position in the increasingly competitive Department of Defense marketplace.

          As for UIC's other subsidiaries, all three showed outstanding results
     in 1995. For Symtron Systems, Inc., major sales of its Airport Rescue Fire
     Fighter Trainers to Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Washington Dulles
     International Airport, and the Helena, Montana, regional airport were the
     chief contributors to a banner year. Detroit Stoker Company registered a 17
     percent increase in sales, the lion's share attributable to its versatile
     Hydrograte(R) stoker that can create energy from an amazing variety of
     biomass fuels, ranging from paper mill wood waste to sunflower hulls.
     Lastly, Neo Products, aided by new injection-molding equipment, nearly
     doubled the previous year's operating income.

          I am pleased to announce three important corporate appointments: James
     H. Perry, UIC's Treasurer, as Chief Financial Officer; Robert W. Worthing,
     an experienced member of AAI's senior management team, as UIC's Vice
     President and General Counsel; and Susan Fein Zawel, UIC's Secretary and
     Associate General Counsel, as Vice President Corporate Communications.

          The future--1996 and beyond--holds promise for UIC. In 1995 a
     comprehensive strategic plan was formulated. The plan identified the
     Company's core competencies, its markets and strategies for growth. In the
     near term, we will focus on increasing market share in transit, firefighter
     training, and weather reporting systems while maintaining a strong position
     in the defense and stoker businesses. And, of course, the overall goal is
     the enhancement of shareholder value.

A Message from Harold S. Gelb, Chairman of the Board

          As the new Chairman of the Board of United Industrial Corporation, I
     welcome this opportunity to tell you about important changes in Board
     membership. Bernard Fein retired after 35 years of outstanding
     contributions to UIC and was named Chairman Emeritus. I was elected
     Chairman of the Board and Howard M. Bloch was elected Vice Chairman.
     Following the resignations of directors Maurice Rosenthal and Rick Bierman,
     we were fortunate to add to our Board Edward C. "Pete" Aldridge, Jr.,

The Year in Review
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


AAI CORPORATION
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     For AAI, 1995 was a year in which sales were up and the company became more
     profitable and competitive. But charges related to past contracts eroded
     earnings.

          Most serious was the charge on a single defense program that AAI was
     awarded years ago. Management in 1995 set aside financial reserves that are
     expected to be sufficient to offset the substantial added costs incurred on
     this contract. Legal claims have been filed to recover contract
     expenditures to which AAI believes it is entitled.

          On the positive side, AAI in 1995 achieved the coveted ISO 9001
     Certification, an internationally recognized quality standard for both
     commercial and defense work. Certification will give the company an edge in
     the struggle for competitive contracts. In its core Department of Defense
     (DOD) business, AAI maintained leadership in computerized training
     simulators and unmanned air vehicles. In the non-DOD marketplace, AAI grew
     its weather monitoring business, with the introduction of an important new
     product, and its transit business, with contracts for the refurbishing of
     passenger rail cars. AAI's wholly owned subsidiaries, Engineering Support,
     Inc. and ACL Technologies, both enhanced their market share.


Defense Systems

     AAI's highly regarded computerized training simulators contribute
     significantly to the company's defense sales. Designed and built-to-order
     for military customers, AAI simulators provide a superior, cost-effective
     way for troops to master the intricacies of sophisticated weapons systems.
     An example is AAI's popular Moving Target Simulator (MTS II), which enables
     trainees to practice aiming and firing antiaircraft missiles without danger
     to themselves or others. Within a 40-foot-diameter dome, the MTS II
     computer projects graphic images with realistic infrared signatures of
     air-combat scenarios. As simulated missiles are fired, the computer records
     hits and misses. MTS II systems are presently in service in the U.S. and
     five other countries. A $6 million order from Japan was received in 1995
     and will be delivered in 1996.

- ------------------------------

          AAI is currently building an important new simulator for the U.S. Air
     Force: the computerized maintenance trainer for the Joint Surveillance
     Target Attack Radar System (JointSTARS). An airborne ground-surveillance
     system, JointSTARS employs a specially equipped E-8C aircraft to monitor
     troop maneuvers and other ground activity, then relays the information to a
     command center. Using the JointSTARS maintenance trainer, Air Force

                                                                              5
<PAGE>

     technicians learn how to service the radar sensor and computers that are
     the heart of the apparatus. In 1995 the Air Force expanded the AAI project
     by enlarging the trainer's specifications and exercising an option for a
     second one. Total value of the contract is now over $17 million.

          Most of the electronic combat trainers used by the U.S. armed forces
     were built by AAI; at present, two different systems are in production. The
     Simulator for Electronic Combat Training, a computer-based system that
     generates a synthetic electronic combat environment, is scheduled for
     completion and delivery in August 1996. And the Compass Call Mission
     Simulator is receiving major modification under a 1995 Air Force contract
     worth $3.5 million, with an additional $4 million anticipated in 1996.

          AAI is part of a team that in 1995 was awarded the first phase of an
     innovative program to develop the Fire Support Combined Arms Tactics
     Trainer (FSCATT), a simulator that provides tactical experience to howitzer
     crews. FSCATT is an example of what many regard as the next generation in
     training simulators: distributive interactive systems. Thus, howitzer crews
     using FSCATT will be able to interact with soldiers using other simulator
     training systems--such as drivers of simulated tanks, or pilots of
     simulated airplanes--all within the same virtual reality battlefield. AAI's
     share of the initial development contract is $4 million. Production
     contracts will be awarded in 1996.

          Pioneer UAV, Inc., a joint venture between AAI and Israel Aircraft
     Industries, has had a busy year filling U.S. Navy orders for 30 of the
     Pioneer unmanned air vehicles that won plaudits in the Persian Gulf War. In
     September 1995, two months ahead of the scheduled delivery date to the
     Navy, the men and women of the Pioneer production team at AAI proudly
     rolled out the first of the 14-foot-long, 463-pound reconnaissance
     aircraft. The remaining Pioneers will be delivered through September 1996.
     Further orders are expected in 1996, and annual sustainment orders are
     anticipated for the foreseeable future. AAI also has increased its UAV
     business with contracts to augment the capabilities of the Pioneer system,
     refurbish existing aircraft, provide logistical support, and produce spare
     parts. Pioneer pilotless drones are now in use by the U.S. Navy and Marine
     Corps, based on land and aboard ships. In addition, a test system and a
     training system are operational.

ESI

     Engineering Support, Inc. (ESI), a wholly owned AAI subsidiary with nearly
     300 employees, enjoyed an outstanding year in 1995, with over $21 million
     in sales and higher earnings. ESI markets on-site logistical support for
     government-owned equipment, especially simulation systems. The subsidiary
     scored a major win in 1995, overcoming competition to capture a $15.4
     million contract from the U.S. Army's Simulation Training and
     Instrumentation Command for support of Gunnery Maintenance Trainers. ESI
     also won 1995 contracts for logistical support of the Air Force's EF/F-111
     flight simulator at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and SIMNET, the
     simulation networking system headquartered at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and
     deployed worldwide.


ACL Technologies

     AAI's Santa Ana, California, subsidiary, ACL Technologies, a leading
     producer of hydraulic test equipment for the commercial aviation market and
     the Department of Defense, had an excellent year with sales of $13.8
     million, up 35 percent from 1994. Now underway is a project for the
     automation of Hamilton Standard's facility for producing fuel controls for
     jet aircraft. Domestically 1995 orders included contracts from American
     Airlines, Moog, and Aeroquip, the world's largest manufacturer of pressure
     hoses. International orders, about a third of total business, came from
     Korea, Brunei, Turkey, Indonesia, Singapore, United Kingdom, South Africa,
     Brazil, and China.


Weather Systems

     In 1995 AAI deployed 148 additional Automated Surface Observing Systems
     (ASOS) at the nation's airports, as specified by the company's recently
     restructured contract with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
     Administration (NOAA). Nearly 700 airports now have ASOS installations. The
     revised contract extends the NOAA-funded program to run through 1997 and
     increases its total value by $10 million. AAI is also actively pursuing
     several other ASOS markets and has booked 15 sales to the U.S. Air Force
     for 1996.

          AAI is proud of ASOS. Designed and assembled at the company's Hunt
     Valley, Maryland, facility, it has proved its effectiveness under the most
     severe climatic conditions on the planet. In 1995 AAI shipped two systems
     for Greenland--the fifth and sixth systems to be installed there--and the
     Navy has already set up two systems in Antarctica. Repeat orders for ASOS
     from such demanding locations attest to the reliability and durability of
     the product.

          AAI's newly introduced Next Generation Weather Observation System
     (NEXWOS) meets the need for a technologically advanced but lower-priced
     product. The cost advantage of NEXWOS makes it especially attractive for
     smaller airports, heliports, and offshore oil platforms. During its first
     year, NEXWOS was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and won
     contracts from customers in North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana,
     Virginia,

                                                                               9
<PAGE>

     South Dakota, and Connecticut. Preliminary indications are that sales will
     grow significantly in 1996.

          ASOS II, an international version of NEXWOS, was successfully launched
     in 1995 with a 22-system sale to Saudi Arabia and a contract from Latvia
     for Riga International Airport. ASOS II was displayed at the World
     Meteorological Organization Conference in Geneva and also at the Paris Air
     Show.


Transportation Systems

     AAI's transportation subsidiary, Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI), has
     fulfilled the first phase of its contract to produce a fleet of 61 electric
     trolley buses for the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority in Dayton,
     Ohio. A joint venture between AAI and a Czech Republic firm, SKODA, ETI
     accomplished the on-time delivery of three production prototype trolley
     buses. These nonpolluting vehicles are funded in large part by Federal
     Transit Administration clean air funds. After customer evaluation and
     approval, full-scale production will begin in late spring 1996. Meanwhile,
     ETI is competing for a sizable trolley contract to be awarded by San
     Francisco in 1996 and is seeking other opportunities elsewhere in the U.S.
     market.

AAI transportation is expanding
- -------------------------------

overhaul and manufacturing.
- -------------------------------

          During 1995 AAI's transportation division expanded its position in
     both transit overhaul and transit manufacturing. This work requires precise
     heavy fabrication and welding skills that AAI has perfected over the years
     while working on Department of Defense hardware.

          In transit overhaul, a $2.4 million contract to refurbish 28 MARC II
     heavy rail cars for the Maryland Department of Transportation commuter rail
     service was successfully completed as scheduled. Another transit project
     now in progress calls for the repair of 111 trucks--the assembly to which
     train axles and wheels are attached--for Maryland's light rail system that
     connects Baltimore and its suburbs.

          In transit manufacturing, AAI is fabricating a large number of trucks
     and bolster beams for the Southeast Pennsylvania Transit Authority under a
     $4.1 million contract from ABB Australia. The new heavy commuter rail cars
     will serve Philadelphia on the Market-Frankford subway.

          Another manufacturing project, to produce 18 new light rail cars for
     Maryland's Central Light Rail Line, brought AAI $6 million in subcontracts
     from ABB Sweden to build the car shells, and from Adtranz in Elmira, New
     York, to build the trucks. After the propulsion systems and other interior
     equipment are installed, AAI will complete the assembly of the cars. The
     finished trains will provide improved transportation to the
     Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Penn Station (Baltimore), and
     the industrial base around Hunt Valley, Maryland.

SYMTRON SYSTEMS, INC.
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     United Industrial's producer of computer-based simulation systems for
     training firefighters achieved record sales of $11.6 million in 1995, more
     than double the sales of the previous year. Bookings soared 62 percent,
     reflecting substantial contract awards for the company's patented Aircraft
     Rescue Fire Fighter Trainer (ARFFT).

- -----------------------------

          The new contracts came from Chicago O'Hare International Airport,
     Washington Dulles International Airport, and the Helena, Montana, regional
     airport. Installation of these state-of-the-art systems is currently in
     progress at all three sites, with work scheduled to be completed in 1996.

          In contrast to older training systems that burned highly polluting and
     hazardous aviation fuel, Symtron's computer-controlled liquid propane
     system is environmentally friendly and safer to use. The ARFFT includes a
     large mock-up of a crashed fuselage situated in a 125-foot-diameter burn
     area. A computer operator can ignite or extinguish the flames with a single
     keystroke, lessening risk to trainees learning how to rescue passengers
     from burning planes.

          A Structural Fire Fighter Trainer ordered in 1995 for Henderson,
     Nevada, will serve as a regional center at which local firefighters can
     upgrade their skills in combating home and other building fires. Structural
     systems also were purchased this year by a community college in Clinton,
     Michigan, and a fire department in Kassell, Germany.

          Symtron's Military Fire Fighter Trainer Program was awarded $2.7
     million in increased payments on U.S. Navy contracts for systems that teach
     sailors how to deal with shipboard blazes. The recently passed Defense
     Appropriation bill offers the company the prospect of orders for a
     significant number of structural fire trainers to be installed on U.S. Army
     bases.

          In development at Symtron is a Mobile Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighter
     Trainer (MARFFT), a portable system that will be transported from site to
     site on two trailers and shared inexpensively among smaller airports.

DETROIT STOKER COMPANY
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     United Industrial's energy-systems subsidiary registered a sharp gain in
     operating income in 1995 as a result of a 17 percent increase in sales
     coupled with savings from cost containment measures.

          More than 75 percent of Detroit's 1995 contracts were for
     Hydrograte(R) stokers and upgrading of existing stoker installations. The
     Hydrograte has long been popular in the pulp and paper industry, where wood
     waste is burned to generate process steam and electricity. This year the
     largest Hydrograte ever built at Detroit's Monroe, Michigan, facility was
     exported to Fraser Paper in New Brunswick, Canada. In addition to wood
     waste, other renewable biomass fuels are finding increasing favor
     worldwide, including such agricultural waste products as bagasse, olive
     pits, chicken litter, and sunflower hulls. A Hydrograte now being installed
     by Detroit in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, for the Cargill Corporation will be
     fueled with sunflower hulls. Combustion of biomass generally produces
     extremely little pollution, as compared with the fossil fuels.

- ------------------------------

          Aftermarket sales of stoker replacement parts and retrofits remained
     strong in 1995, delivering profit margins that contributed significantly to
     earnings. Over the past two years Detroit's experienced sales and service
     personnel boosted the company's market share of this business by about 6
     percent.

          Detroit's product line of natural gas and oil burners are being
     successfully installed on both new and older industrial boilers. The
     burners are designed to meet federal and state environmental laws requiring
     low emission levels of nitrous oxides. A recent contract from General
     Motors involved the repowering and fuel conversion of two existing boilers
     at the firm's Pontiac, Michigan, fabrication plant.


NEO PRODUCTS COMPANY
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     United Industrial's Chicago-based producer of custom thermoplastic parts
     saw record sales in 1995 and operating income nearly double that of 1994.
     Neo is molding all of the fuel tank reservoirs for two 1997 General Motors
     car models. A $4.7 million supply agreement with Tenex Corporation calls
     for the fabrication of a variety of office wastebaskets. Neo expects to
     continue its investment in modern capital equipment.


                                                                              15

   of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Results of Operations

     Net sales of $227,398,000 in 1995 rose by 8% from 1994. The increase was
attributable to all segments. In the defense segment, which recorded a 7%
increase, the Company's diversification into transportation systems has resulted
in initial program sales, and the recovery of the commercial airline industry
has boosted sales of hydraulic test equipment. The synergies achieved through
the combination of Symtron's engineering capabilities and AAI's manufacturing
and installation capabilities have contributed to a better than twofold increase
in sales of firefighter systems. In 1994, due to an overall reduction in defense
spending, net sales of $209,727,000 were $43,266,000 lower than 1993 net sales
of $252,993,000. The defense segment's business is heavily influenced by changes
in the budgetary plans and procurement policies of the U.S. Government.
Reductions in defense spending and program cancellations in recent years have
adversely affected operating results. Further, government contracts are subject
to price redetermination under certain circumstances and may be terminated for
the convenience of the government. The Company intends to maintain a strong
focus on Department of Defense (DOD) opportunities and believes it is well
positioned over the long term to benefit from the demand for advanced
technological systems by the U.S. and foreign governments. Sales to agencies of
the U.S. Government, primarily by the defense segment, were $154,346,000 in
1995, $159,766,000 in 1994, and $172,169,000 in 1993. The Company's energy
segment recorded a 17% increase in sales in 1995 as compared to 1994, primarily
due to increased volume of sales of Hydrograte stokers. Sales in 1994 trailed
those in 1993 by $2,559,000 generally due to lower stoker sales.

     Gross profit amounted to $45,259,000 or 19.9% in 1995, $46,951,000 or 22.4%
in 1994, and $43,503,000 or 17.2% in 1993. In 1995, the reduction of gross
profit in the defense segment resulted primarily from the recognition of
approximately $10,200,000 of losses on contracts compared to $5,600,000 of
losses in 1994. In 1993, such contract losses were $28,000,000. In 1995, these
losses primarily pertain to reserves taken on one contract: a helicopter
simulator program that eroded the current year's pretax earnings by about
$6,600,000, of which approximately $5,100,000 was recorded in December when the
Company finished its latest estimate to complete. The integration phase of this
project has started and remains on schedule. The Company is optimistic that it
has sufficiently reserved for costs to complete this contract. Also in the
fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a $2,000,000 charge to reflect
certain finished goods and work in progress inventories related to a particular
program at net realizable value. Partially offsetting these charges was the
increased profitability of the Company's hydraulic test equipment business
and growth in sales of certain highly profitable operational and maintenance
training simulators. The increased gross profit in the energy segment was
essentially due to the increased volume and profit margins on sales of
Hydrograte stokers. The increase in gross profit in 1994 compared to 1993
represents improved profit performance by the defense subsidiary, including the
Company's efforts to control costs on certain major long-term contracts,
partially offset by lower sales of stoker equipment at the energy segment.

     Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.1% in
1995, 19.1% in 1994, and 17.2% in 1993. The decrease in 1995 has resulted from
the elimination of certain expenses produced by the Company's organizational
changes in 1994 and 1993, partially offset by a $1,000,000 charge related to the
1994 acquisition of Symtron (see Note 7). The increased percentage in 1994 was
due to the reduction in sales in that year. Interest income was $1,201,000 in
1995, $1,840,000 in 1994, and $3,650,000 in 1993. The decrease in interest
income was principally due to the reduced note receivable balance resulting from
the installment payments on such note receivable which had a 14% interest rate.

                                                                              17

     Interest expense was $2,360,000 in 1995, $3,202,000 in 1994, and $3,011,000
in 1993. Decreased borrowings in 1995 resulted in lower interest expense. In
1994, decreased average borrowings were offset by higher interest rates.

     In 1995, net income of $888,000 decreased $4,324,000 from $5,212,000 in
1994. These results compare to a loss of $12,017,000, before the effect of
changes in accounting, in 1993. The reduction of net income in 1995 resulted
primarily from the recognition of losses of approximately $12,200,000 by the
defense subsidiary on certain long-term contracts and inventory write-offs
mentioned earlier. In the Company's energy segment, increased sales volume and
improved profit margins were the primary reasons behind its improved results.
Net income in 1994 includes a net pension curtailment gain of $928,000 (see Note
11). In 1993, the net loss included a restructuring charge at AAI Corporation of
$22.5 million (see Note 17). A major portion of the charge resulted from the
termination of operations of AAI/MICROFLITE, a business acquired in 1991. Also
in 1993, the net loss was reduced by $1,288,000 for tax credits for research and
experimental expenditures and $994,000 resulting from a net cumulative effect of
changes in accounting principles.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $11,915,000 at the end of 1995,
$6,132,000 at the end of 1994, and $3,906,000 at the end of 1993. The Company's
principal uses of capital during the past several years related to acquisitions,
new projects and the repayment of long-term debt. In January 1994, the Company
acquired Symtron Systems, Inc., a business engaged in the development and
production of patented firefighter trainers (see Note 7). Symtron serves both
government and commercial markets. Net advances of $9,316,000 have been made to
Symtron since its acquisition. The Company anticipates that the receipt of new
contracts will enable Symtron to become self-financing. Symtron's backlog at
December 31, 1995 has more than doubled from a year earlier. In 1995, the
Company made a $1,000,000 payment to the previous shareholders of Symtron based
on the profits on contracts existing at the acquisition date in accordance with
the purchase agreement. Additionally, contingent amounts are payable if certain
pretax profits, as defined in the purchase agreement, are earned for each of
the years in the four year period ending December 31, 1998. Other new
commercial ventures include AAI's entry into the transit systems market and
introduction of the Next Generation Weather Observing System (NEXWOS)and
ASOS II. In 1995, AAI's transportation subsidiary, Electric Transit, Inc.
(ETI), a joint venture between AAI and a Czech Republic firm, SKODA, delivered
on schedule the first pre-production electric trolley bus to the Miami Valley
Regional Transit Authority (MVRTA) for service in the Dayton, Ohio, area.
In 1994, ETI emerged the winner of a competition to build a fleet of 63
(subsequently reduced to 61) electric trolley buses for the MVRTA. Also in
1995, ASOS II sales were recorded to Saudi Arabia and Latvia. The Company
intends to continue increasing its diversification into non-DOD markets.

     The Company expects to meet its cash requirements for 1996, including
amounts necessary to fund new business ventures described above, from operations
and borrowings under its exisiting lines of credit. The Company's defense
subsidiary has a revolving credit arrangement and note agreement that contain
restrictive covenants with respect to payment of dividends or advances and loans
to the Company. These restrictions have not materially affected the Company's
ability to meet its cash requirements. Annual installment payments of $8,540,000
on the Company's note receivable concluded in February 1995; interest income
related to this note decreased by approximately $997,000 in 1995 and $1,196,000
in 1994. Factors relating to the amounts of cash from operating, financing and
investing activities are explained in detail in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.

     The Company's cash dividends of $.26 per share in 1995, $.28 per share in
1994, and $.44 per share in 1993, amounted to aggregate payments of $3,165,000
in 1995, $3,425,000 in 1994, and $5,381,000 in 1993. In 1994, the Company's
customary fourth quarter dividend was declared in February 1995 ($.07 per
share).

     The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.1 at the end of
1995, 2.3 at the end of 1994, and 2.0 at the end of 1993. The current ratio
decreased in 1995 principally due to the increase in the current portion of
long-term debt and increased in 1994, principally due to reductions in accounts
receivable from the U.S. Government and short-term borrowings.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Capital expenditures were $5,705,000 in 1995, $4,146,000 in 1994, and
$5,931,000 in 1993. There are no material commitments for acquisition of capital
assets as of December 31, 1995.

     On October 13, 1994, AAI entered into a two-year revolving credit agreement
with two banks for $20,000,000, including a commitment for up to $10,000,000 for
commercial letters of credit. The revolving credit is limited to a percentage of
the eligible accounts receivable, as defined. Immediately prior to entering into
this credit facility, AAI prepaid $5,000,000 of the $25,000,000 notes payable
with certain insurance companies, thereby reducing the outstanding principal
balance to an aggregate of $20,000,000. (See Note 6 for further information
concerning these agreements.)

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, AAI's net assets of approximately
$68,400,000 and $66,000,000, respectively, were restricted under debt
agreements.

     Under an additional $9,000,000 line-of-credit agreement with a bank, which
expires June 30, 1996, the Company may borrow up to $9,000,000 including a
commitment for up to $4,000,000 of commercial letters of credit. A wholly owned
subsidiary is also a party to this agreement and may use up to $1,000,000 of the
line-of-credit. At December 31, 1995 the unused portion of this credit line was
$4,000,000. This agreement incorporates the covenants of the note purchase
guarantee agreement and is guaranteed by a subsidiary of the Company. The
Company believes it will be able to renew this agreement or obtain comparable
financing on substantially similar terms.

     Long-term debt less the current portion amounted to $13,750,000,
$20,000,000, and $25,000,000 at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The debt amounted to 13.8%, 18.4% and 22.6% of total capitalization in 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively.

     Earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of
the common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the assumed exercise of
all stock options having exercise prices less than the average market price of
the common stock using the treasury stock method.

Environmental and Other Litigation

     The Company and the State of Arizona signed a Consent Decree and Work Plan
to settle a suit related to a small manufacturing facility operated by the
Company between 1959 and 1960. Without admitting liability, and in exchange for
a full release from liability by the State of Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality, the Company has agreed to undertake and pay for a
Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study plus amounts for past and future
costs. The total estimated cost to the Company is approximately $1,900,000,
including the Company's best estimate of its share of the clean-up costs, which
are capped at $1,120,000 (see Note 16).

     In May 1995, a subsidiary of the Company submitted a Request for Equitable
Adjustment to the U.S. Government for approximately $11,800,000 related to a
helicopter simulator contract (see Note 16). While the Company believes that
the formal claims asserted against the customer are meritorious, the customer
has asserted substantive defenses to these claims. Because the proceedings are
currently in the discovery phase, it is not possible at this time to determine
the ultimate amount of recovery of these costs.




                                                                              19

Notes to Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   United Industrial Corporation


NOTE 1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     United Industrial Corporation is a high technology company applying the
majority of its resources to the research, development and production of
military electronics and aerospace systems and components under defense
contracts. Other products include weather monitoring systems, transportation
systems, firefighter training systems, energy systems for industry and
utilities, and plastic products.

     The principal lines of business are defense and related products, energy
generating systems and plastic products.


NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements:

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation:

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in the prior years have been
reclassified to conform to the current year's classifications. The Company
includes in income its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of
unconsolidated investees, when the Company's ownership interest is between 20%
and 50%.

Cash Equivalents:

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount
of these investments reported in the balance sheet approximates their fair
value.

Inventories:

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. At December 31, 1995
and 1994, approximately 7% of total inventory was priced by the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method with the remainder priced at actual, average, or
standard cost. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory pricing had
been used, inventories would have been approximately $4,177,000 higher than
reported on December 31, 1995 and $4,174,000 higher than reported on December
31, 1994. In 1994 certain inventory quantities were reduced, resulting in
liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in
prior years. The effect was to increase net income by $159,000 ($.01 per share)
in 1994.

     Inventories include amounts principally related to long-term contracts of
the Company's defense subsidiary, as determined by the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Sales and gross profit are principally recognized as work
is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total
estimated costs at completion. Alternatively, certain contracts provide for the
production of various units throughout the contract period and these contracts
are accounted for based on the units delivered. See Note 4.

Property and Equipment:

     Property and equipment are stated at cost. The policy of the Company is to
provide for depreciation on the straight-line, sum-of-the-years digits, and
declining-balance methods, by annual charges to operations calculated to
amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
property.

<PAGE>

Earnings per Share:

     Earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of
the common and common equivalent shares outstanding, and assuming exercise of
all stock options having exercise prices less than the average market price of
the common stock using the treasury stock method: 12,193,179 in 1995, 12,241,503
in 1994, and 12,258,693 in 1993.


Stock Based Compensation:

     The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price not less than market value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and intends to
continue to do so.

New Accounting Pronouncements:

     In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which requires impairment losses to be
recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment
are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets' carrying amount. The Company will adopt SFAS
No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996 and, based on current circumstances, does
not believe the effect of adoption will be material.

NOTE 3. TRADE RECEIVABLES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Amounts due from the U.S. Government primarily related to long-term
contracts of the Company's defense subsidiary were as follows:

(Dollars in thousands)                  December 31           1995          1994
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amounts billed                                             $13,882       $18,741
Unbilled recoverable costs and earned fees                   6,521         5,500
Retainage per contract provisions                              247           372
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           $20,650       $24,613
================================================================================

     Billed and unbilled amounts above include $4,405,000 and $4,415,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, related to contracts for which the
Company's defense subsidiary is a subcontractor to other government contractors.
Unbilled recoverable costs and earned fees substantially represent amounts that
will be collected within one year. Retainage amounts will generally be billed
over the next twelve months.

================================================================================

     The inventoried costs associated with long-term contracts include costs and
earnings  ($29,543,000 in 1995 and $32,497,000 in 1994) of incomplete  contracts
not yet billable to the customer. These amounts represent the difference between
the percentage-of-completion  method  of accounting for long-term contracts used
to record operating results by the Company's defense  subsidiary and the amounts
billable to the customer under the terms of the specific contracts. Estimates of
final


                                                                             25
<PAGE>

contract costs and earnings (including earnings subject to future determination
through negotiation or other procedures) are reviewed and revised periodically
throughout the lives of the contracts. Adjustments of earnings resulting from
the revisions are recorded on a current basis. The Company recognized losses of
$10,200,000 ($6,059,000, net of tax benefit, or $.50 per share) during 1995 and
$5,600,000 ($3,461,000 net of tax benefit, or $.28 per share) during 1994,
resulting primarily from revision of cost estimates on certain major long-term
contracts. Some of these losses represent charges for costs incurred in excess
of earnings under a certain government fixed price contract as a result of
changes, delays and disruptions to that contract and that are currently the
subject of formal claims asserted by the Company against the customer.

Costs and earnings in excess of billings include amounts on certain government
contracts in excess of negotiated contract value. These amounts totalled
approximately $12,000,000 at December 31, 1995 and $11,205,000 at December 31,
1994 and are or will be the subject of formal claims if not resolved via
negotiation. The carrying amounts in costs and earnings in excess of billings
are based on costs incurred to date and management's best estimate of the costs
that will be incurred to complete performance of the related contract. Regarding
a certain helicopter simulator program for the U.S. Government, the Company
believes that the formal claims asserted against the customer are meritorious.
The customer has asserted substantive defenses to these claims. Because the
proceedings are currently in the discovery phase, it is not possible at this
time to determine the ultimate amount of recovery of these costs. It is
reasonably possible that the Company's estimates of recoverable costs may change
in the near term as a result of the proceedings with respect to the Company's
formal claims and other ongoing negotiations with the customer. Inventories do
not include any significant amounts of unamortized tooling, learning curve, and
other deferred costs, claims, or other similar items whose recovery is
uncertain.

     The Company has estimated $7,700,000 as the net realizable value of certain
non-contract related finished goods and work in progress inventory. The Company
has identified a number of potential buyers for a substantial portion of the
inventory. However, the Company faces significant competition from other
producers of similar products. It is reasonably possible that the Company may
not be able to finalize an agreement for the sale of this inventory due to
competition and technological limitations. If this occurs, the net realizable
value of this inventory could be reduced in the near term.


NOTE 5.  OTHER ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net pension asset                                         $25,534        $22,337
Patents and other intangible assets                         9,771         11,464
Other                                                       4,219          3,221
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          $39,524        $37,022
================================================================================

     Patents and other intangible assets represent assets acquired in connection
with purchased businesses and are being amortized primarily on a straight-line
basis over 5 to 15 years. Amortization expense amounted to $1,694,000 in 1995,
$1,683,000 in 1994, and $538,000 in 1993. Accumulated amortization amounted to
$5,003,000 and $3,309,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

     During 1994, the Company acquired approximately $7 million of patents and
other intangible assets related to the purchase of Symtron Systems, Inc.

NOTE 6.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In 1992, AAI Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary) entered into a note
purchase agreement with certain insurance companies for $25,000,000. The
proceeds of the note were principally used to repay

26
<PAGE>


the then outstanding borrowings of AAI. The interest rate is 8.65% and is
payable semi-annually. AAI prepaid $5,000,000 of the note in 1994. The remaining
principal is to be repaid in three equal annual payments of $6,250,000
commencing July 31, 1996, and a final payment of $1,250,000 in 1999.

     The Company is a guarantor of the agreement and together with AAI must
comply with certain covenants including, but not limited to, provisions related
to dividends, indebtedness, working capital, net worth, interest coverage and
debt to equity ratios.

     On October 13, 1994, AAI entered into a two year revolving credit agreement
with two banks for $20,000,000, including a commitment for up to $10,000,000 of
commercial letters of credit. The revolving credit is limited to a percentage of
the eligible accounts receivable, as defined. The agreement provides that AAI
may select among several interest rate options. The agreement provides for
restrictive covenants among which are the maintenance of a certain capital base,
as defined; leverage and cash flow coverage ratios; limitations on indebtedness;
and limitations on transfers of funds and use of such funds by the Company or
its wholly owned subsidiaries. Borrowings under the credit agreement and the
outstanding notes with the insurance companies are collateralized by the capital
stock and assets of AAI and its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Company. Such borrowings are guaranteed by the
Company, certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all AAI wholly owned
subsidiaries. There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at
December 31, 1995.

     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, AAI's net assets of approximately
$68,400,000 and $66,000,000, respectively, were restricted under debt
agreements.

     Under an additional line-of-credit agreement with a bank, the Company may
borrow up to $9,000,000 including a commitment for up to $4,000,000 of
commercial letters of credit. Detroit Stoker Company, a wholly owned subsidiary,
also a party to the agreement, may use up to $1,000,000 of the line-of-credit
including commercial letters of credit. At December 31, 1995, the unused portion
of this credit line was $4,000,000 of which $2,000,000 may be used for
commercial letters of credit. The credit agreement expires June 30, 1996, and
requires commitment fees which are not material. The agreement incorporates the
covenants of the note purchase guaranty agreement and is guaranteed by a
subsidiary of the Company.

     The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings under its short-term
revolving credit agreements and long-term debt approximate their fair value.

     Interest expense was $2,360,000 in 1995, $3,202,000 in 1994, and $3,011,000
in 1993. Interest paid was $2,270,000 in 1995, $3,323,000 in 1994, and
$2,950,000 in 1993.

     The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, was 7.14% and 7.67%, respectively.


NOTE 7.  ACQUISITIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On January 18, 1994, the Company purchased all the outstanding shares of
Symtron Systems, Inc. (Symtron), a producer of firefighter training simulators
for government and commercial markets. The purchase price consisted of cash
payments of $2,000,000, assumption of certain liabilities of approximately
$5,900,000, and a contingent payment of up to $1,000,000, based on profits on
contracts existing at the acquisition date. In 1995, the Company made the
contingent payment of $1,000,000, which was classified as selling and
administrative expense in the 1995 financial statements. Additionally,
contingent amounts are payable if certain pretax profits, as defined in the
purchase agreement, are earned for each of the years in the four year period
ending December 31, 1998. Funds generated from operations and an existing line
of credit were utilized to finance the purchase of Symtron.

     The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase; accordingly, the
operations of Symtron are included in the Company's 1994 financial statements
from the date of acquisition. Total revenues of Symtron in 1993 and 1992 were
less than 3% of the consolidated sales of the Company and total assets were less
than 2% of consolidated assets.

                                                                              27
<PAGE>

NOTE 8.  STOCK OPTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In May 1994,  the  shareholders  approved  the 1994  Stock  Option  Plan,  which
provides  for the  granting  of  options  with  respect  to the  purchase  of an
aggregate  of up to 600,000  shares of common  stock of the Company from time to
time to key employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries.  Options granted may
be either  "incentive  stock options," within the meaning of Section 422A of the
Internal Revenue Code, or non-qualified options.


The options are granted at not less than market value at the date of grant and
are exercisable over a period determined by the Board of Directors, but no

NOTE 11. PENSION ARRANGEMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company and its subsidiaries have a number of noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. Plans covering
salaried and management employees provide pension benefits that are based on the
employee's average compensation for the highest five consecutive years before
retirement and years of service. Plans covering hourly employees and union
members generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.
The Company's funding policy for the plans is to make the minimum annual
contributions required by applicable regulations.

     A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost for the plans is
as follows:

================================================================================

     The plans' assets are invested in listed stocks and bonds and
interest-bearing cash equivalents.

     On November 30, 1994, the energy systems segment suspended future benefit
accruals by freezing the non-union employees' defined benefit plan. This
resulted in a pension curtailment gain of $1,092,000 ($675,000 net of taxes or
$.06 per share). The Company replaced the defined benefit plan with a defined
contribution benefit plan. Employee contributions and employer matching are
based on specified formulas. In addition, a curtailment loss of $164,000
($101,000 net of tax benefit or $.01 per share) was recognized for another plan
due to reductions of staffing levels at the Company's defense segment. On
December 31, 1994, the defense segment merged its two defined benefit plans, and
in 1995 converted them into a single cash balance plan. In accordance with the
Cash Balance Plan, a participant's benefit includes the actuarial equivalent of
the participant's accrued benefit under the applicable predecessor

                                                                              29

plan, annual allocations based upon a percentage of salary, and interest earned
on such participant's account. The defense segment also amended its 401 (k) plan
in 1995 to provide for employer matching contributions based on specified
formulas. The effect of the changes in the plans' status has been reflected as
of December 31, 1994.

     During 1993, the curtailment expense was included in the restructuring
charge (see Note 17).

NOTE 12. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, a subsidiary of
the Company sponsors a defined benefit health care plan that provides
postretirement medical benefits to full-time employees who have worked 10 years
and attained age 62 or 30 years of service with the Company. The plan is
non-contributory for retirees and contributory for spouses. The retiree spousal
contributions are adjusted annually. Both the retiree and spousal plan contain
cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The accounting for
the plan anticipates future cost sharing changes to the written plan that are
consistent with the Company's expressed intent to increase the spousal
contribution to the point that the entire cost for spouses will be contributory
at the end of 7 years commencing from January 1, 1996, and limit the amount it
will contribute for retiree insurance costs, as well as each active employee who
later becomes a retiree, to no more than double the amount which the Company
paid for coverage on January 1, 1993. The actuarial and recorded liabilities for
these benefits have not been funded. The accumulated benefit obligation was
determined using the unit credit method and an assumed discount rate of 7.5% in
1995 and 8.5% in 1994. The assumed health care cost trend rate used was 11.6%
for medical and 6.2% for dental decreasing to 6% and 5%, respectively, in the
year 2003. An increase of 1% in the health care trend rate would not materially
increase the cost or accumulated postretirement benefit due to the limit of the
Company not being obligated to pay more than double the amount which the Company
was paying for coverage on January 1, 1993.

     Another subsidiary also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan that
provides postretirement medical and dental benefits to full-time employees who
have worked 10 years and attained age 60. Dental benefits cease for both retiree
and spouse once the retiree reaches age 65. Surviving spouses are eligible for
pre-retirement death benefits. Employees aged 55, but less than 60, with at
least 20 years of service receive only medical benefits commencing when the
retiree reaches age 65. No dental benefit is provided. The accumulated benefit
obligation was determined using the unit credit method and an assumed discount
rate of 7.25% in 1995 and 8.5% in 1994. The assumed health care cost trend rate
was 11.3% decreasing to 6% in 10 years. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A 1% increase in
the health care trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 1995 by $1,256,000 at year-end 1996. The effect of a
1% increase in the health care trend rate would not materially increase the net
periodic cost.

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," which requires that the projected future cost of providing
postretirement benefits, such as health and life insurance, be recognized as an
expense as employees render service instead of when the benefits are paid. The
effect of adopting the new rules increased the 1993 loss before the cumulative
effect of accounting changes by $693,000 ($441,000, or $.04 per share net of tax
benefit). The cumulative effect of this change in accounting increased the 1993
net loss by $12,890,000 or $1.05 per share net of tax benefit.

     The costs of certain health care provided by the Company for eligible
retired employees were $1,694,000 in 1995, $1,719,000 in 1994, and $1,177,000 in
1993.

NOTE 13. INDUSTRY SEGMENTS DATA
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of
products in three principal industries: electronics, aerospace, firefighter
training, and ordnance systems for defense and other government and
non-government entities in the United States and abroad; energy systems for
industries and utilities; and specialty plastic products.

     Sales to agencies of the United States Government, primarily by the defense
segment, were $154,346,000 in 1995, $159,766,000 in 1994, and $172,169,000 in
1993. No single customer, other than the United States Government, accounted for
10 percent or more of net sales in any year. In 1993, export sales amounted to
$31,258,000 and were composed primarily of sales to Asia and Europe. Export
sales in 1995 and 1994 amounted to less than 10% of net sales in those years.


                                                                              31

NOTE 14. INCOME TAXES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS
No. 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. In addition, the effect on deferred taxes
of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment
date. Prior to the adoption of this statement, income tax expense was determined
using the deferred method whereby deferred tax expense was based on items of
income and expense that were reported in different years in the financial
statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the
year the difference originated and reversed.

     The Company elected to adopt SFAS No. 109 by reporting the cumulative
effect of the change in the method for accounting for income taxes as of the
beginning of 1993. The cumulative effect of this accounting change amounted to
$13,884,000 ($1.13 per share), which reduced the 1993 net loss. The effect of
the change in accounting for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 was not
material. Prior years' financial statements have not been restated to apply the
provision of SFAS No. 109.

     Following is a reconciliation of the difference between total tax expense
(benefit) and the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax
rate (34%) to income or (loss) from operations before income taxes:

================================================================================

     In 1993, credits for research and experimental expenditures (research
credit) of $1,288,000 were recognized, thereby increasing the current federal
income tax credit. Approximately $726,000 of this research credit resulted from
payments received in 1993 related to amended returns of prior years and $562,000
principally resulted from the extension of the research credit which had
previously expired in June 1992. No research or experimental credits were
recognized in the provision for income taxes in 1995 and 1994.

     Income tax payments were $7,400,000 in 1995, $3,609,000 in 1993, and a
refund of $2,879,000 in 1994.

NOTE 16. LITIGATION
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company, along with numerous other parties, has been named in five tort
actions relating to environmental matters based on allegations partially related
to a predecessor's operations. These tort actions seek recovery for personal
injury and property damage among other damages. One tort claim is a certified
property and medical class action.

     The Company owned and operated a small facility at a site in the State of
Arizona that manufactured semi-conductors between 1959 and 1960. All such
operations of the Company were sold by 1961. Although this facility may have
used trichloroethylene (TCE) in small quantities, there is no evidence that
this facility released or disposed of TCE at this site.

     On May 18, 1993, the State of Arizona filed suit against the Company
seeking the recovery of investigative costs, injunctive relief to require the
Company to perform a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS), and
ultimately to require the remediation of alleged soil and groundwater
contamination at and near a certain industrial site. Since then the State has
brought in co-defendants whose operations at the site were substantially larger
than those of the Company.

     On June 20, 1995 the Company and the State of Arizona executed an agreement
in principle to settle the litigation. In exchange for a full release from
liability by the State and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the
Company without admitting liability, has agreed to the following:

o    Undertake and pay for the costs of an RI/FS Work Plan, estimated at
     $1,300,000.

o    Pay $125,000 towards past costs incurred by the State of Arizona and the
     Department of Environment Quality.

o    Pay $125,000 towards costs of future remediation and clean-up of the site.
     In addition, at the time the State selects a remedy, the Company agrees to
     an additional contribution in the amount of a percentage of the total
     estimated clean-up cost not to exceed an additional $1,120,000.

o    The Company reserves all rights to seek contribution from other responsible
     parties.

     The Company and the State have signed a Consent Decree and Work Plan
incorporating these terms and conditions. The Consent Decree has been lodged
with the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for a 30-day
public comment period, at the conclusion of which the parties will seek court
approval of the settlement. Resolution of this matter will not have a materially
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. The
Company has provided approximately $1,900,000 based on estimates of the total
cost for the RI/FS, estimates of amounts specified for past costs, and estimates
of future remediation and clean-up costs.

     In May 1995, AAI Systems Management, Inc. (the "subsidiary"), an indirect
subsidiary of the Company, submitted to the U.S. Government (the "customer") a
Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA) totaling approximately $11,800,000 in
connection with a certain contract with the subsidiary. The REA seeks monetary
damages based on costs incurred by the subsidiary arising out of or in
connection with customer directed suspension of work and resulting schedule
delays, additional work directives, and other actions by the customer in
connection with the contract for which contractors are allowed recovery under
the Federal Acquisition Regulations. On July 14, 1995, the subsidiary received
the final decision of the customer rejecting the REA in its entirety. To fully
protect the Company's interest, on October 10, 1995, a Notice of Appeal of the
final decision was filed with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals
seeking monetary damages plus interest. While the Company believes that the
formal claims asserted against the customer are meritorious and the Company will
vigorously pursue recovery of the monies claimed, the customer has asserted
substantive defenses to these claims. Because the proceedings are currently in
the discovery phase, it is not possible at this time to determine the ultimate
amount of recovery of these costs.

     The Company is involved in various other lawsuits and claims, including
certain other environmental matters, arising out of the normal course of its
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability, if
any, under pending litigation, including claims described above, will not have a
materially adverse effect on the Company.


                                                                              35

NOTE 17. RESTRUCTURING
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     On March 29, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan of
reorganization and restructuring of the operations of its defense industry
subsidiary, AAI Corporation. The Company estimated and recorded in the first
quarter a restructuring charge of $23,000,000 ($14,700,000 or $1.20 per share
net of tax benefit). The plan of reorganization and restructuring, which was
considered necessary due to the declining Department of Defense budget and
continuing financial problems of the airline industry, included costs of
organizational and product-line changes, consolidation of facilities and work
force reductions of approximately 300 at AAI and its four subsidiaries. A major
portion of the charge resulted from the termination of the operations of
AAI/MICROFLITE, a manufacturer of flight simulators and training devices, due to
a lack of significant new orders. AAI/MICROFLITE was acquired in 1991.
AAI/MICROFLITE had net sales of $646,000 and incurred pretax losses of
$2,561,000 ($1,690,000 or $.14 per share, net of tax benefit) in 1993.

     As of December 31, 1993, the restructuring program was substantially
completed. During 1994, $750,000 related to the consolidation and
discontinuation of certain manufacturing activities was expended. The net loss
for 1993 includes $22,500,000 of pretax charges ($14,370,000 or $1.17 per share
net of tax benefit) which consisted of $13,822,000 of write-downs to reduce the
carrying value of affected assets, including certain inventories, intangibles
and an office/manufacturing complex at AAI/MICROFLITE, to net realizable value,
$6,683,000 of employee-related expenses associated with the consolidation,
relocation, and termination of certain operations, and $1,995,000 of other
expenses.

     Assets held for sale of $5,439,000 at December 31, 1993, relate to the
remaining assets of AAI/MICROFLITE, including the office/manufacturing complex.
The Company sold these assets in 1994, which resulted in a gain of $1,304,000.
The restructuring program was completed in 1994.

Report of Independent Auditors
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Board of Directors and Shareholders
United Industrial Corporation
New York, New York

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United
Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in Notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes.
