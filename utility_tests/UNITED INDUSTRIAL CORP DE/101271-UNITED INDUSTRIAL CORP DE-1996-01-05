                         Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
United Industrial Corporation


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United
Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 11 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 1993 the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions and income taxes.

                                                            ERNST & YOUNG LLP

A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

In the parent-company-only financial statements, the Company's investment in
subsidiaries is stated at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries since date of acquisition. The Company's share of net income of its
unconsolidated subsidiaries is reflected using the equity method.
Parent-company-only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the
current year's classification.


B. EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF SUBSIDIARIES

In 1993, included in the equity in net loss of subsidiaries is a restructuring
charge of $22,500,000 ($14,370,000, net of tax benefit) regarding the Company's
defense industry subsidiary. A major portion of the charge resulted from the
termination of the operations of AAI/MICROFLITE, a manufacturer of flight
simulators and training devices, due to a lack of new orders. Also, in 1993 the
Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions and income taxes. The implementation of these accounting changes
resulted in a cumulative effect charge against income of $12,890,000, net of tax
benefit and a cumulative effect of $13,884,000 which reduced the 1993 net loss,
respectively. Consequently, the net cumulative effect of these accounting
changes resulted in a $994,000 reduction of the net loss in 1993.
