                                     PART I
                                     -------


     ITEM  1.  BUSINESS

     United Industrial Corporation ("United" or the "Company") was
     incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 14,
     1959 under the name Topp Industries Corporation.  On December 31,
     1959, the name of the corporation was changed to United Industrial
     Corporation.

     The operations of United consist of three principal industry segments: 
     defense, energy systems and plastic products, conducted through four
     wholly-owned subsidiaries.

     Defense
     -------

     AAI Corporation

     AAI Corporation ("AAI") is engaged in research, development and
     manufacture in the following major areas: (1) training and simulation
     systems; (2) automatic test equipment for electronic systems and
     components; (3) ordnance systems; (4) mechanical support systems for
     industrial, military, and marine applications; (5) unmanned air
     vehicle systems; (6) automated weather monitoring systems; and (7) 
     transportation systems.  Since its inception, AAI's business has been
     primarily in support of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DOD").  Since
     1990, the Company has emphasized diversification into other markets to
     reduce its dependence on the DOD.  The United States defense budget
     has been significantly reduced in recent years and this trend is
     expected to continue.  While 1993 sales were similar to 1992, the 1994
     sales decreased $46 million from 1993, primarily in DOD.  In 1994
     approximately 74% of the sales volume of AAI consisted of research,
     development and production of military items under defense contracts. 
     Certain of the contracts currently being worked on by AAI involve
     testing systems for U.S. Navy aircraft, training equipment for the
     U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, and weapons handling systems for the
     U.S. Army.

     The balance of AAI's business consists of work performed in the non-
     Department of Defense markets.  These areas include hydraulic test
     equipment, transportation equipment and weather systems.  AAI was
     awarded a contract for 1,096 weather systems to be installed in
     certain government airports throughout the country.  In 1994, 145
     weather systems were installed bringing total systems installed since
     inception of the contract to 530.

     Because of the variety of its activities, it is not possible to state
     precisely the competitive position of AAI with respect to each of its
     product lines.  In the area of training and simulation systems, AAI is
     one of approximately ten leading organizations developing equipment
     for the U.S. Government.  AAI's ability to obtain orders for training
     and simulation systems is dependent principally on the ability,
     expertise and training of its employees and the level of funding by
     the DOD and foreign military users.  A number of large and small
     companies produce automatic test equipment.  In the area of weapons and










     NYFS11...:\95\78495\0001\1196\FRM31594.Z7D
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

     munitions, AAI ranks high among approximately ten companies
     engaged in development work.  However, AAI's production activity in
     this field is less significant.  AAI began working in the Unmanned Air
     Vehicle business in 1986.  The Company produced the highly successful
     Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle employed by the United States during
     Operation Desert Storm, and presently is pursuing contracts with
     foreign countries.  AAI is one of several large and small competitors
     in this field.

     On January 16, 1992, AAI acquired, through a newly-formed subsidiary
     AAI/ACL Technologies, Inc. ("AAI/ACL"), substantially all of the
     assets and business of ACL Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer of
     hydraulic test equipment principally for the commercial airline
     market.  Business results of AAI/ACL have been less than anticipated
     because of the continued unfavorable economic situation of the
     commercial airline industry in the U.S. and worldwide.

     On March 29, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan of
     reorganization and restructuring whereby, in light of existing
     circumstances such as the declining Department of Defense budget and
     the continuing financial problems of the airline industry and in order
     to position itself for both short and long-term growth, it took a one-
     time restructuring charge.  The charge covered the anticipated cost of
     organizational and product-line changes, the consolidation of
     facilities, and work force reductions of approximately 300
     in AAI and its four subsidiaries.  The non-recurring charge of $22.5
     million ($14,370,00 or $1.17 per share, net of tax benefit) was taken
     during 1993.  As at December 31, 1993, the restructuring program was
     substantially completed.  During 1994, $750,000 was expended.  A major
     portion of the charge resulted from the discontinuance of operations
     of AAI/MICROFLITE.  AAI/MICROFLITE, acquired in 1991, was formerly the
     commercial division of Singer-Link Corporation, a manufacturer of
     flight simulators and training devices for commercial aircraft.   All
     of the remaining assets of AAI/MICROFLITE were sold in 1994.

     AAI's administrative offices and the major part of its manufacturing
     and engineering facilities are located in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

     Symtron Systems, Inc.

     On January 18, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
     shares of Symtron Systems, Inc. ("Symtron"), a producer of fire
     fighter training simulators for the government, military and
     commercial markets.  The purchase price consisted of initial cash
     payments of $2,000,000, assumption of certain liabilities of
     approximately $5,900,000 and contingent payments, not to exceed
     $1,000,000, based on the net worth at specified dates and future
     profits on contracts existing at the acquisition date.  The maximum of
     such payments were earned and payable to the sellers at March 31,
     1995.  Additionally, contingent amounts are payable if certain pretax
     profits, as defined in the purchase agreement, are earned for each of
     the years in the five year period ending December 31, 1998.  Funds
     generated from operations and an existing line of credit were utilized
     to finance the purchase of Symtron.  <PAGE>
<PAGE>


     The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly,
     the operations of Symtron are included in the Company's 1994 financial
     statements.   In 1994 approximately 71% of the sales volume of Symtron 
     consisted of production for commercial customers.  The main office and
     plant of Symtron are located in Fair Lawn, New Jersey.

     Energy Systems
     --------------

     Detroit Stoker Company

     Detroit Stoker Company ("Detroit Stoker") is engaged in the
     manufacture and sale of industrial stokers, combustion systems,
     pneumatic and hydraulic conveying systems, waste to energy incinerator
     equipment, rotary seal feeders, shredders, grapples, and replacement
     parts.  Its products are used for industrial power and municipal power
     plants, utility plants, heating of hospitals, universities and other
     types of public buildings and municipal and industrial incineration
     plants.  Principal customers include public utilities, manufacturing
     and industrial plants, universities, pulp and paper mills and sugar
     mills.  Its waste to energy equipment is used extensively for public
     and private plants burning municipal solid waste as fuel.  The primary
     raw materials used by Detroit Stoker are iron and steel, which are
     available from many sources.  The main office and plant of Detroit
     Stoker are located in Monroe, Michigan.

     The products of Detroit Stoker compete with those of several other
     manufacturers.  Detroit Stoker is presently marketing a liquid and
     gaseous fuel burning product line with low emissions for the power
     industry, primarily for boiler applications.  Potential customers
     would consist of original boiler manufacturers and institutions as
     well as all major industrial manufacturers.  Competition is based upon
     many factors including price, service and performance and competitive
     bidding.

     Its Material Handling division is engaged in the manufacture and sale
     of mechanical conveyors and miscellaneous auxiliary equipment.  Its
     conveyor products are used by industrial, utility and processing
     plants to mechanically convey bulk materials.  The primary raw
     materials used are iron and steel, which are available from many
     sources.  This division competes with several other manufacturers of
     similar equipment.

     Midwest Metallurgical Laboratory, Inc. ("Midwest"), a subsidiary of
     Detroit Stoker, is a foundry engaged in the manufacture of grey and
     ductile iron, stainless steel and special alloyed iron castings.  
     Approximately 85% of the sales of Midwest are to Detroit Stoker.
     Midwest's plant is located in Marshall, Michigan.

     Plastic Products
     ----------------

     Neo Products Co.

     Neo Products Co. ("Neo") engineers and fabricates thermoplastic
     products to the specifications submitted by its customers.  Neo also
     manufactures items for point of purchase display advertising and
     consumer products related primarily to infants, food service equipment
     for a major airline and fuel tank reservoirs for the auto industry.

     Sales to customers of items for point of  purchase display advertising
     represented approximately 28% of sales in 1994.  These sales
     principally consisted of display racks and trays.  Sales of consumer
     end use items represented 57% of sales in 1994.  These sales primarily
     included infant seats, carrier cradles, chairs and waste baskets. 
     Sales to the auto industry represented approximately  11% of sales in
     1994.  The largest customer of Neo accounted for approximately 39% of
     sales in 1994 compared to 32% and 19% in 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
     Neo's main office and plant are located in Chicago, Illinois.

     Neo is engaged in the highly competitive field of thermoplastic
     fabrication.  Neo's operations are in potential and actual competition
     with fabrication facilities of some of its own customers as well as
     other thermoplastic fabricators.  Neo has improved its competitive
     position by increasing the size of its larger injection molding
     presses to accommodate larger size molded parts.  Although it is not
     possible to estimate the position of Neo among competitors in this
     field, it is believed to hold less than 1% market share.  The primary
     raw material used by Neo is plastic resin, which is available from
     many sources.

     For additional information concerning United's subsidiaries reference
     is made to information set forth in the sections entitled "AAI
     Corporation", "Symtron Systems, Inc.", "Detroit Stoker Company" and
     "Neo Products Company" commencing on page 5, of United's 1994 Annual
     Report to Shareholders (the "Annual Report"), which sections are
     incorporated herein by reference.

     General
     -------
     Employees

     As of March 1, 1995 United and its subsidiaries had approximately
     1,900 employees.  Approximately 220 of these employees are represented
     by several unions under contracts expiring between March 1996 and
     January 1998.  United considers its employee relationships to be
     satisfactory.

     Patents

     United and its subsidiaries own more than 100 United States patents
     relating to various products, including stokers, marine equipment,
     ordnance and electronic equipment, and fire 
<PAGE>

     fighter trainers.  In addition, United has numerous pending applications
     for patents.  There is no assurance as to how many patents will be issued
     pursuant to these pending applications.  The applications relate to a wide
     variety of fields, including automation control systems, ordnance devices,
     and electronic developments.  No patent is considered to be of material
     importance to United.

     Research and Development

     During 1994, 1993 and 1992, the subsidiaries of United (exclusive of
     AAI) expended approximately $ 98,031, $126,300 and $90,400,
     respectively, on the development of new  products and the improvement
     of existing products.  All of the programs and the funds to support
     such programs are sponsored by the subsidiary involved.  In addition
     to the above amount, AAI is substantially engaged in research and
     development for the U.S. Government.

     Backlog

     The backlog of orders by industry segment at December 31, 1993 and
     1994 was as follows:

     Defense                       $204,225,000            $211,751,000

     Energy Systems                   2,711,000               4,627,000

     Plastic Products                 1,331,000               1,281,000

</TABLE>

     The increase in the backlog for the defense segment was primarily due
     to increased orders in the non-defense markets.  The increase in
     backlog for energy systems was due to the increased level of new
     contracts being awarded.  Except for approximately $90,951,000 of
     research and development backlog, substantially all of the backlog
     orders at December 31, 1994 are expected to be filled in 1995.

     Government Contracts

     No single customer other than the U.S. Government, principally the
     Department of Defense, accounted for 10% or more of net sales during
     the year.  Sales to the Government normally carry a lesser margin of
     profit than commercial sales and may be subject to price
     redetermination under certain circumstances.  Contracts for such sales
     can be terminated for the convenience of the Government.

     ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


     On December 27, 1989, the Company was named in an administrative order
     filed by the Arizona Attorney General's Office seeking the Company's
     response to alleged environmental

     contamination at property located on West Osborn Street in Phoenix,
     Arizona (the "West Osborn property"), that the State alleges formerly was
     owned by the Company.  The Arizona Attorney General's Office and the 
     Arizona Department of Environmental Quality have contended that 
     contamination from the West Osborn property, as well as other properties
     nearby, has contributed to a groundwater contamination.  In 1990, the 
     Company challenged the administrative order and it was withdrawn. 
     Subsequently, the Arizona Attorney General's Office and the Arizona 
     Department of Environmental Quality named the Company and several other
     parties on a draft consent order holding the Company and the parties 
     jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating alleged 
     environment contamination at the West Osborn property and for the payment
     of certain additional past and future investigative costs.  During 1991,
     the Company negotiated  with Arizona officials over the scope of the 
     consent decree, although the Company does not presently believe nor has it
     conceded to the State or to any other party that it bears any
     liability for the costs of responding to any contamination at the West
     Osborn property.  These negotiations were not producing results and
     thus were terminated.  The draft consent order seeks work and payments
     totalling approximately $1 to $2 million from all of the allegedly
     involved parties.  On May 18, 1993, the State of Arizona filed suit
     against the Company in the U.S. District  Court of Arizona seeking the
     recovery of investigative costs, injunctive relief to require the
     Company to perform a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study, and
     ultimately to require the remediation of alleged soil and ground-water
     contamination.  The State has since brought in co-defendants whose
     operations at the site were substantially larger than those of the
     Company.  This case is the subject of active discovery by the Company. 
     The Company intends to vigorously contest these actions and believes
     that the resolution of these actions will not be material to the
     Company.

     On February 11, 1992 a complaint was filed against the Company and ten
     other named and ten unnamed entities in the Maricopa County Superior
     Court of Arizona by seven individuals seeking to represent a class.  A
     class in excess of 10,000 was originally alleged.  The plaintiffs have
     amended their complaint to separate the larger property damage and
     medical monitoring classes into smaller subclasses based on geographic
     location and alleged exposure to solvents.  In the process of
     amendment, the overall sizes of the respective classes have been
     significantly reduced.  This suit alleges that the members of the
     class have been exposed to contaminated groundwater in the
     Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona area and suffer increased risk of disease
     and other physical effects.  They also assert property damages under
     various theories; seek to have certain scientific studies performed
     concerning health risks, preventative measures and long-term effects;
     and seek incidental and consequential damages, punitive damages and an
     injunction against actions causing further exposures.  The property
     and medical classes recently were certified.  The Company has joined
     with the other defendants and appealed the class certification issue
     to the Arizona Supreme Court.  The Company intends to vigorously
     contest these actions and believes that the resolution of these
     actions will not be material to the Company.

     Three additional lawsuits were filed on April 7, 1993, December 20,
     1993, and June 10, 1994 in the Maricopa County Superior Court of
     Arizona.  These matters allege personal

     injury and wrongful death by multiple plaintiffs arising from the 
     alleged contamination in the Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona area.  
     The Company intends to aggressively defend against these claims, 
     however, at this time, no estimate can be made as to the amount or
     range of potential loss, if any, to the Company with respect to these
     matters.  In comparison to the other defendants, the operations of 
     the Company were very limited in time and size.

     In January 1993, Detroit Stoker was named as a third-party defendant
     in four lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the
     Northern District of Ohio.  The third-party plaintiffs that have sued 
     Detroit Stoker are ship owners that have in turn been sued by Great Lakes
     maritime workers who claim to have suffered injuries and disease as a 
     result of alleged exposure to asbestos while working aboard the ships.
     The ship owners claim that Detroit Stoker and other suppliers to the ship
     owners furnished products, supplies or components of the ships that 
     contained asbestos.  These cases are currently inactive pending their 
     transfer to the national multi-district asbestos docket in the United
     States District Court in Philadelphia.  Detroit Stoker intends to 
     aggressively defend these claims, however, at this time, no estimate can
     be made as to the amount or range of potential loss, if any, to Detroit
     Stoker with respect to this action.

     Detroit Stoker was notified in March 1992 by the Michigan Department
     of Natural Resources ("MDNR") that it is a potentially responsible
     party in connection with the clean-up of a former industrial landfill
     located in Port of Monroe, Michigan.  MDNR is treating the Port of
     Monroe landfill site as a contaminated facility within the meaning of
     the Michigan Environmental Response Act ("MERA"), MCLA section 299.601
     et seq.  Under MERA, if a release or a potential release of a
     ------
     discarded hazardous substance is or may be injurious to the
     environment or to the public health, safety, or welfare, MDNR is
     empowered to undertake or compel investigation and response activities
     in order to alleviate any contamination threat.  Detroit Stoker
     intends to aggressively defend these claims, however, at this time, no
     estimate can be made as to the amount or range of potential loss, if
     any, to Detroit Stoker with respect to this action.

     Turpin Wachter Associates, Inc. ("TWAI") commenced an action against
     AAI Systems Management, Inc. ("SMI") before the American Arbitration
     Association in December 1993 alleging that SMI was required to
     exercise options awarding TWAI further work under a subcontract
     relating to the Navy fire fighter.  In December 1994, TWAI was awarded
     $117,000. 

     Peak Oilfield Service Corp. ("Peak") sued SMI in the United States
     District Court for the District of Alaska in December, 1993, alleging
     that SMI interfered with an implied contract between SMI's
     subcontractor and Peak.  In March 1994, full settlement was reached in
     this matter which consisted of the payment of $170,000 to the
     plaintiff.

     There are various other lawsuits and claims, including other
     environmental matters, pending against United.  In the opinion of
     United's management based in part on advice of counsel,

     none of these other actions will have a materially adverse effect on 
     the consolidated financial position of the Company.

                         Report of Independent Auditors

     Board of Directors and Shareholders
     United Industrial Corporation


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United
     Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and
     1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash
     flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
     1994. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules
     listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and
     schedules are the responsibility of the company s management. Our
     responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
     and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
     to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
     are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
     a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
     financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
     principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
     as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
     that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
     above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
     financial position of United Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries
     at December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the consolidated results of their
     operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
     period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
     accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
     statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
     financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
     respects the information set forth therein.

     A. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     In the parent-company-only financial statements, the Company's
     investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost plus equity
     in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries since date of acquisition.
     The Company's share of net income of its unconsolidated subsidiaries
     is reflected using the equity method. Parent-company-only financial
     statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's
     consolidated financial statements.

     Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform
     to the current year's classification.


     B. EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF SUBSIDIARIES

     In 1993, included in the equity in net loss of subsidiaries is a
     restructuring charge of $22,500,000 ($14,370,000, net of tax benefit)
     regarding the Company s defense industry subsidiary. A major portion
     of the charge resulted from the termination of the operations of
     AAI/MICROFLITE, a manufacturer of flight simulators and training
     devices, due to a lack of new orders. Also, in 1993 the Company
     changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits other
     than pensions and income taxes. The implementation of these accounting
     changes resulted in a cumulative effect charge against income of
     $12,890,000, net of tax benefit and a cumulative effect of $13,884,000
     which reduced the 1993 net loss, respectively. Consequently, the net
     cumulative effect of these accounting changes resulted in a $994,000
     reduction of the net loss in 1993.

                      AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
                      ------------------------------------

     This AMENDMENT to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Amendment") is
     made and entered into as of December 20, 1993, by and among AAI
     CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and PRINCIPAL
     MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY ("Principal Mutual"), an Iowa
     Corporation, and amends that certain Note Purchase Agreement, dated as
     of July 15, 1992, (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), by and among the
     Company and Principal Mutual, The Travelers Insurance Company and The
     Travelers Indemnity Company of Rhode Island, (collectively, the
     "Purchasers"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company to the
     Purchasers of $25,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.65%
     Senior Notes Due 1999 (the "Notes").  Principal Mutual owns in the
     aggregate $13,000,000 principal amount of the total issue of
     $25,000,000.  United Industrial Corporation ("UIC"), the parent of
     AAI, guaranteed the payment of the Notes pursuant to the Guaranty
     Agreement, dated as of July 15, 1992.

     The Company has requested that Principal Mutual modify the Note
     Purchase Agreement by amending Section 6.8 dealing with "Restriction
     on Liens" so that the Company may be allowed to incur liens to secure
     a guarantee to Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York (the "Bank") to
     induce the Bank to provide a line of credit to Pioneer UAV, Inc., a
     joint venture, in which the Company is a 50% participant.  Principal
     Mutual has agreed to the Company's request, provided, the Company
     agrees to covenant that under no circumstances will the Notes be
     subordinate to the Company's indebtedness to the Bank.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good
     and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
     hereby acknowledged, the undersigned do hereby covenant and agree as
     follows:

     1.   Definitions
          -----------
          Terms used and not defined herein shall have the respective
          meanings ascribed to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement.

          general obligations of the Company and under no circumstances
          will the obligations of the Company under this Agreement and the
          Notes rank in right of payment subordinate to the indebtedness of
          the Company to Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York."

     3.   Amendments to Section 6.8 of the Note Purchase Agreement
          --------------------------------------------------------
          3.1  The last sentence of subsection (v) of Section 6.8 of the
               Note Purchase Agreement is amended by deleting the period at
               the end thereof and inserting ";" and " in lieu thereof.

          3.2  A new subsection (vi) is added after subsection (v) by
               inserting the following language:

               "(vi) liens securing the guarantee provided by the Company
               up to a maximum of $750,000 to Bank Leumi Trust Company of
               New York to provide a line of credit to Pioneer UAV, Inc."

     4.   Representations and Warranties
          ------------------------------
          In order to induce Principal Mutual to enter into this Amendment,
          the Company represents and warrants as follows:

               been commenced or are contemplated, and there has been no
               material adverse change in the business, conditions, or
               operations (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its
               Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except as previously
               disclosed to Principal Mutual.

               judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Company

               to which the Company is a party or is subject, or by which
               it or its property is bound, or conflicts with or

               forth herein, none of the terms or provisions of either the
               Note Purchase Agreement or the Notes shall be deemed to be
               modified hereby, and each of the Note Purchase Agreement and
               the Notes, as modified herein, shall continue in full force
               and effect.

               separate counterparts, each of which taken together shall
               constitute one and the same agreement.

     with any business activity, other than that of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies, directly or indirectly in competition with any
     of the business operations or activities of Employer and its
     subsidiary companies.  Nothing herein contained, however, shall
     restrict Employee from making any investments in any company whose
     stock is listed on a national securities exchange or actively traded
     in the over-the-counter market, so long as such investment does not
     give him the right to control or influence the policy decisions of any
     such business or enterprise which is or might be directly or
     indirectly in competition with













































<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     any of such business operations or activities of Employer or any of

     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies or the general industry of
     which they are a part, from the time of entering upon employment until
     the termination thereof, and whether acquired by Employee before or
     during the term of his employment; provided, however, that nothing
                                        --------  -------
     herein shall be construed as requiring any such communication where
     the method, development, invention and/or improvement is lawfully
     protected from disclosure as the trade secret of a third party,
     including,














































<PAGE>

     other instruments deemed necessary by Employer for the prosecution of
     such patent applications or the acquisition of Letters Patent in the
     United States and/or any foreign countries.

                    (d)  Employee agrees that for a period of three (3)
     years from and after the termination or expiration  of his employment
     by Employer, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or

                         (i)  directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice
     or induce any employee of Employer or of any of its subsidiary
     companies to be employed by any person, firm or

     corporation which is, directly or indirectly, in competition with the
     business or activities of Employer or any of its subsidiary companies;
     or

                        (ii)  directly or indirectly approach any such
     employee for these purposes; or

                       (iii)  authorize or knowingly approve the taking of
     such actions by other persons on behalf of any such person, firm or
     corporation, or assist any such person, firm or corporation in taking
     such action; or

                       (iv)   directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice
     or induce any person, firm or corporation (other than the U.S.
     Government or its agencies) who or which on the date hereof is, or at
     any time during the period of employment hereunder shall be, a
     customer of Employer or of any of its subsidiary companies to become a
     customer for the same or similar products which it purchased from
     Employer or any of its subsidiary companies, of any other person, firm
     or corporation, and Employee shall not approach any such customer for
     such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of such
     actions by any other person.

                    (e)  Employee agrees that during the term of his
     employment by Employer, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, he
     will not at any time enter into, on behalf of Employer or any of its
     subsidiary companies, or cause Employer or

























     <PAGE>
<PAGE>   

     any of its subsidiary companies to enter into, directly or indirectly,
     any transactions with any business organization in which he or any
     member of his immediate family may be interested as a partner,
     trustee, director, officer, employee, shareholder, lender of money or
     guarantor.

               7.  Injunctive Relief.  Employee acknowledges that the
                   -----------------
     services to be rendered by him hereunder are of a special, unique and
     extraordinary character and that it would be very difficult or
     impossible to replace such services and further that irreparable
     injury would be sustained by Employer and its subsidiary companies in
     the event of a violation by Employee of any of the provisions of this
     Agreement, and by reason thereof Employee consents and agrees that if
     he violates any of the provisions of this Agreement, Employer shall be
     entitled to an injunction to be issued by any court of competent
     jurisdiction restraining him from committing or continuing any
     violation of this Agreement.

               8.  Survival of Provisions.  The provisions of Sections 5, 6
                   ----------------------
     and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or expiration of this
     Agreement, irrespective of the reason therefor.

               9.  Expenses.  Employer shall reimburse Employee for all
                   --------
     reasonable expenses properly incurred by him on behalf of Employer in
     the performance of his duties hereunder, provided that proper vouchers
     are submitted to Employer by Employee












































<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     evidencing such expenses and the purposes for which the same were
     incurred.

               10.  Disability.  If Employee shall be incapacitated by
                    ----------
     reason of mental or physical disability or otherwise during the term
     of this Agreement so that he is prevented from performing his
     principal duties and services hereunder for a period of three (3)
     consecutive months or one or more periods aggregating three (3) months
     during any twelve (12) month period, Employer shall have the right to
     terminate this Agreement by sending written notice of termination to
     Employee, and thereupon his employment pursuant to this Agreement
     shall terminate and Employee shall be entitled to no further payments
     hereunder, other than (i) for any compensation due pursuant to Section
     4 hereof through the date of such termination, (ii) the reimbursement,
     pursuant to Section 9 hereof, of any expenses incurred prior to the
     date of such termination, and (iii) the continuation of Employee's
     base salary pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof for a period of six (6)
     months from the date of such termination, but not beyond the
     Termination Date or the date on which Employee shall commence to
     receive benefits pursuant to Employer's long term disability plan, as
     then in effect.

               11.  Death.  In the event of the death of Employee during
                    -----
     the term hereof, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and
     Employer shall have no further obligations


































<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     hereunder, other than to pay to Employee's estate any compensation due
     pursuant to Section 4 hereof through the date of such termination and
     to reimburse, pursuant to Section 9 hereof, any expenses incurred by
     Employee through the date of such termination.

               12.  Termination by Employer for Cause.  Employer shall have
                    ---------------------------------
     the right to terminate the employment of Employee under this Agreement
     as well as any and all payments to be made hereunder, other than for
     any compensation due pursuant to Section 4 hereof through the date of
     such termination and any reimbursement, pursuant to Section 9 hereof,
     of expenses incurred by Employee through the date of such termination,
     if Employee shall commit any of the following acts of default:

                      (i)  Employee shall have committed any material
     breach of any of the provisions or covenants set forth herein; or

                      (ii)  Employee shall have committed any act of
     gross negligence in the performance of his duties or obligations
     hereunder; or

                      (iii)  Employee shall have committed any material
     act of dishonesty or breach of trust against Employer or any of its
     subsidiary companies; or
 
                      (iv)   Employee's conviction of, or plea of nolo
                                                                  ----
      contendere to, a felony.
      ----------










































<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

               If Employer elects to terminate this Agreement as set forth
     above, Employer shall send written notice to Employee terminating this
     Agreement and describing the action of Employee constituting the act
     of default, and thereupon no further payments of any type shall be
     made or shall be payable to Employee hereunder notwithstanding any
     other provisions of this Agreement, except as set forth in the first
     sentence of this Section 12.

               13.  No Conflicting Agreements.  Employee represents and
                    -------------------------
     warrants that he is not a party to any agreement, contract or
     understanding, whether employment or otherwise, which would in any way
     restrict or prohibit him from undertaking or performing employment in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

               14.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire
                    ----------------
     understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter
     hereof, and no statement, representation, warranty or covenant has
     been made by either party except as expressly set forth herein.  This
     Agreement shall not be changed or terminated orally.  This Agreement
     supersedes and cancels all prior agreements between the parties,
     whether written or oral, relating to the employment of Employee.

               15.  Applicable Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by,
                    --------------
     construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the

               16.  Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and other
                    -------
     communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to

               17.  Section Headings.  The section headings set forth in
                    ----------------

     Mr. P. David Bocksch
     90 Ardmore Road
     Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey 07423

     Re: Grant of Incentive Stock Option

     Dear Mr. Bocksch:

          On May 10, 1994, the Stockholders of United Industrial
     Corporation (the "Company") authorized and approved the 1994 Stock
     Option Plan, which was previously adopted by the Board of Directors. 
     The 1994 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") provides for the grant of
     options to certain key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
     A copy of the Plan is annexed hereto and shall be deemed a part hereof
     as if fully set forth herein.  Unless the context otherwise requires,
     all terms defined in the Plan shall have the same meaning when used
     herein.

          The Company hereby grants to you, as a matter of separate
     inducement and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for
     your services, the option (the "Option") to purchase, in accordance
     with the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, but subject to
     the limitations set forth herein and in the Plan, an aggregate of
     100,000 Shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share, of the
     Company at a price of $     per share, such option price being, in the
     judgment of the Option Committee, not less than one hundred percent
     (100%) of the fair market value of such share at the date hereof.  The
     Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within
     the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended, but it is specifically understood that no warranty is made to
     you as to such qualification.

          Subject to the provisions and limitations of Sections 6 and 7 of
     the Plan, this Option may be exercised by you, on a cumulative basis,
     during a period often (10) years commencing on the date of grant of
     this Option and terminating at the close of business on March 27,
     2005, as follows:

          (a)  up to one third (1/3) of the total number of shares subject
     to this Option may be purchased by you commencing one year after the
     date hereof;

          (b)  up to an additional one third (1/3) of the total number of
     shares subject to this Option may be purchased by you commencing two
     years after the date hereof; and

          (c)  the balance of the total number of shares subject to this
     Option may be purchased by you commencing three years after the date
     hereof.

<PAGE>
     

          The unexercised portion of the Option granted herein will
     automatically and without notice terminate and become null and void
     upon the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of the grant of
     this Option.  If, however, prior to the expiration of ten (10) years
     from the date of grant of this Option, your employment with the
     Company and any parent or subsidiary corporation terminates this
     Option will terminate on the applicable date as described below;
     provided, however, that none of the events described below shall
     --------  -------
     extend the period of exercisability of this option beyond ten (10)
     years from the date of grant of this Option;

          (a)  the date of termination, if your employment is terminated
     other than by reason of death, disability, retirement, good reason or
     dismissal other than for cause (as such terms are defined in the
     Plan);

          (b)  the expiration of one (1) year after your death if your
     death occurs either during your employment or within the one-year or
     three-month period after the termination of your employment specified
     in clauses (c) and (d) below, except that your Option will be
     exercisable during such one-year period only to the extent that it
     would have been exercisable on the date of your death;

          (c)  the expiration of one (1) year after the termination of your
     employment by reason of your disability (as defIned in the Plan),
     except that your Option will be exercisable during such one-year
     period only to the extent that it would have been exercisable
     immediately prior to the termination of your employment; and

          (d)  the expiration of three (3) months from the date of
     termination of your employment by reason of your retirement, good
     reason (as defined in the Plan) or dismissal other than for cause (as
     defined in the Plan), except that your Option will be exercisable
     during such three-month period only to the extent that it would have
     been exercisable immediately prior to the termination of your
     employment.

          In no event shall you exercise this Option for a fraction of a
     share or for less than one hundred (100) shares (unless the number
     purchased is the total balance for which the Option is then
     exercisable).

          This Option is not transferable by you otherwise than by will or
     the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during your
     lifetime, only by you.  This Option may not be assigned, transferred
     (except by will or the laws of descent and distribution), pledged or
     hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and
     shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar proceeding. 
     Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other
     disposition of this Option contrary to the provisions hereof, and the
     levy of any attachment or similar proceeding upon the Option, shall be
     null and void and without effect.

          Any exercise of this Option shall be in writing addressed to the
     Corporate Secretary of the Company at the principal place of business
     of the Company, shall be substantially in the form attached hereto and
     shall be accompanied by a certified or bank cashier's check to the
     order of the Company in the full amount of the purchase price of the
     shares so purchased.

          If the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine that it
     is necessary, to comply with applicable securities laws, the
     certificate or certificates representing the shares purchased pursuant
     to the exercise of this Option shall bear an appropriate legend in
     form and substance, as determined by the Company, giving notice of
     applicable restrictions on transfer under or in respect of such laws.

          You hereby covenant and agree with the Company that if, at the
     time of exercise of this Option, there does not exist a Registration
     Statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as
     amended (the "Act"), which Registration Statement shall have become
     effective and shall include a prospectus which is current with respect
     to the shares subject to this Option (i) that you are purchasing the
     shares for your own

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     

     account and not with a view to the resale or distribution thereof and
     (ii) that any subsequent offer for sale or sale of any such shares
     shall be made either pursuant to (x) a Registration Statement on an
     appropriate form under the Act, which Registration Statement shall
     have become effective and shall be current with respect to the shares
     being offered and sold, or (y) a specific exemption from the
     registration requirements of the Act, but in claiming such exemption,
     you shall, prior to any offer for sale or sale of such shares, obtain
     a favorable written opinion from counsel for or approved by the
     Company as to the applicability of such exemption.

          As provided in the Plan, the Company may withhold from sums due
     or to become due to you from the Company an amount necessary to
     satisfy its obligation to withhold taxes incurred by reason of the
     disposition of the shares acquired by exercise of this Option in a
     disqualifying disposition (within the meaning of Section 421(b) of the
     Code), or may require you to reimburse the Company in such amount. 
     The Company may hold the stock certificate to which you are entitled
     upon the exercise of this Option as security for the payment of
     withholding tax liability, until cash sufficient to pay such liability
     has been accumulated.

          You agree that for a period of three (3) years from and after the
     termination or expiration of your employment by the Company, you will
     not:

          (i)  directly or indirectly solicit, entice or induce any
     employee of the Company or of any of its subsidiary or affiliated
     companies to be employed by any person, firm or corporation which is,
     directly or indirectly, in competition with the business or activities
     of the Company or any of its subsidiary or affiliated companies; or

          (ii) directly or indirectly approach any such employee for these
     purposes; or

          (iii) authorize or knowingly approve the taking of such
     actions by other persons on behalf of any such person, firm or
     corporation, or assist any such person, firm or corporation in taking
     such action; or

          (iv) directly or indirectly solicit, raid, entice or induce any
     person, firm or corporation (other than the US Government or its
     agencies) who or which on the date hereof is, or at any time during
     the period hereunder shall be, a customer of the Company or of any of
     its subsidiary or affiliated companies to become a customer for the
     same or similar products which it purchased from the Company or any of
     its subsidiary or affiliated companies, of any other person, firm or
     corporation, and you shall not approach any such customer for such
     purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of such actions
     by any other person.

          You further agree that you will not divulge, furnish or make
     available to anyone at anytime, except as part of your employment by
     the Company or any of its subsidiary or affiliated Companies either
     during or subsequent to much employment, any knowledge or information
     with respect to confidential or proprietary information, methods,
     processes, plans or materials of the Company or any of its subsidiary
     or affiliated companies, or with respect to any other confidential or
     proprietary aspects of the business of the Company or any of its
     subsidiary or affiliated companies.

          This agreement is subject to all terms, conditions, limitations
     and restrictions contained in the Plan, which shall be controlling in
     the event of any conflicting or inconsistent provisions.

     TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

          United Industrial Corporation's net income in 1994 was $5,212,000
     ($.43 per share) compared with a loss of $11,023,000 ($.90 per share) in
     1993.  The net loss in 1993 included a restructuring charge at the
     Company's defense subsidiary, AAI Corporation, of $22.5 million ($14.4
     million, or $1.17 per share, net of  tax benefit).  Sales were $210
     million in 1994 compared with $253 million in 1993.

          During the year quarterly cash dividends of $.07 each were paid,
     totaling $.28 a share.

     AAI CORPORATION

          Last year I informed you that AAI had taken the steps required to
     restore profitability in 1994.  That this has now occurred is
     gratifying for us all.  The next challenge for the company is to reach
     improved earnings levels.  I am pleased to report to shareholders that
     great progress has already been made in reducing overhead, increasing
     efficiency, and tightening asset management.  In the face of a
     shrinking defense market, costly excess capacity is being eliminated,
     and obsolete Cold War  business strategies are being discarded.  AAI's
     president and CEO, Richard R. Erkeneff, is introducing a new,
     customer-centered corporate culture throughout the company.

          AAI's strengths are impressive and reassuring.  It is a leader in
     the design and production of computer-driven training simulators,
     which provide a cost-effective way to teach troops how to operate
     sophisticated weapons systems.  Such simulators will remain essential
     to all the armed forces for the foreseeable future.  During 1994 AAI's
     Defense Systems division booked orders for its improved Moving Target
     Simulator, delivered an HH-60 helicopter flight simulator to the Coast
     Guard, and won the contract to develop a simulator for training Air
     Force technicians to service the

<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System.  Another program for
     which AAI can count on long-term demand is the Pioneer unmanned
     reconnaissance air vehicle.  Production of the battle-tested Pioneer
     is being increased in 1995 to fill orders received by Pioneer UAV,
     Inc., a joint venture between AAI and Israel Aircraft Industries.

          AAI's strengths also stem from its growing diversification.  Our
     Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) is presently installed at
     hundreds of large airports.  In 1995 the Weather Systems division is
     launching a sister product, Next Generation Weather Observation System
     (NEXWOS), priced to compete for a market of thousands of smaller
     airports.  The Transportation Systems division continues its rapid
     advance.  AAI's latest transportation subsidiary, Electric Transit,
     Inc., a joint venture with a Czech Republic firm, Skoda, is building
     an electric trolley bus fleet for Dayton, Ohio.

     SYMTRON SYSTEMS, INC.

          Symtron's first year as one of our subsidiaries was marked by
     important sales of its computer-based simulation systems for training
     fire fighters, including a prestigious contract from New York City's
     JFK International Airport.  Under the direction of Symtron's
     president, John J. Henning, the company is designing systems that help
     to save lives and are environmentally friendly.  Increased sales are
     anticipated in 1995.

     DETROIT STOKER COMPANY

          We are all saddened by the sudden death on February 10, 1995, of
     Daniel E. McCoy, 58, president and CEO of Detroit Stoker Company.  Dan
     came to Detroit in 1992, and the company has benefited greatly from
     his leadership and vision.  One of the legacies of his creative
     management is a








































<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     product line of low-pollution industrial burners.  We are seeking a
     successor who will keep the company on the course he set.

          During 1994 Detroit reorganized its foundry, incurring costs that
     adversely affected income.  However, year-end bookings are up and the
     outlook for 1995 earnings is good.

     NEO PRODUCTS COMPANY

          Neo Products Company, maker of custom plastic parts, expanded
     capacity this past year with new production equipment.  To adjust for
     rising raw material costs that reduced 1994 profits, Neo has increased
     prices.  Michael A. Schillaci, Neo's president is looking forward to
     higher sales and earnings in 1995.

     CORPORATE OFFICERS

          I am delighted to announce the appointment of two new corporate
     officers, James H. Perry as Treasurer and Susan Fein Zawel as
     Secretary.  Jim, 33, was formerly a senior manager at Ernst & Young. 
     Susan, 41, an attorney who for several years has served ably on our
     UIC management team and as General Counsel of the Company, is also my
     daughter.  I am contemplating one other key executive change in the
     near future about which I will keep shareholders closely advised.

     PROSPECTS FOR 1995

          Business backlog at the end of 1994 was $218 million compared
     with $208 million at the end of 1993.  Shareholders' equity per share
     was $7.27, up from the 1993 low of $ 6.96.  We expect additional
     improvement in earnings in 1995.

     THE YEAR IN REVIEW

     AAI CORPORATION

          In 1994 a leaner AAI returned to profitability and prepared
     itself for further gains.  Management focused attention on achieving
     the competitive edge needed to prosper in the present business
     climate.

          The decisive changes of the past two years--downsizing the
     workforce, restructuring operations, consolidating facilities--have
     succeeded in strengthening AAI.  But much remains to be done to attain
     higher earnings.   AAI's president and CEO, Richard R. Erkeneff, is
     orienting the company more firmly towards satisfying the needs of its
     customers and upholding its long tradition of technological
     excellence.  His senior management team, along with rank and file AAI
     employees, have demonstrated the ability to overcome powerful
     competition, winning a number of hotly contested contracts during 1994
     against strong contenders.

          AAI is striving aggressively to capture market share of its core
     Department of Defense (DOD) business.  Its R&D is aimed at several
     potentially profitable new products for both military and commercial
     use.  In the non-DOD marketplace, the company is moving innovatively
     to enhance its leadership in automated surface weather monitoring
     while widening its position in the vital area of mass transit systems.

     DEFENSE SYSTEMS

          For military planners in the U.S. and other advanced
     industrialized nations, the procurement of computerized training
     simulators is a top priority.  AAI plays a leading role in the
     creation of such digital simulators, with which troops responsible for
     the operation of complex weapons systems can be trained safely,
     effectively, and economically.  Teaching troops how to aim
     antiaircraft weapons,

<PAGE>
     

     for example, is the mission of AAI's highly successful Moving Target
     Simulator  (MTS II), a computer-based air defense training system that
     generates realistic air combat scenarios within a 40-foot-diameter
     dome.  AAI currently has eleven systems set up in five countries and
     contracts outstanding for seven additional installations.  New orders
     during 1994 included a $6 million sale to Japan and also one to the
     U.S. Army Missile Command to furnish an MTS II for the North Dakota
     National Guard.

          Another major AAI digital simulator project is the HH-60, a 
     helicopter flight trainer that provides instruction in flying the
     widely used Blackhawk helicopter.  Purchased by the Naval Air Warfare
     Center, the HH-60 flight simulator was delivered by AAI this year to
     the Coast Guard facility in Mobile, Alabama.  The company is proud of
     this quality product, which is receiving high marks from pilots and
     holds the promise of significant international sales.

          In addition, this year the company gained a hard-fought contract
     against vigorous competition to build the computerized maintenance
     trainer for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint
     STARS).  An important U.S. Air Force/U.S. Army airborne ground-
     surveillance system, tested under fire during Operation Desert Storm,
     Joint STARS monitors troop and equipment  movement via radar and
     transmits activity directly to a command center.  Under the $12
     million contract, AAI will design, develop, and install the
     maintenance trainer used for teaching Air Force technicians to service
     the sophisticated radar sensors and computers in the E-8C Joint STARS
     aircraft.  The contract positions AAI for other maintenance trainer
     opportunities.

          AAI markets on-site logistical support of its simulation
     equipment for customers in the U.S., Germany, Australia, and The
     Republic of Korea through Engineering Support, Inc. (ESI), a wholly






































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     owned AAI subsidiary with nearly 300 employees.  ESI has over 25
     active programs with a total anticipated sales value of about $40
     million.

          Potentially profitable R&D programs now under way with DOD
     funding include the Advanced Boresight Equipment (ABE), a patented
     state-of-the-art coupling of computer, laser, and gyroscopic
     technology that could transform the costly process for precision
     alignment of parts.  A prototype was successfully demonstrated during
     1994 on aircraft in France, Germany, and Great Britain.  The company
     is presently building the first preproduction demonstration units of
     ABE for boresighting of military aircraft.  During 1995 AAI will
     formulate plans for a commercial version of ABE, which could have an
     even larger market.  Another promising product with both military and
     commercial applications is AAI's patented PDCue  system that utilizes
     the supersonic sound waves coming off a projectile to detect its
     direction, distance, and class of round.

           AAI has expanded its production of Pioneer unmanned air vehicles
     as a result of two new U.S. Navy, Naval Air Systems Command orders for
     the pilotless reconnaissance drones that won extensive praise during
     the Persian Gulf War.  Pioneer UAV, Inc., a joint venture between AAI
     and Israel Aircraft Industries,  received the order for 30 air
     vehicles, payloads, and spares worth nearly $27 million.  Deliveries
     will begin in the latter part of 1995.  Now in service with the U.S.
     Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, the Pioneer is capable of flying for
     more than five hours at altitudes of up to 15,000 feet, performing
     battlefield missions under adverse environments.  

     ACL TECHNOLOGIES

          A leading producer of test equipment for aviation fluid power
     components, this growing AAI subsidiary has already captured 30
     percent of a $40 million market.  Overcoming heavy competition, ACL in
     1994 won a $4 million order from Hamilton Standard Division of United
     Technologies.

































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     ACL's goal is to establish its automated equipment as the industry
     standard endorsed by all component manufacturers.

     WEATHER SYSTEMS

          In 1994 AAI signed a restructured contract with the National
     Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which has funded
     installation of the company's highly regarded Automated Surface
     Observing System (ASOS) at hundreds of airports.  Extended to run
     beyond 1997, the revised contract sets future ASOS deployment at 12
     systems per month, raising the value of the $200 million program by
     $10 million and increasing the company's profits.  The extension
     allows AAI more time to tap the military market for ASOS, valued at
     $60 to $80 million.  As a harbinger of future business, the U.S. Air
     Force purchased its first three ASOS, for Vandenberg Air Force Base in
     California, and has already ordered five more systems for fiscal year
     1995.

           The cost of ASOS exceeds the budgets of thousands of smaller
     general aviation airports, hospital heliports, and off-shore oil
     platforms--all of which could use automated weather monitoring
     equipment.  This past year AAI undertook an ambitious R&D effort to
     accommodate the requirements of this lucrative market by building a
     lower-priced, quality product.  The result is the Next Generation
     Weather Observation System (NEXWOS), a completely new hardware design
     that retains the software capabilities of the higher-priced ASOS and
     offers customers technical and price advantages over competing
     systems.  An advertising campaign will launch  NEXWOS in early 1995. 

          In an effort to open additional markets for the data acquisition
     technology created for ASOS, AAI is developing an instrumented package
     for the automated monitoring of water quality, funded by the National
     Institute for Environmental Renewal.  This $504,000 contract calls for
     a system to detect and measure contaminants in Pennsylvania's heavily
     polluted Lackawanna River, a part of the




































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     Chesapeake Bay watershed that passes through an anthracite mining
     region.  AAI will retain full rights to any product design.

     TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 

          AAI made substantial progress in 1994 towards its goal of
     becoming a leading American producer of transit systems.  At year-end,
     three major AAI mass transportation projects were under way -- in
     Ohio, California, and Maryland.

          In Ohio, AAI emerged the winner of a competition to build a fleet
     of 63 electric trolley buses (ETBs) for the Dayton area.  Total value
     of the contract, with the exercise of an option for up to 91 coaches,
     is about $ 43 million.  Eighty percent of the cost of the non-
     polluting vehicles will come from Federal Transit Administration clean
     air grants.  The trolleys will be produced by AAI's latest
     transportation subsidiary, Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI). 
     Headquartered in Dayton, ETI is a joint venture between AAI and a
     Czech Republic firm, Skoda, one of the world's foremost ETB
     manufacturers.  ETI, the first electric trolley bus company set up in
     the U.S. since 1955, will sell buses to Dayton now and, eventually,
     throughout the U.S. market.  

          ETBs are more expensive than diesel or alternate fuel buses, but
     those vehicles have twelve-year life expectancies, whereas electrics
     last 20 years or more.  ETI will deliver three prototype buses to
     Dayton late in 1995.  Delivery of production models will begin in mid-
     1996 and continue through late 1997.

          In California, AAI's subsidiary, California Car Shell, Inc., has
     established in the City of Carson the only plant in the U.S.
     manufacturing light-rail car shells.  The plant will become
     operational early in 1995 and is expected to turn out its first units
     by the end of the year.  The shells will be produced by California Car
     Shell under a licensing agreement with its teaming partner,




































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     Siemens Duewag Corporation, the recipient of a large contract from the
     Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority for 74 light rail vehicles,
     with an option for 13 more.  After completing the Los Angeles
     contract, California Car Shell will furnish shells for other Siemens
     ventures in North America.

           In Maryland, AAI was awarded a contract to renovate a fleet of
     heavy rail cars.  The contract, from the Maryland Department of
     Transportation, Mass Transit Administration, entails the refurbishing
     of 28 rail cars used on the Maryland Commuter Rail Service.  The
     expertise AAI employees are acquiring in the specialized field of rail
     car assembly is positioning the company for expansion into the transit
     overhaul business.

     SYMTRON SYSTEMS, INC.

          A noteworthy event for United Industrial this past year was the
     acquisition in January 1994 of a wholly owned subsidiary, Symtron
     Systems, Inc., of Fair Lawn, New Jersey, a developer and producer of
     patented fire fighter trainers.  Symtron provides customers with safe,
     practical, and ecologically acceptable systems that simulate real
     conditions encountered in a wide variety of fires.

          During 1994 Symtron received a $1.5 million contract to install
     its state-of-the-art Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighter Trainer (ARFFT) at
     Salt Lake City International Airport, and another contract, worth $2.1
     million, for an ARFFT at New York City's JFK International Airport. 
     The latter ARFFT facility will also serve as a training center for
     fire safety personnel from La Guardia and Newark airports.

          The JFK project includes a mock-up of a 72-foot-long crashed
     aircraft fuselage, situated in a 125-foot-diameter burn area.  To
     reduce risk to trainees practicing the rapid rescue of passengers,
     ARFFT's computer-controlled, liquid propane fire can be extinguished
     rapidly.  The propane fire is





































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     intense, with flames up to 40 feet high, but compared to  burning
     aviation fuel, it does not significantly contaminate the air and
     ground.

          Training systems for fighting structural fires in homes garnered
     orders totaling $2.4 million in 1994 from municipal fire departments,
     a college, and Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas.  In
     addition, Symtron's Military Fire Fighting Trainer Program won U.S.
     Navy contracts worth $2.77 million for an ARFFT that simulates a
     carrier conflagration and for an Advanced Shipboard Fire Trainer for
     the Great Lakes Naval Station.

          With a number of sizable bids and proposals presently
     outstanding, Symtron's president, John J. Henning, looks forward to
     increased sales in 1995.

     DETROIT STOKER COMPANY

          United Industrial's energy systems subsidiary saw a decline in
     1994 earnings due to one-time costs associated with the reorganization
     of its foundry, Midwest Metallurgical Laboratories, Inc.  However,
     Detroit's core business was stronger in 1994 than in 1993 and bookings
     climbed 12 percent.  This upward trend is expected to continue in
     1995.

          At Midwest, a wholly owned subsidiary of Detroit, lead times for
     casting have now been shortened, enabling the company to meet
     customers' requirements for faster deliveries of stoker replacement
     parts and retrofits.  This improvement will allow Detroit to compete
     for a bigger share of the profitable aftermarket business.

          Orders for Hydrograte(registered trademark) stokers accounted 
     for over 40 percent of Detroit's total contracts in 1994.  Designed 
     originally for the pulp and paper industry, these durable waste-to-
     energy stokers are finding favor also in other businesses.  A Hydrograte
     ordered this past year by the Genesee Power Station in Michigan will
     generate electricity by burning urban demolition waste from razed 
     buildings. 






























     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     At another facility under construction in Florida, Hydrogrates are
     being installed for that state's largest sugar company.  Five giant
     boilers fueled with bagasse, a cane residue, will produce steam for
     the refinery and sufficient electricity to power an American city of
     50,000.

          Looking to the future, Detroit's new product line of oil and gas
     burners that emit low levels of nitrous oxides is providing industrial
     users with a cost-effective way of meeting federal and state air
     quality standards.  Detroit is also participating in two funded
     environmental research projects to develop other combustion systems
     that reduce pollutants.  Both research agreements give Detroit
     exclusive marketing rights.

     NEO PRODUCTS COMPANY

          United Industrial's Chicago-based producer of custom
     thermoplastic parts enjoyed good sales in 1994.  But Neo's president,
     Michael A. Schillaci, reported that increases in the price of the
     firm's basic raw material, plastic resin, trimmed earnings.  With a
     recently purchased 610-ton injection molding machine that expands
     capacity and provides customers with faster turnaround, and with
     prices raises to compensate for climbing costs, Neo anticipates an
     excellent business year in 1995.

     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
     UNITED INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION

                                                                           
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE 1:   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial statements
     ----------------------------
     include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  Significant
     intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
     consolidation.  Certain amounts in the prior years have been
     reclassified to conform to the current year's classifications.

     CASH EQUIVALENTS:  The Company considers all highly liquid investments
     -----------------
     with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
     equivalents.  The carrying amount of these investments reported in the
     balance sheet approximates their fair value.

     INVENTORIES:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. 
     ------------
     At December 31, 1994 and 1993, approximately 7% and 9%, respectively,
     of total inventory was priced by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method
     with the remainder priced at actual, average, or standard.  If the
     first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of inventory pricing had been used,
     inventories would have been approximately $4,174,000 higher than
     reported on December 31, 1994 and $4,198,000 higher than reported on
     December 31, 1993.  In  1994 and 1992 certain inventory quantities
     were reduced, resulting in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities
     carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years.  The effect was to
     increase net income by $159,000 ($.01 per share) and $534,000 ($.04
     per share) in 1994 and 1992, respectively.

     Inventories include amounts related to long-term contracts of the
     Company's defense subsidiary, as determined by the percentage-of-
     completion method of accounting.  Sales and gross profit are
     principally recognized as work is performed based on the relationship
     between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. 
     Additionally, certain contracts provide for the production of various
     units throughout the contract period and these contracts are accounted
     for based on the units delivered.  See Note 3.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:  Property and equipment are stated at cost. 
     -----------------------
     The policy of the Company is to provide for depreciation on the
     straight-line, sum-of-the-years digits, and declining-balance methods,
     by annual charges to operations calculated to amortize the cost over
     the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property.  

     EARNINGS PER SHARE:  Earnings per share has been computed using the
     -------------------
     weighted average number of the common and common equivalent shares
     outstanding, and assuming exercise of all stock options having
     exercise prices less than the average market price of the common stock
     using the treasury stock method:  12,241,503 in 1994, 12,258,693 in
     1993, and 12,257,850 in 1992.

     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company
     ------------------------------
     adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  (SFAS) No.
     106,"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
     Pensions" (See Note 11).  In addition, effective January 1, 1993, the
     Company








<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     changed its method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred
     method to the liability method required by  No. 109, "Accounting for
     Income Taxes" (See Note 13).  

     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE 2:   TRADE RECEIVABLES

      =============================================================================
</TABLE>

     Billed and unbilled amounts above include $4,415,000 and $5,940,000 at
     December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, related to contracts for
     which the Company's defense subsidiary is a subcontractor to other
     government contractors.  Unbilled recoverable costs and earned fees
     substantially represent amounts that will be collected within one
     year.  Retainage amounts will generally be billed over the next twelve
     months.

     ==============================================================================
</TABLE>

     The inventoried costs associated with long-term contracts include
     costs and earnings ($32,497,000 in 1994 and $39,504,000 in 1993) of
     incomplete contracts not yet billable to the customer.  These amounts
     represent the difference between the percentage-of-completion method
     of accounting for long-term contracts used to record operating results
     by the Company's defense subsidiary and the




<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     amounts billable to the customer under the terms of the specific
     contracts.  Estimates of final contract costs and earnings (including
     earnings subject to future determination through negotiation or other
     procedures) are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives
     of the contracts.  Adjustments of earnings resulting from the
     revisions are recorded on a current basis.  The Company recognized
     losses of $5,600,000 ($3,461,000 net of tax benefit, or $.28 per
     share) during 1994 and $28,000,000 ($17,833,000 net of  tax benefit,
     or $1.45 per share) during 1993, resulting primarily from revision of
     cost estimates on certain major long-term contracts.

          Included in costs and earnings relating to long-term contracts at
     December 31, 1994 and 1993, are amounts related to estimated
     reimbursable costs applicable to certain government contracts.  Such
     estimated reimbursable costs approximate $16,538,000 and $3,400,000,
     respectively, and such amounts are subject to negotiation with the
     government.  The Company has provided reserves which it believes are
     adequate to cover any exposure related to these contracts.  
     Inventories do not include any significant amounts of unamortized
     tooling, learning curve, and other deferred costs, claims, or other
     similar items whose recovery is uncertain.

     ===============================================================================
</TABLE>

     The note receivable is due from a British manufacturing company and
     relates to the sale of a subsidiary in 1985.  The note, which is
     payable in one remaining annual installment  of $8,540,000, bears
     annual interest at 14% and was paid in February 1995.

          Patents and other intangible assets represent assets acquired in
     connection with purchased businesses and are being amortized primarily
     on a straight-line basis over 5 to 15 years.  Amortization expense
     amounted to $1,683,000 in 1994, $538,000 in 1993, and $900,000 in
     1992.  Accumulated amortization amounted to $3,309,000 and $1,626,000
     at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

          During 1993, the unamortized amount ($1,202,000) of certain
     intangible assets primarily related to an acquired business were
     charged off in connection with the restructuring charge as disclosed
     in Note 17.

          During 1994, the Company acquired approximately $7 million of
     patents and other intangible assets related to the purchase of Symtron
     Systems, Inc.

     $25,000,000.  The proceeds of the note were principally used to repay
     the then outstanding borrowings of AAI.  Interest is payable semi-
     annually.   The note purchase agreement was amended in July 1993
     whereby certain debt covenants were modified and the interest rate was
     increased from 8.65% to 9.15% at such date, but reverted to 8.65%
     effective January 1, 1994.  AAI prepaid $5,000,000 of the notes in
     1994.  The remaining principal is to be repaid in three equal annual
     payments of $6,250,000 commencing July 31, 1996, and a final payment
     of $1,250,000 in 1999. 

          The Company is a guarantor of the agreement and together with AAI
     must comply with certain covenants including, but not limited to,
     provisions related to dividends, indebtedness, working capital, net
     worth, interest coverage and debt to equity ratios.

          On October 13, 1994, AAI entered into a two year revolving credit
     agreement with two banks for $20,000,000, including a commitment for
     up to $10,000,000 of commercial letters of credit.  The revolving
     credit is limited to a percentage of the eligible accounts receivable,
     as defined.  The agreement provides that AAI may select among several
     interest rate options.  The agreement provides for restrictive
     covenants among which are the maintenance of a certain capital base,
     as defined; leverage and cash flow coverage ratios; limitations on
     indebtedness; and limitations on transfers of funds and use of such
     funds by the Company or its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Borrowings
     under the credit agreement and the outstanding notes with the
     insurance companies are collateralized by the capital stock and assets
     of AAI and its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain wholly owned
     subsidiaries of the Company.  Such borrowings are guaranteed by the
     Company, certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all AAI wholly
     owned subsidiaries.  There was $1,200,000 outstanding under the credit
     agreement at December 31, 1994.

          At December 31, 1994 and 1993, AAI's net assets of approximately
     $66,000,000 and $45,000,000, respectively, were restricted under debt
     agreements.

          Under an additional line-of-credit agreement with a bank, the
     Company may borrow up to $4,000,000 including a commitment for up to
     $2,000,000 of commercial letters of credit.  At

     December 31, 1994, the unused portion of this credit line was
     $1,000,000.  The credit agreement expires November 30, 1995, and
     requires commitment fees which are not material.  The agreement
     incorporates the covenants of the note purchase guaranty agreement and
     is guaranteed by two subsidiaries of the Company.

          The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings under its short-
     term revolving credit agreements and long-term debt approximate their
     fair value.

          The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings
     outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993, was 7.67% and 4.88%,
     respectively.

     NOTE 6:   ACQUISITIONS

          On January 18, 1994, the Company purchased all the outstanding
     shares of  Symtron Systems, Inc. (Symtron), a producer of fire fighter
     training simulators for government and commercial markets.  The
     purchase price consisted of cash payments of $2,000,000, assumption of
     certain liabilities of approximately $5,900,000, and contingent
     payments not to exceed $1,000,000, based on the net worth at specified
     dates and future profits on contracts existing at the acquisition
     date.  Additionally, contingent amounts are payable if certain pretax
     profits, as defined in the purchase agreement, are earned for each of
     the years in the five year period ending December 31, 1998.  Funds
     generated from operations and an existing line of credit were utilized
     to finance the purchase of Symtron.

          The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, accordingly, the
     operations of Symtron are included in the Company's 1994 financial
     statements from the date of acquisition.  Total revenues of Symtron in
     1993 and 1992 were less than 3% of the consolidated sales of the
     Company and total assets were less than  2% of consolidated assets.

                                                                           
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE 7:   STOCK OPTIONS

          The Incentive Stock Option Plan adopted in 1982 provided for the
     issuance of options to key employees to purchase common stock of the
     Company.  Options expired 10 years from the date of grant.  The plan
     terminated in February 1992, and all outstanding options (7,408 with
     exercise prices of $14.65) expired in May 1993.  During 1992, options
     to acquire 6,560 shares were exercised at $8.765. 

          In May 1994, the shareholders approved the 1994 Stock Option
     Plan, which provides for the granting of options with respect to the
     purchase of an aggregate of up to 600,000 share of common stock of the
     Company from time to time to key employees of the Company and its
     subsidiaries.  Options granted may be either "incentive stock
     options," within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal Revenue
     Code, or non-qualified options.








     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

          The options are granted at not less than market value at the date
     of grant and are exercisable over a period determined by the Board of
     Directors, but no longer than ten years after the date they are
     granted.  During 1994, options were granted for 94,000 shares at
     exercise prices of $4.50 and $4.75 per share. 
                                                                           
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE 8:   LEASES

     Total rental expense for all operating leases amounted to $2,714,000
     in 1994, $2,803,000 in 1993, and $2,994,000 in 1992.  Contingent
     rental payments were not significant.

     The future minimum rental commitments as of December 31, 1994, for all
     noncancelable leases were 
     $2,000,000 in 1995; $1,500,000 in 1996; $617,000 in 1997; $418,000 in
     1998; $305,000 in 1999; and $360,000 thereafter.

     NOTE 10:   PENSION ARRANGEMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS

     The Company and its subsidiaries have a number of noncontributory
     defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. 
     Plans covering salaried and management employees provide pension
     benefits that are based on the employee's average compensation for the
     highest five consecutive years before retirement and years of service. 
     Plans covering hourly employees and union members generally provide
     benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.  The Company's
     funding policy for the plans is to make the minimum annual
     contributions required by applicable regulations.

     A summary of the components of net periodic pension cost for the plans
     is as follows:

     The plans' assets are invested in listed stocks and bonds and
     interest-bearing cash equivalents.

          The discount rates assumptions were reduced in 1993 to give
     consideration to declining interest rates.  This change resulted in an
     increase to the accumulated benefit obligation and the projected
     benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by  $13,561,000 and
     $16,242,000, respectively.

          As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
     87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," the Company recorded an
     additional pension liability of  $2,857,000 at  December 31, 1993 to
     reflect the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair
     value of plan assets for one of its defined benefit plans.   Since the
     additional liability may not exceed the related unrecognized prior
     service costs, a reduction in shareholders' equity ($901,000 net of
     tax benefit) was separately reported at December 31, 1993.

          On  November 30, 1994, the energy systems segment suspended
     future benefit accruals by freezing the non-union employees' defined
     benefit plan.  This resulted in a pension curtailment gain of
     $1,092,000 ($675,000 net of taxes or $.06 per share).  The Company
     replaced the defined benefit plan with a defined contribution benefit
     plan.  Employee contributions and employer matching are based on
     specified formulas. In addition, a curtailment loss of  $164,000
     ($101,000 net of tax benefit or $.01 per share) was recognized for
     another plan due to reductions of staffing levels at the Company's
     defense segment.  On December 31, 1994, the defense segment merged its
     two defined benefit plans, and subsequent to year-end converted them
     into a single cash balance plan.  In accordance with the Cash Balance
     Plan, a participant's benefit includes the actuarial equivalent of the
     participant's accrued benefit under the applicable predecessor plan,
     annual allocations based upon a percentage of salary, and interest
     earned on such participant's account.  The defense segment also
     amended its 401 (k) plan subsequent to year-end to provide for
     employer matching contributions based on specified formulas.  The
     effect of the changes in the plans' status has been reflected as of
     December 31, 1994.

          During 1993, the curtailment expense was included in the
     restructuring charge  (see Note 17).  During 1992, the Company's
     energy systems segment offered an early retirement program to
     employees meeting specified conditions.  This early retirement program
     principally included up to five years of credited service in the
     subsidiary's pension plans and the payment of certain medical benefits
     for defined periods.  This offer was accepted by 17 employees.  The
     present value of the associated costs of these special termination
     benefits amounted to approximately $1,191,000, of which $816,000 will
     be paid by the pension plans.  It is expected that the Company will
     fund the pension plans for these costs over a thirty-year period.
                                                                           
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE 11:   POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

          In addition to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, a
     subsidiary of the Company sponsors a defined benefit health care plan
     that provides postretirement medical benefits to full-time employees
     who have worked 10 years and attained age 62 or 30 years of service
     with the Company.  The plan is non-contributory for retirees and
     contributory for spouses.  The retiree spousal contributions are
     adjusted annually.  Both the retiree and spouse plan contain cost-
     sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.  The accounting
     for the plan anticipates future cost sharing changes to the written
     plan that are consistent with the Company's expressed intent to
     increase the spousal contribution to the point that the entire cost
     for spouses will be contributory at the end of 10

     years commencing from January 1, 1993 and limit the amount it will
     contribute for retiree insurance costs, as well as each active
     employee who later becomes a retiree, to no more than double the
     amount which the Company paid for coverage on January 1, 1993.  The
     actuarial and recorded liabilities for these benefits have not been
     funded.  The accumulated benefit obligation was determined using the
     unit credit method and an assumed discount rate of 8.5% in 1994 and
     1993.  The assumed health care cost trend rate used was 12% for
     medical and 6.4% for dental decreasing to 6% and 5%, respectively, in
     the year 2003.  An increase of 1% in the health care trend rate would
     not materially increase the cost or accumulated postretirement benefit
     due to the limit of the Company not being obligated to pay more than
     double the amount which the Company was paying for coverage on January
     1, 1993.

          Another subsidiary also sponsors a defined benefit health care
     plan that provides postretirement medical and dental benefits to full-
     time employees who have worked 10 years and attained age 60.  Dental
     benefits cease for both retiree and spouse once the retiree reaches
     age 65.  Surviving spouses are eligible for pre-retirement death
     benefits.  Employees aged 55, but less than 60, with at least 20 years
     of service receive only medical benefits commencing when the retiree
     reaches age 65.  No dental benefit is provided.  The accumulated
     benefit obligation was determined using the unit credit method and an
     assumed discount rate of  8.5% in 1994 and 8% in 1993.  The assumed
     health care cost trend rate was 12% decreasing to 7% in 11 years.  The
     health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the
     amounts reported.  A 1% increase in the health care trend rate would
     increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December
     31, 1994 by $431,000 at year-end 1995.  The effect of a 1% increase in
     the health care trend rate would not materially increase the net
     periodic cost.

          Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
     Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires that the
     projected future cost of providing postretirement benefits, such as
     health and life insurance, be recognized as an expense as employees
     render service instead of when the benefits are paid.  The effect of
     adopting the new rules increased the 1993 loss before the cumulative
     effect of accounting changes by $693,000 ($441,000, or $.04 per share
     net of  tax benefit).  The cumulative effect of this change in
     accounting increased the 1993 net loss by $12,890,000 or $1.05 per
     share net of  tax benefit.  Postretirement benefit cost for 1992,
     which was recorded on a cash basis, has not been restated.

          The costs of certain health care provided by the Company for
     eligible retired employees were $1,719,000 and $1,177,000 in 1994 and
     1993, respectively.  In 1992 such benefits were recognized as incurred
     and amounted to $1,335,000.

     $180,695,000 in 1992.  No single customer, other than the United
     States Government, accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales in
     any year.  In 1993, export sales which amounted to $31,258,000 and
     were composed primarily of sales to Asia and Europe.  Export sales in
     1994 and 1992 amounted to less than 10% of net sales in those years.

     NOTE 13:   INCOME TAXES

          Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for
     Income Taxes."  Under SFAS No. 109, the liability method is used in
     accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred tax assets
     and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
     reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
     using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
     differences are expected to reverse.  In addition, the effect on
     deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period
     that includes the enactment date.  Prior to the adoption of this
     statement, income tax expense was determined using the deferred method
     whereby deferred tax expense was based on items of income and expense
     that were reported in different years in the financial statements and
     tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year
     the difference originated and reversed.

          The Company elected to adopt SFAS No. 109 by reporting the
     cumulative effect of the change in the method for accounting for
     income taxes as of the beginning of 1993.  The cumulative effect of
     this accounting change amounted to $13,884,000 ($1.13 per share),
     which reduced the 1993 net loss.  The effect of the change in
     accounting for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 was not
     material.  Prior years' financial statements have not been restated to
     apply the provision of SFAS No. 109.

          Following is a reconciliation of the difference between total tax
     expense (benefit) and the amount computed by applying the federal
     statutory income tax rate (34%) to income or (loss) from operations
     before income taxes:

     In 1993, credits for research and experimental expenditures (research
     credit) of $1,288,000 were recognized, thereby increasing the current
     federal income tax credit.  Approximately $726,000  of this research
     credit resulted from payments received in 1993 related to amended
     returns of prior years and $562,000 principally resulting from the
     extension of the research credit which had previously expired in June
     1992.  No research or experimental credits were recognized in the
     provision for income taxes in 1994.

          Deferred income tax expense (credit), resulting primarily from
     differences in accounting methods used for financial and tax purposes,

     NOTE 16:   LITIGATION

          The Company, along with various other parties, has been named in
     five claims (including four tort claims) relating to environmental
     matters based on allegations principally related to a predecessor's
     operations.  These tort actions seek recovery for personal injury and
     property damage among other damages.  In one tort claim, class
     certification was granted as to both property damage and medical
     monitoring classes.  The Company has joined the other defendants in
     appealing the class certification issue to the Arizona Supreme Court.

          The Company owned and operated a small facility at a site in the
     State of Arizona that manufactured semi-conductors between 1959 and
     1960.  All such operations of the Company were sold prior to 1962. 
     This facility may have used trichloroethylene ("TCE") in small
     quantities.  However, to date, there is no evidence that this facility
     released or disposed of TCE at this site.

          On May 18, 1993, the State of Arizona filed suit against the
     Company seeking the recovery of investigative costs, injunctive relief
     to require the Company to perform a Remedial Investigation and
     Feasibility Study, and ultimately to require the remediation of
     alleged soil and groundwater contamination at and near a certain
     industrial site.  Since then the State has brought in  co-defendants
     whose operations at the site were substantially larger than those of
     the Company.  The parties are engaged in active discovery.

          Management intends to vigorously contest these actions and
     believes that the resolution of these actions will not be material to
     the Company.

          The Company is involved in various other lawsuits and claims,
     including certain other environmental matters, arising out of the
     normal course of its business.  In the opinion of management, the
     ultimate amount of liability, if any, under pending litigation,
     including claims described above, will not have a materially adverse
     effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.

     NOTE 17:   RESTRUCTURING

          On March 29, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
     plan of reorganization and restructuring of the operations of its
     defense industry subsidiary, AAI Corporation.  The Company estimated
     and recorded in the first quarter a restructuring charge of
     $23,000,000 ($14,700,000 or $1.20 per share net of tax benefit).  The
     plan of reorganization and restructuring, which was considered
     necessary due to the declining Department of Defense budget and
     continuing financial problems of the airline industry, included costs
     of organizational and product-line changes, consolidation of
     facilities and work force reductions of approximately 300 at AAI and
     its four subsidiaries.  A major portion of the charge resulted from
     the termination of the operations of AAI/MICROFLITE, a manufacturer of
     flight simulators and training devices, due to a lack of significant
     new orders.  AAI/MICROFLITE was acquired in 1991.  Net sales related
     to the AAI/MICROFLITE operations amounted to $646,000, $2,600,000 and
     $7,700,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. AAI/MICROFLITE
     incurred pretax losses of $2,561,000 ($1,690,000 or $.14 per share,
     net of tax benefit) in 1993, $8,800,000 ($5,800,000 or $.47 per share
     net of tax benefit) in 1992 and an immaterial loss in 1991.

          As of December 31, 1993, the restructuring program was
     substantially completed.  During 1994, $750,000, related to the
     consolidation and discontinuation of certain manufacturing activities
     was expended.  The net loss for 1993 includes $22,500,000 of pretax
     charges ($14,370,000 or $1.17 per share net of tax benefit) which
     consisted of $13,822,000 of write-downs to reduce the carrying value
     of affected assets, including certain inventories, intangibles and an
     office/manufacturing complex at AAI/MICROFLITE, to net realizable
     value, $6,683,000 of employee-related expenses associated with the
     consolidation, relocation, and termination of certain operations, and
     $1,995,000 of other expenses.

          Assets held for sale of $5,439,000 included on the Consolidated
     Balance Sheet at December 31, 1993, relate to the remaining assets of
     AAI/MICROFLITE, including the office/manufacturing complex.  The
     Company sold these assets in 1994, which resulted in a gain of
     $1,304,000.  The restructuring program was completed in 1994.

     REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     Board of Directors and Shareholders
     United Industrial Corporation
     New York, New York

          We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
     United Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994
     and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
     cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
     December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility
     of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
     opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
     the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
     statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
     assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
     made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
     reasonable basis for our opinion.

          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
     position of United Industrial Corporation and subsidiaries at December
     31, 1994 and 1993, and the consolidated results of their operations
     and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
     December 31, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
     principles.

          As discussed in Notes 11 and 13 to the consolidated financial
     statements, effective January 1, 1993 the Company changed its method
     of accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and
     income taxes.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          Net sales for the year 1994 were $209,727,000.  This was 17% less
     than 1993 net sales of $252,993,000, which in turn, was 1% greater
     than 1992 sales of  $251,315,000.  In general, the overall reduction
     in defense spending has adversely impacted the Company's sales.  

          The Company had net income of $5,212,000 in 1994 compared to a
     loss, before the effect of changes in accounting, of $12,017,000 in
     1993 and net income of $6,393,000 in 1992.   Net income in 1994
     includes a net pension curtailment gain of $928,000 ($574,000 net of
     taxes or $.05 per share).  See Note 10.  The net loss in 1993 included
     a restructuring charge at the Company's defense subsidiary, AAI
     Corporation, of $22.5 million ($14.4 million, or $1.17 per share, net
     of tax benefit).  See Note 17.  A major portion of the charge resulted
     from the termination of operations of AAI/MICROFLITE, a business
     acquired in 1991.   Also, in 1993, the net loss was reduced by
     $1,288,000 ($.11 per share) for tax credits for research and
     experimental expenditures and $994,000 ($.08 per share) resulting from
     a net cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.  In 1992,
     net income included charges for special termination benefits of
     $786,000,  related to early retirement programs, net of taxes.  

          Gross profit amounted to $48,508,000 or 23.1% in 1994,
     $44,804,000 or 17.7% in 1993, and $62,311,000 or 24.8% in 1992.  The
     increase in gross profit in 1994 compared to 1993 represents improved
     profit performance by the defense subsidiary, including continued
     progress in the Company's efforts to control costs  on certain major
     long-term contracts.  In 1992,  the decrease in net sales affected the
     overall absorption of overhead costs on existing contracts of the
     Company's

<PAGE>
     

     defense subsidiary.  As a result, overhead costs as a percent of net
     sales increased in 1992, due principally to AAI/MICROFLITE.  In
     addition, cost overruns on certain defense contracts negatively
     impacted gross profit in 1992. 

         The return to profitability from operations in 1994 was due to not
     only successful performance on most contracts and the containment of
     costs on certain long-term contracts, but also the elimination of
     certain selling and administration expenses resulting from the
     Company's organizational changes in 1994 and 1993.  The effects of
     these matters were  a decrease in selling and administrative expenses
     of approximately $3,200,000 in 1994 and $7,400,000 in 1993 due to work
     force reductions at the defense subsidiary and the termination of
     operations at AAI/MICROFLITE.  Interest income was $1,840,000 in 1994,
     $3,650,000 in 1993, and $3,879,000 in 1992.  The decrease in interest
     income was principally due to the reduced note receivable balance
     resulting from the installment payments on such note receivable which
     has a 14% interest rate.  However, in 1993, the decrease was partially
     offset by interest on tax refunds and other tax related items. 
     Interest expense was $3,202,000 in 1994, $3,011,000 in 1993 and
     $3,193,000 in 1992.   Decreased average borrowings were offset by
     higher interest rates in 1994, resulting in increased interest
     expense.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

          Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $6,132,000 at the end of
     1994, $3,906,000 at the end of 1993 and $2,608,000 at the end of 1992. 
     The Company s principal uses of capital during the past several years
     relate to acquisitions, new projects and the repayment of long term
     debt.  The Company intends to continue growing its diversification
     into non-DOD markets. In January 1994, the Company acquired Symtron
     Systems, Inc., a business engaged in the development and production of
     patented fire fighter trainers, and in January 1992 acquired ACL
     Technologies, Inc., a business engaged in the design and manufacture
     of fluid test systems (see Note 6).  Both of these businesses serve
     government and commercial markets.  Net advances of  $4,557,000 and
     $13,236,000 have been made to Symtron and ACL, respectively , since
     their acquisition.   The Company anticipates that the receipt of new
     contracts will enable both Symtron and ACL to become self-financing.  
     Other commercial ventures include AAI's entry into the transit systems
     market and the launching of the Next Generation Weather Observing
     System (NEXWOS). Currently, AAI is teamed with Siemens Duewag
     Corporation to produce light rail vehicles for the Los Angeles area
     and other Siemens' North American undertakings in the future.  Also in
     1994, AAI's new transportation subsidiary, Electric Transit, Inc., a
     joint venture between AAI and a Czech Republic firm, Skoda, emerged
     the winner of a competition to build a fleet of 63 electric trolley
     buses for the Dayton, Ohio area.

          The Company expects to meet its cash requirements for 1995 from
     operations, payments on its note receivable and borrowings under its
     existing lines of credit.  The Company's defense subsidiary has a
     revolving credit arrangement and note agreement that contain
     restrictive covenants with respect to payment of dividends or advances
     and loans to the Company. These restrictions have

<PAGE>
     

     not materially affected the Company's ability to meet its cash
     requirements.   Annual installment payments of $8,540,000 on the
     Company's note receivable (see Note 4) concluded in February 1995;
     interest income related to this note decreased by approximately
     $1,196,000 in 1994.  Factors relating to the amounts of cash and cash
     equivalents are explained in detail in the Consolidated Statement of
     Cash Flows.  The Company declared cash dividends of $.21 per share in
     1994, $.44 per share in 1993 and $.64 per share in 1992, and amounted
     to payments of $2,571,000 in 1994, $5,381,000 in 1993, and $7,845,000
     in 1992.  In 1994, the Company's customary fourth quarter dividend was
     declared in February 1995 ($.07 per share).  The ratio of current
     assets to current liabilities was 2.2 at the end of 1994, compared to
     2.0 at the end of 1993 and 1.5 at the end of 1992.  The current ratio
     continued to increase in 1994, principally due to reductions in
     accounts receivable from the U.S. Government and short-term
     borrowings.

          Capital expenditures were $4,146,000 in 1994, $5,931,000 in 1993,
     and $5,547,000 in 1992. There are no material commitments for
     acquisition of capital assets as of December 31, 1994.

          On October 13, 1994, AAI entered into a two-year revolving credit
     agreement with two banks for $20,000,000, including a commitment for
     up to $10,000,000  for commercial letters of credit.   The revolving
     credit is limited to a percentage of the eligible accounts receivable,
     as defined.  Immediately prior to entering into this credit facility,
     AAI prepaid $5,000,000 of the $25,000,000 notes payable with certain
     insurance companies, thereby reducing the outstanding principal
     balance to an aggregate of $20,000,000.  The agreement provides for
     restrictive covenants among which are:  the maintenance of a certain
     capital base, as defined, leverage and cash flow coverage ratios,
     limitations on indebtedness, and limitations on transfers of funds,
     and use of such funds by the



































     
<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Borrowings under the
     credit agreement and the outstanding notes with the insurance
     companies are collateralized by the capital stock and assets of AAI
     and its wholly owned subsidiaries and certain wholly owned
     subsidiaries of the Company.  Such borrowings are guaranteed by the
     Company, certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all AAI wholly
     owned subsidiaries.

          At December 31, 1994 and 1993, AAI's net assets of approximately
     $66,000,000 and $45,000,000, respectively, were restricted under debt
     agreements.

          Under an additional line-of-credit agreement with a bank, which
     expires November 30, 1995, the Company may borrow up to $4,000,000
     including a commitment for up to $2,000,000 of commercial letters of
     credit.  At December 31, 1994, the unused portion of this credit line
     was $1,000,000.  This agreement incorporates the covenants of the note
     purchase guarantee agreement and is guaranteed by two subsidiaries of
     the Company.

          Long-term debt at December 31, 1994 amounted to $20,000,000, or
     18.4% of total capitalization, compared with $25,000,000 or 22.6% of
     total capitalization at end of 1993 (See Note 5).

          Earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average
     number of the common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the
     assumed exercise of all stock options having exercise prices less than
     the average market price of the common stock using the treasury stock
     method.
