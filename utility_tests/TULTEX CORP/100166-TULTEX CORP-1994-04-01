   Nothing in this form shall be construed to imply that the Commission has 
verified any information contained herein.

   If the notification relates to a portion of the filing checked above, 
   identify the Item(s) to which the notification relates:

Part I - Registrant Information

     Full Name of Registrant 
     TULTEX CORPORATION 
     ------------------

     Address of Principal Executive Office 
     101 Commonwealth Boulevard, P. O. Box 5191
     ------------------------------------------

     City, State and Zip Code
     Martinsville, Virginia  24115
     -----------------------------

Part II - Rules 12b-25 (b) and (c)

If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or 
expense and the registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25(b), the 
following should be completed. (Check box if appropriate)

[X]  (a) The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this 
form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or expense;

[X]  (b) The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition report 
on Form 10-K, Form 20-F, 11-K or Form N-SAR, or portion thereof will be 
filed on or before the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due 
date; or the subject quarterly report or transition report on Form 10-Q, or
portion thereof will be filed on or before the fifth calendar day following 
the prescribed due date; and

[X]  (c) The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 
12b-25(c) has been attached if applicable.




Part III - Narrative

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 20-F, 11-K, 10-Q, 
N-SAR or the transition report or portion thereof could not be filed within 
the prescribed time period.

The Registrant is renegotiating certain of the covenants in its revolving 
credit and long-term loan agreements. Renegotiation of these covenants is 
necessary prior to completion of Registrant's financial statements for the 
fiscal year ending January 1, 1994, and the delivery of the opinion of
Registrant's independent auditors.  Although Registrant and its lenders have 
orally agreed to the principal terms of the renegotiated covenants, 
documenting these agreements in the form of amendments to the loan agreements
has proven to be extremely time-consuming because of the complexity of the 
lending arrangements and the number of lenders involved. Notwithstanding 
Registrant's efforts to complete this process to permit filing of the annual 
report on Form 10-K within the prescribed period, Registrant has been unable 
to do so. Registrant expects to be able to complete and file its Form 10-K
by April 16, 1994.

Part IV - Other Information

     (1) Name and telephone number of person to contact
in regard to this notification

     (2) Have all other periodic reports required under section 13 or 15(d) 
     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or section 30 of the Investment 
     Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months or for such shorter 
     period that the registrant was required to file such report(s) been 
     filed?  If the answer is no, identify report(s).

                                                 							 [X] Yes     [ ] No

     operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will 
     be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject 
     report or portion thereof?

                                                 							 [X] Yes     [ ] No

     If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively 
     and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why a 
     reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

For the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994, net income was $5,903,000, or 16 
cents per share, compared with $13,191,000, or 42 cents per share for the

$533,611,000, compared with $503,946,000 for the year ended January 2, 1993.  

The news release of February 8, 1994 follows in its entirety:

TULTEX CORPORATION RECORDS LOWER SALES AND EARNINGS FOR 1994 DUE TO DECREASE 
IN DEMAND FOR ACTIVEWEAR

MARTINSVILLE, VA, February 8, 1994 - Tultex Corporation (NYSE -TTX) today 
announced lower sales and earnings for fourth quarter and fiscal 1993 due 
to a significant decline in demand for activewear in the latter half of the 
year.

For the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994, net income was $5,903,000, or 16 
cents per share, compared with $13,191,000, or 42 cents per share for the 
previous 12 months. Sales for the year ended January 1, 1994, were 
$533,611,000, compared with $503,946,000 for the year ended January 2, 1993.

Fourth quarter sales were $155,242,000, compared with $163,452,000 for the 
fourth quarter of 1992.  Net income for the period was $2,241,000 or 6 cents 
per share, compared with $13,021,000 or 44 cents per share for the same 
period in 1992.

In addition to a decrease in demand, fourth quarter earnings were adversely 
impacted by reduced operating schedules and expenses associated with 
streamlining operations.  The approximate impact of these events was 
$2,563,000, or 9 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1993.

In addition, the company changed its method of determining cost of inventories 
from last-in, first-in (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method 
during the fourth quarter.  This change, which was applied by restating
previously reported financial results, did not materially impact earnings for 
fiscal 1993.  Earnings for fiscal 1993 were also lower as a result of the 
company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."

"In response to a downturn in demand for activewear, we have made and 
implemented many tough decisions with regards to streamlining our operations," 
stated Mr. Franck.  "The decrease in demand for activewear at retail resulted 
in a dramatic build-up in inventories throughout the activewear industry, 
which causes us to remain cautious going into 1994. We will continue to seek 
ways to reduce our costs in order to remain successful in this competitive 
industry."

"In 1994, we will continue to focus on our higher end apparel brands--Logo 
Athletic (registered trademark) and Discus Athletic (registered trademark)-- 
which gained market share in 1993.  We will also continue to expand our 
T-shirt business and capitalize on opportunities to build Tultexr T-shirts 
into a stronger trade brand.  While the coming months will be challenging,
we believe we will be successful because of our cost structure, our 
manufacturing capabilities and our experienced work force," concluded 
Mr. Franck.

Tultex Corporation is vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of 
activewear and licensed sports apparel, selling many of its products under 
the Tultex (registered trademark), Brittania (registered trademark), 
Discus Athletic (registered trademark), Logo 7 (registered trademark) and 
Logo Athletic (registered trademark) brand names.  The company operates 
manufacturing plants in Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Massachusetts 
and Jamaica.
