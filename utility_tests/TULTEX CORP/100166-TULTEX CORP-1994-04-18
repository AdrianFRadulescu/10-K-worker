PART    I

Item 1.  Business

Tultex Corporation is a Virginia corporation engaged principally in the 
business of manufacturing and selling textile products.  The company is a 
vertically integrated producer of fleece and jersey activewear and leisure 
time apparel.  It operates apparel plants in Virginia, North Carolina, 
Indiana, Massachusetts and Jamaica, and yarn plants in North Carolina. 

The principal products of the company are knitwear items of various kinds for 
work and casual wear such as sweatshirts, jogging suits, hooded jackets, 
headwear and T-shirts.  The company manufactures apparel products under 
Tultex (Registered Trademark), Tultex Maximum Sweats (Registered Trademark), 
Tultex Super Weights (Registered Trademark), Discus Athletic (Registered 
Trademark), Universal (Registered Trademark), Logo 7 (Registered Trademark), 
Logo Athletic (Registered Trademark) and Competitor (Registered Trademark)
brand labels and private labels.  In 1991, the company was licensed to 
manufacture and market adult fleecewear under the Brittania (Registered 
Trademark) label owned by Levi Strauss & Co.  These products are distributed 
at wholesale through company sales offices and manufacturers' representatives 
throughout the United States and abroad, primarily to discount and chain 
stores, mail houses, screenprinters and contract customers.  The total 
revenues of the company were $533,611,000 in 1993, $503,946,000 in 1992 and 
$349,910,000 in 1991.  In 1993, sales in the last half of the year were 64% 
compared to 68% and 71% in the last half of 1992 and 1991, respectively.   
The company has over 4,400 customers. No single customer accounted for 10% 
of consolidated net sales in fiscal 1993.  Total sales to the five largest 
customers were $186,253,000 in 1993, $175,581,000 in 1992 and $121,555,000 
in 1991.

The company's products are manufactured in 12 plants in Virginia and North 
Carolina, one plant in Indiana, one plant in Massachusetts and one plant in 
Jamaica, operated by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, AKOM, Ltd., a 
Cayman Islands, B.W.I corporation.  The company also operates a maquiladora
sewing operation in Mexico.  These products are marketed by the company 
through its national sales organization and designated sales representatives. 
The Customer Service Center has centralized the storage of most nondecorated 
garments and provides a means of automatic storage and retrieval, supporting 
packing and shipping operations, resulting in improved inventory management 
and customer service.  Currently the company stores goods in 6 warehouses.

The company's traditional business is to market fleece and jersey knit 
activewear with an emphasis on sales of basic style garments in high-volume 
markets.  The company's marketing methods are typical of producers of basic 
clothing products.  Its merchandising department keeps abreast of current
fashionable styles and colors.  After internal reviews by manufacturing 
departments, selected customers preview and comment upon prototype garments 
before the merchandising department determines those to be presented in sales 
catalogs.  Production is planned on orders received and anticipated customer 
orders for these garments. 







<PAGE> 2

The company is a major manufacturer and marketer of fleeced knitwear and a 
significant competitor in this market, although its exact competitive position 
is unknown.  While management estimates that there are five major domestic
competitors in the fleeced knit activewear segment of the apparel industry, the
company's products compete with all clothing which is used for the same general
purposes by the consumer.  Competition from both domestic and foreign apparel
manufacturers is intense and, although brand awareness by the consumer appears 
to be developing in importance, price remains the principal competitive factor.

The 1992 acquisitions of Logo 7 and Universal Industries, now a part of Logo 7,
have made the company a major competitor in the licensed sports apparel 
business, one of the fastest growing portions of the apparel industry.  Logo 7
decorates garments using silkscreening or embroidery and markets decorated 
headwear.  Logo 7 is a licensee of the National Football League, National 
Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball for 
the manufacturing and marketing of certain apparel products bearing logos of 
teams that are a part of those organizations.  

Logo 7's apparel product lines include T-shirts, golf shirts and sweaters, 
basic fleece products, shorts, fashion fleece, jerseys, wind suits, and 
jackets.  Most items are sold in a relatively broad range of colors, due to 
requirements to match the relevant team colors.  In the silkscreening process,
Logo 7 uses automatic silkscreen machines and dryers for longer runs and 
hand-operated presses for shorter or more complicated runs.  The embroidery is
carried out using high-speed, computerized Tajima stitching equipment.  
Generally production is tied to specific orders, although during the slower 
times of the year, some production is devoted to restocking small quantities 
of finished items which Logo 7 keeps in its inventory.  The completed garments
are folded and packed by hand and are typically dispatched within 24 hours.

Logo 7 also decorates, designs and markets headwear to sporting goods stores 
and major retailers throughout the United States.  Logo 7 obtains 80% of its 
headwear product line from the Far East with the remainder sourced 
domestically.  The company maintains non-exclusive domestic licenses with 
professional sports organizations and major colleges for the right to use 
team logos and graphics.  In addition, Logo 7 maintains several 
"toy/character/entertainment" licenses and numerous corporate licenses.  The 
company also markets nondecorated hats to team dealers and children's 
headwear.

The company's yarn operations produce cotton and cotton-synthetic blended 
yarns of various counts.  The yarn produced is principally consumed internally
by the company's apparel operation. 

The company's facilities for manufacturing have adequate capacity to support 
the annual sales growth objective for 1994.  The current nondecorated order 
backlog was estimated at approximately $57,000,000 at the end of 1993, a 
decrease of approximately $29,000,000 from the end of the prior year.  
Backlogs were computed from orders on hand at the last day of each fiscal 
year.  Management cautions that due to the typical second-half seasonality of
the activewear business, year-end order backlogs are not a reliable indicator
of sales volume for the coming year.  Additionally, customers are now ordering
closer to the retail selling season than in the past to shorten lead times 
and minimize inventory risk.   




<PAGE> 3

The company attempts to minimize the seasonal sales effects on manufacturing 
operations by producing a portion of its fall line in spring and summer for 
sales in the following fall and winter months.  The outerwear T-shirts line 
introduced in 1990 and the addition of headwear through the acquisition of
Universal Industries in 1992 are intended to promote additional first-half 
shipments of the company products.    

The principal raw materials are cotton and synthetic fibers, dyes and 
chemicals.  Approximately 9% of the spun yarns in our apparel products is 
purchased from yarn vendors.  These yarns and the dyes and chemicals are 
purchased at competitive prices from numerous suppliers.

Dominion Stores, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates fourteen retail 
stores in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, which sell surplus 
company apparel and apparel items of other manufacturers, and thirty-three 
retail stores in twenty-one states which sell first quality company-made 
products and accessory items.

Tultex Canada, Inc. is a subsidiary that commenced operation in 1990 as part 
of the company's initial expansion into international markets.  In 1992, an 
agreement was also signed with Nissan Trading Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of 
Nissan Motor Co., to market and sell Tultex products in Japan.  While 
international sales were immaterial in 1993, both of these ventures 
experienced strong double digit sales growth over the prior year.

General

Expenditures for research and development in fiscal 1993 were insignificant. 

Approximately 7,000 persons are employed by the company.  No Tultex employees
are represented by a labor union.  

The company, along with other apparel manufacturers in the area, returns 
dyeing wastes for treatment to the City of Martinsville's municipal effluent 
systems.  These treated dyeing wastes do not pose environmental risks.  In 
1989, the city adopted a plan for removing the coloration, caused by the dye
wastes, from the water by using polymer chemicals to combine with the 
extremely small particles of the dye to create a sludge-like substance that 
can be retrieved from the water at the city's wastewater treatment plant.  To
cover the cost to the city, each company pays 50 to 80 cents per thousand 
gallons of water above regular water costs for its portion of the expense. 
The expenditures required do not have a material effect on the company's 
earnings or competitive position.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations

Results of Operations 

The financial results for the first six months of 1992 and all prior periods 
presented have been restated to include Universal Industries, Inc., acquired 
by Tultex in June 1992 through an exchange of stock accounted for as a pooling
ofinterests. In addition, the company changed its method of determining cost 
of inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) method during the fourth quarter of 1993. This change has 
been applied by retroactively restating all prior periods presented. The
following table presents the company's consolidated income statement items as 
a percentage of sales.

*Includes the cumulative effect recognition of SFAS No.96 "Accounting for 
 Income Taxes" adopted as of first quarter 1991.

Net sales and other income for the year ended January 1,1994, increased $30 
million or 6% from 1992 which increased $154 million or 44% from 1991. The 
1993 sales growth was due to a 24% increase in sales of the company's Logo 7 
subsidiary partially offset by lower nondecorated apparel sales. The 1992
sales increase was primarily due to sales of Logo 7 which was acquired by the 
company as of January 1, 1992. Unit sales volume of nondecorated apparel in 
1993 was relatively unchanged from prior year levels, while the average 
selling price decreased 2%.  The 1993 average price decline of nondecorated 
products was primarily due to proportionately higher shipping volume of jersey
products which sell at lower prices than fleece garments.  Unit sales volume 
and average pricing in 1992 each increased 3% from 1991.

The company's nondecorated apparel order backlog at January 1, 1994 was $57 
million versus $86 million at January 2, 1993. This 34% decrease reflects a 
significant decline in demand for activewear in the latter half of 1993 that 
is expected to continue through the first six months of 1994. This decrease 
in demand has resulted in higher manufacturer inventories compared to last 
year.  The company currently plans to operate reduced work schedules to better
align inventories with demand. The combination of lower sales and increased 
product costs due to lower production volume are expected to negatively impact
net income for the first six months of 1994 compared to the first half of 
1993.


<PAGE> 10

Costs of products sold as a percentage of sales increased from 73% for fiscal 
year 1992 to 74% for 1993. The increase in cost of products sold as a 
percentage of sales was primarily due to heavier fabric weights, greater 
sewing detail for nondecorated products, strong decorated apparel sales 
growth with mass merchandisers which generally yield lower margins, and 
expenses associated with streamlining operations. The increase in jersey 
sales, which traditionally yield lower margins than fleece, has also increased
cost of products sold as a percentage of sales. Total apparel production for 
1993 decreased 3% from the comparable period of 1992. The company expects a 
significant increase in raw cotton prices during 1994 due to lower than
anticipated cotton yields.

Depreciation as a percentage of net sales was 4% for 1993 and 1992.  
Depreciation expense in 1993 increased 12% over last year, and in 1992 
depreciation grew 20% over 1991. The 1993 increase was primarily due to 
expenditures for machinery and equipment.

Selling, general and administrative (S,G&A) expenses increased as a percentage
of sales from 16% in 1992 to 17% in 1993. S,G&A expenses in 1993 increased $7 
million or 9% compared to 1992. The primary reason for the S,G&A increase was 
a $5 million increase in royalty expenses related to higher sales of 
professional sports licensed apparel. In 1992, S,G&A expenses increased $36 
million or 79% compared to 1991. This increase was generated by the effect of
the aforementioned acquisition of Logo 7 and increased advertising expense 
due to promotion of the Tultex and Discus Athletic brands.

Interest expense was 3% of sales for 1993 and 1992.  Interest expense was $17
million for 1993 compared to $14 million for 1992. The increase was primarily
the result of higher debt due to increased working capital needs and the
acquisition of Logo 7. The company has experienced increased working capital 
needs due to higher inventory levels and extended payment terms for our 
customers.

The provision for income taxes is a function of pretax earnings and the 
combined effective rate of federal and state income taxes. The effective rate
for combined federal and state income tax was 35% in 1993, 35% in 1992 and 
32% in 1991.  The lower rate for 1991 was the result of permanent differences
between book and tax income and their increased percentage relationship to 
relatively low pretax earnings.

Sales for Logo 7 for 1993 increased 24% from the previous year. Logo 7 
manufactures and markets decorated activewear encompassing a broad range of 
products, such as T-shirts, fleecewear, jackets, windsuits and headwear. Logo
7 offers these screenprinted and embroidered apparel items under licenses from
all major professional sports, colleges and certain entertainment industries. 
Since Logo 7 is primarily positioned in the licensed sports apparel business, 
a portion of the success of the company is tied to the fortunes of sports 
teams.  In 1993, the Dallas Cowboys victory in the Superbowl and the Chicago 
Bulls again winning the NBA Championship were positive factors in the annual 
financial performance. Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys is a representative 
for our Logo Athletic branded products. Logo 7 is adding National Basketball
Association rookie Chris Webber and National Hockey League All-Star Chris 
Chelios as representatives to broaden appeal of the Logo Athletic brand. Logo 
7 is introducing the Driver's Club for NASCAR racing fans in 1994 and has 
obtained the license rights to 1994 World Cup Soccer played at various venues
in the United States, as well as rights to the 1996 Summer Olympic Games to 
be held in Atlanta.

The company foresees significantly higher sales volume of nondecorated jersey
products during 1994 through improved utilization of existing capacity. 
Increased jersey manufacturing capacity is enabling the company for the first
time in 1994 to offer this product to major retail accounts.  Increased sales
are also expected for the company's upscale Discus Athletic brand as a result
of aggressive marketing in the department store and specialty shop channels. 
The Discus Athletic brand of fleece and T-shirts is a sponsor of Men's 
Atlantic Coast Conference Basketball for 1994 through 1996.  Discus Athletic 
commercials will be shown during every regular season game, as well as the 
conference tournament. The company's basic nondecorated fleece product sales 
were disappointing for 1993 and shipment volume is expected to be relatively 
flat in 1994. Efforts to reduce seasonality are somewhat encouraging due to 
continued growth of jersey products, headwear and windsuits.  Despite this 
improvement, 1994 is expected to follow the same general pattern of quarterly 
sales and earnings as evidenced in past years due to the seasonal nature of 
fleece products.  The company is cautious concerning 1994. Competition in the
industry is intense with price decreases anticipated due to higher 
manufacturer inventory levels compared to last year throughout the industry. 
The company's operating schedules and financial performance for the first six 
months of 1994 will be negatively impacted until these inventory levels are 
reduced to more conventional levels.

The company continues to seek ways to lower costs, increase efficiency and 
improve product quality. Strategic Process Management teams have been formed 
to review critical processes in the company and pinpoint probable 
opportunities for significant improvement. This ongoing program is expected to
result in initial cost reductions during 1994. In addition, the company has 
begun streamlining operations which will result in reduced labor and related 
benefit expenses during 1994. These cost reduction efforts will help offset 
pricing pressures from current competitive conditions during 1994.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Net working capital at January 1, 1994 increased $117 million from year-end 
1992, as inventories and accounts receivable increased and working capital 
debt was moved from current liabilities to long-term debt due to replacement 
of the company's short-term bank lines with a $225 million, two-year revolving
credit facility.  

Due to the seasonality of fleecewear shipments, receivables normally peak in 
September and October and begin to decline in December as shipment volume 
decreases and cash is collected. Accounts receivable increased $7 million 
from January 2, 1993 to January 1, 1994. The average number of days' sales in
receivables was 77 for 1993 compared to 73 for 1992. This increase was due to 
the aforementioned extended terms taken by our customers.

Inventories increased $27 million compared to year-end 1992 as a result of 
lower than expected sales unit volume due to the industry downturn. The 
average days' sales in inventory on hand at year-end 1993 increased 13% from 
January 2, 1993; and at year-end 1992, the average number of days' sales in
inventory on hand increased 21% from December 28, 1991. The current ratio at 
year-end was 6.4, 2.0 and 2.0 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1993
increase was the result of the aforementioned revolving credit facility which
is classified as long-term debt.





<PAGE> 12

On October 6, 1993, the company entered into a $225 million revolving credit 
facility which replaced its short-term credit lines. This agreement, which 
has a two-year maturity with three annual options to renew, provides for the 
company's working capital needs.  Average borrowings under this facility
during the fourth quarter were $167 million at an average annual rate of 
3.9%. The highest single day balance reached during the quarter was $190 
million. Outstanding letters of credit under this facility at January 1, 1994
were $10 million. Long-term debt at January 1,1994 increased $112 million 
compared to year-end 1992 due to $121 million outstanding under the revolving 
credit facility partially offset by reclasses to current portion of long-term
debt and regularly scheduled payments. At year end, the company had obtained 
waivers for one loan covenant violation with several lenders. The company 
has obtained amendments for certain loan covenants for 1994. These amendments 
will provide for greater flexibility during the current period of decreased 
demand.

At January 1, 1994, there were no notes payable to banks under short-term 
lines of credit. At January 2, 1993, the comparable amount was $80 million. 
The decrease was due to the company's aforementioned revolving credit 
facility. Short-term borrowings outstanding averaged $92 million, $81 million
and $68 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, at average annual
interest rates of 3.7%, 4.4% and 6.4%. The highest single-day balance reached
each year was $186 million in 1993, $114 million in 1992 and $107 million in 
1991.  In 1993, net cash used by operating activities of $6 million primarily
related to a $27 million increase in inventories and a $7 million increase in
accounts receivable partially offset by depreciation of $23 million and net 
income of $6 million. Cash used by investing activities of $24 million was 
primarily used to finance additions to fixed assets. Cash provided by 
financing activities of $33 million was derived principally from increased 
long-term debt of $121 million partially offset by an $80 million reduction 
in short-term debt. Planned capital expenditures for 1994 are $14 million.  
The company expects annual cash flows from income and non-cash items, 
supplemented by the new revolving credit facility, to support its seasonal 
working capital requirements in 1994.

Stockholders' equity was $179 million at year-end 1993, $179 million at 
year-end 1992 and $157 million at year-end 1991. Stockholders' equity remained
relatively constant from January 2, 1993 to January 1, 1994 since net income 
of $6 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1 million 
were offset by cash dividends declared of $7 million.  The return on average 
stockholders' equity was 3% in 1993, 8% in 1992 and 7% in 1991.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Tultex Corporation
Fiscal years ended January 1, 1994, January 2, 1993 and December 28, 1991.

Note 1--Accounting Policies 
The significant accounting policies followed by  Tultex Corporation and its 
subsidiaries in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
are as follows: 

Basis of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.   

Cash and Equivalents:  The company considers cash on hand, deposits in banks, 
certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities as cash and 
equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.

Inventories:  Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with 
cost determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. See Note 3 for 
information concerning the change in the method of valuing inventories from 
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the FIFO method during 1993.

Property, Plant and Equipment:  Land, buildings and equipment are carried at 
cost. Major renewals and betterments are charged to the property accounts 
while replace-ments, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend 
the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently. Gain or loss on
retirement or disposal of individual assets is recorded as income or expense.

Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method for all depreciable 
assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Classification                          Estimated Useful Lives
- - --------------------------              ----------------------
Land improvements                       20 years
Buildings and improvements              12-50 years 
Machinery and equipment                 3-20 years

Capitalized Interest:  Interest is capitalized on major capital expenditures 
during the period of construction.  Total interest costs incurred and amounts 
capitalized for the fiscal years were:

Interest capitalized        --             --            (2,350)

                     			 =======        =======         ========

Intangible Assets: Goodwill and licenses are being amortized on a 
straight-line basis over 25 years.





<PAGE> 21

Pensions: Pension expense includes charges for amounts not less than the 
actuarially determined current service cost plus amortization of prior 
service costs over 30 years. The company funds amounts accrued for pension 
expense not in excess of the amount deductible for federal income tax 
purposes.

Revenue Recognition: The company recognizes the sale when the goods are 
shipped or ownership is assumed by the customer.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided based upon income reported for 
financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of 
temporary differences between financial and taxable income.

Net Income per Share: Net income per common share is computed using the 
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period after 
giving retroactive effect to stock splits and stock dividends after deducting 
the preferred dividend requirements which accrued during the period.

Segment Information: The company is a vertically integrated manufacturer and 
marketer of activewear and leisure-time apparel which is considered a single 
business segment.

Fiscal Year: The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to 
December 31, which periodically results in a fiscal year of 53 weeks. The 
Universal Industries subsidiary historically observed a calendar year. The 
difference in the year-ends was considered to be immaterial on the pooled
financial results contained in this report. Universal Industries, Inc. 
adopted the fiscal year-end and quarterly reporting periods of Tultex as of 
the acquisition date.

Other Postretirement Benefits: As further described in Note 10, the company 
changed its accounting for the costs of certain life insurance and medical 
benefits for eligible retirees and dependents in 1993.

Note 2--Mergers and Acquisitions 

On January 31, 1992, effective as of January 1, 1992, the company acquired 
assets, certain liabilities, contracts and licenses of Logo 7, Inc., a major 
producer and marketer of licensed sports apparel, for a purchase price of 
approximately $58 million, consisting of $15 million (stated value) of a new
series of Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $7.50 Series B and $43 
million cash. The $43 million cash was obtained with a 17-month interim loan 
from two banks which was prepaid without penalty. The company obtained 
permanent financing on June 26, 1992. The results of Logo 7, Inc. are included
in the company's consolidated statement of income for 1992. The purchase price
of $58 million has been allocated to the various acquired assets.  Goodwill of
$4 million was determined and is being amortized over 25 years on a 
straight-line basis. Logo 7, Inc., which was a Subchapter S corporation, 
reported audited net sales of $92 million and earnings before taxes of $3 
million for the 12 months ended December 31, 1991. Logo 7, Inc. had 
stockholders' equity of $14 million at December 31, 1991.  The following pro 
forma results for 1991 include Logo 7, and do not purport to be indicative of 
the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the  
combination been in effect for the fiscal year or that may result in the 
future. Also included in these 1991 results is Universal Industries, Inc. 
which was acquired in June 1992 and accounted for as a pooling of interests.

On June 30, 1992, the company completed the acquisition of Universal 
Industries, Inc., a professional sports hatwear licensee located in 
Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, through an all-stock deal valued at $11.1 
million for nearly 1.3 million common shares. The acquisition has been 
accounted for as a pooling of interests, and accordingly, the financial 
statements have been restated to include the results of operations for 
Universal for all periods presented.

Note 3--Inventories

The components of inventories are as follows:

                            				========        ========        ========

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company changed its method of 
determining the cost of inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO method. 
Under the current economic environment of low inflation, the company believes 
that the FIFO method will result in a better measurement of operating results.
This change has been applied by retroactively restating the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements. Although this change in method did not 
materially impact net income in 1993, it decreased net income by $4,001,000 
or 14 cents per share in 1992, and $416,000 or 1 cent per share in 1991.

Note 4--Property, Plant and Equipment

Note 5--Short-Term Credit Agreements 

Until October 6, 1993, when the company entered into a two-year revolving 
credit agreement with 12 banks (see Note 6), it had formal short-term lines 
of credit with lending banks aggregating $57,000,000 with interest payable at 
or below the prime rate. At January 2, 1993 and December 28, 1991, the 
weighted average interest rates on borrowings outstanding of $79,825,000 and 
$51,000,000 were 4.1% and 5.3% respectively. The use of these lines was 
restricted to the extent that the company was required to liquidate its 
indebtedness to certain individual banks for a 30-day period each year. At 
times, the company borrowed amounts in excess of the lines on a short-term 
negotiated basis.

The company currently has short-term lines of credit with two lending banks 
totaling $5,000,000. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines 
at January 1, 1994.

<PAGE> 24

As part of the borrowing arrangements, the company was expected to maintain 
average compensating cash balances, which were based on a percentage of the 
available credit line by bank and the percentages varied by bank. The amount 
of compensating balances required for credit lines in effect January 1, 1993 
was an average of $1,320,000. The compensating balances were held under 
agreements which did not legally restrict the use of such funds, and therefore
the funds were not segregated on the face of the balance sheet. The 
compensating cash balances were determined daily by the lending banks based
upon balances shown by the bank, adjusted for average uncollected funds and 
Federal Reserve requirements. During the periods shown in the statements, the
company was in substantial compliance with the compensating requirements. 
Funds on deposit with the lending banks and considered in the compensating
balances were subject to withdrawal; however, the availability of the 
short-term lines of credit were dependent upon the maintenance of sufficient 
average compensating balances. 

The Universal Industries subsidiary, accounted for as a pooling-of-interests 
acquisition, had outstanding under short-term banker's acceptance agreements 
$4,762,000 at December 31, 1991.

The company utilizes letters of credit for foreign sourcing of inventory. 
Letters of credit outstanding were $9,715,000, $5,266,000 and $771,000 at 
January 1, 1994, January 2, 1993 and December 28, 1991, respectively. After 
October 6, 1993, all letters of credit issued were part of the revolving
credit agreement described in Note 6.

On October 6, 1993, the company signed a two-year $225 million revolving 
credit agreement with 12 banks with interest at or below prime. The facility 
replaced the company's previous short-term credit lines used to support 
working capital and future growth. The agreement provides for a two-year 
maturity with three annual options to renew. 

On June 26, 1992, the company issued 8.875% unsecured, senior notes totaling 
$95,000,000. Payments consist of interest only for the first two years and 
installment payments of principal and interest for the remaining five years.
The proceeds of this financing retired an interim loan of $45,000,000 used to 
acquire Logo 7, prepaid $25,000,000 of the $50,000,000 term loan obtained in 
1989 and refinanced other indebtedness.




<PAGE> 25

Interest is due quarterly and principal is due in 11 remaining quarterly 
installments of $2,083,000 on the remaining $22,917,000 of the term loan. 
As a condition to the $25,000,000 prepayment in 1992, the company indemnified 
the term-loan lender for the costs and liabilities associated with an 
interest rate credit exchange agreement that allowed the lender to provide 
fixed-rate financing to the company at the inception of the term loan in 1989.

The term loan agreement, senior notes and revolving credit agreement contain 
provisions regarding maintenance of working capital and restrictions on 
payment of cash dividends.  At January 1, 1994, the company was in compliance 
or had obtained waivers for any violations of covenants. Consolidated 
retained earnings, which were free of dividend restrictions, amounted to 
$2,744,000 at January 1, 1994. 

Interest paid by the company (net of capitalized amounts) in 1993, 1992 and 
1991 was $16,830,000, $13,180,000 and $10,706,000, respectively.

The approximate aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next 
five fiscal years are as follows:

*Includes maturity of $121,000,000 outstanding under revolving credit 
 agreement which the company expects to renew.

Note 7--Dividends 

At December 30, 1989, dividends payable represented amounts paid January 2, 
1990 and April 2, 1990. The latter dividend was declared in December 1989 and 
was charged against stockholders' equity in that period. This dividend was 
for the first quarter 1990 and therefore not included in 1989 dividends per 
share information presented in this report. At January 1, 1994, dividends 
payable represents amounts paid on January 3, 1994.

Note 8--Stock Options In 1988, the company's stockholders ratified the 1987 
Stock Option Plan under which 700,000 shares of common stock were reserved 
for stock option grants to certain officers and employees. The plan provided 
that options may be granted at prices not less than the fair market value on 
the date the option is granted, which means the closing price of a share of 
common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape on 
such day. Some options remain unexercised from the 1987 Stock Option Plan, 
which expired November 19, 1992.










<PAGE> 26

On March 21, 1991, the company's stockholders ratified the 1990 Stock Option 
Plan under which 700,000 shares of common stock were reserved for stock 
option grants to certain officers and employees. Options granted under the 
1990 Plan may be incentive stock options ("ISOs") or nonqualified stock 
options. The option price will be fixed by the Executive Compensation 
Committee of the Board at the time the option is granted, but in the case of 
an ISO, the price cannot be less than the share's fair market value on the 
date of grant. Grants must be made before October 18, 2000 and expire within 
10 years of the date of grant. In exercising options, an employee may 
receive a loan from the company for up to 90% of the exercise price. 
Outstanding loans are shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity on the 
balance sheet.On October 28, 1993, the Board of Directors approved an 
increase of 500,000 shares in the maximum number of shares to be issued 
pursuant to the exercise of options granted under the Plan, extended the
date that grants could be made to October 27, 2003, and provided that no 
participant may be granted options in any calendar year for more than 50,000 
shares of Common Stock. Shareholders will be asked to approve these change at
the Annual Meeting.

A summary of the changes in the number of common shares under option for 
each of the three previous years follows:

Income tax payments were $4,512,000, $4,404,000 and $2,705,000 for 1993, 1992 
and 1991, respectively.

In 1992, the company adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This 
Statement, issued in February 1992, superseded SFAS No. 96, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes," which the company had adopted in 1991. Both statements require 
the liability method in accounting for deferred income taxes. The company's 
adoption of SFAS No. 109 resulted in no material effect on 1992 earnings. The 
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle due to the adoption 
of SFAS No. 96 at the beginning of the 1991 fiscal year was $2,848,000, or
10 cents per share, and is separately shown in the 1991 statement of income.

Note 10--Employee Benefits 

All qualified employees of the parent company and its Universal subsidiary 
are covered by a noncontributory, defined benefit plan. The benefits are 
based on years of service and the employee's highest 5 consecutive calendar 
years of compensation paid during the 10 most recent years before retirement.
Prior service costs are amortized over 30 years. The status of the defined 
benefit plan as of January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993 was as follows:

The following rate assumptions were made for the noncontributory, defined 
benefit and the nonqualified unfunded supplementary retirement plans:

                                   					1993                           1992

Rate of return on plan assets           10.0%                          9.0%

The long-term rate of salary progression for 1993 reflected no anticipated 
rate increase for the first two years, followed by 3.5% for two years, 4% for
six years and 5% thereafter. The comparable rate in 1992 was 5% for all years.
The changes in rates from year to year were made to reflect what management 
considered to be a better approximation of the rates to be realized.

The company's policy has been to fund the minimum required contribution after
the end of the fiscal year plus interest on the contribution from the end of 
the plan year until paid. The company's Universal Industries subsidiary 
historically funded the maximum required contribution during the year.

At the end of 1992, Universal Industries, Inc. pension plan's future service 
benefits were frozen and the plan assets were absorbed into the company's 
pension plan, which resulted in a curtailment loss of $104,000.

The company has a nonqualified, unfunded supplementary retirement plan for 
which it has purchased cost recovery life insurance on the lives of the 
participants. The company is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies.
The amount of coverage is designed to provide sufficient revenues to recover 
all costs of the plan if assumptions made as to mortality experience, policy 
earnings and other factors are realized. Expenses related to the plan were 
$547,000 in 1993, $395,000 in 1992 and $312,000 in 1991. The actuarially 
determined liability which has been included in other deferrals was 
$3,190,000 at January 1, 1994, $2,313,000 at January 2, 1993 and $1,962,000 
at December 28, 1991. 

The following table sets forth the plan's status and amounts recognized in 
the company's financial statements at January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993:

Substantially all employees meeting certain service requirements are 
eligible to participate in the company's employee savings (401-K) plan. 
Employee contributions are limited to a percentage of their compensation, as 
defined in the plan. Although the plan did not provide for any company
contributions in 1992, a matching provision became effective April 1993, but 
was discontinued on January 2, 1994.

A new profit sharing plan was implemented January 1, 1991 which provides for 
a quarterly payment to employees if a profit is reported in the most recently 
completed quarter and is sufficient to recover any previously reported 
quarterly losses.  This replaced the employee bonus plan that was in effect 
in the previous years. The employee profit sharing/bonus expense was $727,000 
in 1993, $4,614,000 in 1992 and $2,446,000 in 1991.

The company also provides certain postretirement medical and life insurance 
benefits to substantially all employees who retire with a minimum of 15 years 
of service for the period of time until the employee and any dependents reach
age 65. The medical plan requires monthly contributions by retired 
participants which are dependent on the participant's length of service, age 
at the date of retirement and Medicare eligibility. The life insurance plan 
is noncontributory. Prior to 1993, the company expensed the costs relating to 
these unfunded plans as incurred. Such costs amounted to approximately 
$375,000 in 1992 and 1991. 

In 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." The standard required companies to recognize the estimated costs 
of provided postretirement benefits on an accrual basis. The company elected
the delayed recognition method of adoption which allows amortization of the 
initial transitional obligation over a 20-year period. At January 3, 1993, 
the actuarially determined accumulated postretirement benefit was $5,101,000.

The amounts recognized on the company's balance sheet at January 1, 1994 were 
as follows:

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation was 8%. The assumed medical cost trend rate was 12% in 1993, 
declining by 1% per year until an ultimate rate of 5% is achieved. The medical
cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the
obligation and net periodic cost reported. A one percentage point increase in
the medical cost trend rate would have increased the accumulated 
postretirement benefit obligation by $337,000 and the aggregate service and 
interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 
1993 by $52,000.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement 
No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." As the company 
does not have significant postemployment benefits, the adoption of this
statement in 1994 is not expected to have a material impact on the company's 
results of operations or financial position.

Rental expense charged to income was $15,092,000 in 1993, $13,696,000 in 
1992 and $12,309,000 in 1991.

Note 13--Employment Agreements 
The company has entered into employment continuity agreements with certain 
of its executives which provide for the payments to these executives of 
amounts up to three times their annual compensation plus continuation of 
certain benefits if there is a change in control of the company (as defined) 
and a termination of their employment. The maximum contingent liability at 
January 1, 1994 under these agreements was approximately $4,560,000.

Employment agreements with certain executives were executed as a result of 
the Logo 7 acquisition. Under predefined events of termination, the company 
could incur a maximum liability of $9,786,000 as of January 1, 1994.

Note 14--Concentration of Credit Risk 
The company's concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number
of primarily domestic customers who are geographically dispersed. The company
has no customer that constituted 10% of net sales in 1993. As disclosed on 
the balance sheet, the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts 
to cover estimated credit losses.

Note 15--Shareholder Rights Plan 
In March 1990, the Board of Directors of the company adopted a Shareholder 
Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one right for each outstanding share 
of common stock to shareholders of record April 2, 1990. Each right entitles 
the registered holder to purchase from the company, until the earlier of 
March 22, 2000 or the redemption of the rights, one one-thousandth of a 
share of newly authorized Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, 
Series A, without par value, at an exercise price of $40. The rights are not 
exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock until the earlier of 
(i) 10 days following the public announcement that a person or a group of 
affiliated persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire beneficial 
ownership of 10% or more of the company's outstanding common stock or (ii) 
10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange 
offer that would result in a person or group owning 10% or more of the 
company's outstanding common stock. The company may redeem the rights at a 
price of $.01 per right at any time prior to the acquisition of 10% or more 
of the company's outstanding common stock or certain other triggering events.

Note 16--Stock Purchase Plan 
In February 1994, the company initiated the Salaried Employees' Stock 
Purchase Plan. Under the plan, employees may elect to purchase shares of the 
company's common stock in amounts ranging from 20-30% of their annual salary.
Employees will pay for the stock through payroll deductions over a 60-month 
period. The shares will be held by the company and interest of 6% per annum 
will be charged until the end of the 60-month period. The price of the 
shares will be fixed as of the last day of trading in February 1994. The 
company has reserved 925,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to 
the plan.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Tultex Corporation

In our opinion, based upon our audits and the report of other auditors, the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated 
statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in stockholders' equity 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tultex 
Corporation and its subsidiaries (the company) at January 1, 1994 and 
January 2, 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 1994, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the company's management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Universal 
Industries, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total 
revenues of $34,984,000 for the year ended December 31, 1991. Those 
statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been 
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to 
the amounts included for Universal Industries, Inc., is based solely on the
report of other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and significant 
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors 
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements, the company changed 
its method of accounting for income taxes in 1992 and 1991. In addition, as 
discussed in Notes 3 and 10 of Notes to the Financial Statements, the 
company changed its method of valuing inventory and accounting for 
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits, respectively, in 1993.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Universal Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Universal Industries, Inc.
as of December 31, 1991 and the related consolidated statements of income and
retained earnings and cash flows and for the two year period ended December 31,
1991 (not presented separately herein). These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the finanical statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the finanical position of Universal Industries Inc. as 
of December 31, 1991, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the two year period ended December 31, 1991 in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

                            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Universal Industries Inc.:

In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements of
Universal Industries, Inc. as of December 31, 1991 and for the two year
period ended December 31, 1991, (not presented separately herein), we have
also audited the following financial statement schedules:

       Schedule V    - Property, Plant and Equipment
       Schedule VI   - Accumulated Depreciation of Property, Plant and
                       Equipment
       Schedule VIII - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts
       Schedule IX   - Short-term Borrowings
       Schedule X    - Supplementary Income Statement Information

In our opinion, these financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic finanical statements taken as a whole, present fairly,
in all material respects, the information required to be included therein.

Exhibit 18

February 23, 1994

To the Board of Directors 
 of Tultex Corporation

Dear Directors:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements included in the 
Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 1994
and issued our report theron dated February 23, 1994. Note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements describes a change in the Corporation's
method of determining the cost of inventories from the last-in, first-out to
the first-in, first-out method. It should be understood that the preferability
of one acceptable method of inventory accounting over another has not been 
addressed in any authoritative accounting literature and in arriving at our
opinion expressed below, we have relied on management's business planning and
judgment. Based on our discussions with management and the stated reasons for
the change, we believe that such change represents, in your circumstances,
the adoption of a preferable alternative accounting principle for inventories
in conformity with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20.

Yours very truly,

/s/ Price Waterhouse
