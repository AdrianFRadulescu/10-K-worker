PART I

Item 1. Business

General
Tultex Corporation is one of the world's largest marketers and manufacturers 
of activewear and licensed sports apparel for consumers and sports enthusiasts. 
The company's diverse product line includes fleeced sweats, jersey products 
(outerwear T-shirts), and decorated jackets and caps. These products are sold 
under the company's own brands led by the Discus Athletic and Logo Athletic 
premium labels and under private labels, including Nike, Levi Strauss, Reebok 
and Pro Spirit. In addition, the company has numerous professional and college 
sports licenses to manufacture and market embroidered and screen-printed 
products with team logos and designs under its Logo Athletic and Logo 7 brands. 
The company is a licensee of professional sports apparel, holding licenses from 
the National Football League ("NFL"), Major League Baseball ("MLB"), the 
National Basketball Association ("NBA") and the National Hockey League ("NHL") 
to manufacture a full range of sports apparel for adults and children.

Historically, Tultex has been a producer of quality fleece products for sale 
to distributors and resale to consumers under private labels. However, in the 
1980s, the activewear industry began to change. Increasing consumer demand 
reflecting more active and casual lifestyles and the industry's historically 
good long-term growth prospects and low fashion risk as compared to other 
apparel products, attracted large, well-financed companies which acquired 
competitors of the company. Simultaneously, larger mass merchandise retailers 
began to exert pressure on margins for lower-priced fleece products.

In recent years, Tultex has initiated a strategy to enhance its competitiveness 
and to capitalize on growth opportunities by becoming a consumer-oriented 
apparel maker able to compete in a changing industry. This strategy includes 
the following elements:

Increasing Emphasis on Higher-Margin Products.  The company is strengthening 
its competitiveness in the activewear business through the development of 
branded and private label, higher-quality and higher-margin products to 
supplement its traditionally strong position in the lower-priced segment of 
the business. The company is developing its own brands, promoting Discus 
Athletic for its premium products and using the Tultex label for the 
value-oriented segment of the market. Discus Athletic's highly visible 
advertising during televised broadcasts of college football and basketball on 
the ESPN and ABC television networks and of Atlantic Coast Conference 
basketball has contributed to significant annual increases in sales of this 
brand since 1992. In addition, Tultex has partnering arrangements to supply 
higher-quality, private label products to companies such as Reebok, Levi 
Strauss and Nike, none of which accounted for more than 10% of the company's 
consolidated sales during 1995. To complement its development of higher-margin 
products, the company began manufacturing jersey products in 1991.

Expanding into Licensed Apparel Business to Complement Activewear Business. 
Tultex's 1992 acquisitions of Logo 7, a marketer of licensed sports apparel, 
and Universal, a marketer of sports licensed headwear, enabled the company to 
achieve the fourth largest market share (12.0%) in the higher-margin licensed 
apparel business in 1994, and have created opportunities for significant 
manufacturing and distribution synergies with the company's activewear 
business.  The promotion of the Logo Athletic brand of licensed apparel 
through television and print advertising, as well as promotional 
arrangements featuring Superbowl quarter back Troy Aikman of the Dallas
<PAGE> 

Cowboys', San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Steve Young, Miami Dolphins'
quarterback Dan Marino,  Denver Broncos' quarterback John Elway  and the 
Green Bay Packers' Reggie White, among others, has helped to increase the 
visibility and sales of Logo Athletic products.

Increasing Distribution Channels and Strengthening Customer Relationships. 
Tultex actively pursues strong relationships with department, sporting goods 
and other specialty stores, such as Sears,  JC Penney, Modell's, Dillard's, 
Foot Locker, Champs and Sports Authority, to distribute its higher margin 
branded and private label products. In addition, the company continues to 
strengthen its relationships with high volume retailers such as Wal-Mart and 
Target by supplying private label and Tultex products. Tultex provides 
customers with exceptional service and support; as an example, its 
distribution capabilities are highly responsive to  customers' changing 
delivery and inventory management requirements.

Investing in Modern Distribution and Production Facilities. During  fiscal 
1988 through fiscal 1995, Tultex invested approximately $208 million in 
capital expenditures, primarily in the construction of its customer service 
center and in high-efficiency spinning, knitting, dyeing, cutting and 
embroidering machinery. In 1991, Tultex began operating the customer service 
center, which the company  believes is the most highly automated in the 
industry. Having made significant investments in its distribution and 
production facilities, the company's 1996 capital budget is set at $16 million.

The company's strategy has improved its sales mix. While net sales increased 
3.5% in fiscal 1995 over 1994, net sales of Discus Athletic activewear 
increased 29.9% to $75.8 million and net sales of Logo Athletic licensed 
apparel increased 42.8% to $92.0 million. Sales of jersey products were $93.1 
million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 1995, representing 24.0% of the 
company's activewear sales during such period compared to 16.5% for fiscal 
1994.  Reduced consumer demand for licensed apparel due to the MLB strike and 
NHL lockout, a slowdown at retail for activewear products in the fourth quarter
and higher raw material costs adversely affected Tultex's results of operations 
during 1995.

The company's activewear business is vertically integrated, spinning 
approximately 80% of the yarn it requires in three yarn plants located in 
North Carolina (the balance is purchased under yarn supply contracts) and 
knitting, dyeing and cutting fabric and sewing finished goods in 7 plants in 
Virginia and North Carolina and one plant in Jamaica. The company's licensed 
sports apparel operations are conducted from one plant in Indiana and one 
plant in Massachusetts.

Industry

The Company produces activewear and licensed sports apparel and headwear for 
sale at a broad range of price points through all major distribution channels.

Activewear

The company's activewear business consists of its fleecewear and jersey 
products. All activewear industry and market share data included herein has 
been estimated by the company based on data provided by Market Research 
Corporation of America, a leading provider of market information on the 
textile industry.


<PAGE> 

Fleecewear. The fleecewear industry, with retail sales of approximately $7.8 
billion in 1995, has grown 1.7% in unit sales from 1990 to 1995. The 
predominant fleecewear products are sweatshirts, pants and shorts. 

Jersey (Outerwear T-shirts). Unit retail sales of jersey products have grown 
7.5% from 1990 to 1995 and in 1995 totaled $7.0 billion, or 73 million dozens. 
Like fleecewear, the industry characteristics of jersey apparel include low 
fashion risk and long-term growth. Imports are a greater threat as the 
weight/labor ratio and the freight costs involved are lower for jersey products 
than for fleecewear; however, the ability to produce large volumes with short 
delivery times gives domestic manufacturers an advantage over import 
competition in both fleecewear and jersey apparel.

Licensed Apparel and Headwear

Estimated wholesale sales of professional sports licensed apparel (including 
headwear) for 1994 were approximately $1.8 billion, according to Sports Style 
Magazine, an industry publication. In general, the company believes that the 
prospects for its continued growth in this market are good, although growth is 
expected to be less rapid than in recent years due to increased competition. 
The continually changing fortunes of existing teams, together with the 
introduction of new franchises, has made the market extremely dynamic, as 
interest in each team fluctuates with its performance. Manufacturers, such as 
the company, with the capacity to respond quickly to these changes with new 
products and designs, enjoy a competitive advantage over smaller competitors. 

Company Products

Activewear

The principal activewear products of the company are fleeced knitwear items 
such as sweatshirts, jogging suits, hooded jackets, headwear and jersey 
apparel for work and casual wear. The company manufactures apparel products 
principally under the Discus Athletic and Tultex brands. Products carrying the 
Discus Athletic name are marketed for sale to chains such as Foot Locker, 
department stores such as Sears and sporting goods stores, while Tultex 
products are marketed for sale to mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and 
wholesale clubs such as Sam's. The company is licensed to manufacture and 
market adult fleecewear under the Britannia trademark owned by Levi Strauss & 
Co. The company also manufactures private-label products for sale under many 
labels, including Nike, Levi Strauss, Reebok and Pro Spirit.

Licensed Apparel and Headwear

The company's licensed apparel products include jackets, sweats, T-shirts, 
baseball-style caps and other headwear, embroidered or imprinted with 
professional and college sports and entertainment-related licensed designs and 
logos. These products are marketed under the Logo Athletic and Logo 7 brands. 
Under the Logo Athletic name, the company offers premium-quality jackets, caps 
and other activewear, including NFL "Pro-Line" authentic sideline gear and NBA 
"Authentics" apparel. Tultex, through Logo 7, acquired Pro-Line status from 
the NFL in 1993, a flagship program entitling the company to sell products 
identical to those worn on the sidelines by NFL players and coaches. Under the 
terms of the non-exclusive four-year Pro-Line contract, the company markets 
Pro-Line products at retail for all 30 NFL teams. Under the terms of the 
non-exclusive three-year NBA Authentics contract, the company markets products 
that are identical to those worn by NBA players, coaches and managers during 
competition. The company's NFL Pro-Line and NBA Authentics products 
<PAGE> 

prominently feature the Logo  Athletic name and trademark, which the company 
believes are key elements in developing the Logo Athletic brand. Under the 
Logo 7 brand, the company offers moderately-priced outerwear, fleecewear, 
T-shirts and caps with licensed designs and logos. The company also sells 
popularly-priced licensed fleecewear, jersey apparel and headwear.

Customers; Marketing and Sales

Customers

The company offers a diverse product line for sale at a full range of price 
points through all major distribution channels. The company has no customer 
that constituted 10% of net sales in 1995.  The company's top four customers 
together accounted for approximately 27% of sales. 

Marketing and Sales

The company has shifted its marketing strategy in recent years to focus on the 
development of its own brands and sales through distribution channels that 
support higher margins. In particular, the company has devoted significant 
resources to the promotion of its Discus Athletic and Logo Athletic brands.
In 1993, the company began conducting advertising campaigns to promote its 
Discus Athletic and Logo  Athletic brands. The Discus Athletic advertising 
campaign emphasizes quality and the usefulness of the product for many sports. 
The company believes that this positioning effectively differentiates the 
Discus Athletic line from competing specialized lines with powerful brand 
associations. The Logo Athletic campaign focuses on establishing the 
"authenticity" of Logo Athletic products. The company believes that licensed 
apparel sales benefit substantially from the perception that products are the 
same as those worn by professional sports stars.  

Advertising expenditures were $17.1 million and $17.7 million in 1994 and 1995, 
respectively, of which $14.7 million and $22.7 million, respectively, were 
expensed in those years. In fiscal 1995, the company adopted the provisions of 
the Accounting Standards Executive Committee's Statement of Position on 
Reporting Advertising Costs ("Statement").  The Statement required that 
certain advertising costs which were previously deferred and amortized over 
an anticipated benefit period be recognized currently in the statement of 
income.  Advertising expenses reported as part of selling, general and 
administrative expenses on the statement of income increased by approximately 
$5.0 million in 1995 as a result of adopting this change in accounting method.

New product introductions are important to the company's licensed apparel 
business and are undertaken to generate consumer excitement and demand. 
Logo 7's creative design team, in cooperation with key customers and licensors, 
continually develops and introduces new products and styles. The company is 
able to react quickly to changing team fortunes, designing new products to 
capitalize on shifts in popularity and delivering those products to the market 










<PAGE> 

rapidly, sometimes in a matter of hours. During major professional and 
collegiate sporting events, such as the Super Bowl, the company produces 
on-site decorated products with championship logos of the winning teams for 
immediate distribution and sale at the event.

The company's marketing methods for other products are typical of producers of 
basic clothing products. Its merchandising department keeps abreast of current 
fashionable styles and colors. After internal reviews by manufacturing 
departments, selected customers preview and comment upon prototype garments 
before the merchandising department determines those to be presented in sales 
catalogs. Production is planned on orders received and anticipated customer 
orders for these garments.

As of December 30, 1995, Tultex operated a sales office in each of New York, 
Boston, Chicago and Atlanta and a Discus Athletic showroom in New York City. 
These offices are the primary points of contact for customers and coordinate 
sales, distribution of sales information, certain advertising, point-of-sale 
displays and customer service. The company also employs eight independent 
sales representatives to market its Discus Athletic line in the fragmented 
sporting goods market. Logo 7's products are marketed through a sales force 
of 50, including Logo 7 employees and independent sales representatives. In 
1992, the company entered into an agreement with Nissan Trading Co., Ltd., 
a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co., to market and sell the company's Discus 
Athletic products in Japan. International sales in 1994 and 1995 were less 
than 10%.

In November 1995, the company and four other investors completed the formation 
of Wide Open Performance Wear, Inc.  The company has minority ownership in 
this joint venture which markets garments screenprinted with NASCAR graphics.

At December 30, 1995, Dominion Stores, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
operated 13 outlet stores in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, which 
sell surplus company apparel and apparel items of other manufacturers, and 
operated 29 The Sweatshirt Company retail stores in 18 states, which primarily 
sell first-quality company-made products and accessories. Dominion Stores' 
total sales in fiscal 1995 were $16.0 million.

Licenses

Most of the company's licensed products are sold through Logo 7. The company 
is a licensee of professional sports apparel, maintaining a full complement of 
licenses with all of the major North American professional sports leagues 
- -- the NFL, MLB, the NBA and the NHL -- and the Collegiate Licensing Company. 
The company also holds licenses for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and 
NASCAR.  These licenses require the payment of royalties generally ranging 
from 9% to 16% of sales with guaranteed royalties of approximately $6 million 
in fiscal 1996. The company's major licenses with the NFL, NBA and NHL expire 
in 1997 and the MLB license expires in 1996. The company is licensed to 
manufacture and market adult fleecewear under the Britannia(registered 
trademark) trademark owned by Levi Strauss & Co.

The company's ability to compete is dependent on its ability to obtain and 
renew licenses, particularly those from the major professional sports leagues. 
The company enjoys long-standing relationships with its major league licensees, 
having been awarded its first licenses with the NFL in 1971, with the NBA in 
1977, with MLB in 1980 and with the NHL in 1988. The company has no reason to 
believe that it will not be able to successfully renew these licenses. While 
the company has enjoyed long, successful and uninterrupted licensing 
<PAGE> 

relationships with its professional and collegiate athletic licensors, if a 
significant license or licenses were not renewed or replaced, the company's 
sales would likely be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the 
company's material licenses are non-exclusive and new or existing competitors 
may obtain similar licenses.

Manufacturing

The company's manufacturing process consists of yarn production; fabric 
construction including knitting, dyeing and finishing operations; apparel 
manufacturing including cutting and sewing operations; and, for garments with 
logos, screenprint and embroidery operations. As a result of its modernization 
efforts, the company believes that its manufacturing facilities are outfitted 
with some of the most efficient and technologically-advanced equipment in the 
industry.

During fiscal 1988 through fiscal 1995, the company invested approximately 
$208 million to open new facilities, including sewing facilities in Roanoke, 
Virginia and Montego Bay, Jamaica (a leased facility), and the highly 
automated customer service center in Martinsville, Virginia, and to modernize 
other facilities. Open-end spinning frames were acquired to increase yarn 
production and reduce costs, higher color quality and lower dyeing costs were 
achieved from the installation of new jet dyeing equipment, new dryers were 
added in the fabric finishing process, automated cutting machines were 
introduced, and new information systems were implemented.

Tultex's highly-automated customer service center, opened in 1991, has greatly 
expanded the company's distribution capabilities. The customer service center 
allows the company to package and ship its products according to the more 
detailed color, size and quantity specifications typically required by 
high-margin retailers and department stores and has permitted consolidation of 
the company's warehouses. 

In spring 1992, Logo 7 moved its operations to a newly-constructed, leased 
facility built to Logo 7's specifications. This 650,000 square foot building 
allowed Logo 7 to centralize operations, increase inventory control, improve 
material flow and will allow for future expansion. 

Tultex manufactures yarn at three facilities located in North Carolina, which 
have a combined production capacity of 1.3 million pounds per week, utilizing 
modern, open-end spinning frames. For its knitting operations, Tultex operates 
approximately 500 modern high-speed, latch-needle circular knitting machines, 
which produce various types of fabrics. The company believes its dyeing 
operations are among the most modern and technologically efficient in the 
industry; dyeing operations are computer-controlled, allowing precise 
duplication of dyeing procedures to ensure "shade repeatability" and 
color-fast properties. The finishing operations employ mechanical squeezing 
and steaming equipment.

The Martinsville cutting facility uses advanced Bierrebi automatic continuous 
cutting machines with computer-controlled hydraulic die-cutting heads and 
"lay-up" machines and high-speed reciprocating knives. Sewing production at 
the company's eight sewing facilities is organized on an assembly-line basis.





<PAGE> 

The company decorates its unfinished licensed apparel products using 
screenprinting or embroidery at Logo 7's facilities in Indianapolis and 
Universal's facilities in Massachusetts. Automatic silk-screen machines and 
dryers are used for longer runs, and hand-operated presses are used for 
shorter or more complicated runs. Embroidery is applied using high-speed, 
computerized stitching equipment.

In September 1995, the company entered into a five-year production agreement
with Overseas Manufacturing Systems of America, Inc. ("OMSA"), a Mexican joint
venture, to produce jersey products. The company provided three spinning 
machines to OMSA for use in its yarn making operations and OMSA agreed to
manufacture up to 24,000 dozens of jersey product per year for delivery to the
company or its U.S. based customers.

The company's order backlog at December 31, 1994 was approximately $143 
million and at December 30, 1995 was approximately $184 million. Backlogs are 
computed from orders on hand at the last day of each fiscal period. The 
company believes that due to the seasonality of the company's business and the 
just-in-time nature of much of the company's sales, order backlogs are not a 
reliable indicator of future sales volume.

Raw Materials

The company's principal raw materials for the production of activewear are 
cotton and polyester. Cotton content in fleecewear typically is 50% and in 
jersey apparel typically is 100%. The company is producing increasing amounts 
of fleecewear containing 90-100% cotton. Fleecewear and jersey manufacturers 
are extremely sensitive to fluctuations in cotton and polyester prices as 
these materials represent approximately 30% of the manufacturing cost of the 
product. In addition, the company is indirectly impacted by increasing costs 
of raw materials in its licensed apparel business because the company 
purchases finished goods containing cotton and polyester and these higher raw 
materials costs often are effectively passed on to the company. Cotton prices 
increased significantly in 1995 over 1994 levels. In 1995, the company's 
average price per pound of cotton was $0.85, compared with $0.72 in 1994, 
while the average price per pound of polyester was $0.80 in 1995, compared 
with $0.64 in 1994. The company expects the average price paid for fiber in 
1996 to be relatively unchanged from the average price for the prior year 
As of March 12, 1996, the company has fixed the price on approximately 50% of  
its planned cotton purchases for fiscal 1996. To the extent cotton prices 
increase before the company fixes the price for the remainder of its raw cotton 
needs, the company's results of operations could be adversely affected.

Trademarks

The company increasingly promotes and relies upon its trademarks, including 
Discus Athletic, Logo  Athletic, Tultex, and Logo 7, which are registered in 
the United States and many foreign countries.

Seasonality

The company's business is seasonal. The majority of fleecewear sales and 
related net income occur in the third and fourth quarters, coinciding with 
cooler weather and the playing seasons of popular professional and college 
sports. Jersey sales peak in the second and third quarters of the year, 
somewhat offsetting the seasonality of fleecewear sales.


<PAGE> 

Environmental Matters

The company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws 
and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge, storage, 
handling and disposal of a variety of substances and wastes used in or 
resulting from its operations, including, but not limited to, the Water 
Pollution Control Act, as amended; the Clean Air Act, as amended; the Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended; the Toxic Substances Control Act, 
as amended; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980, as amended.

The company returns dyeing wastes for treatment to the City of Martinsville, 
Virginia's municipal wastewater treatment systems operated pursuant to a 
permit issued by the state. The city has filed a timely application to renew 
its permit. In 1989, the city adopted a plan for removing the coloration, 
caused by the dye wastes, from the water by using polymer chemicals to combine 
with the extremely small particles of the dye to create a sludge-like 
substance that can be retrieved from the water at the city's wastewater 
treatment plant and disposed of as a non-hazardous waste in the city's 
landfill. To cover the cost to the city, the company pays 50 to 80 cents per 
thousand gallons of water above regular water costs. The expenditures required 
do not have a material effect on the company's earnings or competitive 
position.

The company's operations also are governed by laws and regulations relating to 
employee safety and health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act 
and regulations thereunder, which, among other  things, establish exposure 
limitations for cotton dust, formaldehyde, asbestos and noise, and regulate 
chemical and ergonomic hazards in the workplace.

The company believes that it is in material compliance with the aforementioned 
laws and regulations and does not expect that future compliance and actions 
responding  to routine inspections will have a material adverse effect on its 
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable 
future. However, there can be no assurances that environmental and other legal 
requirements will not become more stringent in the future or that the company 
will not incur significant costs in the future to comply with such requirements.

Employees

The company had approximately 6,835 employees at December 30, 1995, of which 
5,990 or 88% were paid hourly.

In August 1994, hourly employees at the company's Martinsville, Virginia 
facilities voted for representation by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile 
Workers Union (now known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile 
Employees or UNITE). The company accepted a three-year labor contract with the 
union which covers all hourly employees at the Martinsville facilities. It was 
ratified by an employee vote in March 1995. The contract covers approximately 
2,100 hourly employees in the Martinsville area.  In May 1995, hourly 
employees at the company's South Boston, Virginia sewing facility voted for 
representation by UNITE.  A three-year contract was ratified by an employee 
vote in August 1995.  The contract covers approximately 550 employees in the 
South Boston area.  Employees represented by UNITE accounted for approximately 
39% of the company's total employees and approximately 44% of the company's 
hourly employees.  None of the company's other employees are represented by a 
union.

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS

Net income for the year ended December 30, 1995, was $8.6 million before
a $6.8 million after-tax charge related to the company's debt
refinancing and a required change in the method of accounting for
advertising costs. Results for fiscal 1994 were $6.2 million before a
one-time, after-tax gain on the sale of a facility. As reported, net
income was $1.8 million compared with $8.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1994. Sales for the year just ended were $585.3 million
compared with $565.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1994.

Our overall operating performance during 1995 compares favorably with
the prior year in spite of the challenges faced by the apparel industry.
Historically high raw material costs, labor problems in professional
sports and weak consumer spending on apparel in the fall affected the
entire apparel chain from manufacturer to retailer.

Our company showed significant improvement in operating performance as
illustrated in the table below. Activewear's operating margin
improvements more than offset the decrease in our licensed business so
that overall EBIT increased 38%. The information presented below
reflects EBIT (earnings before interest, taxes and extraordinary item)
and operating margin as though advertising was expensed in 1993 and 1994
using the accounting method adopted in first quarter 1995.

<PAGE>

We believe that the fundamentals of our business are good as we look to
the future. Demand for our product is increasing and raw material
prices, which have been at historical highs, are beginning to decline.
We continue to be successful in moving our business toward higher-margin
branded and private label sales. This is evident in our strong gains
with the company's Discus AthleticRegistration Mark and Logo
AthleticRegistration Mark brands. Our commitment to these brands
resulted in a 37% increase in branded sales for the year and helped us
move our margins up. Spring training is underway after an exciting
Playoff and World Series in baseball. Magic and Michael are back in the
NBA. Our spokesman Troy Aikman was the winning Super Bowl quarterback.
And, 1996 is an Olympic year.

ACTIVEWEAR

Led by Discus Athletic, as well as increases in our private label and
wholesale business, activewear sales grew 13% last year, and operating
profits for this business segment increased by 75%. In 1995, 44% of our
activewear dozens were sewn outside the United States, helping us to
lower cos ts while still providing good service to our customers. In
1996, we expect approximately 55% of our dozens to be sewn outside the
U.S. Some of our competitors are reducing capacity, particularly in
fleece, and we are continuing to take market share. As we began 1996,
our backlog was up 29% over the previous year.

Our customer relationships are excellent with the right customers. We're
partnered with the best in the business. In November, Tultex received
the Sears Platinum Circle Award, given to an elite set of partners with
whom Sears plans to grow its business. For the third consecutive year,
Tultex was the recipient of the Vendor of Excellence Award from the
Women's Department of Target stores. The Target Men's Department also
awarded Tultex the Vendor of Excellence Award for 1995. This is our
first year in supplying this program and the first award given by that
department in the last three years. We believe Sears and Target, among
others of our customers, have success formulas which will generate
continued growth for them, and for us.

THE RIGHT CUSTOMERS. WE'RE PARTNERED WITH THE

LICENSED PRODUCTS

Our licensed business, continuing to feel the effects from 1994's
professional player strikes and lockouts, struggled for three quarters
of 1995. But a strong year-end finish and higher order backlogs
indicate that licensed products is experiencing a strong recovery. The
Logo Athletic brand has gained in popularity and has taken market share.
Super Bowl Quarterback Troy Aikman continues as our primary spokesman
for the Logo Athletic brand and his association with the brand has been
instrumental in increasing its revenues from $0 in 1992 to $92 million
in 1995. We expect Logo Athletic sales to continue to grow in 1996. With
the success of our Logo Athletic brand and the prospect of full seasons
in all major sports and the Olympics, 1996 looks like a promising year
in licensed products-the best in several years. The Operating Margin
table shows the historic dynamics of our two businesses, Activewear and
Licensed Products. You can see what the positive impact of a turnaround
in licensed products would be.

As we discussed in the 1994 annual report, we completed a refinancing of
our company's debt in March 1995. We believe the longer maturities and
increased covenant flexibility provided by this refinancing give us the
stable financial platform needed to continue    investing in our brands
and to take advantage of new business opportunities as they arise.

Shareholders of record as of March 8, 1996 will be voting on a new
Consolidated Incentive Compensation Plan, which replaces all other
salaried incentive plans. It is designed so that no incentive
compensation is earned by any member of management unless there is an
improvement in our company's return on assets. Our Board strongly
believes this plan is designed such that it enhances share value.

In 1995, we improved our business in a difficult industry and rugged
retail environment. In 1996, we expect to improve much more. Most of our
own personal net worth is invested in Tultex stock. We continue to be
buyers of the stock. Our money is where your money is, and we continue
to put more of it there, because we believe strongly in the company's
long-term future and the prospects for a good year in 1996.

Sincerely,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                Tultex Corporation



Fiscal years ended December 30, 1995, December 31, 1994 and
January 1, 1994.

NOTE 1-ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Tultex Corporation is a marketer and vertically integrated manufacturer
of activewear and licensed sports apparel which is considered a single
business segment.The company's product line includes fleeced
sweats, jersey products and decorated jackets and caps.The significant 
accounting policies followed by Tultex Corporation and its subsidiaries in 
preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Basis of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Equivalents:The company considers cash on hand, deposits
in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities as
cash and equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
Such cash equivalents have maturities of less than 90 days.

Inventories: Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. See Note 2
for information concerning the change in the method of valuing
inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the FIFO method
during 1993.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Land, buildings and equipment are
carried at cost. Major renewals and betterments are charged to the
property accounts while replacements, maintenance and repairs which
do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are
expensed currently. Interest is capitalized on major capital expenditures
during the period of construction.There was no interest capitalized in
the three years ended December 30, 1995. Depreciation is provided on
the straight-line method for all depreciable assets over their estimated
useful lives as follows:

Classification                           Estimated Useful Lives

Land improvements                        20 years
Buildings and improvements               12-50 years
Machinery and equipment                  3-20 years








				     11



<PAGE>
Intangible Assets: Goodwill and licenses are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 25 years.The company continually evaluates
the existence of goodwill impairment on the basis of whether the
goodwill is fully recoverable from projected, undiscounted net cash
flows of the related asset.The gross amount of goodwill was $3,909,000 at 
December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994. Accumulated amortization of goodwill 
was $625,000 and $469,000 at December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994, 
respectively.The gross amount of licenses was $26,507,000 at December 30, 1995 
and December 31, 1994. Accumulated amortization of licenses was $4,241,000 and
$3,181,000 at December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively.

Pensions: Pension expense includes charges for amounts not less than the 
actuarially determined current service costs plus amortization of prior service 
costs over 30 years.The company funds amounts accrued for pension expense not 
in excess of the amount deductible for federal income tax purposes.

Revenue Recognition:The company recognizes the sale when the
goods are shipped or ownership is assumed by the customer.

Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided based upon income reported
for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effect of temporary differences between financial and taxable income.

Net Income per Common Share: Net income per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period after giving retroactive effect to stock
splits and stock dividends and after deducting the preferred dividend
requirements which accrued during the period.The weighted average
number of common shares outstanding were 29,810,000, 29,685,000
and 28,961,000 for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Fully
diluted net income per common share is not materially different from
primary net income per common share for fiscal 1995, 1994 and 1993.

Fiscal Year:The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
December 31, which periodically results in a fiscal year of 53 weeks.

Other Postretirement Benefits: As further described in Note 9, the
company changed its method of accounting for the costs of certain life
insurance and medical benefits for eligible retirees and dependents in
1993.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instru-
ments," requires disclosure about the fair value of certain instruments.
Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
variable rate debt are reflected in the financial instruments at fair value
because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.The estimated
fair value of the company's fixed rate debt is disclosed in Note 5.

Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements:The prepara-
tion of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Tultex Corporation


New Accounting Standard: In October 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"  (SFAS 123), which 
established a fair value-based method of accounting and requires certain 
disclosures related to stock-based compensation plans. SFAS 123, which is 
effective in fiscal 1996, will require the company to determine whether it 
will adopt the fair value-based method of accounting or provide certain 
required pro forma disclosures in the notes to financial statements. Management 
does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on the 
company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2-INVENTORIES

The components of inventories are as follows:

(In thousands                   DEC. 30,         Dec. 31,        Jan. 1,
 of dollars)                     1995              1994            1994

Raw materials                   $ 20,803        $  25,704       $  29,291
Goods in process                  17,645           13,453          11,956
Finished goods                   113,290           87,436         112,296
Supplies                           6,208            3,590           3,735

Total inventories               $157,946         $130,183        $157,278

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the company changed its method of
determining the cost of inventories from the LIFO method to the FIFO
method. Under the current economic environment of low inflation, the
company believes that the FIFO method will result in a better measure-
ment of operating results.This change has been applied by retroac-
tively restating the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
This change in method did not materially impact net income for 1993.
The balance of retained earnings for the year ended January 2, 1993
has been adjusted for the effect (net of income taxes) of applying
retroactively the new method of valuing inventories.

NOTE 3-PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment, at cost, consist of the following:

The company utilizes letters of credit for foreign sourcing of inventory.
Trade letters of credit outstanding were $3,648,000, $2,026,000 and
$9,715,000 at December 30, 1995, December 31, 1994 and January 1,

In March 1995, the company sold $110 million of 10 5/8% senior notes
due March 15, 2005. Net proceeds from the sale, together with
borrowings under the revolving credit facility, were used to pay
principal, accrued interest and prepayment expenses related to the
$95,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8% senior notes due
June 1, 1999 and the $15,997,000 aggregate principal amount term
loan due July 31, 1996. In connection with the repayment of the 8 7/8%
senior notes and the term loan, the company was required to write off
unamortized debt issuance costs and incurred a prepayment penalty.
The resultant one-time, after-tax charge amounted to $3,746,000 or 13
cents per share.

Concurrent with the sale of the 10 5/8% senior notes, the company
entered into a three-year $225,000,000 revolving credit facility which
replaced its existing two-year facility due to expire on October 5, 1995.
The terms of the new agreement are substantially equivalent to those in
the former facility and provide for borrowings at or below prime.

Tultex Corporation

NOTE 5 (Continued)

All subsidiaries of the company full and unconditionally guarantee the
company's obligations under the 10 5/8% senior notes on a joint and
several basis.

The senior notes and revolving credit facility contain provisions regarding 
maintenance of net worth, indebtedness levels and restrictions on the payment 
of cash dividends. At December 30, 1995, the company was in compliance with all 
debt covenants. Consolidated retained earnings, which were free of dividend 
restrictions, amounted to $5,080,000 at December 30, 1995.

Interest paid by the company in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $22,412,000,
$18,598,000 and $16,830,000, respectively.The weighted average interest rates 
on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 30, 1995 and 
December 31, 1994 were 7.6% and 5.2%, respectively.

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five
fiscal years are as follows:

(In thousands of dollars)                     Total

1996                                       $       145
1997                                                24
1998                                           117,509*
1999                                                 7
2000                                                 -

*Includes maturity of $117,500,000 outstanding under revolving credit
facility.

At December 30, 1995 the fair value of the 10 5/8% Senior notes
exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $2,100,000. Such fair
value was determined using valuation techniques that considered cash
flows discounted at current market rates in effect at the end of the year.

NOTE 6-DIVIDENDS

At December 30, 1995, dividends payable represented amounts paid on the 
company's 5% cumulative preferred stock on January 2, 1996. All stated 
dividends on the Series B cumulative preferred stock had been declared and 
paid prior to December 30, 1995.

During the second quarter of 1994, the company suspended the
payment of dividends on its common stock. As of December 30, 1995,
common stock dividends had not been reinstated.

NOTE 7-STOCK OPTIONS

In 1988, the company's stockholders ratified the 1987 Stock Option Plan
under which 700,000 shares of common stock were reserved for stock
option grants to certain officers and employees.The plan provided that
options may be granted at prices not less than the fair market value on
the date the option is granted, which means the closing price of a share

				      15
<PAGE>

of common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
composite tape on such day. Some options remain unexercised from the
1987 Stock Option Plan, which expired November 19, 1992.

On March 21, 1991, the company's stockholders ratified the 1990 Stock
Option Plan under which 700,000 shares of common stock were
reserved for stock option grants to certain officers and employees.
Options granted under the 1990 Plan may be incentive stock options
("ISOs") or nonqualified stoc  k options.The option price will be fixed by
the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board at the time the
option is granted, but in the case of an ISO, the price cannot be less
than the share's fair market value on the date of grant. Grants must be
made before October 18, 2000 and generally expire within 10 years of
the date of grant. In exercising options, an employee may receive a loan
from the company for up to 90% of the exercise price. Outstanding loans
are shown as a reduction of stockholders' equity on the balance sheet.
On May 19, 1994, the stockholders approved an increase of 500,000
shares in the maximum number of shares to be issued pursuant to the
exercise of options granted under the Plan, extended the date that
grants could be made to October 27, 2003, and provided that no
participant may be granted options in any calendar year for more than
50,000 shares of common stock.

A summary of the changes in the number of common shares under
option for each of the three previous years follows:

Year  Ended                         Number       Per Share

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rates with the company's 
effective income tax rates for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was as follows:
						   
                                          						   DEC. 30,    Dec. 31   Jan. 1,

Effective income tax rate ....................     38%          38%      35

Income tax payments were $4,895,000, $4,659,000 and $4,512,000 for fiscal 1995, 
1994 and 1993, respectively.

The company recently underwent an examination by the Internal Revenue Service 
for the years ended 1991, 1992 and 1993. The outcome of this examination did 
not materially impact the company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 9-EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
All qualified employees of the parent company and its Universal subsidiary are 
covered by a noncontributory, defined benefit plan. The benefits are based on 
years of service and the employee's highest five consecutive calendar years of 
compensation paid during the 10 most recent years before retirement. Prior 
service costs are amortized over 30 years.The status of the defined benefit 
plan as of December 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994 was as follows:

(In thousands of dollars)                    1995          1994

   and $26,733, respectively                    34,320        27,393
Additional benefits based on
   estimated future salary levels                4,512         6,002

Projected benefit obligation                    38,832        33,395

Plan assets in excess of projected
   benefit obligation                           (3,201)        1,199
Unrecognized net (gain) loss                     2,025        (1,273)
Unrecognized net transitional assets            (1,369)       (1,838)
Unrecognized prior service cost                    502           145

Accrued pension liability                    $  (2,043)    $  (1,767)
     
      The following rate assumptions were made for the plan:

                            				 1995      1994
Discount rate of return on
   projected benefit obligation  7.75%      8.5%
Rate of return on plan assets    10.0%     10.0%

The long-term rate of salary progression for 1995 reflected an increase of 3.5% 
for the first two years, followed by 4% for six years with an ultimate rate of 
increase of 5% thereafter.The long-term rate for 1994 reflected no anticipated 
rate increase for the first year, followed by 3.5% for two years, 4% for six 
years and 5% thereafter.
				      
Pension expense in 1995, 1994 and 1993 included the following components:

(In thousands of dollars)                        1995        1994      1993

Service cost-benefits earned
    during the period                            $  1,285    $ 1,707   $  1,861

Actual (gain) loss on plan assets                  (4,542)     4,587     (2,362)
Net deferral                                          719     (9,000)    (1,919)

Net periodic pension cost                        $    276    $   102    $   473

The company's policy has been to fund the minimum required contribution after 
the end of the fiscal year plus interest on the contribution from the end of 
the plan year until paid.The company's Universal Industries subsidiary 
historically funded the maximum required contribution during the year.

The company has a nonqualified, unfunded supplementary retirement
plan for which it has purchased cost recovery life insurance on the lives
of the participants.The company is the sole owner and beneficiary of
such policies.The amount of coverage is designed to provide sufficient
revenues to recover all costs of the plan if assumptions made as to
mortality experience, policy earnings and other factors are realized.
Expenses related to the plan were $577,000 in 1995, $536,000 in 1994
and $547,000 in 1993.The actuarially determined liability which has
been included in other deferrals was $3,434,000 at December 30, 1995,
$3,506,000 at December 31, 1994 and $3,190,000 at January 1, 1994.

The following table sets forth the plan's status and amounts recognized
in the company's financial statements at December 30, 1995 and
December 31, 1994:

Net periodic supplementary
   pension cost               $577    $536    $547

Substantially all employees meeting certain service requirements are
eligible to participate in the company's employee savings (401-k) plan.
Employee contributions are limited to a percentage of their compensa-
tion, as defined in the plan.The plan does not provide for any company
contributions.

Substantially all employees are eligible to receive bonuses or profit-
sharing distributions, the amounts of which are determined by the labor
contract for employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement
and on a discretionary basis for all other employees. Such expenses
amounted to $2,044,000 in 1995, $1,791,000 in 1994 and $2,329,000 in 1993.

The company also provides certain postretirement medical and life
insurance benefits to substantially all employees who retire with a

				      21

Tultex Corporation

NOTE 9 (Continued)
minimum of 20 years of service for the period of time until the employee and 
any dependents reach age 65.The medical plan requires monthly contributions by 
retired participants which are dependent on the participant's length of service,
age at the date of retirement and Medicare eligibility.The life insurance plan 
is noncontributory. Prior to 1993, the company expensed the costs relating to 
these unfunded plans as incurred.

In 1993, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 
No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.
The standard required companies to recognize the estimated costs of providing 
postretirement benefits on an accrual basis.The company elected the delayed 
recognition method of adoption which allows amortization of the initial transi-
tional obligation over a 20-year period. At January 2, 1993, the actuarially 
determined accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $5,101,000.

The amounts recognized in the company's balance sheet at December 30, 1995 
and December 31, 1994 were as follows:

(In thousands of dollars)                               1995       1994

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation           $ (6,973)  $ (7,066)
Unrecognized transitional obligation                       4,334      4,590
Unrecognized loss                                          1,770      1,847

Accrued liability                                       $   (869)  $   (629)

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1995, 1994  and 1993
included the following components:
(In thousands of dollars)                        1995        1994        1993

Service cost-benefits earned
   during the period                             $   207     $  198      $  171
Interest on accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation                 564        398         402
Amortization of accumulated
   postretirement benefit obligation                 256        256         256
Amortization of loss                                  63         -           -

Total periodic postretirement
   benefit cost                                  $ 1,090     $  852      $  829

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7.75% for 1995, 8.5% for 1994 and 8% for 1993.The assumed
medical cost trend rate was 11% in 1994, declining by 1% per year until an
ultimate rate of 5.5% is achieved. For 1995, the rate used was 10%, still
declining by 1% per year until reaching an ultimate goal of 5.5%.The effect of a
1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year
would have increased the aggregate of 1995 service cost and interest cost by
$69,000, and would have increased the December 30, 1995 accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $456,000.

The adoption of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits"  in 1994 had no material impact on the company's results of operations
or financial position, as the company does not have significant post-employ-
ment benefits.

entertainment industries. Under the terms of these agreements, the company is 
required to pay minimum guaranteed fees to certain licensors.The remaining 
minimum obligations under these agreements at December 30, 1995 were 
approximately $5,800,000 in fiscal 1996 and $8,000,000 in fiscal 1997.

tives of amounts up to three times their annual compensation plus
continuation of certain benefits if there is a change in control in the
company (as defined) and a termination of their employment.The

ments was approximately $4,496,000. Under predefined events of
termination the company could incur a maximum liability of $1,123,000.

NOTE 13-CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

number of primarily domestic customers who are geographically
dispersed.The company has no customer that constituted 10% of net
sales in 1995.There was one customer that constituted 10.4% of net
sales in 1994 and no such customer in 1993. As disclosed on the

NOTE 14- SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In March 1990, the Board of Directors of the company adopted a
Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one right for each
outstanding share of common stock to shareholders of record on April
2, 1990. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
company, until the earlier of March 22, 2000 or the redemption of the
rights, one one-thousandth of a share of newly authorized Junior
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, without par value, at
an exercise price of $40.The rights are not exercisable or transferable
apart from the common stock until the earlier of (i) 10 days following the
public announcement that a person or a group of affiliated persons has
acquired or obtained the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or
more of the company's outstanding common stock or (ii) 10 business
days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
that would result in a person or group owning 10% or more of the
company's outstanding common stock.The company may redeem the
rights at a price of $.01 per right at any time prior to the acquisition of
10% or more of the company's outstanding common stock or certain
other triggering events.

NOTE 15-STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In February 1994, the company initiated the Salaried Employees' Stock
Purchase Plan. Under the plan, employees could elect to purchase
shares of the company's common stock in amounts ranging from 20-
30% of their annual salary. Employees will pay for the stock through
payroll deductions over a 60-month period. Interest at 6% per annum
will be charged until the stock is fully paid and the shares will be held by
the company until that time. Under the plan, 753,667 shares were
issued at a price of $5.50. Of the $4,144,000 loans recorded for the
shares, $2,777,000 has been collected, leaving an outstanding balance
at December 30, 1995 of $1,367,000. Interest income realized in 1995
and 1994 on the loans was $138,000 and $188,000, respectively. In
January 1995, the directors of the company approved an amendment to
the plan that allows an employee options for early payment of the loan.

NOTE 16-ADVERTISING COSTS
In fiscal 1995, the company adopted the provisions of the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee's Statement of Position on Reporting
Advertising Costs ("Statement").  The Statement required that certain
advertising costs which were previously deferred and amortized over an
anticipated benefit period be recognized currently in the statement of
income. Advertising expense charged to income was $22,706,000 in
1995, $14,669,000 in 1994 and $9,934,000 in 1993. Selling, general
and administrative expenses reported on the statement of income
increased by approximately $5,000,000 in 1995 as a result of adopting
this change in accounting method.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS             


To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Tultex Corporation





     In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet and related
consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of changes in stockholders'
equity  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of
Tultex  Corporation and its subsidiaries  (the company) at December 30, 1995 and
December 31, 1994, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 30,  1995,  in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our  audits.We  conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards  which  require  that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reason-
able  assurance  about  whether the  financial  statements  are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and  significant  estimates made by  management,  and evaluating the
overall financial  statement  presentation.We  believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
     
In 1993, the company changed its method of valuing inventory and accounting
for postretirement  medical and life insurance benefits, as discussed in Notes 2
and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements,  respectively. In addition, in 1995, the
company changed its method of recording  advertising costs, as discussed in Note
16 of Notes to Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF                      Tultex Corporation
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The company changed its method of determining cost of inventories
from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first-out (FIFO)

Fiscal Year 1995 Compared to Fiscal Year 1994

Net Sales and Other Income for the year ended December 30, 1995
increased $19.9 million, or 3.5%, over the prior year level of $565.4
million.The increase was attributable primarily to increased sales
volume in the activewear line.This increase was partially offset by
decreases in licensed apparel and licensed headwear sales due to the
National Hockey League lockout, Major League Baseball strike and
retailer reluctance to buy National Basketball Association apparel until a
labor agreement was reached in September. Activewear sales in fiscal
1995 increased $43.4 million or 12.6% over fiscal 1994 from $344.4
million to $387.8 million. Licensed apparel sales decreased $17.2
million or 11.3% to $135.4 million as compared to fiscal 1994, while
licensed headwear sales decreased $6.4 million or 9.4% to $62.0
million. Sales of Discus Athletic(R) activewear increased 29.9% to $75.8
million, and sales of Logo Athletic(R) licensed apparel increased 42.8% to
$92.0 million. Sales of jersey products were $93.1 million for the fiscal
year ended December 30, 1995, representing 24.0% of the company's
activewear sales during such period compared to 16.5% for fiscal 1994.
Cost of Products Sold as a percentage of sales improved in fiscal 1995,
decreasing from 74.2% in fiscal 1994 to 73.8%.This reduction resulted
primarily from manufacturing efficiencies realized from increased
production schedules and higher average selling prices. Costs were
reduced in spite of growth in jersey volume, which typically produces
lower margins, and increased raw material costs. Raw material costs
were higher in 1995 than in 1994 as a result of the increased price of
both raw cotton and polyester fiber. Cotton prices fluctuate based on the
relationship between supply and demand, with prices increasing as
demand increases and/or supply decreases.The company expects its
cotton prices for 1996 to be relatively unchanged from 1995. As of March
12, 1996, the company has fixed the price on approximately 50% of its
planned cotton purchases for fiscal 1996.

Depreciation expense as a percentage of sales was 4.0% for fiscal 1995
and 4.2% for fiscal 1994. Depreciation expense in 1995 was $23.2
million, which was $0.8 million or 3.4% lower than fiscal 1994 levels due
to relatively low capital expenditures.

Selling, General and Administrative ("S,G&A") e xpenses increased $5.7
million in 1995. As a percentage of net sales, S,G&A expenses were
16.9% in 1995 and 16.5% in 1994. Higher S,G&A expenses in 1995
resulted from higher advertising expenses and increases in the
company's provision for bad debts. Included in the company's 1995
advertising expenses were $5.0 million in deferred advertising costs
which were charged off as required by the Accounting Standards
Executive Committee's Statement of Position on Reporting Advertising
Costs.This statement first became effective for the company at the
beginning of fiscal 1995.The decision to increase the bad debt provision
was made in response to difficulties currently facing customers in the
retail and wholesale business sectors.

Operating income (income before interest, income taxes and gain on
sale of facility) increased 9.6% during the 1995 fiscal year to $30.9
million compared to $28.2 million for fiscal 1994.This increase was due
to the improved performance of the company's activewear business.

Interest expense as a percentage of sales increased from 3.2% of sales
in fiscal 1994 to 3.8% of sales in fiscal 1995. Interest expense increased
$3.8 million or 20.9% in 1995 over 1994, from $18.2 million to $22.0
million primarily as a result of higher average rates partially offset by
lower average borrowing requirements.The nature of the company's
business requires extensive seasonal borrowings to support its working
capital needs. During fiscal 1994, revolving credit facility borrowings
averaged $155.3 million at an average rate of 5.2%. During fiscal 1995,
average borrowings under the revolving credit facility were $136.4 at an
average rate of 7.6%.The reduction in average borrowings was due to
the company's continuing emphasis on increasing cash management.

Provision for Income Taxes is a function of pretax earnings and the
combined effective rate of federal and state income taxes.The effective
rate for combined federal and state income taxes was 38% in 1995 and
1994.The provision for income taxes decreased $2.1 million in 1995 as
a result of lower pretax earnings. As a percentage of net sales, it
decreased to 0.6% in fiscal 1995 from 1.0% in fiscal 1994.

Fiscal Year 1994 Compared to Fiscal Year 1993
Net Sales and Other Income for fiscal 1994 increased $31.8 million or
6.0% over 1993 from $533.6 million to $565.4 million.The 1994 sales
growth was due to increased sales volume in the activewear and
licensed headwear lines partially offset by a decrease in other licensed
apparel sales. Unit sales volume of activewear apparel increased 12%
from the prior year's level, while the average selling price of activewear
decreased approximately 3% from 1993.The 1994 average selling
price decline of activewear products was primarily due to proportion-
ately higher shipping volume of jersey products, which sell at lower
prices than fleece garments.

Cost of Products Sold as a percentage of sales in fiscal 1994 remained
relatively unchanged from 1993, increasing from 74.1% to 74.2%.
Continuing efficiency improvements and overhead reductions during
1994 helped contain total costs. Costs were contained notwithstanding
growth of jersey volume, which typically produces lower margins,
increased raw material costs and product improvements. Utilization of
the company's manufacturing and distribution facilities improved in the
second half of 1994 as a result of the increased demand for activewear.
Raw material costs were higher in 1994 than in 1993 as a result of the
increased price of raw cotton.

Depreciation expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 4.2% of
sales for 1994 from 4.4% for 1993. Depreciation expense increased by
$0.6 million or 2.6% over 1993 from $23.4 million to $24.0 million, due
to fixed asset additions.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses decreased as a percent-
age of sales to 16.5% in 1994 from 16.6% in 1993. S,G&A expenses
increased $5.1 million in 1994.This increase was primarily attributable
to higher advertising costs and sales commissions in activewear lines,
especially relating to the company's Discus Athletic brand, and higher
royalties in the licensed apparel lines.

Interest expense was 3.2% of sales for both 1994 and 1993. Interest
expense increased $1.2 million or 7.1% in 1994 over 1993, from $17.0
million to $18.2 million, primarily as a result of higher average borrow-
ings to finance working capital requirements.

Provision for Income Taxes reflects an effective tax rate for combined
federal and state income taxes of 38% in 1994 and 35% in 1993.The
increase in provision for income taxes was due to higher pretax
earnings and higher effective federal and state income tax rates.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net working capital at December 30, 1995 increased $152.0 million  or
123.7% to $274.8 million from $122.8 million at December 31, 1994.
This increase resulted primarily from the completion of the refinancing
which is described later and which caused the reclassification of $104.0
million of borrowings from current maturities at year-end 1994 to long-
term debt at year-end 1995. Net accounts receivable increased $3.0
million from December 31, 1994 to December 30, 1995.

Inventories traditionally increase during the first half of the year to
support second-half shipments. In 1995, inventories peaked on July 1
1995. As of December 30, 1995, inventories had increased approxi-
mately $27.8 million or 21.3% from December 31, 1994, while sales
had increased 3.5% in fiscal 1995 versus fiscal 1994.The increase in
inventory, particularly fleece product, was due to lower than anticipated
consumer spending at retail during the latter part of fourth quarter.
Additionally, the company increased its jersey inventory supply in order
to meet anticipated first quarter 1996 sales demand.The current ratio
(ratio of current assets to current liabilities) at December 30, 1995 was
7.8 compared to 1.7 at December 31, 1994.The increase in the current
ratio was due mainly to higher current maturities of debt at year-end
1994.

In first quarter 1995, the company signed a three-year $225 million
revolving credit facility which replaced its existing facility due to expire
on October 5, 1995.The credit facility has a three-year term which
expires in April 1998 but which allows for two one-year extensions. In
first quarter 1995, the company also sold $110 million of 10 5/8% senior
notes due March 15, 2005.The senior notes require no principal
payments until 2005 with interest due semi-annually.These notes,
which were priced at par, were used to repay existing indebtedness of
the company. In connection with these transactions, the company
recognized a one-time, after-tax charge of $3,746,000, or 13 cents per
share, representing unamortized debt issuance costs and a prepayment
premium. While this refinancing has resulted in higher interest expense,
the company believes that the longer maturity and increased covenant
flexibility provided under the terms of these agreements will allow the
company to continue its long-term investment in brand promotion and
higher margin products.Total indebtedness at December 30, 1995
consisted primarily of the senior notes totaling $110.0 million and
$117.5 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.The
company's average credit facility borrowings during fiscal 1995 were
$136.4 million and its peak borrowing was $182.6 million at September
5, 1995. As of December 30, 1995, the company was in compliance
with all debt covenants.

In fiscal 1995, net cash provided by operations was $6.9 million
compared to $24.6 million in fiscal 1994. Cash used for capital
expenditures increased $8.7 million in fiscal 1995 from $8.6 million to
$17.3 million.The company has budgeted approximately $16 million for
capital expenditures in fiscal 1996. Cash provided by financing activities
was $7.4 million for fiscal 1995 compared to cash used by financing
activities of $24.1 million as a result of increased borrowing require-
ments.The company expects that its short-term borrowing needs will be
met through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the
revolving credit facility. In addition, the notes will require no scheduled
repayments until their maturity in 2005. Debt as a percentage of
capitalization was 54.6% at December 30, 1995 compared to 53.6% at
December 31, 1994.The company's long-term goal is to reduce debt as
a percentage of total capitalization to 40%.

Stockholder's equity increased $2.0 million during fiscal 1995 primarily
due to net income of $1.8 million and net proceeds from the employee
stock purchase plan of $2.1 million.This increase was partially offset by
cash dividends on the company's preferred stock of $1.9 million.
Substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the senior
note offering, the company paid the current dividend and existing
dividend arrearage on its preferred stock totaling $1.4 million and has
continued paying quarterly dividends thereon.
