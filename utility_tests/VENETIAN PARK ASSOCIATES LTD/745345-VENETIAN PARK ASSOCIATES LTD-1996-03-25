      (ii) reduce the outstanding balances of loans secured by the Partnership
      property, and (iii) thereafter, provide cash distributions to the Limited
      Partners;

2)    Have potential to appreciate in value in excess of the purchase price; and

3)    To the extent possible, the Partners should not realize taxable income 
      with respect to a portion or all of distributions to the Limited Partners
      of cash from operations.  The fundamental objective was to acquire the
      Property for its economic benefits.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations:

Operating income for 1995 substantially declined on a year-to-year basis:
$1,590,577 in 1995 vs. $1,628,405 in 1994, a decrease of $37,828.  Net spendable
last year was ($36,398) vs. $93,150 during 1994, a reduction of $129,548.

The scheduled gross monthly rent roll for December 1995 was $146,469 vs.
$147,741, a decrease of $1,272.  At the same time, vacancy losses for 1995 were
$192,127 vs. $174,255 for 1994, an increase of $17,872.  Operating expenses and
replacements during 1995 were $1,013,049 vs. $944,453 the prior year, an
increase of $68,596.  Replacements were reduced by $1,848 when comparing 1995
and 1994.

                                       6

Results of Operations (continued):


Besides excessively high tenant turnover - which resulted in increased costs for
painting, draperies, cleaning and advertising - other factors contributed to
increased expenses.  Payroll went up due to the following reasons:

(1)   Increases in managers' salaries due to lease renewal bonuses and rental
      commissions.

(2)   Additional personnel were employed in 1995 to speed up the Property's
      rehabilitation program and for cost savings made possible by performing
      much of the work with on-site personnel in lieu of outside contractors.

(3)   Additional leasing personnel were required to deal with the high number of
      vacancies.

Variable expenses increased by $36,043 over the previous year ($166,923 vs.
$130,880) due to high vacancies and apartment preparation costs (advertising
increased by $5,686; credit verification, $5,162; and interior cleaning,
$3,161).  In addition, legal fees went up by $2,889 due to higher eviction costs
and legal research for determining means, if any, of reducing accounting costs
by eliminating SEC requirements for 10-K and 10-Q forms.  Landscaping expenses
also went up by $12,891 due to costs of correcting storm damage (removal and
replacement of trees, flowers and shrubbery) -- also, repairs and additions to
the sprinkler system.

Repairs and maintenance increased by $8,010 over the previous year ($110,398 vs.
$102,388) due in part to on-site exterior painting program and two bridge
replacements.

Replacement expenses in 1995 decreased by $1,848 ($62,772 vs. $64,621).

Cash on hand as of December 31, 1995, was $212,006 of which $84,034 consisted of
tenant refundable security deposits.  At the same time the previous year, cash
on hand was $223,061.  The Property's FHA replacement reserves as of December
31, 1995, stood at $116,065 substantially unchanged from the $113,204 on hand
the year before.

With Stockton's unemployment rate still in excess of 12%, we must continue the
task of bringing in financially qualified tenants from a smaller base.  This
will require the continued use of two leasing consultants, heavy advertising and
ongoing expenditures for completion of the exterior work to say nothing of
anticipated costs in connection with repainting (and in some cases recarpeting
and replacing window coverings and vinyl floors) of vacated apartments.

ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS:

Operating Activities:

The Partnership had a positive cash flow from operating activities of $90,989,
$225,896 and $170,426 for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1995, respectively.


                                       7


<PAGE>

The decrease in positive cash flow from operating was largely attributable to
the soft California rental market, excessively high tenant turnover and work
required by HUD to meet its standards.

Financing Activities:

The principal repayment of long-term debt remain consistent over the three-year
period.  There were no capital distributions to partners in 1995 due to the soft
rental market.  The distributions to partners were $0, $63,095 and $207,215 for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, respectively.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


1.  Organization and significant accounting policies:

       Organization:

          The partnership, organized as a limited partnership within California,
          formed October 31, 1983 to acquire an interest in real property
          located in Stockton, California.  On October 31, 1983 the partnership
          purchased an existing apartment complex with a total of 295 units
          comprised of four separate apartment projects operated under Section
          221(d) (4) of the National Housing Act.  Such projects are regulated
          by HUD as to operating methods.  The partnership is economically
          dependent on the Stockton, California rental market.

          With HUD approval, the financial statements have been prepared on a
          consolidated basis encompassing the following four separate HUD
          projects:

                     PROJECT NAME                   HUD PROJECT NUMBER
               ----------------------------         ------------------
               Venetian Park Apartments I              136-35387-PM
               Venetian Park Apartments II             136-35409-PM
               Venetian Park Apartments III            136-35450-PM
               Venetian Park Apartments IV             136-35518-PM

       Cash:

          The partnership maintains cash balances in excess of the current FDIC
          limit, at First Interstate Bank.

       Fixed assets and depreciation:

          Fixed assets are stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided on the
          straight-line and accelerated methods over estimated useful lives
          which range from 5 to 35 years.  The fixed assets are pledged as
          collateral for the mortgage note payable.  Maintenance, repairs and
          minor renewals are expensed as incurred.

       Amortization:

          Prepaid loan fees are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
          the term of the loans, 33-1/3 years.

       Franchise tax:

          Income or loss of the partnership is allocated 1% to the general
          partners and 99% to the limited partners, which represents their
          respective ownership interests in the partnership.  No income tax
          provision has been included in the financial statements since income
          or loss of the partnership is required to be reported by the
          respective partners on their income tax returns.  The State of
          California imposes a minimum franchise tax per year for limited
          partnerships.


                                                                              15

2.  Restricted cash:

       Tenant security deposits:

          The Federal Housing Administration requires that all tenants' security
          deposits collected be restricted to repayment of extraordinary damages
          caused by the tenants or repayment to the tenants at the end of their
          leases.  These deposits are to be held in separate bank accounts in
          the name of the project.  The balance in these bank accounts at
          December 31, 1995 and 1994 was $84,034 and $83,987, respectively.

       Reserve for replacements:

          The FHA also requires reserve for replacement funds to be maintained
          by the mortgagee for the mortgagor to cover major expenditures of the
          project for replacements.  The payments are included with the mortgage
          payments and amount to $2,098 per month.  The disbursements from this
          fund require the approval of HUD.  The activity was as follows:

       Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).  The outcome of this
       filing is unknown at this time.  At this time the former employee has not
       filed a right to sue letter nor has the DFEH brought a lawsuit.  The
       Company believes the complaint is completely without merit and intends to
       vigorously defend its position.

General Partners.

                  The General Partners are described below:

That firm engaged primarily in real estate brokerage of income-producing 
multifamily residential real estate and served as general partner for a 
number of public and private syndications.   Because Mr. Jacobson's time is 
devoted to property management and syndication activities and serving the 
interests of the investors in the syndications formed by him, his involvement 
with WAGNER/JACOBSON CO., INC., has ceased.  In 1982, Mr. Jacobson, formed 
NORMAN JACOBSON REALTY RESOURCES, INC.  Mr. Jacobson is also President of 
NORMAN JACOBSON MANAGEMENT CO, which acts as property manager for various 
apartment complexes and commercial properties in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano and Contra Costa Counties.

In 1981 Mr. Jacobson co-formed Jacobson/Weill Income Realty Fund, a publicly 
offered real estate fund, which purchased the Chateau Apartments, a 104-unit 
apartment complex located at 1503 Fulton Avenue, Sacramento, California.  In 
1982 Mr. Jacobson and Mr. Ted Weill were co-general partners with Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards Realty in Parkfair Associates, Ltd., a publicly 
offered limited partnership, formed for the purpose of purchasing the

Associates, Ltd. which purchased the 295-unit Venetian Park Apartments in 
Stockton, California.

Mr. Jacobson is also General Partner for Hilltop Associates, Ltd. (formed in 
1983 to purchase the 70-unit Hilltop Apartments), Hillsdale Investors, Ltd. 
(formed in 1984 to purchase the 48-unit Hillsdale Garden Apartments), 
Jefferson Place Investors (formed in 1985 to purchase the 66-unit Jefferson 
Place Apartments) and Cottage Bell Investors (formed in 1985 to purchase the 
160-unit Cottage Bell Apartments).  These properties are all in Sacramento.  
In addition, Mr. Jacobson is General Partner for Muir Creek Investors (formed 
in 1986 to purchase the 108-unit Muir Creek Apartments in Martinez, 
California), and Med Village Investors (formed in 1988 for the purpose of 
constructing the 106-unit Mediterranean Village Apartments in Fairfield, 
California).

Norman Jacobson Realty Resources, Inc., of which Mr. Jacobson is a principal 
and the sole owner, is general partner of Palm Mesa, Ltd. (formed in 1970 to 
purchase the 147-unit Palm Mesa Apartments) and Parkwood Village, Ltd. 
(formed in 1971 to purchase the 276-unit Newport Village Apartments).  Both 
of these properties are in Costa Mesa, California.

In 1977, Mr. Jacobson was president of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors. 
 Formerly he

<PAGE>

was president of the Venice Board of Realtors.  He has been a director 
of the California Association of Realtors (CAR) periodically since 1963 and 
was elected regional vice-president of the CAR in 1978.  In 1971-72 he was 
vice-chairman of the CAR's Syndication Division and was founding editor of 
the Syndication Division's official publication, THE CALIFORNIA SYNDICATOR.  
Mr. Jacobson lectures and writes extensively in the fields of real estate 
investments.  He has periodically instructed for University of California 
Extension since 1961, lectures from time to time for the UCLA Graduate School 
of Management and is one of 80 real estate professionals in the United States 
invited to write a Chapter for THE REAL ESTATE HANDBOOK published by 
Dow-Jones, Irwin.

Mr. Jacobson holds a degree in business administration from UCLA, where he 
graduated in 1952.

THEODORE J. WEILL.  Mr. Weill is a general partner in numerous ongoing 
private and public syndications, and is active in real estate development and 
other activities.  From December, 1969 to February, 1977, Mr. Weill served as 
principal in the development of recreational communities and became Executive 
Vice President of the Resort Development Group of Dart/Kraft Industries in 
1970. From January, 1963, to November, 1969, he was President and Chairman of 
a privately held real estate and brokerage company specializing in 
commercial, industrial and income property with annual sales of $50 million, 
and a property management company with managed assets of $100 million.  Mr. 
Weill has served as a consultant to Dart/Kraft Industries, SRI International 
and ITT Corporation.  In March, 1977, he founded Weill Financial Corporation, 
a Los Angeles real estate investment organization.

Mr. Weill has a Bachelor's degree in marketing and finance from the 
University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Finance and Commerce in 1956, 
and in 1977 graduated with honors from the Pepperdine University 
Presidential/Key Executive MBA program.


PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

The Partnership Agreement provides that J/W Management Corp., a California 
Corporation organized by the General Partners, will be responsible, through 
its own personnel and/or through subcontracted management services, for the 
management of the Property, for a fee of 5% of the gross income of the 
Property, which fee is generally charged in the Stockton area. Historically, 
J/W Management has subcontracted the off-site property management to firms 
specializing in apartment house management and has paid 3% of the gross 
income to such firms while retaining the remaining 2% as compensation for 
overseeing the subcontractor's work.   J/W Management Corp. was dissolved in 
1990, and the General Partners individually continue to oversee the 
subcontractor's work and receive the 2% compensation.

Presently, the off-site management of the property is subcontracted to Norman 
Jacobson Management Co., an affiliate of one of the General Partners.

The General Partners are prohibited from entering into any transaction on 
behalf of the Partnership with any other limited partnership in which the 
General Partners or any affiliate of the General Partners has an interest.  

The General Managers may engage in the real estate business or in other 
businesses for their own account for the accounts of others or otherwise, and 
neither the Partnership nor any Limited Partners shall be entitled to any 
interest therein.  There may be conflicts of interest on the part of the 
General Partners between the Partnership and other limited partnerships with 
which they are affiliated at such time as the Partnership attempts to sell or 
rent realty or employ resident and building managers, as well as under other 
circumstances.

It is the policy of the Partnership that the Limited Partners may not engage 
directly or indirectly in any capacity for monetary gain.  Generally the 
Limited Partners participate in the profits, losses and distributions and 
have certain limited partner voting rights.  No Limited Partner shall have 
any right to be active in the conduct or management of the Partnership 
business, nor have any power to bind the Partnership by contract, agreement, 
compromise or undertaking; provided, however, that Limited Partners shall 
have the right to vote on Partnership matters, as set forth in the 
Partnership Agreement, which affects its basic structure.

Limited Partners holding 10% of the Units may call (in the General 
Partnership notice) a meeting as provided in the Rules of the Commissioner of 
Corporations of the State of California, and an affirmative vote of the 
majority interest of the Limited Partners shall be required to take action 
upon certain matters as provided in the Partnership Agreement.
