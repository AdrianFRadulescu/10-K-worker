Item 1.  Business.  

General

Wisconsin Bell, Inc. (the Company), is incorporated under the laws of the 
State of Wisconsin and has its principal office at 722 North Broadway, 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 (telephone number 414-549-7102).  The Company is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Ameritech Corporation (Ameritech), a Delaware 
corporation.  Ameritech is the parent of the Company, Illinois Bell Telephone 
Company, Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated, Michigan Bell Telephone 
Company and The Ohio Bell Telephone Company (the "landline telephone 
companies"), as well as several other communications businesses and has its 
principal executive offices at 30 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 
(telephone number 312-750-5000).  The Company is managed by its sole 
shareholder rather than a Board of Directors as permitted by Wisconsin law.  

In 1993, Ameritech restructured its landline telephone companies and two other 
related businesses into a structure of customer-specific business units 
supported by a single, regionally coordinated network unit.  The five Bell 
companies continue to function as legal entities, owning Bell company assets 
in each state and continue to be regulated by the individual state public 
utility commissions.  Products and services are now marketed under a single 
common brand identity, "Ameritech," rather than using the "Bell" name.  
While the Ameritech logo in now used to identify all the Ameritech companies, 
the Company is sometimes regionally identified as Ameritech Wisconsin.  

The Company is engaged in the business of furnishing a wide variety of 
advanced telecommunications services in Wisconsin, including local exchange 
and toll service and network access services in Wisconsin.  In accordance with 
the Consent Decree and resulting Plan of Reorganization (Plan) described 
below, the Company provides two basic types of telecommunications services 
within speci-fied geograph-ical areas termed Local Access and Transport Areas 
(LATAs), which are generally centered on a city or other identifiable 
community of interest.  The first of these services is the transporting of 
telecommunica-tions traffic between telephones and other equipment on 
customers' premises located within the same LATA (intraLATA service), which 
can include toll service as well as local service.  The second service is 
providing exchange access service, which links a customer's telephone or other 
equipment to the network of transmission facilities of interexchange carriers 
which provide telecommunications service between LATAs (interLATA service).  

About 67 percent of the population and 14 percent of the area of Wisconsin is 
served by the Company.  The remainder of the state is served by other local 
telecommunications companies.  La Crosse, Wisconsin, is the only city of over 
50,000 population in the State in which local service is furnished by a non-
affiliated company.  Other communications services offered by the Company 
include data transmission, transmission of radio and television programs and 
private line voice and data services.  

<PAGE>
The following table sets forth for the Company the number of customer lines 
in service at the end of each year.

                                  1993      1992     1991     1990     1989

The Company has certain agreements with Ameritech Publishing, Inc. ("Ameritech 
Publishing"), an Ameritech business unit doing business as "Ameritech 
Advertising Services," under which Ameritech Publishing publishes and 
distributes classified directories under a license from the Company and 
provides services to the Company relating to both classified and alphabetical 
directories.  API pays license fees to the Company under the agreements.  

Ameritech Services, Inc. (ASI) is a company jointly owned by the Company and 
the other Ameritech landline telephone companies.  ASI provides to those 
companies human resources, technical, marketing, regulatory planning and real 
estate asset management services, purchasing and material management support, 
as well as labor contract bargaining oversight and coordination.  ASI acts as 
a shared resource for the Ameritech subsidiaries providing operational support 
for the landline telephone companies and integrated communications and 
information systems for all the business units.  

Ameritech Information Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Ameritech, sells, 
installs and maintains business customer premises equipment, and sells network 
and central office-based services provided by the Company and the other four 
landline telephone companies.  It also provides expanded marketing, product 
support and technical design resources to large business customers in the 
Ameritech region.  

In 1993, about 91% of the total operating revenues of the Company were from 
telecommunications services and the remainder principally from billing and 
collection services, rents, directory advertising and other miscellaneous 
nonregulated operations.  About 75% of the revenues from communication 
services were attributable to intrastate operations.  

Capital expenditures represent the single largest use of Company funds.  The 
Company has been making and expects to continue to make large capital 
expenditures to meet the demand for telecommunications services and to further 
improve such services.  The total investment in telecommunications plant 
increased from about $2,571,000,000 at December 31, 1988, to about 
$2,724,000,000 at December 31, 1993, after giving effect to retirements but 
before deducting accumulated depreciation at either date.  Capital 
expenditures of the Company since January 1, 1989, were approximately as 
follows:  

     1989 .............. $174,000,000      1992 .............. $174,000,000
     1990 .............. $155,000,000      1993 .............. $147,000,000
     1991 .............. $164,000,000      

Expanding on the aggressive deployment plan it began it 1992, in January 1994, 
Ameritech unveiled a multi-billion dollar plan for a digital network to 
deliver video services.  Ameritech is launching a digital video network 
upgrade that by the end of the decade will enable 6,000,000 customers in its 
<PAGE>
region to access interactive information and entertainment services, as well 
as traditional cable TV services, from their homes, schools, offices, 
libraries and hospitals.  The Company, for its part in the network upgrade 
has made an initial filing with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
seeking approval of the program.  The filing reflects capital expenditures of 
approximately $53.0 over the next three years.  

The Company may also, depending on market demand make additional capital 
expenditures under the digital video network upgrade program.  The Company 
anticipates that its capital expenditures for the program will be funded 
without increasing its recent historical level of capital expenditures.  
Capital expenditures are expected to be about $156.0 in 1994.  This amount 
excludes any capital expenditures that may occur in 1994 related to the above 
described video network upgrade program.  

Consent Decree and Line of Business Restrictions

On August 24, 1982, the United States District Court for the District of 
Columbia (Court) approved and entered a consent decree entitled the 
"Modification of Final Judgment" (Consent Decree), which arose out of 
antitrust litigation brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ), and which 
required AT&T to divest itself of ownership of those portions of its wholly--
owned Bell operating communications company subsidiaries (Bell Companies) that 
related to exchange telecommunications, exchange access and printed directory 
advertising, as well as AT&T's cellular mobile communications business.  On 
August 5, 1983, the Court approved a Plan outlining the method by which AT&T 
would comply with the Consent Decree.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree and the 
Plan, effective January 1, 1984, AT&T divested itself of, by transferring to 
Ameritech, its ownership of the exchange telecommunications, exchange access 
and printed directory advertising portions of the Ameritech Bell Companies, 
as well as its regional cellular mobile communications business.  

The Consent Decree, as originally approved by the Court in 1982, provided 
that the Company (as well as the other Bell Companies) could not, directly 
or through an affiliated enterprise, provide interLATA telecommunica-tions 
services or information services, manufacture or provide telecommun-ications 
products or provide any product or service, except exchange telecom-
munications and exchange access service, that is not a natural monopoly 
service actually regulated by tariff.  The Consent Decree allowed the Company 
and the other Bell Companies to provide printed directory advertising and to 
provide, but not manufacture, customer premises equipment.  

The Consent Decree provided that the Court could grant a waiver to a Bell 
Company or its affiliates upon a showing to the Court that there is no 
substantial possibility that the Bell Company could use its monopoly power 
to impede competition in the market it seeks to enter.  The Court has, from 
time to time, granted waivers to the Company and other Bell Companies to 
engage in various activities.  

The Court's order approving the Consent Decree provides for periodic reviews 
of the restrictions imposed by it.  Following the first triennial review, in 
decisions handed down in September 1987 and March 1988, the Court continued 
the prohibitions against Bell Company manufacturing of telecommunications 
products and provision of interLATA services.  The rulings allowed limited 
provision of information services by transmission of information and provision 
<PAGE>
of information gateways, but excluded generation or manipulation of 
information content.  In addition, the rulings eliminated the need for a 
waiver for entry into non-telephone related businesses.  

In April 1990, a Federal appeals court decision affirmed the Court's decision 
continuing the restriction on Bell Company entry into interLATA services and 
the manufacture of telecommunications equipment, but directed the Court to 
review its ruling that restricted RHC involvement in the information services 
business and to determine whether removal of the information services 
restriction would be in the public interest.  In July 1991, the Court lifted 
the information services ban but stayed the effect of the decision pending 
outcome of the appeals process.  Soon after the stay was lifted on appeal and 
in July 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the Court's order 
allowing the Bell companies to produce and package information for sale across 
business and home phone lines.  In November 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court 
declined to review the lower court ruling.  

Members of Congress and the White House are intensifying efforts to enact 
legislative reform of telecommunications policy in order to stimulate the 
development of a modern national information infrastructure to bring the 
benefits of advanced communications and information services to the American 
people.  

Intrastate Rates and Regulation

The Company, in providing communications services, is subject to regulation 
by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) with respect to 
intrastate rates and services, depreciation rates (for intrastate services), 
issuance of securities and other matters.  Unless otherwise indicated, the 
amounts of the changes in revenues resulting from changes in intrastate rates 
referred to below are stated on an annual basis and are estimates without 
adjustment for subsequent changes in volumes of business.  The principal 
changes in intrastate rates authorized since January 1, 1989, were:

On June 29, 1989, the PSCW approved an order which extended competition to 
some intraLATA toll services by authorizing interexchange carriers to provide 
certain services in competition with the Company and other local carriers.  As 
a result, effective July 6, 1989, the PSCW approved the Company's proposals to 
reprice the intraLATA toll services that would be affected by the new 
competitive environment.  These services include WATS and 800 Services and 
Value Calling Plans.  This repricing order caused long distance revenue to 
decrease by about $5,800,000 annually.  

On July 1, 1989, the PSCW ordered a 14% return on equity which resulted in 
credits on customer bills.  This would have caused an annual decrease of 
$34,700,000 in local service and access revenues, however, this amount was 
reduced by $3,500,000 due to a temporary injunction granted by the Milwaukee 
County Circuit Court on August 9, 1989.  The injunction was a result of an 
appeal filed by the Company relating to the inside wire installation and 
maintenance portion of the PSCW order.  

On December 27, 1989, the PSCW issued an interim and amended order which 
decreased the ongoing rate credit by $5,200,000 per quarter year starting 
January 1, 1990.  This adjustment was in consideration of the shortfall 
<PAGE>
Wisconsin Bell was expected to incur due to the implementation of access rates 
for intrastate long distance service and the mirroring of interstate access 
rates.  Additionally, the PSCW established this adjustment on a 
subject-to-refund with interest provision basis, pending final determination 
of the Company's shortfall at a later date.  

On June 15, 1990, the PSCW ordered a refund of $23,500,000 to residential and 
business customers as well as interexchange carriers, related to the level of 
earnings experienced during the moratorium period covering August 1987 through 
July 1989.  At the same time, the PSCW also ordered the Company to refund 
approximately $2,000,000 to customers in order to pass back savings resulting 
from a gross receipts tax rate reduction effective January 1, 1989.  The 
order resulted in credits on customer bills and refunds to interexchange 
carriers during the month of July 1990.  The Company made sufficient 
provisions in the financial statements throughout the 1987-89 period in 
anticipation of the PSCW findings.  The PSCW also ruled that an additional 
$9,300,000 was subject to refund pending the outcome of the appeal associated 
with inside wire.  

On September 5, 1990, the PSCW approved two alternate plans for intrastate 
regulation - the Base Case Plan and the Three-Year Plan.  The Company chose to 
participate in the Three-Year Plan.  The terms and conditions of the plan were 
effective October 1, 1990, and resulted in an annual decrease of $3,943,000 in 
local service revenues.  Under the Three--Year Plan, the rate of return on 
equity was set at 13.75 percent and the Company's revenues were not subject--
to-refund on a going forward basis.  This trial, which was to remain in effect 
until December 31, 1993, has been extended while the PSCW reviews a new price 
regulation plan.  In February 1994, bills were introduced in the Wisconsin 
legislature that, if passed, would replace rate-of-return regulation with 
price regulation for companies choosing it.  

On February 21, 1991, the PSCW authorized the elimination of the subject--
to-refund with interest provision pertaining to the Company's expected 
quarterly shortfall of $5,200,000 due to the change from independent company 
settlements to access charges.  The PSCW also determined that no refund is 
necessary for this item during the January 1, 1990, through September 30, 
1990, subject-to--refund period.  

On May 1, 1991, the Company repriced its Value Calling Plans reducing long 
distance revenue by approximately $900,000 annually.  

Effective June 1991 and in accordance with provisions of the Three-Year Plan, 
the Company implemented a volume discount rate structure that replaced the 
previous residential local service calling plans.  The new rate structure 
reduces local service revenue by nearly $23,000,000 annually.  

On September 1, 1992, the Company eliminated Business Touchtone charges 
reducing local service revenue by $4,800,000 annually.  

On October 5, 1992, the Company repriced its Value Calling Plans reducing long 
distance revenue by approximately $600,000 annually.  

On March 30, 1993, the PSCW reached a final decision concerning inside wire 
and moratorium refund issues.  In April 1993, the Company commenced refunding 
$22,500,000 to residential and business customers and interexchange carriers.  
<PAGE>
The $21,300,000 credit/rate reduction consisted of three elements:  
$17,300,000 for settlement of inside wire appeals; $3,900,000 for an addi-
tional refund from the 1987-89 moratorium review; and $158,000 for additional 
gross receipts tax rate reductions that must be passed back to customers.  

Additionally during 1993, the Company repriced other specific services which 
resulted in the following approximate rate reductions:

FCC Regulatory Jurisdiction

The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) with respect to intraLATA interstate services, interstate 
access services and other matters.  The FCC prescribes for communications 
companies a uniform system of accounts apportioning costs between regulated 
and nonregulated services, depreciation rates (for interstate services) and 
the principles and standard procedures (separations procedures) used to 
separate property costs, revenues, expenses, taxes and reserves between those 
applicable to interstate services under the jurisdiction of the FCC and those 
appli-cable to services under the jurisdiction of the respective state 
regulatory authorities.  

For certain companies, including the Company, interstate services regulated 
by the FCC are covered by a price cap plan.  The Plan creates incentives to 
improve productivity over benchmark units in order to retain higher 
earnings.  Price cap regulation sets maximum limits on the prices that may 
be charged for telecommunications services but also provides for a sharing of 
productivity gains.  Earnings in excess of 12.25% will result in prospective 
reductions of the price ceilings on interstate services.  

In January 1994, the FCC began a scheduled fourth-year comprehensive review of 
price cap regulation for local exchange companies.  

Access Charges Arrangements

Interstate Access Charges.  

<PAGE>
The Ameritech landline telephone companies provide access services for the 
origination and termination of interstate telecommunications.  The access 
charges are of three types:  common line, switched access and trunking.  

The common line portion of interstate revenue requirements are recovered 
through monthly subscriber line charges and per minute carrier common line 
charges.  The carrier common line rates include recovery of transitional and 
long-term support payments for distribution to other local exchange carriers.  
Transitional support payments were made over a four-year period which ended on 
April 1, 1993.  Long-term support payments will continue indefinitely.  

Effective January 1, 1994, rates for local transport services were 
restructured and a new "trunking" service category created.  Trunking services 
consist of two types:  those associated with the local transport element of 
switched access and those associated with special access.  Trunking services 
associated with switched access handle the transmission of traffic between a 
local exchange carrier's serving wire center and a Company end office where 
local switching occurs.  Trunking services associated with special access 
handle the transmission of telecommunications services between any two 
customer-designated premises or between a customer-designated premise and a 
Company end office where multiplexing occurs.  High volume customers generally 
use the flat-rated dedicated facilities associated with special access, while 
usage sensitive rates apply for lower-volume customers that utilize a common 
switching center.  

Local transport rate elements for switched services assess a flat monthly rate 
and a mileage sensitive rate for the physical facility between the customer's 
point of termination and the end office, a usage sensitive and mileage 
sensitive rate assessed for the facilities between the end office through the 
access tandem to the customer's serving wire center, and a minute of use 
charge assessed to all local transport.  The flat rate transport rates and 
structure generally mirror special access rate elements.  Customers can order 
direct transport between the serving wire center or end office and the access 
tandem and tandem switched transport between the access tandem and the end 
office.  

Special access charges are monthly charges assessed to customers for access to 
interstate private line service.  Charges are paid for local distribution 
channels, interoffice mileage and optional features and functions.  

State Access Charges.  

Compensation arrangements required in connection with origination and 
termination of intrastate communications by interexchange carriers are 
subject to the jurisdiction of the state regulatory commissions.  The 
Ameritech landline telephone companies currently provide access services to 
interexchange carriers authorized by the state regulatory commissions to 
provide service between local serving areas pursuant to tariffs which 
generally parallel the terms of the interstate access tariffs.  In the event 
interexchange carriers are authorized by the state regulatory commissions to 
provide service within their local serving areas, the Ameritech landline 
telephone companies intend to provide access service under the same tariffs 
applicable to intrastate services provided by such carriers between the 
Ameritech landline telephone companies' local serving areas.  

<PAGE>
Separate arrangements govern compensation between Ameritech landline telephone 
companies and independent telephone companies for jointly provided 
communications within the five Ameritech companies' local serving areas and 
associated independent telephone company exchanges.  These arrangements are 
subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC and the state regulatory commissions.  

Competition

Regulatory, legislative and judicial decisions, technological advances 
as well as heightened customer interest in advanced telecommunications 
services, have expanded the types of available communications services and 
products and the number of companies offering such services.  Market 
convergence, already a reality, is expected to intensify.  

The FCC has taken a series of steps that are expanding opportunities for 
companies to compete with local exchange carriers in providing services that 
fall under the FCC's jurisdiction.  In September 1992, the FCC mandated that 
local exchange carriers provide network access for special transmission paths 
to competitive access providers, interexchange carriers and end users.  In 
February 1993, Ameritech filed a tariff with the FCC, which was effective in 
May, making possible this type of interconnection.  In August 1993, the FCC 
issued an order that permits competitors to interconnect to local telephone 
company switches.  Under the new rules, certain telephone companies must allow 
all interested parties to terminate their switched access transmission 
facilities at telephone company central offices, wire centers, tandem switches 
and certain remote nodes.  Ameritech filed a tariff in November 1993 to effect 
that change which was effective in February 1994.  

Ameritech is seeking opportunities to compete on an equal footing.  Although 
the Company is barred from providing interLATA and nationwide cable services, 
its competitors are not.  Cellular telephone and other wireless technologies 
are poised to bypass Ameritech's local access network.  Cable providers, who 
currently service more than eighty percent of American homes, could provide 
telephone service and have expressed their desire to do so.  Certain 
interexchange carriers and competitive access providers have demonstrated 
interest in providing local exchange service.  Ameritech's plan is to 
facilitate competition in the local exchange business in order to compete in 
the total communications marketplace.  

Customers First:  Ameritech's Advanced Universal Access Plan

In 1993, Ameritech embarked on a long-range restructuring with the intent of 
dramatically changing the way it serves its customers, and in the process 
altered its corporate framework, expanding the nature and scope of its 
services and supporting the development of a fully competitive marketplace.  
In March, Ameritech filed a plan with the FCC to change the way local 
telecommunications services are provided and regulated and to furnish a policy 
framework for advanced universal access to modern telecommunications services 
- - voice, data and video information.  

Ameritech proposes to facilitate competition in the local exchange business 
by allowing other service providers to purchase components of its network and 
to repackage them with their own services for resale, in exchange for the 
freedom to compete in both its existing and currently prohibited businesses.  
<PAGE>
Ameritech has requested regulatory reforms to match the competitive environ-
ment as well as support of its efforts to remove restraints, such as the 
interLATA service restriction, which currently restrict its participation in 
the full telecommunications marketplace.  In addition, Ameritech asks for more 
flexibility in pricing new and competitive services and replacement of caps on 
earnings with price regulation.  Under the plan, customers would be able to 
choose from competitive providers for local service as they now can choose a 
provider for interexchange service.  

To demonstrate conclusively the substantial customer and economic benefits of 
full competition, in December 1993, Ameritech proposed a trial of its plan, 
beginning in 1995.  Ameritech has petitioned the DOJ to recommend Federal 
District Court approval of a waiver of the long-distance restriction of the 
Consent Decree so that Ameritech can offer interexchange service.  At the same 
time, Ameritech would facilitate the development of local communications 
markets by unbundling the local network and integrating competitors' 
switches.  The trial would begin in Illinois in the first quarter of 1995 and 
would last indefinitely.  Other states could be added over time.  If the trial 
is approved by the DOJ, the request must be acted on by the Court which 
retains jurisdiction over administering the terms of the Consent Decree.  In 
February 1994, Ameritech filed tariffs with the Illinois Commerce Commission 
that propose specific rates and procedures to open the local network in that 
state.  Approval could take up to 11 months.  

Ameritech has received broad support for the plan from Midwest elected 
officials, national and Midwest business leaders, and education, health 
industry, economic development and consumer leaders.  The national and local 
offices of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) also support the plan.  

Ameritech has alternative regulatory proposals pending with the state 
regulatory commissions in its region to support implementation of the plan.  

Ameritech Video Network Concept

In January 1994, Ameritech filed plans with the FCC to construct a digital 
video network upgrade that will enable it to reach 6,000,000 customers by the 
end of the decade.  Ameritech expects to spend $4.4 billion to upgrade its 
network to provide video services, part of a total of approximately $29 
billion Ameritech estimates it will spend on network improvements over the 
next fifteen years.  Ameritech is pursuing alliances and partnerships that 
will position it as a key participant in the emerging era of interactive video 
experiences.  Pending FCC approval of Ameritech's plan and clearing of other 
regulatory hurdles, the construction of the first phase of the network could 
begin as soon as the fourth quarter of 1994.  The new network, which will be 
separate from Ameritech's core local communications network, will be expanded 
to approximately 1,000,000 additional Midwest customers in each of the next 
five years.  

Ameritech will be only one of many users of the broadband network.  A 
multitude of competing video information providers, businesses, institutions, 
interexchange carriers and video telephony customers will also have access to 
the technology.  

<PAGE>
With the new system, customers will have access to a virtually unlimited 
variety of programming sources.  These will include basic broadcast services, 
similar to today's cable service, and advanced interactive services such as 
video on demand, home healthcare, interactive educational software, distance 
learning, interactive games and shopping, and a variety of other entertainment 
and information services that can be accessed from homes, offices, schools, 
hospitals, libraries and other public and private institutions.  

Cable/Telco Cross Ownership Ban

In November 1993, Ameritech filed motions in two federal courts seeking 
freedom from the ban on providing video services in its own service area.  
Ameritech asked U.S. District Courts in Illinois and Michigan to declare 
unconstitutional the provisions of the Cable Act of 1984 that bar the RHCs 
from providing cable TV service in areas where they hold monopolies on local 
phone service.  In August 1993, a U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. 
granted a request by Bell Atlantic Corporation for such an order, but that 
court denied similar requests by Ameritech and the other RHCs.  

Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would repeal the 
cross ownership ban.  

Employee Relations

As of December 31, 1993, the Company employed 5,137 persons, a decrease 
from 5,659 at December 31, 1992.  During 1993, approximately 270 employees 
left the payroll as a result of voluntary and involuntary workforce programs, 
and 156 nonmanagement employees took advantage of a Supplemental Protection 
Program (SIPP) established under labor agreements to voluntarily exit the 
workforce.  Additional restructuring was done by normal attrition.  On 
March 25, 1994, Ameritech announced that it will reduce its nonmanagement 
workforce by 6,000 employees by the end of 1995, including approximately 600 
at the Company.  Under terms of agreements between Ameritech, the CWA and the 
IBEW, Ameritech is implementing an enhancement to the Ameritech pension plan 
by adding three years to the age and net credited service of eligible 
nonmanagement employees who leave the business during a designated period that 
ends in mid-1995.  In addition, Ameritech's network business unit is offering 
financial incentives under the terms of its current contracts with the CWA and 
IBEW to selected nonmanagement employees who leave the business before the end 
of 1995.  

The reduction of the workforce results from technological improvements, 
consolidations and initiatives identified by management to balance its cost 
structure with emerging competition.  

Approximately 3,875 employees are represented by the Communications Workers of 
America (CWA), a union affiliated with the AFL-CIO.  

In July and August 1993, the Ameritech landline telephone companies and 
Ameritech Services reached agreement with the union on a workforce transition 
plan for assigning union-represented employees to the newly established 
business units.  The agreement with the CWA extends existing union contracts 
with the landline telephone companies and Ameritech Services to the new units.  
The pacts address a number of force assignment, employment security and union 
representation issues.  In 1995, when union contracts are due to expire, the 
parties will negotiate regional contracts.  

<PAGE>
During 1992, 171 of the Company's management employees left the Company 
through a voluntary early retirement program and involuntary terminations.  
Through 1995, the Company expects to eliminate additional positions through 
job consolidations and force reduction initiatives resulting from 
technological efficiencies.  

Item 2.  Properties.  

The properties of the Company do not lend themselves to description by 
character and location of principal units.  At December 31, 1993, central 
office equipment represented 36% of the Company's investment in telecommunica-
tions plant in service; land and buildings (occupied principally by central 
offices) represented 12%; telecommunications instruments and related wiring 
and equipment, including private branch exchanges, substantially all of which 
are on the premises of customers, represented 10%; and connecting lines which 
constitute outside plant, the majority of which are on or under public roads, 
highways or streets and the remainder of which are on or under private 
property, represented 42%.  

Substantially all of the installations of central office equipment and 
administrative offices are located in buildings owned by the Company 
situated on land which it owns in fee.  Many garages, administrative offices, 
business offices and some installations of central office equipment are in 
rented quarters.  

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.  

Pre-divestiture Contingent Liabilities Agreement

The Plan provides for the recognition and payment of liabilities that are 
attributable to pre-divestiture events (including transactions to implement 
the divestiture) but that do not become certain until after divestiture.  
These contingent liabilities relate principally to litigation and other 
claims with respect to the former Bell System's rates, taxes, contracts, 
equal employment matters, environmental matters and torts (including 
business torts, such as alleged violations of the antitrust laws).  

With respect to such liabilities, AT&T and the Bell Companies, including 
the Company, will share the costs of any judgment or other determination of 
liability entered by a court or administrative agency, the costs of 
defending the claim (including attorneys' fees and court costs) and the 
cost of interest or penalties with respect to any such judgment or 
determination.  Except to the extent that affected parties may otherwise 
agree, the general rule is that responsibility for such contingent 
liabilities will be divided among AT&T and the Bell Companies on the basis 
of their relative net investment (defined as total assets less reserves for 
depreciation) as of the effective date of divestiture.  Different 
allocation rules apply to liabilities which relate exclusively to 
pre-divestiture interstate or intrastate operations.  

Although complete assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of any 
litigation, in the opinion of the Company's management any monetary 
liability or financial impact to which the Company would be subject after 
final adjudication of all of the foregoing actions would not be material in 
amount to the financial position of the Company.

                           OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                             (Dollars in Millions)


The Year 1993 Compared to the Year 1992

Following is a discussion and analysis of the results of operations of 
the Company for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, based on the 
Statements of Income and Rein-vested Earnings.  Other pertinent data are also 
given in the Selected Financial and Operating Data.  

Revenues

Total operating revenues were $1,122.3 for 1993 and $1,087.4 for 1992.  The 
increase of $34.9 or 3.2%, consisted of the following:  

                                                       Increase        Percent
                              1993         1992       (Decrease)        Change

Local service                $487.7       $474.9         $12.8            2.7%
 
Local service revenues increased $12.8 which resulted from an $18.9 increase 
in business and residence revenue volumes.  Customer lines increased 3.5% from 
1,833,722 at December 31, 1992, to 1,898,159 at December 31, 1993.  In 
addition, public telephone revenues increased $1.0 and Directory revenues 
increased $0.5.  These increases were partially offset by a $3.0 decrease due 
to the business touchtone rate elimination effective September 1992, and a 
$2.6 reduction related to a refund for inside wire that was charged against 
local message revenues effective April 1, 1993.  In addition, private line 
revenues decreased $2.0.  

                                                       Increase        Percent

   Interstate access         $239.1       $224.6        $ 14.5           6.5%
   Intrastate access         $ 88.6       $ 93.3        $ (4.7)         (5.0%)
 
Interstate access charge revenues increased $14.4 due in part to a $6.4 
decrease in National Exchange Carriers Association (NECA) transitional support 
funding and a $5.9 demand and rate increase in end user revenues.  In 
addition, payments to American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) for 800 
settlements decreased $3.6.  A demand increase of $5.7 in traffic sensitive 
access revenues also contributed to the increase.  Interstate switched minutes 
of use increased 5.3%.  This increase was partially offset by a $7.3 decrease 
in traffic sensitive access revenues caused by rate reductions.  

Intrastate access revenues decreased $4.7 primarily from a $11.4 decrease in 
switched access revenues caused by rate reductions.  This decrease was 
partially offset by a $6.0 increase in switched access volumes.  Intrastate 
switched minutes of use increased 8.3%.

Long distance                    $206.8      $200.4         $6.4         3.2%
 
Long distance revenues increased $6.4 primarily due to a $5.2 increase 
associated with increased message toll volumes, a $2.1 increase in independent 
company toll revenue and a $1.8 increase related to the finalization of 
independent company cost studies.  These increases were partially offset by 
$2.7 in volume decreases in private line, wide area telephone service (WATS) 
and coin revenues.

Miscellaneous - net              $100.1       $94.2         $5.9         6.3%
 
Miscellaneous revenues increased $5.9 due to a $2.8 increase in revenues from 
inside wire due to the price restructuring of inside wire maintenance plans 
and increased time and material rates.  In addition, affiliated company cost 
recovery billings increased $1.1, and uncollectible expense decreased $1.6. 

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses were $867.3 in 1993 and $865.9 in 1992.  The increase of 
$1.4 or 0.1% consisted of the following:  

                                                         Increase      Percent
                                  1993        1992      (Decrease)      Change

Depreciation                     $186.1      $186.4        $(0.3)        (.1%)
 
Depreciation decreased $0.3 as a result of completing the amortization of a 
reserve deficiency authorized by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 
(PSCW) of $24.3.  This decrease was partially offset by increased rates due to 
the PSCW represcription, and the amortization of an additional reserve 
deficiency authorized by the PSCW effective July 1, 1993.  

                                                         Increase      Percent
                                  1993        1992      (Decrease)      Change

Employee related expenses        $255.8      $260.7        $(4.9)       (1.9%)
 
Employee related expenses decreased $4.9.  Force reductions reduced employee 
related expenses by $15.3.  At December 31, 1993, the Company had 5,137 
employees compared to 5,659 at December 31, 1992, a decrease of 522 employees.  
This decrease due to force reductions was partially offset by wage and salary 
increases of $7.4 and overtime increases of $2.5.

Taxes other than income taxes     $62.8       $61.7         $1.1         1.8%
 
The increase in taxes other than income taxes resulted from an increase in 
remainder assessment fees and a sales/use tax assessment.

Other operating expenses         $362.6      $357.1         $5.5         1.5%
 
The increase in other operating expenses resulted primarily from affiliated 
billing increases of $10.7 for the Company's allocation of common Ameritech 
costs.  These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 decrease in contract 
services, a $2.0 decrease in materials and supplies and a $1.2 decrease in 
miscellaneous other expenses.  

Other Income and Expenses

                                                          Increase     Percent
                                  1993        1992       (Decrease)     Change

Interest Expense                  $32.0       $42.0       ($10.0)      (23.8%)
 
The decrease in interest expense is due to the retirements in 1993 of $300.0 
in long-term debt, bearing interest ranging from 8% to 8-3/4%.  This debt was 
refinanced with short-term debt with Ameritech, which bears lower interest 
rates, and $150.0 of long-term debt bearing interest at 6-3/4%.  

                                                          Increase     Percent
                                  1993        1992       (Decrease)     Change

Other (Income)/Expense            $10.7        $6.2         $4.5        72.6%
 
The increase in other expense is due primarily to $5.8 in interest income from 
Internal Revenue Service refunds that occurred during 1992.  In addition, the 
Company expensed $9.0 in debt refinancing costs in 1993 and $8.0 of such costs 
in 1992.  

                                                       Increase        Percent
                              1993         1992       (Decrease)        Change

Income Tax Expense            $74.3        $56.0         $18.3          32.7%
 
The increase in income tax expense reflects the increase in the federal tax 
rate from 34% to 35% and a $39.0 or 22.5% increase in income before income 
taxes and cumulative change in accounting principles.

Other Matters

Effects of Regulatory Accounting

The Company presently gives accounting recognition to the actions of 
regulators where appropriate, as prescribed by Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of 
Regulation" (SFAS No. 71).  Under SFAS No. 71, the Company records certain 
assets and liabilities because of actions of regulators.  Further, amounts 
charged to operations for depreciation expense reflect estimated useful lives 
and methods prescribed by regulators rather than those that might otherwise 
apply to unregulated enterprises.  In the event the Company determines that it 
no longer meets the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, the accounting impact 
to the Company would be an extraordinary noncash charge to operations of an 
amount which could be material.  Criteria that give rise to the discontinuance 
of SFAS No. 71 include:  (1) increasing competition which restricts the 
Company's ability to establish prices to recover specific costs, and (2) a 
significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from 
cost-based regulation to another form of regulation.  The Company periodically 
reviews these criteria to ensure that continuing application of SFAS No. 71 is 
appropriate.  

Regulatory Environment

Customer demand, technology and the preferences of policy makers are all 
converging to increase competition in the local exchange business.  The 
effects of increasing competition are apparent in the marketplace the Company 
serves.  For example, competitive access providers have requested regulatory 
authority to provide full local exchange service in Wisconsin.  Additionally, 
increasing volumes of intraLATA long distance services purchased by large and 
medium sized business customers are sold by carriers other than the Company.  

Recognizing the trend, the Company's regulatory/public policy activities are 
focused on achieving a framework that allows for expanding competition while 
providing a fair opportunity for all carriers, including the Company, to 
succeed.  The cornerstone of this effort is Ameritech's "Customers First Plan" 
that was filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on March 1, 
1993.  In a subsequent filing with the U.S. Department of Justice, Ameritech 
proposed that the Customers First Plan be implemented on a trial basis 
beginning in January, 1995 in Illinois and other states thereafter.  

The Customers First Plan proposed to open all of the local telephone business 
in the Company's service area to competition.  In exchange, Ameritech has 
requested three regulatory changes.  First, Ameritech has requested relief 
from the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) interLATA ban.  Such relief 
would mean that the Company would be allowed to offer all long distance 
services.  Second, Ameritech has requested a number of modifications in the 
FCC's price cap rules.  These modifications would apply only to Ameritech, 
including the Company, and would eliminate any obligation to refund, in the 
form of its share of future rate reductions, its share of interstate earnings 
in excess of 12.25%.  The modifications would also provide the Company 
increased ability to price its interstate access services in a manner 
appropriate to competitive conditions.  Third, Ameritech has requested FCC 
authority to collect in a competitively neutral manner, the social subsidies 
currently embedded in the rates that the Company charges long distance 
carriers for access to the local network.  

<PAGE>
Status of Business Units

In February 1993, following a year-long examination of its business called 
"Breakthrough Leadership," Ameritech announced it would restructure its  
business into separate units organized around specific customer groups - such 
as residential customers, small businesses, interexchange companies and large 
corporations - and a single unit that will run Ameritech's network in 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.  The Ameritech Bell Companies 
will continue to function as legal entities owning current Bell Company assets 
in each state.  The network unit will provide network and information 
technology resources in response to the needs of the other business units.  
This unit will be the source of network capabilities for products and services 
offered by the other business units and will be responsible for the 
development and day-to-day operation of an advanced information 
infrastructure.  

All of the business units and the network unit are currently operational.  
Ameritech has developed a new logo and is marketing all of its products and 
services under the single brand name "Ameritech."  

Digital Video Network

In January 1994, Ameritech Corporation (Ameritech), the parent of the Company, 
announced a program to launch a digital video network upgrade that is 
expected, by the end of the decade, to make available interactive information 
and entertainment services, as well as traditional cable TV services, to 
approximately 6,000,000 Ameritech customers.  The Company has filed an 
application with the FCC seeking approval of the program.  The application 
reflects capital expenditures of approximately $53.0 over the next three 
years.  The Company may also, depending on market demand, make additional 
capital expenditures under this program.  The Company anticipates that its 
capital expenditures for the program will be funded without an increase to its 
recent historical level of capital expenditures.  

Changes in Accounting Principles

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The new 
accounting method is essentially a refinement of the method the Company had 
been following and, accordingly, did not have a material impact on the 
Company's financial statements upon adoption.  

As more fully discussed in Note C to the financial statements, effective 
January 1, 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," and SFAS No. 112, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  The cumulative effect of these 
accounting changes was recognized in the first quarter of 1992 as a change in 
accounting principles of $151.8, net of a deferred income tax benefit of 
$93.8.  

<PAGE>
Workforce Resizing

On March 25, 1994, Ameritech announced that it will reduce its nonmanagement 
workforce by 6,000 employees by the end of 1995, including approximately 600 
at the Company.  Under terms of agreements between Ameritech, the 
Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers (IBEW), Ameritech is implementing an enhancement to the 
Ameritech pension plan by adding three years to the age and net credited 
service of eligible nonmanagement employees who leave the business during a 
designated period that ends in mid-1995.  In addition, Ameritech's network 
business unit is offering financial incentives under the terms of its current 
contracts with the CWA and IBEW, to selected nonmanagement employees who leave 
the business before the end of 1995.  

The above actions will result in a charge to first quarter 1994 earnings of 
approximately $53.0 or $31.7 after-tax.  A significant portion of the program 
cost will be funded by Ameritech's pension plan, whereas financial incentives 
to be paid from company funds are estimated to be approximately $14.2.  
Settlement gains, which result from terminated employees accepting lump-sum 
payments from the pension plan, will be reflected in income as employees leave 
the payroll.  The Company believes this program will reduce its employee-
related costs by approximately $30.0 on an annual basis upon completion of 
this program.  

The reduction of the workforce results from technological improvements, 
consolidations and initiatives identified by management to balance its cost 
structure with emerging competition.

the schedules referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's 
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements and schedules based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.  

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Wisconsin Bell, Inc. as of 
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  

As discussed in Note C to the financial statements, the Company changed its 
method of accounting for certain postretirement and postemployment benefits in 
1992.  

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole.  The financial statement schedules 
listed in Item 14(a)(2) are presented for purposes of complying with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not a required part of the 
basic financial statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements 
and, in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data 
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements 
taken as a whole.

           . Charges incurred for services        $12.6     $15.2     $14.6
 

     Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment is 
     stated at original cost.  The original cost of property, plant and 
     equipment acquired from ASI includes a return on investment to ASI. 
     
     The provision for depreciation is based principally on the 
     straight-line remaining life and the straight-line equal life group 
     methods of depreciation applied to individual categories of property, 
     plant and equipment with similar characteristics.  The provision for 
     intrastate deprecia-tion is prescribed by the Public Service Commission of 
     Wisconsin (PSCW) and differs from the Federal Communications Commission 
     (FCC) prescribed methods.  The PSCW permits only the use of the 
     straight-line remaining life method.  

     Generally, when depreciable plant is retired, the amount at which such 
     plant has been carried in property, plant and equipment in service is 
     charged to accumulated depreciation.  

     The cost of maintenance and repairs of plant is charged to expense.  

     Investments - The Company's investment in ASI (10% ownership or $26.7 for 
     1993 and 10% or $22.0 for 1992, respectively) is reflected in the 
     financial statements using the equity method of accounting.  All other 
     investments are carried at cost.  

<PAGE>
     Material and Supplies - Inventories of new and reusable material and 
     supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined 
     generally on an average cost basis.  

     Interest During Construction - Regulatory authorities allow the Company 
     to accrue interest as a cost of constructing certain plant and as an item 
     of income, i.e., allowance for debt and equity funds used to finance 
     construction.  Such income is not realized in cash currently but will be 
     realized over the service life of the plant as the resulting higher 
     depreciation expense is recovered in the form of increased revenues.  

     Income Taxes - The Company is included in the consoli-dated federal 
     income tax return filed by Ameritech and its subsidiaries.  Consolidated 
     income tax currently payable has been allocated to the Company based on 
     the Company's contribution to consolidated taxable income and tax 
     credits.  Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of 
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," 
     (SFAS No. 109).  The new accounting method is essentially a refinement of 
     the liability method already followed by the Company and accordingly, did 
     not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements upon 
     adoption.  

     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on differences between the 
     financial statement bases of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of 
     those same assets and liabilities.  Under the liability method, deferred 
     tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using 
     the statutory tax rates in effect when these temporary differences are 
     expected to reverse.  Deferred income tax expense is measured by the 
     change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability during the year.  
     In addition, for regulated companies, SFAS No. 109 requires that all 
     deferred regulatory liabilities be recognized at the revenue requirement 
     level.  It further requires that a deferred tax liability be recorded to 
     reflect the amount of cumulative tax benefits previously flowed through 
     to ratepayers and that a long-term deferred asset be recorded to reflect 
     the revenue to be recovered in telephone rates when the related taxes 
     become payable in future years.  

     The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for investment tax 
     credits.  Therefore, credits earned prior to the repeal of investment 
     tax credits by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and also certain 
     transitional credits earned after the repeal are being amortized as 
     reductions in tax expense over the life of the plant which gave rise 
     to the credits.  

     Temporary Cash Investments - Temporary cash investments are stated at 
     cost, which approximates market.  The Company considers all highly 
     liquid, short-term investments with an original maturity of three months 
     or less to be cash equivalents.  

     Short Term Financing Arrangement - During 1991, Ameritech entered into 
     an arrangement with its subsidiaries for the provision of short-term 
     financing.  This arrangement became effective for the Company June 1, 
     1992.  Ameritech issues commercial paper and notes and secures bank 
     loans to fund the working capital requirements of its subsidiaries and 
     invests short-term, excess funds on their behalf.  See Note D and H.

(B)  INCOME TAXES - The components of income tax expense before accounting 
     changes were as follows:

                                                 Year Ended December 31,

     Total income tax expense . . . . .       $ 74.3      $56.0      $56.8 

     Deferred income tax expense (credits) results principally from temporary 
     differences caused by the change in the book and tax bases of property, 
     plant and equipment due to the use of different depreciation methods 
     and lives for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  

     Total income taxes paid were $74.5, $89.0 and $77.1 in 1993, 1992 and 
     1991, respectively.  

The following is a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax 
rate for each of the last three years and the Company's effective tax rate:

     The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted in August of 1993, 
     increased the statutory federal income tax rate for 1993 to 35 percent.  
     In accordance with the liability method of accounting, the Company 
     adjusted, on the enactment date, its deferred income tax balances not 
     subject to regulatory accounted prescribed by SFAS No. 71 (see Note A).  
     The result was a reduction in deferred income tax expense of $2.3, 
     primarily from increasing the deferred tax assets associated SFAS Nos. 
     106 and 112 (see Note C).  

     As of December 31, 1993, the Company had a regulatory asset of $41.7 
     (reflected in Other Assets and Deferred Charges) related to the 
     cumulative amount of income taxes on temporary differences previously 
     flowed through to ratepayers.  In addition, on that date, the Company had 
     a regulatory liability of $72.2 (reflected in Other Deferred Credits) 
     related to the reduction of deferred taxes resulting from the change in 
     the federal statutory income tax rate of 35 percent and deferred taxes 
     provided on unamortized investment tax credits.  These amounts will be 
     amortized over the regulatory lives of the related depreciable assets 
     concurrent with recovery in rates.  The accounting for and the impact on 
     future net income of these amounts will depend on the ratemaking 
     treatment authorized in future regulatory proceedings.  

     As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the components of long-term accumulated 
     deferred income taxes were as follows:  

                                                  1993            1992

(C)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

     Pension Plans - Ameritech maintains noncontributory defined pension and 
     death benefit plans covering substantially all of the Company's 
     management and nonmanagement employees.  The pension benefit formula used 
     in the determination of pension cost is based on the average compensation 
     earned during the five highest consecutive years of the last ten years of 
     employment for the management plan and a flat dollar amount per year of 
     service for the nonmanagement plan.  Pension (credit) cost is allocated 
     to subsidiaries based upon the percentage of compensation for the 
     management plan and per employee for the nonmanagement plan.  The 
     Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount up to the 
     maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.  
     However, due to the funded status of the plans, no contributions have 
     been made for the years reported below.  The following data provides 
     information on the Company's (credit) cost for the Ameritech plans:  

                                                    Year Ended December 31,

                                                   _______  ________ _______
     Pension credit was determined using the projected unit credit actuarial 
     method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
     No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."  The resulting pension 
     credits are primarily attributable to favorable investment performance 
     and the funded status of the plans.  

     Certain disclosures are required to be made of the components of pension 
     costs and the funded status of the plans, including the actuarial present 
     value of accumulated plan benefits, accumulated projected benefit 
     obligation and the fair value of plan assets.  Such disclosures are not 
     presented for the Company because the structure of the Ameritech plans 
     does not permit the plans' data to be readily disaggregated.  

     The assets of the Ameritech plans consist principally of debt and equity 
     securities, fixed income securities and real estate.  As of December 31, 
     1993, the fair value of plan assets available for plan benefits exceeded 
     the projected benefit obligation (calculated using a discount rate of 
     5.8% as of December 31, 1993 and 1992).  The assumed long-term rate of 
     return on plan assets used in determining pension cost was 7.25% for 
     1993, 1992 and 1991.  The assumed increase in future compensation levels 
     also used in the determination of the projected obligation was 4.5% in 
     1993 and 1992.  

<PAGE>
     Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions - Effective January 1, 1992, 
     the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, 
     "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" 
     (SFAS No. 106).  SFAS No. 106 requires the cost of postretirement 
     benefits granted to employees to be accrued as expense over the period in 
     which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive 
     benefits.  The cost of health care costs and post-retirement life 
     insurance benefits for current and future retirees was recognized as 
     determined under the projected unit credit actuarial method.  

     In adopting SFAS No. 106, the Company elected to immediately recognize 
     effective January 1, 1992, the transition obligation for current and 
     future retirees.  The unrecognized obligation was $230.2 less deferred 
     income taxes of $90.3 or $139.9, net.  To this amount, is added the 
     Company's 10 percent share of ASI's transition benefit obligation of $6.2 
     for a total charge of $146.1.  

     As defined by SFAS No. 71, a regulatory asset and any corresponding 
     regulatory liability associated with the recognition of the transition 
     obligation was not recorded because of uncertainties as to the timing and 
     extent of recovery in the ratemaking process.  

     Substantially all current and future retirees are covered under 
     postretirement benefit plans sponsored by Ameritech.  Such benefits 
     include medical, dental and group life insurance.  Ameritech has been 
     prefunding (including cash received from the Company) certain of these 
     benefits through Voluntary Employee Benefit Associations (VEBAs) and 
     Retirement Funding Accounts (RFAs).  The associated plan assets 
     (primarily corporate securities and bonds) were considered in determining 
     the transition obligation under SFAS No. 106.  Ameritech intends to 
     continue to fund its obligation appropriately, and is exploring other 
     available funding and cost containment alternatives.  Ameritech allocates 
     its retiree health-care costs on per participant basis, whereas group 
     life insurance is allocated based on compensation levels.  

     SFAS No. 106 requires certain disclosures as to the components of 
     postretirement benefit costs and the funded status of the plans.  Such 
     disclosures are not presented for the Company as the structure of the 
     Ameritech plans does not permit the data to be readily disaggregated.  

     However, the Company has been advised by Ameritech as to the following 
     assumptions used in determining its SFAS No. 106 costs.  

     As of December 31, 1993, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the 
     fair value of plant assets available for plan benefits.  The assumed 
     discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit 
     obligation was 7.0% as of December 31, 1993 and 7.5% as of December 31, 
     1992.  The assumed rate of future increases in compensation level was 
     4.5% as of December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992.  The expected 
     long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.25% in 1993 and 1992 on 
     VEBAs and 8.0% in 1993 and 1992 on RFAs.  The assumed healthcare cost 
     trend rate in 1993 was 9.6% and 10% in 1992, and is assumed to decrease 
     gradually to 4% in 2007 and remain at that level.  The assumed increase 
     in healthcare cost is 9.2% for 1994.  The healthcare cost trend rates 
     have a significant effect on the amounts reported for costs each year.  
     <PAGE>
 Specifically, increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one 
     percentage point in each year would have increased the transition 
     obligation and annual expense by 18%.  

     Postretirement benefit cost under SFAS No. 106 for 1993 and 1992 was 
     $23.7 and $21.9, respectively.  During 1991, the cost of postretirement 
     health care benefits for retirees was $20.3.  

     As of December 31, 1993, the company had approximately 4,359 retirees 
     eligible to receive health care and group life insurance benefits.  

     Postemployment Benefits - Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers 
     Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS No. 112).  SFAS No. 112 
     requires employers to accrue the future cost of certain benefits such as 
     workers compensation, disability benefits and health care continuation 
     coverage.  A one-time charge related to adoption of this statement was 
     recognized as a change in accounting principle, effective as of 
     January 1, 1992.  The charge was $5.5, net of deferred taxes of $3.5.  To 
     this amount is added the Company's 10% share of ASI's one-time charge of 
     $.2 for a total charge of $5.7.  Previously the Company used the cash 
     method to account for such costs.  Future expense levels are dependent 
     upon actual claim experience, but are not expected to be materially 
     different than prior charges to income.  

     Workforce Reductions - During 1993, 270 employees left the Company 
     through a voluntary early retirement program and involuntary 
     terminations.  The net cost of this effort including termination 
     benefits, settlement and curtailment gains from the pension plan, was a 
     credit to expense of $2.8.  The involuntary termination plan remains in 
     effect until December 31, 1994.  

     During 1992, 172 employees left the Company through a voluntary early 
     retirement program and involuntary terminations.  The net cost of this 
     effort including termination benefits, settlement and curtailment gains 
     from the pension plan, was a credit to expense of $0.1.  

     During 1991, the Company offered most of its management employees an 
     early retirement program.  The net cost of this program, including 
     termination benefits and a settlement gain from the pension plan, was 
     $0.9.

     On December 30, 1992, the Company announced a plan to call its 8-3/4% 
     $100.0 bonds effective February 1, 1993.  The premium paid to call the 
     bonds, ($5.1) along with the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs 
     related to the bonds ($2.9) have been expensed as of December 31, 1992 
     and are included in other expense (income).  The bond call was financed 
     with short-term borrowings from Ameritech.    

     On August 11, 1993, the Company issued $150.0 of 6-3/4% debentures due 
     August 15, 2024.  The proceeds from the sale, along with short-term 
     borrowings, were used to retire $100.0 of 8-1/4% debentures due 
     November 15, 2016 and $100.0 of 8% debentures due January 1, 2014.  The 
     Company has filed a registration statement with the Securities and 
     Exchange Commission for the issuance of up to $200.0 in unsecured debt 
     securities for general corporate purposes.  

     Early extinguishment of debt costs (including call premiums and 
     write-offs of unamortized deferred costs) were $9.0, $8.0 and $0.0 in 
     1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and were included in other expense 
     (income) on the statements of income.  
 
(F)  LEASE COMMITMENTS - The Company leases certain facilities and equipment 
     used in its operations under both operating and capital leases.  Rental 
     expense under operating leases was $14.1, $14.7 and $19.3 for 1993, 1992 
     and 1991, respectively.  At December 31, 1993 the aggregate minimum 
     rental commitments under noncancelable leases were approximately as 
     follows:

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair 
     value of financial instruments:  

     Cash and Temporary Cash Investments - Carrying value approximates fair 
     value because of short-term maturity of these instruments.  

     Debt - The carrying amount (including accrued interest) of the Company's 
     debt maturing within one year approximates fair value because of the 
     short-term maturities involved.  The fair value of the Company's 
     long-term debt was estimated based on the year-end quoted market price 
     for the same or similar issues.  

     Other Assets and Liabilities - These financial instruments consist 
     primarily of other investments, other accrued liabilities and customer 
     deposits.  The fair values of these items was based on expected cash 
     flows or, if available, quoted market prices.  

     Long-Term Payable to ASI (For Postretirement Benefits) - This item 
     represents the long-term payable to ASI for the Company's proportional 
     share of ASI's transition benefit obligation related to the adoption of 
     SFAS No. 106.

     The fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992 were affected by several income and 
     expense items.  The fourth quarter of 1993 was affected by gains from a 
     workforce resizing and charges for the early retirement of debt.  In the 
     1992 quarter, the Company recognized higher costs and charges resulting 
     from its market realignment efforts, the early retirement of debt, and 
     increased advertising.  These costs were offset by gains resulting from 
     workforce resizing and higher than expected pension credits.  

     First quarter 1992 results reflect charges related to the adoption of 
     SFAS Nos. 106 and 112 for postretirement and postemployment benefits, as 
     discussed previously in Note C.  The charges totaled $151.8.  

     All adjustments necessary for a fair statement of results for each period 
     have been included.  

(J)  CALCULATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES  

     The ratio of earnings to fixed charges of the Company for the years ended 
     December 31, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990 and 1989 were 6.78, 4.70, 4.31, 4.57 
     and 4.00, respectively.  

     For the purpose of calculating this ratio, (i) earnings have been 
     calculated by adding to income before interest expense and accounting 
     changes, the amount of related taxes on income and the portion of rentals 
     representative of the interest factor, (ii) the Company considers 
     one-third of rental expense to be the amount representing return on 
     capital, and (iii) fixed charges comprise total interest expense and such 
     portion of rentals.  

(K)  EVENT SUBSEQUENT TO DATE OF AUDITORS' REPORT - (UNAUDITED)

     On March 25, 1994, Ameritech announced it would reduce its nonmanagement 
     workforce resulting in an after-tax charge to the Company of $31.7.  The 
     charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 1994.  The details of 
     this plan are discussed on page 22 in MD&A.
