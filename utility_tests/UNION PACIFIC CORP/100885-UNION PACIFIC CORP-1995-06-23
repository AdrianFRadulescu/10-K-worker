 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 ----------------------------
 
 
 Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan:
 
 
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
 benefits of Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan (the "Plan") as of December
 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of changes in net assets
 available for benefits for the years then ended.  These financial statements
 are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to
 express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
 obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
 of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
 An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
 significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
 financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
 reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
 In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
 respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
 1994 and 1993, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
 years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
 Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
 financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental information by fund
 in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of
 changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for the purpose of
 additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available for
 benefits and changes in net assets available for benefits of the individual
 funds.  The supplemental information by fund is the responsibility of the
 Plan's management.  Such Supplemental Information by fund has been subjected
 to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial
 statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects when
 considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
 
 1. Description of Plan
    -------------------
 The following description of the Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan (the
 "Plan") provides only general information.  Participants should refer to the
 Plan document for a more complete description of the Plan's provisions.
 
 General - The Plan was adopted in October 1973 by the Board of Directors of
 Union Pacific Corporation (the "Company") and approved by its stockholders in
 May 1974.  Under the terms of the Plan, non-agreement employees generally
 become eligible to participate in the Plan after completing twelve months
 continuous service and working at least 1,000 hours.  Effective July 1, 1992,
 the Plan added the following four investment options:  the Vanguard/Wellington
 Fund ("Wellington"), Vanguard U.S. Growth Portfolio ("U.S. Growth"), Vanguard
 International Growth Portfolio (International Growth"), and the Total Bond
 Market ("Bond Index").
 
 Contributions - The Company contributes to the Plan on behalf of each
 participant an amount equal to 50% of the participant's contribution with such
 Company contribution limited to 3% of the participant's base salary.  The Plan
 meets the requirements of section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which
 (I) permits certain employee contributions to be withheld on a "salary
 deferral" basis, so that amounts deducted will not be included in the
 employee's income for Federal income tax purposes, (ii) allows employees to
 contribute up to 16% of their salary to the Plan, (iii) provides for payroll
 based employee stock ownership plan contributions ("PAYSOP"), and (iv) makes
 various other changes intended to give participants greater control and
 flexibility with respect to Plan investments. 
 
 Loans to Participants - In June 1985, the loan provisions of the Plan were
 approved by the Internal Revenue Service and became effective.  The amount of
 a loan is limited to one-half of the vested value of a participant's accounts,
 excluding PAYSOP and subject to a minimum and maximum loan amount as well as
 limitations based on salary level.  As the loan is repaid, all principal and
 interest payments will be credited to the participant's accounts, excluding
 PAYSOP, in the same proportions as the contributions then being made on behalf
 of the participant.  If no contributions are then being made, the loan
 repayments will be invested in accordance with the participant's most recent
 investment election, unless he or she directs otherwise to the extent
 permitted by the Plan.  Participants' loans, which are secured by the
 participants' individual account balances, bear a fixed rate of interest set
 by the Plan Administrator based on  interest  rates  then being  charged  on 
 similar loans, and are repayable over periods not exceeding five years, except
 loans relating to a principal residence, in which case the term of the loan
 shall not exceed fifteen years.   The loans bear interest ranging from 5.5%
 to 10.5%.  The number of loans outstanding at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was
 1,951 and 1,824, respectively.

                 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

 Participant Accounts - Aggregate monthly employee and Company contributions,
 may be invested entirely in the Company Stock Fund (Company Stock), Equity
 Index Fund (Equity Index), Fixed Income Fund (Fixed Income), Wellington, 
 U.S. Growth, International Growth, or the Bond Index or any combination 
 thereof, in multiples of 5% in accordance with separate elections by each 
 employee.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, 5,290 and 5,319 members of the 
 Plan held interests in 4,815 and 4,816 Company Stock accounts, 2,589 and 
 2,727 Equity Index accounts, 2,820 and 3,107 Fixed Income accounts, 999 
 and 732 Wellington accounts, 514 and 345 U.S. Growth accounts, 1,072 
 and 659 International Growth accounts, and 359 and 321 Bond Index accounts, 
 respectively.  In addition, 3,452 and 3,526 members held interests in PAYSOP 
 accounts at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
 Participants' Plan accounts are maintained on a unit basis.  Under this
 method, an employee's account value is expressed in units of participation,
 representing an undivided interest in the underlying assets and income of the
 Fund.  The purchase or redemption price of the units is determined daily by
 the Trustee, based on the current market values, or contract value in the case
 of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs), of the underlying assets of the
 Fund.  The number of units at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the unit values
 at the end of each quarter within the year then ended were as follows:

 Vesting - Vesting is based exclusively upon years of service.  Participants
 at all times have a 100% vested interest in their voluntary contributions plus
 actual earnings thereon and their PAYSOP account.  A participant's vested
 interest in the portion of his/her account derived from Company contributions
 increases 25% every year, after two years of credited service, to 100% vested
 after five years of credited service.  A participant's interest in the
 Company's contributions will also become 100% vested if while employed by the
 Company, the participant reaches age 65, dies, or sustains a total and
 permanent disability.
 
 Payment of Benefits - A participant may elect to receive a final distribution
 under the Plan as either a cash lump sum distribution, or in monthly
 installments over a specified period of time not to exceed the lesser of ten
 calendar years or the life expectancy of the participant or the joint life
 expectancy of the participant and his/her beneficiary as prescribed in the
 Treasury Regulations.  Final distributions of PAYSOP accounts must be lump sum
 distributions.  For benefit payments equal to or less than $3,500, the Plan
 Administrator may direct the Trustee to make a lump sum payment to the
 participant or beneficiary.  A participant has the option to receive the value
 of his/her PAYSOP account and the portion of his/her account invested in the
 Company Stock Fund in cash or in shares of such Company stock; in-kind
 distributions will be lump sum and any fractional shares will be distributed
 in cash. 
 
 A withdrawal may be made by a participant from his/her account in accordance
 with the Plan's provisions.

 Forfeitures - When certain terminations of participation in the Plan occur,
 the nonvested portion of a participant's account, as defined by the Plan,
 represents a potential forfeiture.  Such potential forfeitures reduce
 subsequent Company contributions to the Plan.  However, if upon reemployment
 the former participant  fulfills certain requirements as defined in the Plan,
 the previously forfeited nonvested  portion of the participant's  account  may
 be  restored  through Company contributions.
 
 Amounts summarized below represent Company contributions forfeited for the
 years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993:

 Administrative Expenses - All costs of Plan administration are borne by the
 Company.
 
 2. Significant Accounting Policies - The accounts of the Plan have been
 prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The
 financial statements were prepared in accordance with the financial reporting
 requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as
 permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's amendments to Form 11-K
 adopted during 1990.
 
 Investments are valued utilizing closing prices except for the investment in
 the GICs, which is valued at cost plus reinvested interest.  Dividend income
 is recorded as of the ex-dividend date.  Security transactions are recorded
 as of the trade date.
 
 3. Investments - At December 31, 1994 and 1993 Plan investments were
 maintained in commingled funds of the Plan Trustees along with investments of
 another Company-administered Thrift Plan, within Master Trusts.  Assets,
 liabilities, investment income, and security gains and losses are allocated
 monthly to the Plan based on its equity in the investments of the Master
 Trusts.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Plan held percentage interests in
 the Master Trusts of 84.5 and 83.5 in Company Stock (including PAYSOP), 64.9
 and 66.0 in Equity Index, 61.0 and 64.1 in Fixed Income, 77.5 and 77.6 in the
 Loan Fund, 74.4 and 80.8 in Wellington, 73.9 and 77.7 in U.S. Growth, 74.5 and
 77.6 in International Growth, and 64.2 and 72.4 in Bond Index.
 
 The Plan provides for separate funds for the investment of contributions. 
 Participants may designate into which fund or funds their contributions and
 the Company matching contributions are to be directed within specific limits. 
 At December 31, 1994 and 1993, Company Stock and PAYSOP are invested primarily
 in Union Pacific Common Stock.  Equity Index is invested in the Vanguard Index
 Trust 500 Portfolio Fund at December 31, 1994 and 1993, which is designed to
 closely track the investment performance of the Standard and Poor's 500
 Composite Stock Index. At December 31, 1994 and 1993, Fixed Income is
 comprised of investments in GICs bearing interest at 6.92% to 9.50% and 8.90%
 to 9.65%, respectively.  GICs are held with insurance companies rated at least
 A-1 by Standard & Poors.  The maturities of these GICs are generally not
 longer than five years and their principal and interest are unconditionally
 guaranteed by the respective insurance companies.  At December 31, 1994 and
 1993, Fixed Income is also comprised of the Vanguard Fixed Income Securities
 Fund Short-Term Corporate Portfolio which  is  composed of Class A corporate
 bonds.  As the GICs expire, the proceeds will be reinvested by Vanguard in new

                 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

 GICs, Bank Investment Contracts, or the Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund
 Short-Term Corporate Portfolio.  Wellington is invested in the
 Vanguard/Wellington Fund at December 31, 1994, which is composed of common
 stocks and fixed-income securities.  At December 31, 1994, U.S. Growth is
 invested in Vanguard U.S. Growth Portfolio which is composed of established
 U.S. growth stocks.  International Growth is invested in the Vanguard
 International Growth Portfolio at December 31, 1994, which is composed of
 foreign common stocks with high growth potential.  At December 31, 1994, Bond
 Index is invested in the Vanguard Bond Index Fund which is designed to closely
 track the investment performance of the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment-Grade
 Bond Index.
 
 4. Plan Amendments - Effective August 1, 1994, the Plan was amended to allow
 each Participant to make daily elections to change his/her investment
 elections, transfer all or a portion of his/her interest in any Investment
 Fund, and/or elect to increase, reduce or totally suspend contributions being
 made.  Effective April 1, 1993, the Plan was amended to provide that the
 account of a participant who cannot be located is forfeited and used to reduce
 Company match contributions to the Plan, pending reinstatement upon location. 
 The Plan was amended and restated to reflect changes in the law, including
 those resulting from the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  These amendments were
 approved by the Named Fiduciary - Plan Investments pursuant to a delegation
 of authority from the Company's Board of Directors.  
 
 5. Federal Income Taxes - The Company has received a letter of determination
 from the Internal Revenue Service dated April 18, 1995, and the Plan
 Administrator and the Plan's tax counsel believe that the Plan is currently
 designed and being operated in compliance with section 401(a) of the Internal
 Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
 Inasmuch as it is the opinion of Management that the Plan is qualified,
 employees participating in the Plan are not taxed on Company contributions
 made on their behalf, on employee contributions made on a pre-tax basis, on
 earnings on such Company contributions or pre-tax employee contributions, or
 on earnings on after-tax employee contributions, until any such amounts are
 distributed.  In addition, no provision for Federal income taxes has been made
 in the financial statements. 
 
 6.   Plan Termination - Although the Plan is intended to be continued by the
 Company, the Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.  In
 the event of a Plan termination or partial termination, or the Company
 permanently ceases to make contributions, all invested amounts shall
 immediately vest and be nonforfeitable.  All funds shall continue to be held
 for distribution as provided in the Plan.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Union Pacific Fruit Express Company
  Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the Union Pacific Fruit Express Company Agreement Employee 401(k)
Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1994 and 1993 and the
related statements of changes in net assets available for benefits for the
year ended December 31, 1994 and the period August 1, 1993 (Date of Inception)
through December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1994 and 1993 and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
year ended December 31, 1994 and the period August 1, 1993 (Date of Inception)
through December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed in
the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  The supplemental information by Fund in the statements
of net assets available for benefits and the statements of changes in net
assets available for benefits is presented for purposes of additional analysis
rather than to present the net assets available for benefits and changes in
net assets available for benefits of the individual funds.  Such supplemental
schedules and supplemental information by fund have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

 General - The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering employees of the

 employment the terms of which are governed by a collective bargaining
 agreement entered into between the Company and a Union, to which
 eligibility to participate in the Plan has been extended, and have
 completed one year of service or were employees as of the effective date of
 the Plan, August 1, 1993.  It is subject to the provisions of the Employee
 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended.
 
 Contributions - Participants may contribute 2% to 8% of their compensation
 on a salary deferral basis subject to limitations specified in the Internal
 Revenue Code.  The Company does not contribute to the Plan.
 
 Participant Accounts - Each participant account is credited with the
 participant's contributions and allocations of the Plan's earnings. 
 Allocations are based on participant account balances.
 
 Vesting - Participants are at all times 100% vested in the value of their
 account.
 
 Payment of Benefits - Distribution of benefits shall be in a lump sum no
 later than 60 days following the close of the plan year in which the
 participant's termination of employment occurs, subject to certain
 mandatory pay-outs to participants who have attained age 70-1/2, but have
 not yet terminated employment.
 
 
 2.   Significant Accounting Policies

 accepted accounting principles.  The financial statements were prepared in
 accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the Employee
 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as permitted by the Securities and
 Exchange Commission's amendments to Form 11-K adopted during 1990.

 4.   Plan Administration
      -------------------
     
 The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of
 Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration of
 the Plan are paid by the Company.
 
 
 5.   Tax Status
      ----------
 
 During 1994, the Company submitted an application to the Internal Revenue
 Service for a determination letter that the Plan meets the requirements for
 qualification under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). 
 Subject to any amendments to the Plan required by the IRS as a condition to
 issuing a favorable determination letter, the Company believes that the
 Plan is being operated in accordance with the requirements for
 qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and that, as a result, the
 related trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. 
 Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been included in the Plan's
 financial statements.
 
 
 6.   Plan Termination
      ----------------
 
 Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
 right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the
 provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and income
 of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's participants
 and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee either to distribute
 the Plan's assets to the participants, or to continue the Trust and
 distribute benefits as though the Plan had not been terminated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
 Skyway Retirement Savings Plan:
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
 benefits of the Skyway Retirement Savings Plan (the Plan) of December 31,
 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of changes in net assets
 available for benefits for the years then ended.  These financial
 statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
 on our audits.
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
 obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
 of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
 statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
 used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
 the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
 provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
 In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
 respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December
 31, 1994 and 1993, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for
 the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
 principles.
 
 Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
 basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The accompanying supplemental
 schedules of assets held for investment as of December 31, 1994 and
 reportable Plan transactions for the year ended December 31, 1994 are
 presented for the purpose of additional analysis and are not a required
 part of the basic financial statements, but are supplementary information
 required by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting
 and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
 These schedules are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Such
 supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures
 applied in our audit of the basic 1994 financial statements and, in our
 opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when considered in
 relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

SKYWAY RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994 AND 1993

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

  The following description of the Skyway Retirement Savings Plan (the Plan)
  provides only general information.  Participants should refer to the Plan
  agreement and amendments for a more complete description of the Plan's
  provisions.

  General - The Plan, established January 1983 by Skyway Freight Systems, 
  Inc. (the Company), is a defined contribution plan covering all full-time 
  employees who have completed one year and 1,000 hours of service.  The Plan 
  is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
  of 1974 (ERISA).  Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company (Vanguard) currently 
  serves as Trustee of the Plan.

  Contributions - Participants may elect to make tax deferred contributions 
  of up to 10% of their compensation (subject to certain Internal Revenue Code
  limitations).  Rollover contributions from a participant's former qualified 
  plan or individual retirement account are also allowed.

  Employer contributions are determined at the discretion of the Company's 
  Board of Directors and may consist of the following:

      - Matching - For the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company
        contributed an amount equal to 25% and 10% of participant's 
        contributions, respectively.  Forfeit the Company and may be used in 
        the following year as a portion of the matching contribution.

      - Profit-sharing - No profit-sharing contributions were made for the years
        ended December 31, 1994 and 1993.  Forfeited contribution amounts are
        added to the profit-sharing contribution to be allocated to the
        participants.  The profit-sharing component of the Plan was eliminated
        effective January 1, 1995.

 Participant Accounts - Each participant's account is credited with the
 participant's contributions and an allocation of (a) the Company's 
 contributions, (b) Plan earnings, and (c) forfeitures of profit-sharing 
 contributions of terminated participants' nonvested amounts.  Allocations 
 are based on participants' contributions, compensation or account balances, 
 as defined in the Plan.

 Vesting - Participants are immediately vested as to participant contributions 
 and earnings thereon.  Vesting in the remainder of their accounts is based on 
 years of continuous employment.  Participants are fully vested after seven 
 years of employment, attainment of age 65, or if employment is terminated by 
 disability or death, regardless of years of service.  Upon employee 
 termination, all nonvested amounts will be forfeited.

 Investment Options - Beginning March 1, 1994, participants were allowed to 
 direct the investment of their accounts in any of the following six investment 
 options:

   Vanguard Investment Contract Trust - Funds are invested in contracts issued
   by insurance companies and banks, and in similar types of fixed income
   investments.

<PAGE> F-6

   Vanguard Windsor II - Funds are invested with a growth and income objective
   in common stocks.

   Vanguard International Growth Portfolio - Funds are invested in potential
   growth companies based outside of the United States.

   Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio - Funds are invested in all of the stocks
   included in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

   Union Pacific Company Stock Fund - Funds are invested in common stock of
   Union Pacific Corporation.

   Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund - Funds are invested in corporate bonds.

 Investment decisions may be changed on a daily basis.

 Payment of Benefits - On termination of employment or attainment of age 65,
 whichever is later, a participant may elect to receive his/her benefit in one 
 of the following forms: (1) a lump-sum amount equal to the value of the vested
 portion of his/her account; (2) installments, payable at least annually over a
 period of years determined by the Plan's Administrative Committee; (3) a
 nontransferable annuity contract providing for a monthly guaranteed income for 
 a specified number of years; or (4) a combination of the above.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 Basis of Accounting - The financial statements of the Plan are prepared under 
 the accrual method of accounting.

 Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments with an original
 maturity of 90 days or less.

 Payment of Benefits - Benefits are recorded when paid.

 Investments are stated at fair value as determined by quoted market prices 
 except for the Vanguard Investment Contract Trust, which is stated at contract 
 value, and participant loans, which are stated at face value.

 Administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company.

 Income Taxes - A favorable determination letter has been received from the
 Internal Revenue Service as to the qualified status of the Plan as amended
 through December 15, 1994.  Therefore, management believes the Plan was 
 qualified and tax-exempt as of and for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 
 1993.  Accordingly, no provision for Federal or state income taxes has been 
 made.

3. PARTICIPANT LOANS

 The Plan permits participants to borrow against the lesser of 50% of the vested
 portion of their account balance, or 100% of their before-tax contribution
 amount, to a maximum of $50,000.  The loans bear interest at 7.5% and are 
 payable over a maximum five-year period.  Loan repayment generally is made 
 through payroll deductions.  

4. PLAN TERMINATION

 Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the right
 under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate 
 the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.  In the event of Plan termination,
 participants would become fully vested.

5. ASSETS OF TERMINATED EMPLOYEES

 At December 31, 1994 and 1993, $142,598 and $108,943, respectively, of Plan
 assets were payable to terminated employees who have withdrawn from 
 participation in the Plan.

6. FUND INFORMATION

 Prior to 1994, the Plan's net assets were invested in common stocks and 
 corporate and government debt securities.  During the latter part of 1993, 
 such investments were converted to cash and equivalents.  Beginning in 1994, 
 participants were allowed to direct the investment of their accounts among six 
 different funds (see Note 1).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
 
 Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k)
   Retirement Thrift Plan:
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
 benefits of the Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift
 Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
 statements of changes in net assets available for benefits for the years
 then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
 Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
 financial statements based on our audits.
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
 standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
 obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
 of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
 statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
 used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
 the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
 provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
 In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
 respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December
 31, 1994 and 1993, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for
 the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
 principles.
 
 Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
 basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules
 listed in the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional
 analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements but
 are supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules
 and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement
 Income Security Act of 1974.  The supplemental information by fund in the
 statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of
 changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for purposes of
 additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available for
 benefits and changes in the net assets available for benefits of such
 supplemental schedules and supplemental information by fund have been
 subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
 financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material
 respects when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
 taken as a whole.

 1.   Description of Plan
      -------------------
 
 The following description of the Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k)
 Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) provides only general information. 
 Participants should refer to the Plan document for a more complete
 description of the Plan's provisions.
 
 General - The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering employees of the
 Union Pacific Railroad Company and its Railroad affiliates (the Company)
 who are represented for the purposes of collective bargaining by a rail
 union, to which eligibility to participate in the Plan has been extended. 
 The Plan covers employees who have completed one year of service or were
 employees as of the effective date of the Plan, July 1, 1990.  It is
 subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
 1974 (ERISA), as amended.
 
 Contributions - Participants may contribute 2% to 8% of their compensation
 on a salary deferral basis subject to limitations specified in the Internal
 Revenue Code.  The Company does not contribute to the Plan.
 
 Participant Accounts - Each participant's account is credited with the
 participant's contributions and an allocation of the Plan's earnings. 
 Allocations are based on participant account balances.
 
 Vesting - Participants are at all times 100% vested in the value of their
 account.
 
 Payment of Benefits - Distribution of benefits shall be in a lump sum no
 later than 60 days following the close of the plan year in which the
 participant's termination of employment occurs, subject to certain
 mandatory pay-outs to participants who have attained age 70-1/2, but have
 not yet terminated employment.
 
 
 2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 accepted accounting principles.  The financial statements were prepared in
 accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the Employee
 Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as permitted by the Securities and
 Exchange Commission's amendments to Form 11-K adopted during 1990.

</TABLE>
  
 4.   Plan Administration
      -------------------             
 
 The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of
 Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration of
 the Plan are paid by the Company.
 
 
 5.   Tax Status
      ----------                      
 
 During 1994 the Company submitted an application to the Internal Revenue
 Service for a determination letter that the Plan meets the requirements for
 qualification under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). 
 Subject to any amendments to the Plan required by the IRS as a condition to
 issuing a favorable determination letter, the Company believes that the
 Plan is being operated in accordance with the requirements for
 qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and that, as a result, the
 related trust is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. 
 Therefore, no provision for income taxes has been included in the Plan's
 financial statements.
 
 
 6.   Plan Termination
      ----------------
 
 Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
 right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the
 provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and income
 of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's participants
 and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee either to distribute
 the Plan's assets to the participants, or to continue the Trust and
 distribute benefits as though the Plan had not been terminated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Union Pacific Motor Freight Company Agreement
  Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets available for
benefits of the Union Pacific Motor Freight Company Agreement Employee 401(k)
Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1994, and the related
statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the period
January 1, 1994 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 1994.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1994 and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the period
January 1, 1994 (Date of Inception) through December 31, 1994 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed in
the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  The supplemental information by fund in the statement
of net assets available for benefits and the statement of changes in net
assets available for benefits is presented for purposes of additional analysis
rather than to present the net assets available for benefits and changes in
net assets available for benefits of the individual funds.  The supplemental
schedules and supplemental information by fund have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

</TABLE>
  
 4.   Plan Administration
      -------------------
     
 The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of
 Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration of
 the Plan are paid by the Company.
 
 
 5.   Tax Status
      ----------
 
 The Plan obtained a tax determination letter dated September 16, 1994, in
 which the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Plan, as then designed
 was incompliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue
 Code.  The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter.
 However, Plan management believes that the Plan currently is being operated
 in compliance with the applicable requirement of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Therefore, it is believed that the Plan qualified and the related trust was
 tax-exempt under provisions of Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
 as of the financial statement date.  Therefore, no provision for income
 taxes has been included in the Plan's financial statements.
 
 
 6.   Plan Termination
      ----------------
 
 Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
 right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the
 provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and income
 of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's participants
 and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee either to distribute
 the Plan's assets to the participants, or to continue the Trust and
 distribute benefits as though the Plan had not been terminated.
