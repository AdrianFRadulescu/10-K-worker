INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan (the "Plan") as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of changes in net
assets available for benefits for the years then ended.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.  DESCRIPTION OF PLAN

    The following description of the Union Pacific Corporation Thrift Plan
    (the "Plan") provides only general information.  Participants should 
    refer to the Plan document for a more complete description of the 
    Plan's provisions.

    General - The Plan was adopted in October 1973 by the Board of Directors 
    of Union Pacific Corporation (the "Company") and approved by its 
    stockholders in May 1974.  Under the terms of the Plan, non-agreement
    employees generally become eligible to participate in the Plan after 
    completing twelve months continuous service and working at least 
    1,000 hours.  Effective November 1, 1995, the Vanguard Money Market 
    Reserves-Prime Portfolio (VMMR Prime Portfolio) was added as an 
    additional investment option.

    Contributions - The Company contributes to the Plan on behalf of each
    participant an amount equal to 50% of the participant's contribution with 
    such Company contribution limited to 3% of the participant's base salary.  
    The Plan meets the requirements of section 401(k) of the Internal 
    Revenue Code, which (i) permits certain employee contributions to be 
    withheld on a "salary deferral" basis, so that amounts deducted will not 
    be included in the employee's income for Federal income tax purposes, (ii) 
    allows employees to contribute up to 16% of their salary to the Plan, 
    (iii) provides for payroll based employee stock ownership plan  
    contributions ("PAYSOP"), and (iv) makes various other changes intended  
    to give participants greater control and flexibility with respect to Plan 
    investments.

    Loans to Participants - In June 1985, the loan provisions of the Plan were
    approved by the Internal Revenue Service and became effective.  The 
    amount of a loan is limited to one-half of the vested value of a 
    participant's accounts, excluding PAYSOP, and subject to a minimum and 
    maximum loan amount as well as limitations based on salary level.  As 
    the loan is repaid, all principal and interest payments will be credited 
    to the participant's accounts, excluding PAYSOP, in the same proportions 
    as the contributions then being made on behalf of the participant.  If no 
    contributions are then being made, the loan repayments will be invested
    in accordance with the participant's most recent investment election,
    unless he or she directs otherwise to the extent permitted by the Plan.
    Participants' loans, which are secured by the participants' individual 
    account balances, bear a fixed rate of interest set by the Plan 
    Administrator based on interest rates then being charged on
    similar loans, and are repayable over periods not exceeding five years, 
    except loans relating to a principal residence, in which case the 
    term of the loan shall not exceed fifteen years.  The loans bear interest 
    ranging from 6.0% to 10.5%.  The number of loans outstanding at 
    December 31, 1995 and 1994 was 1,797 and 1,951, respectively.

                   UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION THRIFT PLAN
                                
                NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


    Participant Accounts - Aggregate monthly employee and Company contributions
    may be invested entirely in the Union Pacific Company Stock Fund (Company
    Stock), Union Pacific Equity Index Fund (Equity Index), Union Pacific Fixed
    Income Fund (Fixed Income), Vanguard/Wellington Fund (Wellington), 
    Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund (U.S. Growth), VMMR Prime Portfolio, Vanguard 
    International Growth Portfolio (International Growth), Vanguard Total 
    Bond Market Fund (Bond Index) or any combination thereof, in multiples of 
    5% in accordance with separate elections by each employee.  At December 
    31, 1995 and 1994, 5,265 and 5,290 members of the Plan held interests in 
    4,725 and 4,815 Company Stock accounts, 2,614 and 2,589 Equity Index 
    accounts, 2,676 and 2,820 Fixed Income accounts, 1,302 and 999 Wellington
    accounts, 925 and 514 U.S. Growth accounts, 9 and zero VMMR Prime 
    Portfolio accounts, 1,106 and 1,072 International Growth accounts, and 
    440 and 359 Bond Index accounts, respectively.  In addition, 3,337 and 
    3,452 members held interests in PAYSOP accounts at December 31, 1995
    and 1994, respectively.

    Participants' Plan accounts are maintained on a unit basis.  Under this
    method, an employee's account value is expressed in units of participation,
    representing an undivided interest in the underlying assets and income 
    of the Fund.  The purchase or redemption price of the units is 
    determined daily by the Trustee, based on the current market values, 
    or contract values in the case of Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs), 
    of the underlying assets of the Fund.   

    Vesting - Vesting is based exclusively upon years of service.  
    Participants at all times have a 100% vested interest in their voluntary 
    contributions plus actual earnings thereon and their PAYSOP account.  A 
    participant's vested interest in the portion of his/her account derived
    from Company contributions increases 25% every year, after two years of 
    credited service, to 100% vested after five years of credited service.  A 
    participant's interest in the Company's contributions will also become 
    100% vested if, while employed by the Company, the participant reaches 
    age 65, dies, or sustains a total and permanent disability.

    Payment of Benefits - Except for PAYSOP accounts, a participant may elect 
    to receive a final distribution under the Plan as either a cash lump sum
    distribution or monthly installments over a specified period of time not
    to exceed the lesser of ten calendar years, the life expectancy of the
    participant or the joint life expectancy of the participant and his/her
    beneficiary as prescribed in the Treasury Regulations.  Final 
    distributions of PAYSOP accounts must be lump sum distributions.  For
    benefit payments equal to or less than $3,500, the Plan Administrator
    may direct the Trustee to make a lump sum payment to the participant or
    beneficiary.  A participant has the option to receive the value of 
    his/her PAYSOP account and the portion of his/her account invested in 
    the Company Stock Fund in cash or in shares of such Company stock; 
    in-kind distributions will be lump sum and any fractional shares will be
    distributed in cash.

    A withdrawal may be made by a participant from his/her account in 
    accordance with the Plan's provisions.

                NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


    Forfeitures - When certain terminations of participation in the Plan occur,
    the nonvested portion of a participant's account, as defined by the Plan,
    represents a potential forfeiture.  Such potential forfeitures reduce
    subsequent Company contributions to the Plan.  However, if upon 
    reemployment the former participant fulfills certain requirements as 
    defined in the Plan, the previously forfeited nonvested portion of the 
    participant's account may be restored through Company contributions.

    Amounts summarized below represent Company contributions forfeited for the
    years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994:

</TABLE>

    Administrative Expenses - All costs of Plan administration are borne by the
    Company.

2.  Significant Accounting Policies - The accounts of the Plan have been
    maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
    The financial statements were prepared in accordance with the financial 
    reporting requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
    of 1974 as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's 
    amendments to Form 11-K adopted during 1990.  

    Investments are valued utilizing closing prices except for the investment 
    in the GICs, which is valued at cost plus reinvested interest.  Dividend
    income is recorded as of the ex-dividend date.  Security transactions are 
    recorded as of the trade date.

    Certain 1994 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1995 
    financial statement presentation.

3.  Investments - At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Plan investments were
    maintained in commingled funds of the Plan Trustee along with investments 
    of another Company-administered Thrift Plan, within a Master Trust.  
    Assets, liabilities, investment income, and security gains and losses 
    are allocated monthly to the Plan based on its equity in the investments
    of the Master Trust.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Plan held 
    percentage interests in the Master Trust of 82.9 and 84.5 in Company 
    Stock (including PAYSOP), 66.2 and 64.9 in Equity Index, 65.8 and 61.0 
    in Fixed Income, 77.7 and 77.5 in the Loan Fund, 74.0 and 74.4 in 
    Wellington, 71.9 and 73.9 in U.S. Growth, 33.3 and 0.0 in the VMMR Prime
    Portfolio, 75.6 and 74.5 in International Growth, and 70.2 and 64.2 in 
    Bond Index.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

    At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the total investments at fair value of the
    Master Trust were $526,488,315 and $395,595,127, respectively.  In 
    addition, total net appreciation (depreciation) in fair value of 
    investments and total interest and dividends of the Master Trust were
    $95,247,372 and ($48,929,825) and $21,156,851 and $17,727,550, 
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994. 

    The Plan provides for separate funds for the investment of contributions. 
    Participants may designate into which fund or funds their contributions and
    the Company matching contributions are to be directed within specific 
    limits.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Company Stock and PAYSOP are 
    invested primarily in Union Pacific Common Stock.  Equity Index is  
    invested in the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio Fund at December 31,  
    1995 and 1994, which is designed to closely track the investment perform- 
    ance of the Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index. At December 31,
    1995 and 1994, Fixed Income is comprised of investments in GICs bearing 
    interest at 5.94% to 7.85% and 6.92% to 9.50%, respectively. Interest rates
    are fixed for the life of each contract.  GICs are held with
    insurance companies rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poors.  
    The maturities of these GICs range from two to five years 
    and their principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by 
    the respective insurance companies.  The fair value of the GICs 
    approximates their contract value.   At December 31, 1995 and 1994,
    Fixed Income is also comprised of the Vanguard Investment Contract
    Trust, which is comprised of contracts issued by financial institutions and
    backed by high quality bonds and bond mutual funds.  As the GICs expire, 
    the proceeds will be reinvested in the Vanguard Investment Contract Trust. 
    Wellington is invested in the Vanguard/Wellington Fund at December 31, 
    1995 and 1994, which is comprised of common stocks and fixed-income 
    securities.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, U.S. Growth is invested in 
    Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund which is comprised of established U.S. growth 
    stocks.  International Growth is invested in the Vanguard International 
    Growth Portfolio at December 31, 1995 and 1994, which is comprised of 
    foreign common stocks with high growth potential.  At December 31, 1995 
    and 1994, Bond Index is invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market   
    Fund which is designed to closely track the investment performance 
    of the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index.  At 
    December 31, 1995, VMMR Prime Portfolio is a diversified money market 
    investment fund invested and reinvested in high quality certificates of 
    deposit, bankers' acceptances, commercial paper, U.S. government 
    securities, and other short-term obligations with the objective of 
    preserving principal while providing income.

4.  Plan Amendments - Effective December 31, 1995, the Plan was amended to
    provide that service with Chicago and North Western Transportation 
    Company or an affiliated company (CNW) counts as service under the
    Plan to the same extent that such service counted under the Chicago 
    and North Western Railway Company Profit Sharing and Retirement Savings 
    Program (the "Savings Program") subject to any reduction for such CNW 
    service provided in the Savings Program.  Effective January 1, 1996, 
    as of any valuation date, each participant shall have the right to 
    withdraw from the Plan all or a part of the amount from a
    Type A, B or C withdrawal as defined by the Plan, provided that the
    participant has not withdrawn any amount within the twelve-month period
    preceding such valuation date.

                NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


    Effective November 1, 1995, the VMMR Prime Portfolio was added as one of   
    the investment alternatives under the Plan.  Effective June 15, 1995, 
    plan participants who were employees of USPCI, Inc. or its subsidiaries 
    were treated as having a separation from service due to the Company's
    sale of USPCI, Inc. 

    For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, only the first 
    $150,000 (as adjusted) of an employee's salary would be considered for 
    contributions under the Plan. 

5.  Federal Income Taxes - The Company has received a letter of determination
    from the Internal Revenue Service dated April 18, 1995, and the Plan
    Administrator and the Plan's tax counsel believe that the Plan, as
    subsequently amended, is currently designed and being operated in 
    compliance with section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
    as amended.

    Inasmuch as it is the opinion of Management that the Plan is qualified,
    employees participating in the Plan are not taxed on Company contributions
    made on their behalf, on employee contributions made on a pre-tax basis, on
    earnings on such Company contributions or pre-tax employee contributions, 
    or on earnings on after-tax employee contributions, until any such 
    amounts are distributed.  In addition, no provision for Federal income 
    taxes has been made in the financial statements. 

6.  Plan Termination - Although the Plan is intended to be continued by the
    Company, the Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan.  In
    the event of a Plan termination or partial termination, or the Company
    permanently ceases to make contributions, all invested amounts shall
    immediately vest and be nonforfeitable.  All funds shall continue to be 
    held for distribution as provided by the Plan.

7.  Fund Information - Investments at fair value, net appreciation 
    (depreciation) in fair value of investments, interest and dividends,
    contributions, and distributions to participants by fund are as follows 
    for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Union Pacific Fruit Express Company Agreement
  Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the Union Pacific Fruit Express Company Agreement Employee 401(k)
Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the
related statements of changes in net assets available for benefits for the
years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed in
the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  These schedules are the responsibility of the Plan's
management.  Such supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic 1995 financial statements and,
in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF PLAN

    The following description of the Union Pacific Fruit Express Company
    Agreement Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) provides only
    general information.  Participants should refer to the Plan document for a
    more complete description of the Plan's provisions.

    General - The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering employees of the
    Union Pacific Fruit Express Company (the Company) who are governed by a
    collective bargaining agreement entered into between the Company and a
    Union to which eligibility to participate in the plan has been extended,
    and have completed one year of service or were employees as of the
    effective date of the Plan, August 1, 1993.  It is subject to the
    provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
    as amended.

    Contributions - Participants may contribute 2% to 8% of their compensation
    on a salary deferral basis subject to limitations specified in the Internal
    Revenue Code.  The Company does not contribute to the Plan.

    Participant Accounts - Each participant account is credited with the
    participant's contributions and an allocation of the Plan's earnings. 
    Allocations are based on participant account balances.

    Vesting - Participants are at all times 100% vested in the value of their
    account.

    Payment of Benefits - Distribution of benefits shall be in a lump sum no
    later than 60 days following the close of the plan year in which the
    participant's termination of employment occurs, subject to certain
    mandatory pay-outs to participants who have attained age 70-1/2, but have
    not yet terminated employment.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Basis of Accounting - The accounts of the Plan have been prepared in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The financial
    statements were prepared in accordance with the financial reporting

    permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's amendments to Form
    11-K adopted during 1990.

4.  PLAN ADMINISTRATION

    The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of
    Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration of
    the Plan are paid by the Company.

5.  TAX STATUS

    The Plan obtained a tax determination letter dated July 27, 1995, in which
    the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Plan, as then designed, was in
    compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
    (the Code).  The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination
    letter.  However, Plan management believes that the Plan currently is being
    operated in compliance with the applicable requirement of the Internal
    Revenue Code.  Therefore, it is believed that the Plan was qualified and
    the related trust was tax-exempt under provisions of Section 501(a) of the
    Internal Revenue Code as of the financial statement date.  Therefore, no
    provision for income taxes has ben included in the Plan's financial
    statements.

6.  PLAN TERMINATION

    Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
    right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the
    provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and income
    of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's participants
    and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee either to distribute
    the Plan's assets to the participants, or to continue the Trust and
    distribute benefits as though the Plan had not been terminated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Administrative Committee of the
 Skyway Retirement Savings Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the Skyway Retirement Savings Plan (the Plan) as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the related statements of changes in net assets available
for benefits for the years then ended.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The accompanying supplemental schedules
of assets held for investment as of December 31, 1995 and reportable Plan
transactions for the year ended December 31, 1995 are presented for the purpose
of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial
statements, but are supplementary information required by the Department of
Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  These schedules are the responsibility
of the Plan's management.  Such supplemental schedules have been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in our audit of the basic 1995 financial
statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

SKYWAY RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN

   The following description of the Skyway Retirement Savings Plan (the Plan)
   provides only general information.  Participants should refer to the Plan
   agreement and amendments for a more complete description of the Plan's
   provisions.

   General - The Plan, established January 1983 by Skyway Freight Systems,
   Inc. (the Company), is a defined contribution plan covering all full-time
   employees who have completed one year and 1,000 hours of service.  The
   Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
   Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company (Vanguard)
   serves as trustee of the Plan.

   Contributions - Participants may elect to make tax deferred contributions
   of up to 10% of their compensation (subject to certain Internal Revenue
   Code limitations).  Rollover contributions from a participant's former
   qualified plan or individual retirement account are also allowed.

   Employer contributions are determined at the discretion of the Company's
   Board of Directors and may consist of the following:

      Matching - For the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company
      contributed an amount equal to 25% of participant's contributions. 
      Forfeited matching contributions revert to the Company and may be used
      in the following year as a portion of the matching contribution.

      Profit-Sharing - No profit-sharing contributions were made for the years
      ended December 31, 1995 and 1994.  Forfeited contribution amounts are
      added to the profit-sharing contribution to be allocated to the
      participants.  The profit-sharing component of the Plan was eliminated
      effective January 1, 1995.

   Participant Accounts - Each participant's account is credited with the
   participant's contributions and an allocation of (a) the Company's
   contributions, (b) Plan earnings, and (c) forfeitures of profit-sharing
   contributions of terminated participant's nonvested amounts.  Allocations
   are based on participants' contributions, compensation or account balances,
   as defined in the Plan.

   Vesting - Participants are immediately vested as to participant
   contributions and earnings thereon.  Vesting in the remainder of their
   accounts is based on years of continuous employment.  Participants are
   fully vested after seven years of employment, attainment of age 65, or if
   employment is terminated by disability or death, regardless of years of
   service.  Upon employee termination, all nonvested amounts will be
   forfeited.

   Investment Options - Participants may direct the investment of their
   accounts in any of the following six investments options:


      Vanguard Windsor II - Funds are invested with a growth and income
      objective in common stocks.

      Vanguard Investment Contract Trust - Funds are invested in contracts
      issued by insurance companies and banks, and in similar types of fixed
      income investments.

<PAGE> 5
      
      Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio - Funds are invested in all of the
      stocks included the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

      Vanguard International Growth Portfolio - Funds are invested in
      potential growth companies based outside of the United States.

      Union Pacific Company Stock Fund - Funds are invested in common stock of
      Union Pacific Corporation.

      Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund - Funds are invested in corporate bonds.

   Investment decisions may be changed on a daily basis.

   Payment of Benefits - On termination of employment or attainment of age 65,
   whichever is later, a participant may elect to receive the benefit in one
   of the following forms: (1) a lump-sum amount equal to the value of the
   vested portion of the participant's account; (2) installments, payable at
   least annually over a period of years determined by the Plan's
   Administrative Committee; (3) a nontransferable annuity contract providing
   for a monthly guaranteed income for a specified number of years; or (4) a
   combination of the above.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Basis of Accounting - The financial statements of the Plan are prepared
   under the accrual method of accounting.

   Payment of Benefits - Benefits are recorded when paid.

   Investments are stated at fair value as determined by quoted market prices
   except for the Vanguard Investment Contract Trust, which is stated at
   contract value, and participant loans, which are stated at face value.

   Administrative expenses of the Plan are paid by the Company.

   Income Taxes - A favorable determination letter has been received from the
   Internal Revenue Service as to the qualified status of the Plan as amended
   through December 15, 1994.  Therefore, management believes the Plan was
   qualified and tax-exempt as of and for the years ended December 31, 1995
   and 1994.  Accordingly, no provision for Federal or state income taxes has
   been made.

4. PARTICIPANT LOANS

   The Plan permits participants to borrow against the lesser of 50% of the
   vested portion of their account balance, or 100% of their before-tax
   contribution amount, to a maximum of $50,000.  The loans bear interest at
   prime rate plus 1% and are payable over a maximum five-year period.  Loan
   repayment generally is made through payroll deductions.

5. PLAN TERMINATION

   Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
   right under the Plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to
   terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.  In the event of
   Plan termination, participants become fully vested.

6. ASSETS OF TERMINATED EMPLOYEES

   At December 31, 1995 and 1994, approximately $265,000 and $143,000,
   respectively, of Plan assets were payable to terminated employees who have
   withdrawn from participation in the Plan.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k)
  Retirement Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets available for
benefits of the Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan
(the Plan) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related statements of
changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatements.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of December 31,
1995 and 1994, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the
years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed in
the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974.  These schedules are the responsibility of the Plan's
management.  Such supplemental schedules have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic 1995 financial statements and, in
our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

401(k) RETIREMENT THRIFT PLAN

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1994
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  DESCRIPTION OF PLAN

    The following description of the Union Pacific Agreement Employee 401(k)
    Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) provides only general information. 
    Participants should refer to the Plan document for a more complete
    description of the Plan's provisions.

    General - The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering employees of the
    Union Pacific Railroad Company and its Railroad affiliates (the Company) 
    who are represented for the purposes of collective bargaining by a rail 
    union, to which eligibility to participate in the Plan has been extended. 
    The Plan covers employees who have completed one year of service or were 
    employees as of the effective date of the Plan, July 1, 1990.  It is 
    subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
    of 1974 (ERISA), as amended.

    Contributions - Participants may contribute 2% to 8% of their compensation
    on a salary deferral basis subject to limitations specified in the Internal
    Revenue Code.  The Company does not contribute to the Plan.

    Participant Accounts - Each participant account is credited with the
    participant's contributions and an allocation of the Plan's earnings. 
    Allocations are based on participant account balances.

    Vesting - Participants are at all times 100% vested in the value of their
    account.

    Payment of Benefits - Distribution of benefits shall be in a lump sum no
    later than 60 days following the close of the plan year in which the
    participant's termination of employment occurs, subject to certain 
    mandatory pay-outs to participants who have attained age 70-1/2, but have
    not yet terminated employment.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Basis of Accounting - The accounts of the Plan have been prepared in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The financial
    statements were prepared in accordance with the financial reporting
    requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as
    permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's amendments to Form 
    11-K adopted during 1990.

    Investment Valuation and Income Recognition - Investments in the Union
    Pacific Company Stock Fund, Vanguard Wellington Fund, Vanguard Index 
    Trust-500 Portfolio Fund, Vanguard US Growth Fund, Vanguard International
    Growth Portfolio Fund, and the Vanguard Total Bond Market Fund are valued 
    at fair value as determined by quoted market prices.  The investments in 
    the Vanguard Investment Contract Trust Fund are valued at fair value as
    determined by Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company.  Dividend income is
    recorded as of the ex-dividend date.  Security transactions are recorded 
    as of the trade date.

    Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994
    financial statements to conform with classifications in the 1995 financial
    statements.

</TABLE>

4.  PLAN ADMINISTRATION

    The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of
    Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration of
    the Plan are paid by the Company.

5.  TAX STATUS

    The Plan obtained a tax determination letter dated July 27, 1995, in which
    the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Plan, as then designed, was in
    compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
    (the Code).  The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination
    letter.  However, Plan management believes that the Plan currently is being
    operated in compliance with the applicable requirement of the Internal
    Revenue Code.  Therefore, it is believed that the Plan was qualified and
    the related trust was tax-exempt under provisions of Section 501(a)of the
    Internal Revenue Code as of the financial statement date.  Therefore, no
    provision for income taxes has been included in the Plan's financial
    statements.

6.  PLAN TERMINATION

    Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the
    right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the
    provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and income
    of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's participants
    and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee either to distribute
    the Plan's assets to the participants, or to continue the Trust and
    distribute benefits as though the Plan had not been terminated.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Union Pacific Motor Freight Company Agreement
 Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets available for 
benefits of the Union Pacific Motor Freight Company Agreement Employee 401(k) 
Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the 
related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the 
years then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Plan's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plan as of 
December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the changes in net assets available for 
benefits for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic 
financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental schedules listed 
in the Table of Contents are presented for the purpose of additional analysis
and are not a required part of the basic financial statements, but are 
supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974.  These schedules are the responsibility of the
Plan's management. Such supplemental schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 1995 financial 
statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects  
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

1.  DESCRIPTION OF PLAN

    The following description of the Union Pacific Motor Freight Company 
    Agreement Employee 401(k) Retirement Thrift Plan (the Plan) provides only 
    general information.   Participants should refer to the Plan document 
    for a more complete description of the Plan's provisions.

    General - The Plan is a defined contribution plan covering employees 
    of the Union Pacific Motor Freight Company (the Company) who are governed 
    by a collective bargaining agreement entered into between the Company and 
    a Union, to which eligibility to participate in the Plan has been 
    extended, and have completed one year of service or were employees as of 
    the effective date of the Plan, January 1, 1994.  It is subject to
    the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
    (ERISA), as amended.

    Contributions - Participants may contribute 2% to 8% of their 
    compensation on a salary deferral basis subject to limitations specified 
    in the Internal Revenue Code.  The Company does not contribute to the Plan.

    Participant Accounts - Each participant account is credited with the 
    participant's contributions and an allocation of the Plan's earnings.  
    Allocations are based on participant account balances.

    Vesting - Participants are at all times 100% vested in the value of 
    their account.

    Payment of Benefits - Distribution of benefits shall be in a lump sum no 
    later than 60 days following the close of the Plan year in which the 
    participant's termination of employment occurs, subject to certain 
    mandatory pay-outs to participants who have attained age 70-1/2, but have
    not yet terminated employment.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    Basis of Accounting - The accounts of the Plan have been prepared in 
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principals.  The financial 
    statements were prepared in accordance with the financial reporting 
    requirements of the ERISA as permitted by the Securities and Exchange 
    Commission's amendments to Form 11-K adopted during 1990.

    Investment Valuation and Income Recognition - Investments in the Union 
    Pacific Company Stock Fund, Vanguard Wellington Fund, Vanguard 
    Index Trust-500 Portfolio Fund, Vanguard US Growth Fund, Vanguard 
    International Growth Portfolio Fund and the Vanguard Total

    Dividend income is recorded as of the ex-dividend date.  Security 
    transactions are recorded as of the trade date.

4.  PLAN ADMINISTRATION

    The Plan is administered by the Senior Vice President, Human Resources of 
    Union Pacific Corporation.  All expenses incurred in the administration 
    of the Plan are paid by the Company.

5.  TAX STATUS

    The Plan obtained a tax determination letter dated September 16, 1994, 
    in which the Internal Revenue Service stated that the Plan, as then
    designed, was in compliance with the applicable requirements of the
    Internal Revenue Code (the Code).  The Plan has been amended since 
    receiving the determination letter.  However, Plan management believes 
    that the Plan currently is being operated in compliance with the applicable
    requirement of the Internal Revenue Code.  Therefore, it is believed that 
    the Plan was qualified and the related trust was tax-exempt under
    provisions of Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as of the 
    financial statement date.  Therefore, no provision for income
    taxes has been included in the Plan's financial statements.

6.  PLAN TERMINATION

    Although it has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the 
    right under the Plan at any time, to terminate the Plan subject to the 
    provisions of ERISA.  Regardless of such actions, the principal and 
    income of the Plan remains for the exclusive benefit of the Plan's 
    participants and beneficiaries.  The Company may direct the Trustee
    either to distribute the Plan's assets to the participants, or to 
    continue the Trust and distribute benefits as though the Plan had not 
    been terminated.
