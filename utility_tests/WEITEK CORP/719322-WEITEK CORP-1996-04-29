Annual Meeting of Shareholders

         The Company had previously indicated on its Form 10K dated April 1,
1996 that the Annual Meeting of Shareholders was scheduled for June 6, 1996. The
Board of Directors now contemplates that it may reschedule the meeting.

Board Meetings and Committees

         The Board of Directors of the Company held a total of nine meetings
during the year ended December 31, 1995.

         The Audit Committee, which currently consists of directors Gellatly and
Collmeyer, met two times during the last fiscal year. This Committee recommends
engagement of the Company's independent public accountants and is primarily
responsible for approving the services performed by such accountants and for
reviewing and evaluating the Company's accounting principles and its system of
internal accounting controls.

         The Compensation Committee, which currently consists of directors
Collmeyer and King, met once during the last fiscal year. This Committee
establishes the salary and incentive compensation of the executive officers of
the Company.

         The Option Committee, which currently consists of directors Collmeyer
and Gellatly, met eleven times during the last fiscal year. The Option Committee
administers the Company's employee benefits plans.

         During the year ended December 31, 1995, no director attended fewer
than seventy-five percent of the Board of Directors' meetings or any committee
meeting on which such director served.

Compliance With Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act

         Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of
ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Such officers, directors and
ten-percent shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

         Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it,
the Company believes that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, all
Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and
ten-percent shareholders were complied with.

(1)      Potential realizable value is based on an assumption that the stock
price appreciates at the annual rate shown (compounded annually) from the date
of grant until the end of the ten-year option term. These numbers are calculated
based on the requirements promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and do not reflect the Company's estimate of future stock price growth.

Option Values. None of the Named Executive Officers exercised options in 1995.
The following table sets forth, for each of the Named Executive Officers, the

(1)      Market value of underlying securities at year-end minus the exercise
price.

(2)      Options granted pursuant to the 1991 Option Plan are generally
exercisable by the optionee ahead of vesting. Unvested shares purchased on
exercise of an option are subject to a repurchase right of the Company, and may
not be sold by an optionee until the shares vest. Options indicated as
"Exercisable" are those options which were both vested and exercisable as of
December 31, 1995. All other options are indicated as "Unexercisable."

Board Compensation

         Non-employee directors are compensated at the rate of $2,250 per
quarter for their services as members of the Board of Directors. In addition,
non-employee directors are automatically granted options to purchase 6,000
shares of
