                                     Part I
                                        
Item I. Business

 (a) Vacu-dry Company (the Company), incorporated in California in 1946, is
     engaged in the business of the development, production and marketing of
     fruit products.  The Company's products include low moisture and
     evaporated fruits, bulk apple juice, apple juice concentrate, private
     label drink mixes and low moisture food for the food storage market.

     The Company has been engaged in the production of low moisture fruits
     since 1933.  Through drying processes, the moisture in apples is reduced
     from original levels of 85%-90% to as low as 2%. In addition the Company
     purchases other fruits such as  apricots, dates, peaches, prunes and
     other varieties of fruit which have been partially dried and further
     reduces the moisture in these fruits to levels of approximately 3%. The
     resultant low moisture products are much lighter in weight and less
     bulky than their raw, canned or frozen counterparts.  Because of their
     extreme dryness, low moisture fruit products require no refrigeration or
     other special storage conditions.  Other advantages include consistent
     product quality, economical packaging and convenience in handling and
     use.
     
     The Company has a representation agreement to sell fruit products
     produced in Ecuador for a company based in the United States. This
     agreement automatically renews at the end of each three year term unless
     either party notifies the other six months in advance of the end of the
     term.  In the current fiscal year the Company entered into a similar
     representation agreement to sell dried fruit products produced by a
     California company. This agreement automatically renews at the end of
     each three year term unless either party notifies the other six months
     in advance of the end of the term. These products will be sold primarily
     as ingredients to the major food processors. 
     
(b)  The Company competes in a single industry segment within the food
     industry; all assets held are supportive of efforts to compete in that
     segment.  Selective financial information relating to the industry
     segment is as follows:
          
                             1994               1994            1993
     
     Net sales           $21,438,000         $27,773,000    $26,770,000
     Earnings before
       income taxes        $ 287,000         $ 1,887,000    $ 1,791,000 
     Identifiable assets $15,335,000         $14,929,000    $13,210,000


(c)  The low moisture food industry in the United States is comparatively
     small.  There are only a few organizations engaged in the dehydration of
     fruits to low moisture levels (2% to 5% moisture).

     The Company has two major direct competitors in the low moisture and
     evaporated business.  One is a Washington-based agricultural cooperative
     and the other is a Washington-based privately owned processor.  Numerous
     processors compete in the business of producing bulk apple juice and
     concentrate.

     The Company's products are sold directly and through brokers, to the
     bakery, food storage and food service markets, to major food processors
     (most of which use the products as ingredients), and to federal and
     state institutions.

     In terms of volume, apples represent the major fruit handled by the
     Company.  The sources of raw material supply are individual apple
     growers and in emergencies by dried apple processors in Washington.  The
     majority of the Company's raw apple supply comes from California.  In
     some years, due to crop conditions, the percentage of fruit purchased
     from out-of-state sources may increase. In those years, the Company
     incurs increased costs due to additional freight.  The Company strives
     to reflect such cost increases in selling price adjustments but, if
     unsuccessful, will absorb such costs.

     Other important fruits, including peaches, apricots and prunes, are
     obtained principally from dried fruit packing houses in California. 
     Supplies of fruit are expected to be sufficient to meet the needs of
     regular customers.  For other supplies, including cans and packaging
     materials, the Company draws from a number of vendors and expects that
     adequate supplies will be available.

     The business of producing evaporated apples, bulk apple juice and
     concentrate is seasonal, beginning in late July and usually ending in
     March or April.

     Inventories of fresh and dried apples, packaging materials and finished
     goods as of June 30, 1995, were approximately 25% of annual net sales.

     The Company's three largest customers accounted for approximately 21% of
     gross sales in 1995.  The loss of any one or more of these customers
     could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

     The dollar amount of order backlog believed to be firm as of June 30,
     1995, June 30, 1994 and June 30, 1993 was $10,029,000, $9,931,000 and
     $10,790,000, respectively.  The backlog of orders at June 30, 1995 is
     expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.  The dollar value
     of backlog varies during the year, with the peak occurring during the
     September through December period.

     The Company holds the following trademarks:  Vacu-dry, Appella, Apple
     Munchies, Noah's Ark, Fruit Galaxy, Perma-Pak and Pantri Reserve. 
     Trademark sales account for the majority of the Company's total sales. 
     Vacu-dry and Perma-Pak are the predominant trademarks listed above.

     
     For information on research and development expenditures, see Note 11 to
     the Financial Statements.

     The Company has completed the consolidation of its two production
     operations ,with only the product development department remaining to
     complete the consolidation of the two facilities. Product development
     will remain at the idle production facility until the related portion of
     the facility is leased. As of June 30, 1995, the land and buildings of
     the idle production facility remain on the market for sale or lease by
     the Company. The Company has leased a significant portion of the
     facility and is conducting negotiations with other potential tenants.
     
     The Company has complied with all governmental regulations regarding
     protection of the environment.  No material capital expenditures are
     anticipated for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal
     year.

     The Company employs an average of approximately 250 persons.  This
     number varies throughout each year and increases during periods of high
     production.  Of the 250 employees, approximately 200 are represented by
     the General Truck Drivers, Warehousemen and Helpers Union, Local #624. 
     The Company is presently in contract negotiations with the Union.  

(d)  The Company's export sales can vary greatly between years, depending
     upon foreign crop conditions and relative exchange rates.  The amount of
     the Company's export sales for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $1,480,000,
     $1,267,000 and $971,000 respectively.

Item 2. Properties

     The principal administrative offices are located in Sebastopol,
     California.  Approximately 3,710 square feet of office space are leased
     through February 1996.  The lease may be extended for one year.

     The Company owns 15 acres of land and approximately 90,000 square feet
     under roof at 1365 Gravenstein Hwy So., Sebastopol, California.  This
     facility (formerly described as Plant #1) was used for the dehydration
     of fruits to low moisture, prior to the consolidation of this operation
     into the main processing plant (formerly described as Plant #2), located
     at 2064 Gravenstein Hwy No., Sebastopol, California.  As of June 30,
     1995, the land and buildings of the idle production facility (Plant #1)
     remain on the market for sale or lease.  Management believes that
     leasing the facility is currently the most likely alternative.  The
     Company has leased a portion of the facility and is conducting
     negotiations with other potential tenants.  The Company has no debt
     associated with this facility.

     The Company owns 64 acres of land and approximately 282,000 square feet
     under roof at 2064 Gravenstein Hwy. No., Sebastopol, California.  As of
     June 30, 1995, this facility is the Company's only active processing
     plant.  The buildings include facilities to process fresh apples into
     dried products, bulk apple juice and concentrate, in addition to
     dehydrating by continuous air drying and vacuum drying of apples and
     other fruits; warehouse space; cold storage, and office accommodations. 
     The Company has leased approximately 35,000 square feet of excess
     warehouse space through April 1995.  The lease may be extended for one
     year.

     The consolidated production operations functioned at approximately 114%
     of the single shift capacity.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     The Company has no material legal proceedings pending.
                                        
Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the last
     quarter of the year ended June 30, 1995.

     On August 25, 1995, the approximate number of holders of common stock
     was 1,021. On that date, the average of the high and low price per share
     of the Company's stock was $5.0625. This price does not include dealer
     mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
               
     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
    
     Vacu-dry Company's financial condition declined slightly during
     Fiscal 1995 as a result of the lower net earnings. The Company's
     liquidity decreased during 1995 as it's net working capital
     decreased 9%. During the same period, the Company's equity position
     remained level with last year.

     Because the Company's operations are subject to seasonality, the
     Company's liquid resources fluctuate annually in a manner which
     changes very little from year to year.  The Company experiences a
     normal seasonal decrease in production in April.  Inventories and
     related short term borrowing are usually at their peak at this
     time.  The slowdown in production normally extends through July and
     corresponds to the availability of raw fruit on an affordable
     basis.  The Company's inventory ordinarily decreases during the
     period beginning in April and ending in October, which creates a
     corresponding increase in liquidity.

     The Company's largest external source of liquidity is a $4,000,000
     revolving line of credit provided by a bank at the Bank's prime
     lending rate.  As of June 30, 1995, the Company had $1,649,000 of
     available funds on the $4,000,000 revolving line of credit. This
     compares with $2,720,000 of available funds on the $3,000,000
     revolving line of credit as of June 30, 1994.  As of June 30, 1995,
     the Company was in compliance with all covenants and restrictions
     related to its outstanding debt.

     The Company has established a capital expenditure budget of
     approximately $537,000 for the 1995-1996 fiscal year. The Company
     anticipates financing these expenditures through internally
     generated funds and possibly the use of debt financing.

     The most significant internal source of liquidity is the Company's
     net working capital. The Company believes that sustained
     profitability will lessen the impact of seasonal liquidity
     fluctuations.  The Company has also leased a significant portion of
     its idle facility and is aggressively trying to the lease the
     remaining square footage.  At this time the Company is not pursuing
     the sale of this facility.

     The Company's net working capital decreased from $4,167,000 in 1994
     to $3,775,000 in 1995 as a result of using the line of credit to
     finance the current year's capital expenditures. The debt to equity
     ratio remained flat between years.  The Company believes its
     existing working capital line of credit is sufficient to meet its
     commitments.

     The Company anticipates that profitable operations and debt
     financing will satisfy the Company's future liquidity and capital
     needs.  However, the Company will utilize future private or public
     financing if interest rates rise or if the Company's growth
     prospects require additional funds for operations.

     On April 28, 1994, the Board of Directors established a regular
     dividend policy of $.05 per share per quarter.  As a result of the
     lower sales and earnings, the Board of Directors, on April 27, 1995
     suspended the payment of this quarterly cash dividend.

     On July 28, 1994, the Board of Directors approved a plan to
     repurchase up to 40,000 shares of the Company's stock from time to
     time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. 
     During the current fiscal year, the Company repurchased 15,200
     shares of stock under this plan at an average price per share of
     $6.27.  On April 27, 1995 the Board of Directors suspended the
     repurchase of stock under this plan.

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company's sales are dictated by the competitive environment,
     customer demands and consumer preferences. Sales volume between
     years can be affected by one or more of these factors.  In fiscal
     1995 the Company's net sales decreased $6,335,00 or 23%.  The sales
     declined as a result of substantially lower sales to one of the
     Company's major customers in addition to lower sales volume to
     other significant customers.  The competitive environment
     contributed to the sales decline in fiscal 1995.  The Company
     anticipates the competitive environment to continue into the next
     fiscal year and may affect the sales for fiscal 1996. The net sales
     for 1994 increased $1,003,000 or 4%. This increase was a result of
     sales of banana products. Apple sales for the 1994 fiscal year
     decreased $850,000 as a result of the competitive environment.
     Sales in 1994 (predominantly in the first and second quarters) were
     favorably impacted by substantial purchases by one of its major
     customers. In fiscal 1993, the Company's net sales increased
     $2,463,000 or 10%. Increases during 1993 were attributable to
     increases in volume and in unit price.   

     Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased during fiscal
     years 1995 (90%), 1994 (85%) and 1993 (84%), respectively. In
     fiscal 1995, the increase in the cost of sales percentage was
     predominantly due to the lower production volume as a result of the
     decreased sales volume and the resultant decrease in overhead
     absorption.  Cost of sales increased slightly in fiscal year 1994
     due to slightly lower margins, along with inefficiencies incurred
     during the start-up phase of the consolidation of operations.  The
     decrease in 1993, was a result of the increased production volume
     and slightly improved profitability. 

     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $621,000 in
     1995. This decrease was due to multiple factors, including; the
     receipt of two workers compensation dividends from two different
     policy years totally $257,000, a $96,000 credit from the reduction
     in the SAR liability (as result of the lower stock price) and a
     decrease of $346,000 between years in the bonus and profit sharing 
     expense.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 
     $24,000 in 1994, due to the receipt of a workers compensation
     dividend. In 1993, selling, general and administrative expenses
     increased $186,000 or 8%. This increase was due primarily to higher
     brokerage on the increased sales, increased incentive expense
     generated by the Company's  higher earnings and increased marketing
     expenses incurred to promote the Company's existing product line. 
       
     Interest expense increased $144,000 in fiscal 1995 as a result of
     the increased level of borrowing on the line of credit. In 1994
     interest expense increased $31,000, as a result of the increase in
     the prime lending rate by the Company's bank and the larger balance
     owing to the bank on the consolidation related financing during
     fiscal 1994 versus 1993. Interest expense increased $77,000 in
     1993, as a result of an increase in long-term borrowing.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS



To the Shareholders of
Vacu-dry Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Vacu-dry Company
(a California corporation) as of June 30, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of earnings, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1995.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Vacu-dry Company as of
June 30, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

based upon the amount of taxes payable in future years after considering
changes in tax rates and other statutory provisions that will be in effect in
those years.  The implementation of SFAS 109 did not have a material effect
on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

                         2      20            5     80
                         3      40            6    100

All rights are granted at fair market value at the date of grant.  Rights 
generally vest over a period from the second to the sixth anniversary date 
of the grant.  The SAR liability is recorded based on the market price of the
Company's stock as of the balance sheet date.  In 1995, the Company decreased 
selling, general and administrative expenses by $96,000 in order to reflect 
the lower SAR liability.  In 1994 and 1993, the Company increased selling, 
general and administrative expenses by $26,000 and $161,000, respectively, in 
order to reflect the higher SAR liability.

over the ten-year term of the plan.  The plan term began on January 1, 1994.

PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

At the Annual Meeting, seven (7) Directors are to be elected by
the Shareholders to serve until the next Annual Meeting or until
the election and qualification of their successors.  The Board's
proxy holders (named on the enclosed Proxy Card) intend to vote
all shares for which Proxies are granted to elect the following
seven nominees selected by the Company's Board of Directors, and
intend to vote such shares cumulatively if necessary to elect
some or all of such nominees.  All of the Board's nominees for
Director were elected Directors by the Shareholders at the 1994
Annual Meeting, except for Mr. Stapleton who was elected to the
Board on April 27, 1995.  

If any of the Board's nominees refuses or is unable to serve as a
Director (which is not now anticipated), the Board's Proxy
holders intend to nominate and vote for such other person(s) as
they believe will best serve the interests of the Company.  Any
Shareholder may nominate a candidate for Director from the floor
at the Meeting.  Such nominee must consent to serve, if elected,
prior to voting on his or her name.  The Board of Directors has
no reason to believe that any substitute nominee or nominees will
be required.

The seven nominees for Director who receive the most affirmative
votes will be elected Directors.  Votes against a candidate and
votes withheld shall have no effect on the election result,
though applicable securities laws and regulations may require
that the number of such votes subsequently be disclosed to the
Company's Shareholders under certain circumstances.

Filings by Directors, Executive Officers and Ten Percent Holders

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Company's executive officers, directors, and persons who own more
than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity
securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Executive officers,
directors and greater than ten-percent shareholders are required
by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all
Section 16(a) forms they file.

Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received
by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons
that no Forms 5 were required for those persons, the Company
believes that, during fiscal year 1995 all filing requirements
applicable to its executive officers, directors, and greater than
ten-percent beneficial owners were complied with, except that Mr.
Stapleton filed late a Form 3 which was due upon his appointment
as a director.

Board Committees and Meetings  

The Board of Directors met five times during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1995.  The Company's Board of Directors has

the executive committee has the authority of the Board of
Directors for the management of the business and affairs of the

Sugrue.  The Executive Committee held two meetings during the
fiscal year.

Compensation Committee. The function of the compensation
committee is to develop and recommend to the full Board
compensation arrangements, including bonuses and Stock
Appreciation Rights (SARs), for Executive Officers and other
key employees and to advise the chief executive officer on policy
matters concerning officers compensation.  The members of the
committee are Messrs. Gill (Chairman), Boothe, Koplovsky and
Tonascia.  The Compensation Committee held one meeting during the
fiscal year.

Audit Committee. The function of the audit committee is to

the Company's independent auditors and the price to be paid to
the firm, and to consult with the auditors regarding the plan of
audit, the results of the audit and the audit report, and the
adequacy of internal accounting controls.  The members of the
committee are Messrs. Mertz (Chairman), Gill and Tonascia.  The
Audit Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year.

Retirement Savings Committee. The function of the retirement
savings committee is to direct the management of the Company's
Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan.  The committee met
once during the year.  The members of the Committee are Messrs.

The full Board acts as the nominating committee for the Directors
of the Company.

The Summary Compensation Table shows certain compensation
information for the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's
most highly paid executive officers (collectively referred to as

aggregate compensation for such executive officers did not exceed
$100,000 for services rendered in all capacities during fiscal
year 1995.  Compensation data is shown for the fiscal years ended
June 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993.  This information includes the

Compensation of Directors

Outside Directors receive $300 per month for serving as Directors
and are paid $600 for each Board meeting attended and $400 for
each committee meeting attended.  Directors' fees paid by the
Company during fiscal year 1995 totalled $38,000.  Executive
Officers of the Company who also serve on the Board of Directors
are not specifically compensated for duties as directors.

The Company entered into a consulting agreement (effective April
1, 1983) with Boothe Holdings, Inc., a corporation owned and
controlled by D.P. Boothe, Jr., the Company's former Chairman of
the Board and a Director.  On July 31, 1984, Boothe Holdings,
Inc. was liquidated and Mr. Boothe assumed its responsibilities
and rights under the consulting agreement.  Under the agreement,
Mr. Boothe was required to perform such financial and business
consulting services as the Company may request, in exchange for a
$5,000 monthly consulting fee and reimbursement of expenses.  The
agreement terminated on December 31, 1994.  Mr. Boothe received
$30,000 pursuant to this agreement in fiscal 1995.

Mr. Mertz, a member of the San Francisco law firm of Severson &
Werson, served as the Company's legal counsel during fiscal 1995
and is expected to be retained through fiscal 1996.

Employment Contracts

The Company entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Sugrue
dated February 8, 1983, pursuant to which Mr. Sugrue is employed
by the Company, initially as Executive Vice-President. 
Subsequently, Mr. Sugrue was elected President and Chief
Executive Officer.  The agreement terminates on the date Mr.
Sugrue reaches age 65.  Mr. Sugrue is entitled to receive an
annual salary of not less than $60,000, subject to annual review
by the Company's Board of Directors.  Mr. Sugrue's current salary
under the agreement is $122,472 per year.  Under certain
circumstances, including termination of Mr. Sugrue's employment
by the Company without cause, merger or consolidation of the
Company into any other corporation, dissolution of 
the Company, change in control of the Company, or sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company, Mr. Sugrue has
the option to continue the agreement or to enter into a
consulting agreement with the Company pursuant to which Mr.
Sugrue will be obligated to provide consulting services to the
Company for a period ending on the earlier of three years from
the commencement of the contract or the date on which Mr. Sugrue
reaches age 65.  For such consulting services, Mr. Sugrue will be
entitled to receive a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of his
average annual compensation during the last three years during
which he will have been employed by the Company.

Compensation Committee Report

This report is provided by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (the Committee) to assist stockholders in
understanding the Committee's objectives and procedures in
establishing the compensation of Vacu-dry Company's Chief
Executive Officer and other executive officers.  The Committee,
made up of non-employee Directors, is responsible for
establishing and administering the Company's executive
compensation program.  None of the members of the Committee is
eligible to receive awards under the Company's incentive
compensation programs.

Vacu-dry's executive compensation program is designed to
motivate, reward, and retain the management talent needed to
achieve its business objectives and maintain its competitiveness
in the food processing industry.  It does this by utilizing
competitive base salaries that recognize a philosophy of career
continuity and by rewarding exceptional performance and
accomplishments that contribute to the Company's success.

Compensation Philosophy and Objective

The philosophical basis of the compensation program is to pay for
performance and the level of responsibility of an individual's
position.  The Committee finds greatest value in executives who
possess the ability to implement the Company's business plans as
well as to react to unanticipated external factors that can have
a significant impact on corporate performance.  Compensation
decisions for all executives, including the Named Executive
Officers, are based on the same criteria.  These include
quantitative factors that reflect improvements in the Company's
short and long-term financial performance, as well as qualitative
factors which reflect the strength of the Company over the long
term, such as demonstrated leadership skills and the ability to
deal quickly and effectively with difficulties which sometimes
arise.

The Committee believes that compensation of Vacu-dry's key
executives should:

1.   Link rewards to business results and stockholder returns;

2.   Encourage creation of stockholder value and achievement of
strategic objectives;

3.   Maintain an appropriate balance between base salary and
short-and long-term incentive opportunity;

4.   Attract and retain, on a long-term basis, highly qualified
executive personnel; and

5.   Provide total compensation opportunity that is competitive
with that provided by competitors in the food processing
industry, taking into account relative company size and
performance as well as individual responsibilities and
performance. 

Key Elements of Executive Compensation

Vacu-dry's executive compensation program consists of three
elements: Base Salary, Short-Term Incentives and Long-Term
Incentives.  Payout of short-term incentives depends on corporate
performance.  Payout of the long-term incentives depends on
performance of Vacu-dry stock.


Base Salary

A competitive base salary is crucial to support the philosophy of
management development and career orientation of executives. 
Salaries are targeted to pay levels of the Company's competitors
and companies having similar capitalization, revenues, etc. 
Executive salaries are reviewed annually.  Assessment of an
individual's relative performance is made annually based on a
number of quantitative factors such as stock price, earnings and
revenues, as well as qualitative factors which include
initiative, business judgement, technical expertise, and
management skills.  As a result of the reduced sales and profits
of the Company during the first three quarters of the Company's
1995 fiscal year, effective May 16, 1995, the Company implemented
a salary reduction plan for its Executive Officers.  As a result
of such plan, Mr. Sugrue's base salary was reduced by 10% and the
salaries of the other Executive Officers was reduced by 5%.  The
reductions were part of an overall cost reduction plan which
involved the layoff of approximately eight employees and other
cost reductions.

Short-Term Incentive 

Short-term awards to executives are made in cash to recognize
contributions to the Company's business during the past year. 
The Company maintains a Bonus Plan as an incentive for executive
officers of the Company.  The bonus an executive receives is
dependent on individual performance and level of responsibility.

Long-Term Incentive

Long-term incentive awards provided by shareholder-approved
compensation programs are designed to develop and maintain strong
management through share appreciation awards.  The Company's 1985
Stock Appreciation Rights Plan creates incentives for executives
and other key employees by providing them with an opportunity to
indirectly participate in the appreciation in the market value of
the Company's common stock.

In 1993 the directors approved the adoption of the 1994 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan").  All employees, including
executive officers, may purchase shares of the Company's Common
Stock at a discount of 85% of the market value on the first or
last business day of the quarterly offering period, whichever is
lower. The plan became effective January 1, 1994.

1995 Chief Executive Officer Compensation

Mr. Sugrue's base salary for fiscal 1995 was $122,472.  As a
result of the cost reduction plan implemented in May 1995, Mr.
Sugrue's base salary was reduced by 10%.  During the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1995, Mr. Sugrue also received a total of $5,440
as contributions to his Base 401K.  The Company maintains, and
pays premiums on, a Key Man Life Insurance policy on Mr. Sugrue,
one quarter of the proceeds of which are payable to the Sugrue
estate.  The Committee believes Mr. Sugrue's total compensation
package is appropriate for Mr. Sugrue's level of responsibility
and is well within competitive practice.
