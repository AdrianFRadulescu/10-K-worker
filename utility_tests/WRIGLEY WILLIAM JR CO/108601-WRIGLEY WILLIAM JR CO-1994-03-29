      As of February 18, 1994, there were outstanding 90,639,703
shares of Common Stock, no par value, and the aggregate market
value of the Common Stock (based upon the closing price of the
stock on the New York Stock Exchange on such date) held by
non-affiliates was approximately $2,663,970,454.  As of February
18, 1994, there were outstanding 25,760,786 shares of Class B
Common Stock, no par value.  Class B Common Stock is not traded
on the exchanges, is restricted as to transfer or other
disposition, and is convertible into Common Stock on a
share-for-share basis.  Upon such conversion, the resulting
shares of Common Stock are freely transferable and publicly
traded.  Assuming all shares of outstanding Class B Common Stock
were converted into Common Stock, the aggregate market value of
Common Stock held by non-affiliates on February 18, 1994 (based
upon the closing price of the stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on such date) would have been approximately
$3,073,163,867.  Determination of stock ownership by
non-affiliates was made solely for the purpose of this
requirement, and the Registrant is not bound by these
determinations for any other purpose.

      Certain sections of the Registrant's definitive Proxy
Statement, dated February 8, 1994, for the March 8, 1994 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders and of the 1993 Annual Report to
Stockholders are incorporated by reference into portions of Parts
I, II, III and IV of this Report.

                                    PART I

Item 1.  Business

(a)  General Development of Business.

      (1)  General information.  From 1891 to 1903, the Company
was operated as a partnership until its incorporation in Illinois
as Wm. Wrigley, Jr. & Co. in December, 1903.  In November, 1910,
the Company was reincorporated under West Virginia law as Wm.
Wrigley Jr. Company, and in October, 1927, was reincorporated
under Delaware law.

      Throughout its history, the Company has concentrated on one
principal line of business: the manufacturing and marketing of
quality chewing gum products.

      (2)  Not applicable.

(b)  Financial Information About Industry Segments.

      The Company's principal business of manufacturing and
selling chewing gum constitutes more than 90% of its consolidated
worldwide sales and revenues.  All other businesses constitute
less than 10% of its consolidated revenues, operating profit and
identifiable assets.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business.

      (1)  Business conducted.  Following is a description of the
business conducted and intended to be conducted by the Company
and its wholly-owned associated companies (the Company):

            (i)  Principal products, markets and methods of
      distribution.  The Company's principal business is the
      manufacture and sale of chewing gum, both in the United
      States and abroad.

            The Company's brands manufactured and available in the
      United States are:  WRIGLEY'S SPEARMINT, DOUBLEMINT, JUICY
      FRUIT and BIG RED, which account for a majority of the
      Company's sales volume; FREEDENT, available in three
      flavors, a specially formulated chewing gum which does not
      stick to most types of dental work; and EXTRA sugarfree
      chewing gum, containing NUTRASWEET* brand sweetener,
      available in four flavors and as bubble gum.

            Except for BIG RED, which has limited availability
      overseas, these six Wrigley brands are also commonly
      available in many international markets in various flavors. 
      Additional brands manufactured and marketed abroad are: 
      ARROWMINT, COOL CRUNCH, DULCE 16, JUICY FRUIT and P.K,
      chewing gums in sugar coated pellet form, FREEDENT and ORBIT
      sugarfree gums and BIG BOY, HUBBA BUBBA and BIG G, all
      standard bubble gum products.

            The Company's ten largest markets outside of the United
      States in 1993 were Australia, Canada, China, France,
      Germany, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan and the United
      Kingdom. 
                 

      *NUTRASWEET is a registered trademark of The NutraSweet
Company for its brand of sweetening ingredient.

<PAGE>

            Finished chewing gum is manufactured in four factories
      in the United States and nine factories in other countries. 
      Three domestic wholly owned associated  companies
      manufacture products other than finished chewing gum.  The
      Amurol Products Company manufactures and markets primarily
      children's bubble gum items including BIG LEAGUE CHEW,
      BUBBLE TAPE and other uniquely packaged confections.  Amurol
      markets HUBBA BUBBA in the United States under a licensing
      agreement with the parent company.  Various non-gum items,
      such as a line of suckers, dextrose candy, liquid gel candy
      and hard roll candies are an important part of Amurol's
      total business.  REED'S individually wrapped hard roll
      candies, first introduced in 1893, was acquired by Amurol
      Products Company in 1989.  Amurol is also more actively
      developing export markets, the largest being Canada, Mexico
      and Japan.  The principal business of the L.A. Dreyfus
      Company is the production of chewing gum base, at one
      domestic and one overseas factory, for the parent and wholly
      owned associated companies, and for other manufacturers of
      chewing gum and specialty gum products in the United States
      and abroad.  Northwestern Flavors, Inc. processes flavorings
      and rectifies mint oil for the parent and associated
      companies and, as a small portion of its business, also
      manufactures flavorings and other ingredients for
      food-related industries.

            In 1979, the Company organized its domestic converting
      operations, under the name of Wrico Packaging Division, as a
      separate operating unit of the Company.  This division was
      created to help further the Company's capability to produce
      improved packaging materials.  Currently, Wrico produces
      about 35% of the Company's domestic printed and other
      wrapping supplies.

            The Company markets chewing gum primarily through
      wholesalers, corporate chains and cooperative buying groups
      that distribute the product through retail outlets. 
      Additional direct customers are vending distributors,
      concessionaires and other established customers purchasing
      in wholesale quantities.  Customer orders are usually
      received by mail or telephone and are shipped by truck from
      factory warehouses or leased warehousing facilities. 
      Consumer purchases at the retail level are generated
      primarily through the Company's advertisements on television
      and radio, and in newspapers and magazines.

            (ii)  New products.  In 1993, EXTRA in chlorophyll and
      menthol flavors was introduced in France and was introduced
      in spearmint and peppermint flavors in Hong Kong.  In
      Australia and New Zealand, currant-flavored HUBBA BUBBA was
      introduced.

            (iii)  Sources and availability of raw materials. 
      Natural gums and rosins and synthetic raw materials blended
      to make chewing gum base are readily available from private
      contractors and in the open market.  The Company has also
      developed high quality, totally synthetic bases, all the
      components of which are readily available in the open
      market.

            Sugar, corn syrup, flavoring oils and aspartame are
      obtained in the open market, or under contracts, from
      suppliers in the United States.  All other ingredients and
      necessary packaging materials are also purchased on the open
      market and are readily available.

            (iv)  Patents and trademarks.  The Company holds
      numerous patents relating to packaging, manufacturing
      processes and product formulas.  Approximately a dozen
      patents relating to product formula and sweetener
      encapsulation, primarily for sugarfree gum, are deemed of
      material significance to the Company.  Most of these patents
      expire in the countries in which they are registered at
      various times through the year 2012.

<PAGE>

            Trademarks are of material importance to the Company
      and are registered and maintained for all brands of the
      Company's chewing gum on a worldwide basis.

            (v)  Seasonality.  On a consolidated basis, sales
      normally are relatively consistent throughout the year,
      although the combined second and third quarters generally
      contribute more than half of the Company's sales.

            (vi)  Working capital items.  Inventory requirements of
      the Company are not materially affected by seasonal or other
      factors.  In general, the Company does not offer its
      customers extended payment terms.  The Company believes
      these conditions are not materially different from those of
      its competitors.

            (vii)  Customers.  The Company's products are
      distributed through over  5,000 customers throughout the
      United States alone.  No single domestic or foreign customer
      accounts for as much as 10% of consolidated sales or
      revenues.

            (viii)  Orders.  It is the general custom of the
      wholesale trade to purchase chewing gum requirements at
      intervals of approximately ten days to two weeks to assure
      fresh stocks and good turnover.  Therefore, an order backlog
      is of no significance to the chewing gum business.

            (ix)  Government business.  The Company has no material
      portion of its business which may be subject to
      renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the
      election of the Government.

            (x)  Competitive conditions.  The chewing gum market is
      an intensely competitive one in the United States and in
      most international markets.  Though detailed figures are not
      available, there are approximately 14 chewing gum
      manufacturers in the United States.  Outside sources
      estimate that Wrigley brands account for approximately 49%
      of the total chewing gum product unit sales in the United
      States.  The Company's principal competitors in the United
      States are the Warner-Lambert Company and RJR Nabisco.

            Wrigley brands are sold in 121 countries and
      territories, although in some cases these markets are
      relatively small.  In most international markets, there are
      two or three major competitors and generally a half dozen or
      more other companies competing for a share of the gum market
      in each instance.

            In all markets in which the Company distributes its
      products, principal methods of competition are a combination
      of competitive profit margins to the trade, superior
      quality, brand recognition, product benefit and a fair
      consumer price.

<PAGE>

            (xi)  Research and development.  The Company has for
      many years maintained an active in-house program, and has
      also contracted outside services for developing and
      improving Wrigley products, machinery and operations.  In
      relation to the Company's consolidated assets, revenues and
      aggregate operating expenses, amounts expended in these
      areas during the last three fiscal years have not been
      material.

            (xii)  Compliance with environmental laws.  Compliance
      with Federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge
      of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to
      the protection of the environment, has no material effect on
      capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position
      of the Company.

            (xiii)  Employees.  During 1993, the Company employed
      approximately 6,700 persons worldwide.

      (d)  Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic
Operations and Export Sales.

            Information concerning the Company's operations in
      different geographic areas for the years ended December 31,
      1993, 1992 and 1991 is hereby incorporated by reference from
      the 1993 Annual Report to Stockholders, on page 16, under
      the caption "Operations by Geographic Areas," and on page 21
      under the caption "Results of Operations."

    OFFICE BUILDING

    Wrigley Building, Chicago, Illinois(c).........     451,600

      (a)  In China, the Company has a 50 year lease with the
Guangzhou Economic Technological Development Zone for the land
upon which the factory is located.

      (b)  In the Philippines, the Laurel-Langley Agreement
expired on May 27, 1975 and, under the terms of the Philippine
Constitution, foreign firms were required to divest themselves of
their land sites (but not the structures or improvements
thereon).  Consequently, in December, 1975, Wrigley Philippines,
Inc. donated its land site, but not the buildings thereon, by
deed to the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, a
non-stock, non-profit organization with no government
affiliation, on a lease-back arrangement for a 25-year term with
an option to renew for an additional 25 years.

      (c)  This building is the Company's principal
non-manufacturing property and houses the offices of the
Company's corporate headquarters.  In 1993, the Company's offices
occupied approximately 118,000 of the 451,600 square feet of
rentable space in the building.

      In the case of each factory listed above, there are also
included some offices and warehouse facilities.  Also, the
Company maintains branch sales offices and warehouse facilities
in the United States and abroad, all of which are leased for
varying numbers of years.
