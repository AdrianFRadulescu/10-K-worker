ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

     Westin Hotels Limited Partnership (the "Partnership") and its subsidiary
limited partnerships, The Westin St. Francis Limited Partnership (the "St.
Francis Partnership") and the Westin Chicago Limited Partnership (the "Chicago
Partnership"), each a Delaware limited partnership (collectively the
"Partnerships"), were formed on April 25, 1986 for the purpose of acquiring two
hotels, The Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, California and The Westin
Hotel, Chicago in downtown Chicago, Illinois (individually a "Hotel",
collectively the "Hotels"). The Westin St. Francis and The Westin Hotel, Chicago
had been owned by subsidiaries of Westin Hotel Company ("Westin") and have been
managed by Westin as part of Westin's international hotel system since 1945 and
1964, respectively. Westin Realty Corp. ("Westin Realty") is the sole general
partner of the Partnership, St. Francis Hotel Corporation ("St. Francis Corp.")
is the sole general partner of the St. Francis Partnership, and 909 North
Michigan Avenue Corporation ("909 Corp.") is the sole general partner of the
Chicago Partnership. Each general partner (individually a "General Partner,"
collectively the "General Partners") is a subsidiary of Westin. The St. Francis
Partnership and Chicago Partnership are collectively referred to as the "Hotel
Partnerships."

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

     The Partnerships, which commenced operations on August 28, 1986, are
engaged solely in the business of owning and operating the Hotels. Therefore,
the Partnerships are engaged in only one industry segment.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

     The Hotels are managed by Westin and are operated as part of Westin's
international hotel system. The hotel business in general is highly competitive.
To the extent hotel capacity expands or demand for hotel accommodations
decreases in San Francisco and Chicago, where the Partnerships operate the
Hotels, competition will increase. The demand for particular accommodations and
related services are subject to various factors including, but not limited to,
seasonal variance, changes in economic conditions, and changes in travel
patterns and preferences (which may be affected by airline schedules, weather
conditions or availability). Specific information regarding competitive
conditions at each of the Hotels is set forth in Item 2 below.

     On May 12, 1995, Aoki Corporation, the former owner of Westin, sold all of
the stock of Westin, which it had held indirectly through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Caesar Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (formerly Caesar Park Hotel
Investment, Inc.). Westin was sold to a limited liability company formed
specifically for the purpose of this acquisition by Starwood Capital Group,
L.P., affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co., and The Edward Thomas Companies.
Nomura Asset Capital Corporation provided the financing. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is
an international investment banking firm and has been an investor in both real
estate and corporate ventures through its Whitehall Funds and GS Capital
Partners Fund. Starwood Capital Group, L.P. is a private firm that invests on
behalf of its principals, primarily high net worth and institutional partners.
The Edward Thomas Companies is a Beverly Hills-based hotel company that owns and
operates hotels, including Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica.

     The sale of Westin did not change the structure of the General Partners'
and Limited Partners' ownership interests in either the Partnership or Hotel
Partnerships.

     Neither the Partnership nor the Hotel Partnerships have any employees.
Administrative and Hotel personnel are employees of either Westin or the Hotels'
respective General Partners. The Partnerships reimburse Westin and the General
Partners for the costs of such employees. However, neither the Partnership nor
the Hotel Partnerships are directly responsible for the payment of executive
compensation to the officers of the General Partners.

                                      -2-

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

     The Partnerships' properties consist of The Westin St. Francis in San
Francisco, California, and The Westin Hotel, Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. Each
is a first-class hotel bearing the Westin name and located in a premier central
urban location, providing guests with convenient access to business districts,
shopping areas and convention facilities. It may be noted that while Westin
manages hotels located at the airports of these cities, neither is in direct
competition with the Hotels.

THE WESTIN ST. FRANCIS

     Description. During 1995, some of the floors at The Westin St. Francis were
reconfigured to better meet guests' needs. The result is that the Hotel now
contains 1,192 guest rooms, with 613 rooms in the main building and 579 rooms in
the 32-story tower. Four separate restaurants and lounges are located within the
Hotel, including the Compass Rose. Victor's, located on the 32nd floor, is
currently being renovated and will open this summer as a premier banquet
facility. Concierge services, jewelry and gift boutiques, clothing shops, art
galleries, a florist and a hair salon for men and women are all available within
the Hotel.

     Location. The Westin St. Francis is located on historic Union Square in
downtown San Francisco, approximately 12 miles north of the San Francisco
International Airport and within easy walking distance of the George R. Moscone
Convention Center, Chinatown and the central business and financial district of
San Francisco. The world-famous San Francisco cable cars stop directly in front
of the Hotel.

     Capital Improvements. During 1995, the Hotel embarked on an aggressive
renovation program. The Hotel spent $21.2 million on capital improvements. Of
this amount, $2.7 million was spent on the main building facade restoration,
$0.4 million on renovations to food and beverage outlets, $10.7 million on rooms
renovations, and the remaining $7.4 million in other areas including fire/life
safety upgrades and ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliance.

     The Hotel has budgeted $15.5 million for capital improvements in 1996, of
which $2.7 million is to be spent on guest rooms, $2.8 million on food and
beverage outlets, $5.4 million in other areas including fire/life safety
upgrades and ADA compliance, and $4.6 million on the facade project. For further
discussion regarding the funding of these capital expenditures, see Item 7 -
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

     Competitive Conditions. The competition in San Francisco's hospitality
industry remained strong during 1995. As the Moscone Convention Center was being
built, new hotels were added and existing hotels expanded to meet projected
future demand. The Hotel's competitive segment now totals 7,235 rooms. San
Francisco has seen no new additions since 1991 and none are projected for 1996.
A number of hotels have undergone renovations within the past few years,
including the most recent, a multi-million dollar renovation to the Fairmont.

THE WESTIN HOTEL, CHICAGO

     Description. The Westin Hotel, Chicago has 740 guest rooms including 43
suites. The Hotel operates the Chelsea as an all purpose food and beverage
facility and provides retail space for a specialty store and a gift shop.

     Location. The Westin Hotel, Chicago, is located on a prime site in downtown
Chicago at the north end of the famous "Magnificent Mile." The Hancock Center is
situated directly south of The Westin Hotel, Chicago, as is the Water Tower
Place, offering a variety of shopping and entertainment possibilities. The Hotel
is 18 miles from O'Hare International Airport and 12 miles from the Midway
Airport.

     Capital Improvements. In 1995, the Hotel's extensive rooms renovation was
substantially completed. The Hotel spent $6.3 million for capital expenditures.
Of this amount, $3.7 million was spent for guest room improvements, $0.9 million
for the lobby renovation, $1.1 million on food and beverage outlets, focusing
primarily on banquet facilities, and the remaining $0.6 million on various other
projects including fire/life safety upgrades.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4
     The Hotel has budgeted $3.1 million for capital improvements during 1996,
of which $0.7 million will be spent on the facade, $1.3 million for ADA
compliance and updating of systems, $0.9 million for food and beverage outlets.
For discussion regarding the funding of these capital expenditures see Item 7 -
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

     Competitive Conditions. Chicago's hospitality industry experienced
continuing strong competition during the past two years, which is expected to
continue in 1996 as first-class hotel chains view a presence in Chicago as an
essential part of their hotel networks. Additionally, the proposed expansion of
the McCormick Place convention and meeting center, originally scheduled to be
completed in 1994, which will now be completed in April 1997, encouraged
development within the Chicago market. Historically, increased demand has not
been able to fully support these large increases in supply; however, during 1995
and continuing into 1996, it is anticipated that demand will continue to improve
in this market. There were no new additions to the Chicago market in 1995, but
construction of a 1,200 room hotel, expected to open in 1998, is scheduled to
begin in 1996.

MORTGAGE LOANS

     On August 21, 1986, mortgage loans in the amount of $83,325,000 with
respect to The Westin St. Francis and $32,825,000 with respect to The Westin
Hotel, Chicago (collectively the "Mortgage Loans") were refinanced by Teacher
Retirement System of Texas (Lender). The Hotels were acquired subject to the
Mortgage Loans. The Mortgage Loans require that the Hotel Partnerships not
further encumber the Hotels without prior consent of the Lender. On June 2,
1994, the General Partner, on behalf of Westin Hotels Limited Partnership,
successfully completed a restructuring of the Mortgage Loans and entered into a
Restructuring Agreement with the Lender. See discussion regarding the terms of
the Restructuring Agreement under Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital
Resources" below and Note (5) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INSURANCE

     Each Hotel is covered by comprehensive general liability insurance, fire
and extended property insurance (including earthquake coverage), business
interruption, workers' compensation, employer's liability insurance, and such
other insurance as is customarily obtained for similar properties.

     The Hotels currently participate in a Westin insurance program whereby
general liability and workers compensation insurance coverage premiums are paid
through Westin to Aetna Casualty and Surety Company and Westel Insurance
Company, the latter being a wholly owned subsidiary of Westin.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

     Because of the nature of the hotel business, the Hotel Partnerships, along
with Westin as the Hotels' manager, are subject to various claims and legal
actions incidental to the ordinary course of their operations, including such
matters as contract and lease disputes and complaints alleging personal injury,
property damage and employment discrimination. The General Partner believes that
the outcome of any such pending claims or proceedings, individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect upon the business, financial
condition, or results of operations of the Partnership.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     None.

                                     PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED UNITHOLDER MATTERS.

     As of March 25, 1996, there were 8,929 holders of record of the 135,600
Units.

     There is no public market for the Units, and it is not anticipated that a
public market for the Units will develop. The transfer of Units, or any interest
therein, is subject to a variety of restrictions. Limited Partners may not
transfer their interests in the Partnership if, in the opinion of the
Partnership's counsel, such transfers might violate the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the laws of any other
jurisdiction or agency applicable to the transfers, cause the Partnership to be
regarded as an association taxable as a corporation, result in the dissolution
or termination of the Partnership or result in a Hotel Partnership's not being
able to obtain or continue in effect any license permitting the service or sale
of alcoholic beverages in its Hotel. The assignee must also meet certain other
requirements set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of Westin Hotels Limited Partnership before it may be recognized as
a substituted Limited Partner, including the payment of all reasonable expenses
connected with the transfer of any interest. The Limited Partners or their
representatives must furnish, as to voluntary transfers, sufficient information
to counsel to permit the foregoing determination to be made.

     Cash distributions, if any, are distributed to the Partners on a quarterly
basis not later than 75 days after the end of the Partnership's fiscal quarter.
Limited Partners have received no cash distributions during the past five years.
In addition, cash distributions to the limited partners are prohibited for 1996,
and future distributions must be based on the Hotels achieving certain
performance levels as specifically outlined in the Restructuring Agreement. See
Note (2) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS.

GENERAL

     The Hotels' primary market focus is on business travelers, conventions and
other groups and, in the case of The Westin St. Francis, tourism. The Hotels'
business activities generally follow national economic trends. The level of
tourist business is influenced by the general global economic environment and
political climate and, to a lesser extent, by the strength of the U.S. dollar in
relation to foreign currencies. Both The Westin St. Francis and The Westin
Hotel, Chicago continue to experience seasonal trends, with the lowest occupancy
levels occurring the first quarter, followed by increasing occupancies
throughout the remainder of the year. In 1995, however, operating results were
impacted by the renovations being undertaken at both Hotels, as discussed under
Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. See Note (9) of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8 "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" below, for additional quarterly information.

1995 Compared with 1994 
- -----------------------
     During 1995, the Partnership realized net income totaling $1,713,000, 
up $269,000 over 1994 levels of $1,444,000. Significantly lower 
management fees, down $3,121,000 from 1994 levels, were the greatest
single contributor to the earnings improvement. Operating profits improved by
$1,538,000 as the improved profitability in the areas of rooms and other
operating departments was partially offset by declines in food and beverage
operations resulting from slower banquet business at both Hotels.

     Combined rooms revenues showed a 1.2% improvement of $726,000, to
$60,907,000 over 1994 levels. The Westin Hotel, Chicago achieved significantly
higher rooms revenues, up 7.8% over 1994 to $20,237,000 as the average room rate
increased 11.7%, reflecting the Hotel's renovated rooms product and higher
demand in the Chicago market. The Westin Hotel, Chicago's improvement was
partially offset, however, by the 1.8% decline in rooms revenue at The Westin
St. Francis, as the Hotel experienced a 3 percentage point drop in the occupancy
rate, as rooms were renovated and group business declined since the Hotel was
unable to book this segment during the renovation period.

     Combined food and beverage revenues declined by 11.4% to $27,124,000,
reflecting slower banquet activity at each Hotel. The Hotels' food and beverage
declines reflected the previously mentioned slower group business resulting from
the renovations. In addition, The Westin St. Francis' results were further
impacted by an unusually slow social calendar in San Francisco.

     The combined rooms profits improved by 3.1% to $42,976,000 due to the
significant improvement at The Westin Hotel, Chicago. The Hotel achieved a
$1,532,000 increase in rooms profit as The Westin Hotel, Chicago's profitability
benefited from the 11.7% increase in the average room rate. The Westin St.
Francis experienced a slight decline in the rooms profit (0.8%) as the cost
savings measures implemented at the Hotel were insufficient to offset the
decline in rooms revenues previously discussed.

     Despite the improved profitability in food and beverage operations at The
Westin Hotel, Chicago, the Hotels' combined food and beverage profits of
$4,282,000 declined by $692,000, as The Westin St. Francis was only able to
partially offset lost banquet revenues by cost efficiencies.

     Combined profits from other operating departments improved $587,000 to
$6,431,000 as revenues increased $617,000 and costs were virtually kept at 1994
levels. Management fees declined $3,121,000 from 1994 levels to $2,188,000 as no
incentive management fee accrued as provided for in the management contract.
Taxes and insurance increased $2,223,000 over 1994 levels due to the impact of
the one-time property tax rebate which occurred in 1994. Interest expense
related to the subordinated loan from the General Partner increased to
$2,456,000, $1,814,000 greater than 1994 levels, as the loan was fully funded to
$25,000,000 during 1995 and interest accrued for 12 months as compared to 6
months in 1994.

1994 Compared with 1993 
- -----------------------
     In 1994, the Partnership realized net income totaling $1,444,000, a 
$10,119,000 improvement over the 1993 net loss of $8,675,000. 
This improvement resulted from significantly higher operating profits due to
revenue improvements in all operating areas and lower interest expense 
resulting from the debt restructuring, which is discussed in greater
detail under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below. The operating profit
benefited from greater demand in the respective markets for both 

                                      -7-
<PAGE>   8
Hotels. The greatest improvement was in the area of food and beverage
operations, although both Hotels achieved significant growth in rooms revenues.
The Partnership also benefited from a one-time property tax rebate for The
Westin St. Francis, which occurred during the third quarter, and lower
depreciation and amortization expense.

     Combined rooms revenues showed a 3.2% improvement as combined occupancy
levels improved 0.7 percentage points, reflecting growth in demand in both
markets, and the combined average room rate improved by 2.1% reflecting not only
greater demand, but also the impact of the partially completed rooms renovations
at The Westin Hotel, Chicago. The Westin Hotel, Chicago experienced the greatest
strengthening in rooms revenues as the Hotel achieved a 9.2% improvement in
rooms revenues to $18,781,000, up $1,582,000 from the 1993 level. The Westin St.
Francis also achieved slightly higher rooms revenues of $41,400,000, up $299,000
from the 1993 level, due to higher occupancy levels. Occupancy was 
0.6 percentage points higher than 1993 levels of 74.3%, as The Westin 
St. Francis benefited from some major conventions that took place in 
San Francisco during 1994.

     Combined food and beverage revenues improved significantly (9.5%) to
$30,611,000 as banquet business increased at both Hotels, but most significantly
at The Westin St. Francis following completion of the ballroom renovation.
Revenues from the Hotels' other food outlets also improved. The Westin St.
Francis achieved an 8.3% improvement in food and beverage revenues to
$22,344,000 while The Westin Hotel, Chicago's revenues of $8,267,000,
represented a 12.9% improvement over the 1993 level.

     Combined rooms profits reached $41,670,000, a 2.6% improvement over 1993
levels. The Westin Hotel, Chicago's 10.3% improvement was partially offset by
the slight (0.7%) decrease at The Westin St. Francis. The Westin Hotel,
Chicago's improvement primarily resulted from the Hotel's higher average room
rate, while The Westin St. Francis' results were adversely affected by labor
increases which increased related rooms costs, thereby reducing rooms profits.

     Combined food and beverage profits increased by $1,430,000 to $4,974,000,
reflecting improvements at both Hotels, but most significantly at The Westin St.
Francis where food and beverage profit rose by $1,127,000.

     Profits from other operating departments contributed $5,844,000 to the
operating profit, up $496,000 compared with 1993, as the Hotels continued to
realize cost efficiencies while increasing revenues. The $3,078,000 reduction in
taxes and insurance included a one-time property tax rebate of $2,100,000 for
The Westin St. Francis. The $3,350,000 reduction in depreciation and
amortization expense reflects the impact of the full depreciation during 1993 of
equipment placed in service at the inception of the Partnership. The $775,000
increase in administrative and general expense reflects higher credit card
commissions, labor costs and professional fees.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of $10,345,000 at December
31, 1995, a $2,743,000 increase from December 31, 1994. During 1995, net cash
contributed by operating activities equaled $11,882,000; of this amount,
Available Net Cash Flow totaling $8,734,000 was funded into the Furniture,
Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) Reserve Accounts as stipulated in the Restructuring
Agreement.

     The FF&E Reserve Accounts are funded by the proceeds of the Partnership's
subordinated loan from the General Partner and Available Net Cash Flow as
stipulated in the Restructuring Agreement and are included in restricted cash in
the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 1995, the funding of the 
$25 million subordinated loan from the General Partner was completed by the
$7,500,000 contribution to the FF&E Reserve Account for The Westin St. Francis.
This additional funding, along with the $8,734,000 from Available Net Cash Flow,
comprises the $16,234,000 increase in restricted cash for 1995.

     Fourth quarter net capital expenditures totaling $5,101,000, the majority
of which occurred at The Westin St. Francis, were primarily funded from the FF&E
Reserve Accounts. During 1995, a total of $27,393,000 was expended for capital
improvements at the Partnership's Hotels.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>   9
     The 1995 capital budget was adjusted downward from the original levels
approved by the Lender. As stipulated by the Restructuring Agreement, variances
from the original estimated amounts reflect timing adjustments and were either
approved by the Lender or were within the limits required by the Restructuring
Agreement. Of this amount, The Westin St. Francis spent $21.2 million for
capital improvements during 1995, of which $10.7 million was spent on guest
rooms, $0.4 million on food and beverage outlets, $7.4 million in other areas
including fire/life safety upgrades and ADA compliance, and $2.7 million on the
facade project. During 1995, the main building guest rooms were completed and
the Hotel began work on the Tower guest rooms. The Westin Hotel, Chicago spent
$6.3 million for capital improvements in 1995. Of this amount, $3.7 million was
spent on rooms renovations, $1.5 million for equipment and other renovations
including the lobby and facade, and $1.1 million for food and beverage outlets.

     Expenditures in 1996 will total approximately $18.6 million. The Hotels
will continue work on the facades and food and beverage outlets and complete the
fire/life safety upgrades. The major portion of these expenditures are slated
for work at The Westin St. Francis where anticipated outlays for capital
expenditures will total approximately $15.5 million. The Westin St. Francis will
spend approximately $5.4 million on fire/life safety upgrades, ADA compliance
work, and other equipment; $4.6 million for the facade; $2.7 million to finish
the guest room renovations; and $2.8 million on converting less profitable
outlet space to banquet facilities and updating the Dutch Kitchen. The Westin
Hotel, Chicago expects to spend $3.1 million for capital in 1996, of which $0.7
million will be spent on the facade; $0.9 million for banquet facilities and
miscellaneous projects; and $1.2 million for other projects including ADA
compliance and systems updating. At this time, the General Partner anticipates
that future Available Net Cash Flow from operations and funds currently on
deposit in the FF&E Reserve Accounts will provide adequate funding for these
expenditures. As in prior years, the General Partner will continue to closely
monitor the Partnership's cash flow and timing of capital expenditures. The
facade restoration at The Westin St. Francis will continue beyond 1996, with a
current projected 1998 completion date.

     The General Partner believes that the Partnership's liquidity will improve
significantly as a result of the Restructuring Agreement. However, as stipulated
in the Restructuring Agreement, no cash distributions to the Limited Partners
were made during 1995. Furthermore, since the Hotels did not achieve the levels
of performance as specifically outlined in the Restructuring Agreement which
would have allowed the resumption of distributions at this time, no
distributions will be made in 1996. However, barring any unforeseen adverse
occurrence, the General Partner anticipates that the Partnership will be in a
position to resume distributions to the Limited Partners sometime in 1997 and
thereafter from available cash flow. It is important to note that in order for
this to occur, Limited Partner distributions must be based on the Hotels first
achieving certain performance levels as specified in the Restructuring
Agreement.

     When the Partnership was formed in 1986, it was anticipated that a sale or
refinancing of the Hotels would be explored after eight years of Partnership
operations. Beginning with 1994, the Partnership Agreement directed the General
Partner to actively review opportunities to sell or refinance the Hotel
properties on behalf of the Partnership. During 1994, the General Partner
emphasized restructuring the debt to stabilize both Hotels and to allow them to
remain competitive in their respective markets. In 1995, the General Partner
focused on the renovations at both Hotels to support their future profitability.
During 1996, the General Partner will continue its emphasis on the renovations
occurring at both Hotels. The real estate market for luxury hotels continues to
improve and the General Partner will closely monitor these market conditions.
The General Partner anticipates that this direction will best improve the
Partnership's overall financial position and ultimately optimize the value of
the Partnership's properties in the real estate market.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                DECEMBER 31, 1995


(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Westin Hotels Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Partnership"), and its subsidiary limited partnerships, The Westin St. Francis
Limited Partnership and The Westin Chicago Limited Partnership (the "Hotel
Partnerships"). The Westin St. Francis Limited Partnership owns and operates The
Westin St. Francis in downtown San Francisco, California, and The Westin Chicago
Limited Partnership owns and operates The Westin Hotel, Chicago in downtown
Chicago, Illinois (individually a "Hotel", collectively the "Hotels"). All
significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain
of the prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1995
presentation.

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.

     (b) CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH

     For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash equivalents
consist of highly liquid debt instruments bearing floating interest rates and
other short-term investments purchased with original maturities of three months
or less. Restricted cash consists of amounts deposited in interest-bearing money
market accounts. The Partnership's carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value of cash equivalents and restricted cash.

     (c) INVENTORIES

     Inventories, principally food and beverage and supplies, are valued at the
lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or replacement market.

     (d) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

     Depreciation of property and equipment is provided principally on the
straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives as follows:

         Buildings and improvements                              40 years
         Furniture, fixtures and equipment                  7 to 12 years
         Expendable supplies                                      5 years

     An annual group method of depreciation is used under which individual
assets are not specifically identified for purposes of determining retirements,
and fully depreciated asset groups are written off when evidence indicates they
are no longer in use. Proceeds from miscellaneous sales of property and
equipment are credited to accumulated depreciation.

     Expendable supplies (linens, china, silverware and glassware) have been
depreciated to 50% of the cost of initial stock. Replacements are expensed when
purchased.

     Amortization of capitalized lease property and equipment is provided on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the assets' estimated useful lives or
the lease terms.

     Maintenance and repairs, including the cost of minor replacements, are
charged to property maintenance expense accounts. Costs of additions and
betterment of property are capitalized in property and equipment accounts.

                                      -18-

     (e) INCOME TAXES

     The Partnership does not record any provision for Federal and state income
taxes in its consolidated financial statements. All items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit for Federal and state income tax purposes are allocated to
the partners of the Partnership for inclusion in their individual income tax
returns. The reported amounts of the Partnership's net assets and liabilities
exceeded the related tax bases by approximately $43,036,000 and $36,270,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

     (f) STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 121 (SFAS 121)

     During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets To Be
Disposed Of." SFAS 121 requires that long-lived assets held and used by an
entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable and
that long-lived assets held for sale be adjusted to fair market value. The
Partnership must adopt SFAS 121 no later than January 1996. Management does not
believe that adopting SFAS 121 will have a significant impact on the
Partnership's financial position or results of operations.

(2)  ORGANIZATION

     The Partnership was formed on April 25, 1986, to invest in hotel properties
by acquiring limited partnership interests in the Hotel Partnerships. The
Partnership will continue until December 31, 2036, unless terminated sooner
under the provisions of the Partnership agreement.

     Westin Realty Corp. ("Westin Realty"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Westin
Hotel Company ("Westin"), is the sole general partner of the Partnership. On
August 28, 1986, Westin Realty acquired all of the limited partnership interests
in the Hotel Partnerships (which represented 91.62% of the fair value of the
Hotel Partnerships' net assets) and contributed these interests, valued at
$135,600,000, to the Partnership in exchange for all of the limited partnership
interests in the Partnership. Westin Realty then sold these limited partnership
interests in a public offering. The remaining 8.38% interest in the Hotel
Partnerships was retained by the predecessor owners, subsidiaries of Westin.

     On May 12, 1995, Aoki Corporation sold all of the stock of Westin, which it
held indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, Caesar Park Hotels &
Resorts, Inc. (formerly Caesar Park Hotel Investment, Inc.). Westin was sold to
a limited liability corporation formed specifically for the purpose of this
acquisition by Starwood Capital Group, L.P., affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
and The Edward Thomas Companies. The sale of Westin does not change the
structure of the general partner's and limited partners' interests in the
Partnership. An affiliate of Westin Realty owns a total of 20 Limited
Partnership Units, representing less than a 1% ownership interest.

     The Hotel Partnerships' profits and losses are generally allocated 99% to
the Hotel Partnership and 1% to minority interests. Partnership profits and
losses are further allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the general
partner, with the exception of depreciation expense, which is allocated 92.55%
to the limited partners and 7.45% to the general partner. Because of the
allocation of depreciation expense, the general partner's share of profits and
losses since inception is a net loss, resulting in a deficit balance in the
general partner equity account. The Partnership agreement specifies that if a
deficit balance exists after liquidation of the Hotel Partnerships' assets, the
general partner would be obligated to contribute cash to the Partnership equal
to the lesser of the deficit balance or the aggregate amount distributed at
liquidation to the Hotel general partners by the Hotel Partnerships.

     Except for the following restrictions outlined in the June 1994 mortgage
restructuring agreement, net cash flow of the Partnership as defined in the
Partnership agreement is distributed first to the limited partners until certain
preferential distributions are achieved and then allocated to both the general
and limited partners depending on factors related to the source of the net cash
flow and cash distributions as specified in the Partnership agreement. The
Restructuring Agreement prohibits cash distributions to the limited partners for
1995. The agreement permits distributions in 1996 subject to the Hotels
achieving certain performance levels in the two years prior to 1996, and permits
distributions in 1997 subject to the Hotels achieving certain 

                                      -19-
<PAGE>   20
performance levels in the three years prior to 1997. The Hotels, however, did
not achieve the required performance levels to allow a distribution in 1996.
Distributions in 1997 are subject to the Hotels achieving certain performance
levels in the three years prior to 1997.

(3)  RESTRICTED CASH

     During 1995, the remaining $7,500,000 of the $25,000,000 subordinated loan
from Westin Realty was funded to the Partnership. These proceeds have been
deposited in the Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E) Reserve Accounts. In

</TABLE>

     On June 2, 1994, an agreement to restructure the Hotel Partnerships'
existing mortgage loans was completed. The parties to this restructuring were
the mortgage lender, Westin Realty, Westin as manager for the Hotels, and the
Hotel Partnerships.

     The terms of the agreement provided for reductions in the interest rates on
the outstanding balances of the mortgage loans for the following time periods:
(i) 7.0% per annum for the period from December 1, 1993 through November 30,
1995; (ii) 7.5% per annum for the period from December 1, 1995 through November
30, 1997; and (iii) 10.0% per annum for the period from December 1, 1997 through
November 30, 1998, and then 10.25% per annum thereafter. This results in
effective interest rates of approximately 8.55% from December 1, 1993 through
maturity in the year 2001. The agreement also required a $5,000,000 payment in
1994. The mortgage loans, as restructured, provide for the suspension of
additional principal payments through December 1, 1998.

     In addition, the agreement provided for a subordinated loan of $25,000,000
to the Partnership by Westin Realty. This loan accrues interest at an annual
rate of prime plus 1%. Principal and interest are payable only

                                      -20-
<PAGE>   21
upon the earlier to occur of the expiration of 15 years or a refinancing or sale
of either Hotel. At December 31, 1995, $25,000,000 had been funded to the
Partnership.

     Aggregate quarterly payments on the mortgage loans are as follows: interest
payments of $2,297,000 for 1996 and 1997, $3,062,000 for 1998, and interest and
principal payments of $3,410,000 for the remaining years through September,
2001, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance is due. From
December 1, 1993 through December 31, 1997, interest payments are less than the
interest accrued on the mortgage loans. Accordingly, the excess of interest
accrued over interest paid is added to the outstanding principal balance. This
excess totaled $3,972,000 at December 31, 1995 and $1,931,000 at December 31,
1994. Mortgage loans are secured by first mortgage liens on substantially all
Hotel Partnership assets.

     Scheduled principal payments on long-term obligations are $172,000 in 1996,
$153,000 in 1997, $1,349,000 in 1998, $2,830,000 in 1999, $3,080,000 in 2000,
and $146,348,000 thereafter.

     Interest paid by the Partnership totaled $8,615,000 in 1995, $8,859,000 in
1994 and $13,192,000 in 1993.

     The Partnership entered into capital lease agreements with related
obligations of $363,000 in 1995. No new capital lease agreements were entered
into in 1994.

     Given current real estate market conditions and economic uncertainties, it
is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the Partnership's mortgage
loans. Determining the fair value of the subordinated note is not practicable
due to uncertainty as to when the note will be paid.

(6)  OPERATING LEASES

     Minimum annual rental expense for operating leases in effect at December
31, 1995 are as follows:

</TABLE>

(7)  COMMITMENTS

     The Partnership has entered into certain purchase commitments related to
the Hotels' renovations. At December 31, 1995, outstanding commitments for The
Westin St. Francis totaled approximately $6,688,000.

(8)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Westin Realty is responsible for the management and administration of the
Partnership. In accordance with the Partnership agreement, the Partnership
reimburses Westin Realty for expenses in connection with such services, which
totaled $482,000 in 1995, $624,000 in 1994 and $390,000 for 1993.

     Westin, as manager of the Hotels, received a base management fee equal to
2.25% of Hotel gross operating revenues in 1995 and 1994 and 3.5% of Hotel gross
operating revenues in 1993. Base management fees totaled $2,188,000 in 1995,
$2,149,000 in 1994 and $3,298,000 in 1993. Westin also earns an incentive
management fee based on an escalating percentage of annual net operating cash
flow of the Partnership, as defined in the Partnership agreement. The percentage
applied to net operating cash flow was 20% in 1994 and 15% in 1993. No incentive
management fee was earned in 1995. Incentive management fees totaled $3,160,000
in 1994 and $1,694,000 in 1993. Any incentive management fee not currently
payable bears no interest and is deferred and subsequently payable from the
proceeds of a sale or refinancing of the Hotels or net cash flow after 1996.
Therefore, determining the fair value of the liability is not practicable due to
uncertainty as to when the liability will be paid. In any event, the fair value
of the liability does not exceed the carrying amount.

                                      -21-
<PAGE>   22
     Westin also receives a marketing fee, representing the Partnership's share
of the aggregate costs and expenses incurred by Westin in providing advertising,
public relations, sales and reservation services to all Westin hotels. The
marketing fees totaled $1,848,000 in 1995, $1,888,000 in 1994 and $1,790,000 in
1993. The Partnership also reimburses Westin for the services of certain
full-time Hotel employees. All costs incurred for services provided to the Hotel
Partnership by Hotel employees have been recognized as an expense of the
Partnership.

     As disclosed in Note (5), at December 31, 1995, the subordinated note from
Westin Realty to the Partnership totals $28,098,000, which includes $3,098,000
of accrued interest. At December 31, 1994, the balance was $18,142,000 and
included $642,000 of accrued interest.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

     As noted in Item 10 above, the Partnerships have no directors, officers or
other employees. However, under the respective Agreements of Limited Partnership
for the Partnerships, Westin Realty, as General Partner of the Partnership, is
responsible for the administration and management of the Partnership, and St.
Francis Corp. and 909 Corp., as General Partners of the Hotel Partnerships, are
responsible for the administration and management of the Hotel Partnerships. The
General Partners, however, receive no fees for providing these services to the
Partnership. Moreover, neither the Partnership nor the Hotel Partnerships are
directly responsible for the payment of any executive compensation to the
officers of the General Partners.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT.

     As of December 31, 1995, no person owned of record, or to the Partnership's
knowledge owned beneficially, more than 5% of the total number of Units.

     The officers and directors of the General Partners, as a group,
beneficially own no Units. An affiliate of Westin Realty owns a total of 20
Limited Partnership Units, representing less than a 1% ownership interest.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

     All of the directors and principal officers of Westin Realty, except Ms.
Valine, are directors and/or principal officers of Westin. The Partnership has
engaged various subsidiaries of Westin to provide services to the Hotels. See
Note (8) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8
