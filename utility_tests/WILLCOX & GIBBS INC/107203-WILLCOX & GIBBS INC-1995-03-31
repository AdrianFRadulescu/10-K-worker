                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    Willcox  & Gibbs, Inc.  (the "Company" or  "W&G") is a  New York corporation
that was incorporated in 1866. Management believes that the Company is the fifth
largest distributor of electrical parts and supplies in the United States, based
on 1994 sales.

    During  the  last  several  years,  the  Company  has  undertaken  a   major
restructuring.   On  April  22,  1992,   the  Company,  Rexel,  S.A.  ("Rexel"),
International Technical Distributors, Inc. ("ITD"),  a subsidiary of Rexel,  and
Southern  Electric Supply Company, Inc. ("SES"),  a subsidiary of ITD engaged in
the distribution of electrical materials, entered into a Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to
Rexel and ITD 6,284,301 shares  of Company Common Stock  in exchange for all  of
the stock of SES and approximately $10 million in cash. In addition, pursuant to
the  Purchase Agreement, the Company declared a dividend consisting of one share
of common stock of the Company's subsidiary Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex") for each
share  of  Company  Common   Stock  outstanding  on   November  23,  1992   (the
"Distribution").  In August 1992, the Company transferred to Worldtex all of the
stock of  the  Company's subsidiaries  engaged  in the  manufacture  of  covered
elastic yarn.

    Also  during 1992, the Company disposed of its data communications equipment
distribution business, conducted by Data  Net, Inc. and Dataspan Systems,  Inc.,
and  its Montrose Supply and Equipment  Division, which distributed equipment to
the knitting  trade.  In July  1994,  the Company  sold  its apparel  parts  and
supplies  distribution businesses.  As a  result of  these transactions  and the
Distribution,  the  Company  is  now  engaged  solely  in  the  distribution  of
electrical goods and supplies.

    In April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks Electrical Supply Co. ("Sacks"), a
distributor  of electrical supplies and components with three locations in Ohio,
for $13,635,000. On December 17, 1993, the Company acquired Summers Group  Inc.,
("Summers"),  a  distributor of  electrical  parts and  supplies  with locations
principally  in  Texas,  Oklahoma,  Louisiana,  California  and  Arkansas.   The
consideration  for  the  Summers  acquisition  was  $60,000,000  in  cash  and a
$25,000,000 three year note issued to the seller, plus contingent  consideration
to  be determined based on  Summers' profits before interest  and taxes for 1993
and 1994, subject to a maximum purchase price of $120,000,000. In December 1994,
the Company agreed to prepay such  note and cancel the contingent  consideration
in  exchange for cash  payments that brought  the total cash  purchase price for
Summers to $90,950,000 (including $0.7 million of acquisition costs).

    In March, 1994, the  Company sold 3,491,280  newly-issued shares of  Company
Common Stock to Rexel for $31,421,520 in cash. In connection with that sale, the
size of the Company's Board of Directors was reduced from twelve to nine and two
additional  nominees of Rexel became directors of the Company. As a result, five
of the Company's nine current directors are nominees of Rexel.

    During the last half of 1994,  the Company also realigned the management  of
its   electrical  distribution  operations.  The  operations  of  the  Company's
principal subsidiaries, Summers, Sacks, SES and the Consolidated Electric Supply
group ("CES"), were  reorganized along  geographic lines into  two regions:  the
Eastern  Region and  the Western Region.  In addition, substantially  all of the
Company's operating subsidiaries were merged into either SES, which operates the
Eastern Region, or Summers, which operates the Western Region.

ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS

    The Company is engaged in the wholesale distribution of electrical parts and
supplies, operating 171 electrical distribution  locations in 19 states and  the
Bahamas.  The  Company  manages  its  business  through  two  principal regional
organizations: the Eastern Region and the Western Region.

    The Eastern Region operates 88 distribution  centers in 11 states, of  which
40 are in Florida, 14 in Ohio, 9 in Mississippi, 6 in Alabama, 4 in Louisiana, 4
in  Georgia, 3 in Delaware, 2  in Maryland, 2 in Tennessee,  2 in Oklahoma, 1 in
Virginia and 1 in Freeport, Grand Bahamas.

                                       1
<PAGE>
    The Western Region operates 83 locations  in 10 states, consisting of 39  in
Texas,  12 in  California, 9 in  Louisiana, 7 in  Oklahoma, 7 in  Arkansas, 4 in
Missouri, 2 in Arizona, and 1 in each of Colorado, Illinois and New Mexico.

    Each of the Company's electrical distribution locations serves an area  with
approximately  a 50 mile  radius and serves the  needs of electrical contractors
engaged in  construction  work on  commercial  and residential  structures.  The
Company  also  provides materials  to industrial  customers for  maintenance and
repairs and for the manufacture of  equipment. In addition, the Company has  two
divisions  focused on specialty markets: the DataCom division, which distributes
products used to  interconnect voice, data  and video systems,  and the  Cummins
division,  which  distributes  supplies  to  the  utility  industry.  These  two
divisions generated approximately 8% of the Company's sales in 1994.

    In 1994, the Company served over  75,000 customers, with no single  customer
accounting  for more than  3% of total  annual sales. The  Company's ten largest
customers in 1994 represented less than 7.5% of sales. Management believes  that
approximately  50%  of  the  Company's  sales  are  from  the construction-based
electrical  contractor   market.  The   remainder   are  sold   to   industrial,
governmental, municipal and utility company customers.

    Management  believes that  the Company is  the fifth  largest distributor of
electrical parts and  supplies in the  United States, although  there are  other
companies  which account for significantly  greater national volume. The Company
competes with national chains (some  of which are affiliated with  manufacturing
companies)  and  other  independent distributors  operating  single  or multiple
outlets. Because  the  electrical  supply  business  is  fragmented  and  highly
competitive,  service and price  are essential components  of success. A typical
Willcox & Gibbs electrical  distribution location consists of  a 20,000 sq.  ft.
warehouse and office facility, ten inside and outside sales representatives, one
technical  specialist, six warehouse and delivery personnel, and four management
and support  personnel.  An  average branch  has  approximately  400  customers,
maintains  an inventory  of about  15,000 items,  and makes  deliveries within a
50-mile radius. Small branches are often grouped to constitute a profit center.

    The Company's extensive product line  includes electrical supplies, such  as
cable,  cords,  boxes, covers,  wiring  devices, conduit,  raceway  duct, safety
switches, motor controls,  breakers, panels, lamps,  fuses and related  supplies
and  accessories, residential, commercial and industrial electrical fixtures and
other special  use  fixtures,  as  well as  materials  and  special  cables  for
computers  and advanced communications systems. The products sold by the Company
are purchased from over 500 manufacturers  and other suppliers, the two  largest
of which accounted in the aggregate for approximately 14% of the Company's total
purchases during 1994, with none of the remainder accounting for more than 5%.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

    APPAREL PARTS AND SUPPLIES DISTRIBUTION

    In  July 1994, the Company sold  its apparel parts and supplies distribution
businesses, which are described below, for consideration valued at approximately
$44 million.

    The Company's former Sunbrand  Division marketed to  the apparel industry  a
wide  range of sewing  equipment parts, supplies  and other equipment, including
pressing and finishing  equipment, fabric spreading  machines and  reconditioned
equipment.  Its product  line included  needles, tools,  electric and electronic
devices and warehouse  equipment. Sunbrand's executive  offices were located  in
Atlanta.  Sunbrand  had  seven office/distribution  centers  located  near major
apparel manufacturing areas  in Atlanta,  El Paso,  Fall River  (Massachusetts),
Miami, Mexico City, Nashville, and Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic).

    The Company's former Unity Sewing Supply Division ("Unity"), an importer and
distributor of non-trademarked ("generic") parts for industrial sewing machines,
was  headquartered in New York with branch  offices in Los Angeles and Miami. It
sold to dealers,  not to  manufacturers or end  users. The  majority of  Unity's
parts were manufactured in Japan, Germany and the United States.

                                       2
<PAGE>
    The  Company's  former subsidiary,  Willcox  & Gibbs,  Ltd.,  a wholly-owned
United Kingdom subsidiary,  marketed sewing equipment  in certain Common  Market
countries and sold generic sewing equipment parts in the United Kingdom.

    The   Company's  former  subsidiary,   Leadtec  Systems,  Inc.  ("Leadtec"),
distributed to  the  apparel  industry  a  computer-based  real-time  production
control  system,  marketed  under  the  name  "Satellite  Plus",  which utilized
hardware manufactured by others and proprietary software designed by Leadtec.

    COVERED ELASTIC YARN

    Prior to  1993,  the Company  owned  Worldtex and  its  subsidiaries,  which
engaged  in  the  manufacture of  covered  elastic yarn.  These  operations were
disposed of by the  Company pursuant to the  Distribution on November 12,  1992.
While  owned  by the  Company, Worldtex's  principal  product was  nylon covered
spandex used in the manufacture of women's pantyhose, which accounted for 58% of
Worldtex's 1992  sales. Worldtex  also sold  covered spandex  and covered  latex
rubber for use in the manufacture of men's, women's and children's socks.

EMPLOYEES

    As  of December  31, 1994,  the Company had  a total  of approximately 2,800
employees. Approximately  45  employees  are covered  by  collective  bargaining
agreements.  The Company  has experienced  no significant  labor problems during
recent years and considers that its employee relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    The Company's executive offices  are located in leased  office space at  150
Alhambra  Circle, Coral Gables, Florida.  Of the Company's distribution centers,
42 are owned by subsidiaries of the Company and 129 are leased. These leases are
classified as operating  leases and expire  in various years  through 2002.  The
Company's distribution centers generally range from 4,000 to 105,000 square feet
and  include office and warehouse facilities. The average distribution center is
approximately 20,000 square feet.

    Eleven of the Company's distribution centers are leased from Robert  Merson,
a  Senior Vice President of  the Company and President  of the Company's Eastern
Region, and/or members of his or his wife's family, for terms extending  through
2002.  The Company believes that these leases are on terms at least as favorable
as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    There are  no material  pending legal  proceedings as  of the  date of  this
Report  to which the Company or  any of its subsidiaries is  a party or to which
any of their property is subject.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    During the  last quarter  of  the Company's  fiscal  year, no  matters  were
submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders.

</TABLE>

    At  March  10, 1995,  there were  approximately 1,389  holders of  record of
Common Stock.

    No dividends have  been paid on  the Company's Common  Stock since the  last
quarter  of  1991. Future  payment  of cash  dividends  by the  Company  will be
dependent on such  factors as  business conditions, earnings  and the  financial
condition of the Company.

    The terms of the Company's 9.78% Senior Notes, dated as of April 2, 1991, as
amended,  restrict  dividends and  certain other  payments  with respect  to the
Company's capital stock  if the sum  thereof for the  period since December  31,
1992, exceeds the sum of (i) 35% of net cash proceeds from the sale of stock and
certain  subordinated debt  for such period,  plus (ii) 35%  of consolidated net
income (as

                                       4
<PAGE>
defined) for such  period. In  addition, the  Note Agreement  and the  Company's
Revolving  Credit and  Reimbursement Agreement, dated  as of  December 17, 1993,
require that the Company meet certain financial tests that could have the effect
of restricting the Company's ability to pay dividends.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

    The following tables set  forth certain consolidated  financial data of  the
Company  and its subsidiaries for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 1994,

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

    SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS

    In April 1992,  the Company,  Rexel, S.A.  (formerly known  at Compagnie  de
Distribution   de  Materiel   Electrique)  ("Rexel"),   International  Technical
Distributors, Inc. ("ITD"), a subsidiary of Rexel, and Southern Electric  Supply
Company,  Inc.  ("SES"), a  subsidiary  of ITD  engaged  in the  distribution of
electrical  materials,  entered  into   a  Purchase  Agreement  (the   "Purchase
Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Rexel and
ITD 6,284,301 shares of Company Common Stock in exchange for all of the stock of
SES and approximately $10 million in cash. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement,  the Company  declared a dividend  consisting of one  share of common
stock of the Company's subsidiary Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex") for each share  of
Company  Common Stock outstanding on November  23, 1992 (the "Distribution" and,
together with such transactions with Rexel, the "1992 Transactions"). In  August
1992,  the Company  transferred to  Worldtex all of  the stock  of the Company's
subsidiaries engaged in  the manufacture of  covered elastic yarn.  Accordingly,
these  businesses  are reflected  as  discontinued operations  in  the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Also during  1992,  the  Company  sold  its  data  communications  equipment
distribution business and an apparel related unit. On July 13, 1994, the Company
sold  its  apparel  parts  and supplies  distribution  businesses  (the "Apparel
Division") for  consideration of  approximately  $44 million.  Accordingly,  the
Apparel  Division  is  shown  as  a  discontinued  operation  in  the  Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    In April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks Electrical Supply Co. ("Sacks"), a
distributor of electrical supplies and components with three locations in  Ohio,
for  $13.6 million.  On December 17,  1993, the Company  acquired Summers Group,
Inc. ("Summers"), an electrical parts distributor, for $60 million in cash and a
$25 million three year note issued to the seller, plus contingent  consideration
to  be determined based on  Summers' profits before interest  and taxes for 1993
and 1994, subject to a maximum purchase price of $120 million. In December 1994,
the Company agreed to prepay such  note and cancel the contingent  consideration
in  exchange for cash  payments that brought  the total cash  purchase price for
Summers to $90.95 million (including $0.7 million of acquisition costs).

    On March 1, 1994, the Company sold 3,491,280 newly-issued shares of  Company
common  stock to Rexel for a total  purchase price of $31.4 million. Pursuant to
the Company's agreement with Rexel, the size of the Company's Board of Directors
was reduced from twelve to nine, five of whom are nominees of Rexel.

    During the second half  of 1994, the operations  of the Company's  principal
subsidiaries,  Summers, Sacks,  SES and  the Consolidated  Electric Supply group
("CES"), were reorganized along geographical lines into two regions: the Eastern
Region and the Western Region. As part  of this process, the Company closed  six
redundant  or underperforming locations and opened ten new distribution centers.
In addition,  the Company  implemented cost  reduction programs,  including  the
consolidation  and redesign of employee benefit and casualty insurance programs,
established new management incentive programs focused on profit growth and asset
management and commenced  upgrade of  its Eastern  Region's computer  management
information system.

    As  a  result of  the aforementioned  transactions and  discontinuances, the
Company is  now  engaged in  only  one  business segment:  the  distribution  of
electrical  parts  and  supplies,  principally in  the  southern  United States.
Assuming the Sacks and Summers acquisitions  had been consummated as of  January
1,  1992 and the SES acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 1991, the
Company's unaudited pro forma  sales would have been  $958.5 million and  $907.3
million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

</TABLE>

    1994 V. 1993

    Sales increased $544.0  million in 1994  to $1.066 billion.  Sales for  1994
included  a total of $560.8 million from  Summers and Sacks, which were acquired
in December 1993 and April  1993, respectively. Had these acquisitions  occurred
on  January 1, 1993, pro forma 1993 sales would be $958.5 million. The pro forma
sales increase  in  1994  of  11.2%  was  attributable  to  favorable  new  home
construction  markets and growth of sales in the utility and data communications
markets.

    Gross margins declined in 1994 to 19.9% from 20.6% in 1993. This decline was
primarily attributable to the 36% increase  during 1994 in the price of  copper,
an  important component of  the goods distributed  by the Company.  Over half of
this increase occurred  in the  last four months  of the  year. While  inflation
tends  to improve the Company's margins, since so much of the increase in copper
prices occurred late in the year, the improved margins could not offset the $7.2
million increase in LIFO  reserves primarily caused by  the inflation in  copper
wire prices.

    Selling  and administrative expense increased to $187.4 million in 1994 from
$90.4 million in 1993,  reflecting the additional  operations added through  the
above-mentioned acquisitions. As a percentage of sales, such expenses were 17.6%
in  1994 compared to 17.3% in 1993. Included in selling and administrative costs
for 1994 were nonrecurring charges  totaling $4.9 million consisting of  charges
primarily  associated with  the resignation of  an officer of  the company ($2.1
million), the relocation of the corporate office to Coral Gables, Florida  ($0.7
million)  and replacement of  certain computer systems  in the Company's Eastern
Region ($2.1 million).  These nonrecurring costs  amounted to 0.5%  of sales  in
1994.  Depreciation and amortization increased to $9.7 million in 1994 from $5.2
million in  1993, reflecting  increased  amortization of  goodwill on  the  1993
acquisitions  of  Sacks and  Summers  and the  $2.1  million for  replacement of
computer systems.

    Interest expense increased  to $9.6  million in  1994 from  $5.9 million  in
1993. While the Company reduced its borrowings $77.1 million by the end of 1994,
interest  expense increased due to additional debt arising in 1993 in connection
with the acquisitions of Sacks and Summers and the increase in interest rates on
short-term debt. Additionally, discontinued operations absorbed $2.0 million  in
interest expense in 1994 compared to $3.9 million in 1993.

    Other  income-net increased  to $1.0  million in  1994 from  $0.7 million in
1993, primarily reflecting  higher earnings from  short-term investments  during
the second half of 1994.

    Income  from continuing  operations increased to  $9.3 million  in 1994 from
$6.9 million in  1993, reflecting  the additional operations  added through  the
acquisitions of Sacks and Summers in 1993.

                                       7
<PAGE>
    1993 V. 1992

    The  Company's sales increased by $162.4 million in 1993, to $521.5 million.
Excluding the impact of  the acquisitions of SES,  Sacks and Summers,  full-year
sales  were up about 3.8%. CES's  increase resulted primarily from the improving
housing market,  although commercial  construction continued  to lag.  Full-year
sales for SES, Sacks, and Summers as a group were up in 1993 compared with 1992,
reflecting   the  continued  market-share  strength  of  these  units  in  their
respective geographic areas. Full year sales for these divisions totalled $601.3
million in  1993,  including, as  to  Sacks and  Summers,  the period  prior  to
acquisition.  Certain geographic regions  showed an upturn  in 1993. However, no
assurance can be given  that this trend will  continue. Declining copper  prices
and  strong  competition  for  market  share continue  to  put  pressure  on the
Company's gross margin, which increased slightly in 1993, to 20.6%.

    Selling  and  administrative  expenses  increased  $24.4  million  in  1993,
reflecting   the  additional   operations  added   through  the  above-mentioned
acquisitions. However, as a percentage of sales such expenses decreased to 17.3%
in 1993 as compared to 18.3% in 1992, reflecting cost containment programs and a
higher level of sales.

    Interest expense in 1993 was $5.9 million, compared with $5.4 million a year
ago. Although the Company reduced its debt at the end of 1992 in connection with
the 1992  Transactions,  it  increased  its  borrowings  in  1993  to  fund  the
acquisitions  of Sacks and  Summers. Other income-net in  1993 was $0.7 million,
compared  to  $0.1  million  in  1992,  reflecting  principally  earnings   from
short-term investments during the first half of 1993.

    Income from continuing operations increased $19.3 million to $6.9 million in
1993,  reflecting principally the costs  for 1992 Transactions and restructuring
charges that were accrued in 1992.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

</TABLE>

    The Apparel Division was sold July  13, 1994 and accordingly, sales and  net
income of the Apparel Division reflect activity through that date.

    INCOME TAXES

    The  Company had effective income tax rates  of 44%, 43% and (6.3)% in 1994,
1993, and 1992.  The 1994 rate  reflects the  impact of state  and local  taxes,
non-deductible  goodwill  amortization and  increase in  the deferred  tax asset
valuation allowance, reduced by the current deductibility of certain prior  year
transaction  costs. The 1993 rate reflects the  above as well as a reduction due
to the impact of the utilitzation  of federal capital loss carryforwards and  an
increase in the federal corporate income tax rate.

    Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting from
the  deferred  method  to  the  liability  method  required  by  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income  Taxes" (see  Note 10 of  the Notes  to the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements). As permitted under Statement 109, prior years' financial
statements have not been restated.  The cumulative effect of adopting  Statement
109  as of January  1, 1993 was to  increase net income by  $660,000 or $.03 per
share for 1993.

                                       8
<PAGE>
    As of December 31,  1994 and 1993, the  Company had recognized deferred  tax
assets  of $10.2 million and $11.3 million, respectively, arising primarily from
basis differences between  the recorded value  for financial reporting  purposes
and  tax basis  of accounts  receivable, inventory  and various  liabilities and
reserves, including  restructuring  and  transaction costs.  Such  deferred  tax
assets  have been  reduced by  a valuation  allowance of  $1.3 million  and $1.1
million in 1994 and 1993, respectively. In addition, the Company has  recognized
deferred  tax liabilities  totaling $9.4  million and  $7.8 million  in 1994 and
1993, respectively, arising principally  from a higher  recorded value over  tax
basis of property, plant and equipment and certain acquisitions.

    LIQUIDITY; CAPITAL RESOURCES

    At  December  31, 1994,  the  Company had  $23.8  million in  cash  and cash
equivalents, compared to  $19.1 million  at December  31, 1993,  and had  $119.7
million  of indebtedness for borrowed  money (including current installments and
short-term debt), compared to $196.7 million at December 31, 1993. Total  assets
decreased  $14.0 million as of the end  of 1994 to $414.5 million, primarily due
to the disposition of the Apparel Division as discussed below.

    During 1994, the Company generated $33.1 million in cash from its  operating
activities compared to $5.8 million in 1993, primarily reflecting improvement in
various  working capital items and a full  year's operating income from the 1993
acquisitions of Sacks and Summers. Net cash provided by investing activities  in
1994  totalled $17.6 million, reflecting net  cash proceeds from the disposal of
the Apparel Division  of $37.2 million,  offset by net  capital expenditures  of
$12.1  million, the $5.3 million payment  to terminate contingent purchase price
obligations in connection  with the  Summers acquisition and  other payments  of
$2.2  million.  Capital expenditures  increased $6.7  million  in 1994  to $12.1
million, reflecting the full year impact  of the 1993 acquisitions of Sacks  and
Summers  and investment in additional computer equipment and software associated
with the replacement of certain computer systems in the Eastern Region. Net cash
used in investing  activities in 1993  of $62.8 million  reflects the  Company's
acquisitions  of  Sacks  and  Summers,  which  utilized  $68.3  million,  offset
partially by proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $12.9 million.

    Net cash  used  in financing  activities  in 1994  totalled  $46.0  million,
reflecting  primarily the payment of  debt from the proceeds  of the issuance of
common stock to Rexel in March 1994,  and the sale of the Apparel Division.  Net
cash provided by financing activities in 1993 totalled $60.6 million, reflecting
borrowings  under credit arrangements to fund the 1993 acquisitions of Sacks and
Summers.

    The Company had a current ratio of 1.6 at December 31, 1994 compared to  1.3
at  December 31, 1993. The improvement is primarily the result of improvement in
inventory days  to 76  days  in 1994  from  84 days  in  1993 and  reduction  in
short-term  debt in 1994. The number of days sales represented by trade accounts
receivable were 48 at  December 31, 1994  compared to 50  at December 31,  1993.
Trade  working capital turnover  for the year  1994 improved to  7.1 from 6.2 in
1993.

    The ratio of  borrowings (debt) to  stockholders' equity improved  to .9  at
December  31, 1994 from 2.1 at  December 31, 1993, reflecting improved operating
cash flow and the reduction of borrowings from the proceeds of the common  stock
issuance to Rexel and the sale of the Apparel Division in 1994.

    In  April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks for $13.6 million in cash, and in
December 1993, the Company acquired  Summers for $60 million  in cash and a  $25
million  three year  note, plus contingent  consideration, subject  to a maximum
purchase price of $120 million. In  December 1994, the Company agreed to  prepay
such  note and cancel the contingent consideration in exchange for cash payments
that brought  the  total cash  purchase  price  for Summers  to  $90.95  million
(including  $0.7 million  of acquisition  costs). The  Company regularly reviews
possible acquisitions of  businesses, and may  from time to  time in the  future
acquire  other  businesses. The  Company  otherwise currently  expects  that its
capital expenditures during 1995 will be consistent with historical requirements
for the electrical distribution business.

    The Company is party  to the Revolving  Credit and Reimbursement  Agreement,
dated  as of  December 17,  1993 (the  "Credit Agreement"),  with NationsBank of
Florida, N. A., and  Credit Lyonnais New York  Branch. The Credit Agreement  was
amended  on March 30,  1995 and currently  provides for borrowings  from time to
time through March 31, 2000  of up to $40  million. Borrowings under the  Credit
Agreement bear interest at NationsBank's prime rate, or at a rate based on rates
in  the certificate  of deposit  market or  LIBOR, plus  a margin,  which margin
varies depending on  the Company's financial  performance. The Credit  Agreement
includes  various  covenants, including  restrictions on  liens, debt  and lease
obligations and requirements that certain financial ratios be maintained.

    The Company's working capital requirements  are generally met by  internally
generated  funds and short-term borrowings.  Management believes sufficient cash
resources will be available to  support its long-term growth strategies  through
internally  generated funds, credit arrangements and  the ability of the company
to obtain  additional  financing.  However,  no  assurance  can  be  given  that
financing will continue to be available on attractive terms.

    The  Company continually reviews  the impact of  inflation. Pricing policies
are reviewed regularly and, to the extent permitted by competition, the  Company
passes  increased  costs on  by  increasing the  sales  price. The  Company will
continue to monitor the impact of  inflation and will consider these matters  in
setting its pricing policies.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Willcox & Gibbs, Inc.:

    We  have  audited the  consolidated financial  statements and  the financial
statement schedule of Willcox & Gibbs, Inc. and subsidiaries listed in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement schedule  are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an  opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all  material respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of  Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  December  31,  1994  and  1993  and  the
consolidated  results of their operations  and their cash flows  for each of the
three years in the period ended  December 31, 1994 in conformity with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles. In  addition,  in our  opinion,  the financial
statement schedule referred to above, when  considered in relation to the  basic
financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole,  presents  fairly,  in  all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.

    As discussed in Note  10 of the consolidated  financial statements, in  1993
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

        continuing   operations.  Had  the  FIFO   method  been  used  to  value
        inventories, total inventories would  have increased $12,867 and  $5,632
        at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

        For the discontinued operations, inventories were stated at the lower of
        FIFO  cost or  market and  were included  in Net  Assets of Discontinued
        Operations at December 31, 1993.

    (d) INVESTMENTS AND NONCURRENT RECEIVABLES

        Effective January 1,  1994, the Company  adopted Statement of  Financial
        Accounting Standard No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
        and Equity Securities", which addresses the accounting and reporting for
        investments  in equity  securities that  have readily  determinable fair
        value  and  for  all  investments  in  debt  securities.  The   Standard
        classifies  investments into one  of three categories: Held-to-maturity,
        Available-for-sale, and Trading.

        At December 31, 1994, the Company has classified its investments in debt
        securities as "Trading". These investments are included as part of  Cash
        and  Cash Equivalents  based on  their liquidity.  Investments in equity
        securities have been classified as "Available-for-sale". The fair  value
        of these securities at year end was approximately $625. The Company does
        not  believe that  adoption of this  new Standard has  had a significant
        effect on its financial statements.

    (e) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

        Depreciation,  computed  by  means  of  straight-line  and   accelerated
        methods,  is based on the estimated  useful lives of the related assets.
        Leasehold improvements are amortized  over their respective lease  terms
        or their estimated useful lives, if shorter.

        Cost  in excess  of net  assets of  acquired businesses  ("goodwill") is
        amortized over 40 years. At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews
        the carrying  value of  goodwill  in relation  to current  and  expected
        operating  results of the businesses which benefit therefrom in order to
        assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of goodwill.

    (f) FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

        Solely in connection  with the apparel  parts and supplies  distribution
        business,  which was  sold on  July 13,  1994, the  Company entered into
        forward exchange contracts in limited  circumstances as a hedge  against
        purchases  with extended  terms denominated  in foreign  currency. These
        contracts were used by the Company to minimize exposure and reduce  risk
        from  exchange rate  fluctuations in the  regular course  of its foreign
        apparel business. Gains  and losses on  forward contracts were  deferred
        and  included  in  the  measurement  of  the  related  foreign  currency
        transaction. Cash provided and used for forward contracts is included in
        the cash flows resulting from changes  in accounts and notes payable  --
        trade.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    (g) INCOME TAXES

        No  provision  is  made  for  income  taxes  which  may  be  payable  if
        undistributed earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries were  to  be  paid  as
        dividends  to the Company, since the  Company intends that such earnings
        will continue to be invested in  those countries. At December 31,  1993,
        the  cumulative  amount of  foreign  undistributed earnings  amounted to
        approximately $630. Foreign tax credits may be available as a  reduction
        of United States income taxes in the event of such distributions.

    (h) EARNINGS PER SHARE

        Primary  earnings per share are based  on the weighted average number of
        common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year.

    (i) RECLASSIFICATIONS

        Certain prior year amounts  have been reclassified  to conform with  the
        1994 presentation.

2.  SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS
    On  November 12, 1992, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated April 22, 1992
among the Company, Rexel, S.A. (formerly  known as Compagnie de Distribution  de
Materiel  Electrique)  ("Rexel"),  International  Technical  Distributors,  Inc.
("ITD"), a subsidiary of Rexel, and Southern Electric Supply Company ("SES"),  a
subsidiary  of  ITD engaged  in the  distribution  of electrical  components and
supplies, the Company issued to Rexel and ITD 6,284,301 shares of the  Company's
common  stock. In exchange for such  stock issuance, the Company received $9,885
in cash and all the capital stock of SES. The SES acquisition was accounted  for
by  the purchase method (see Note 3). Common stock and capital surplus have been
adjusted for the  proceeds received from  the common stock  issuance less  issue
costs of $2,056.

    Pursuant  to an  Investment Agreement  entered into  in connection  with the
Purchase Agreement, Rexel agreed to certain limitations on its ownership of  the
outstanding common stock of the Company and to certain other restrictions during
the  five  years after  closing. On  March 1,  1994, the  Company sold  to Rexel
3,491,280 newly issued shares of Company common stock for a total cash  purchase
price  of $31,422, which was  used to repay short-term  debt. As a result, Rexel
increased its  beneficial  ownership of  the  outstanding common  stock  of  the
Company  from 30% to 40%.  In connection with that  purchase, the Company, Rexel
and ITD executed  an amendment to  the Investment Agreement  which, among  other
things,  permited Rexel to  increase its beneficial  ownership of Company common
stock to  45%  and provided  for  termination  of the  Investment  Agreement  on
December  31, 1994.  As of  February 6,  1995, Rexel  had further  increased its
beneficial ownership to approximately 43.7%.

    In  connection  with  the  November   12,  1992  transaction,  the   Company
distributed Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex"), its covered yarn manufacturing segment,
as  a dividend to its  stockholders during the fourth  quarter of 1992. Worldtex
owns the  former subsidiaries  of  the Company  engaged  in the  manufacture  of
covered yarn. Effective with the dividend, retained earnings was charged $58,547
for  the book value of the net  assets distributed, including assets of $152,407
and liabilities  of $93,860.  Liabilities included  $32,000 of  debt assumed  by
Worldtex  which was previously  outstanding under the  Company's prior revolving
credit arrangement.  The results  of the  covered yarn  operation for  1992  are
included  in the  Consolidated Statements  of Income  as discontinued operations
(see Note 4).

    Results for  1992 include  transaction-related costs  of $15,344,  including
certain  investment advisor  services, legal  and accounting  fees and executive
incentive payments, in connection with these transactions.

3.  ACQUISITIONS
    On April 12, 1993 the Company acquired the common stock of Sacks  Electrical
Supply  Co. ("Sacks"), a distributor of  electrical supplies and components with
three  locations  in  Ohio,  for  $13.9  million  (including  $0.3  million   of
acquisition costs).

    On  December  17, 1993,  the Company  acquired the  common stock  of Summers
Group, Inc. ("Summers")  for $60 million  in cash and  a $25 million  three-year
note  issued to the seller, plus contingent consideration to be determined based
on defined  profits of  Summers, subject  to a  maximum purchase  price of  $120
million.  On December  22, 1994,  the Company  reached an  agreement pursuant to
which the Company paid $5.25  million in cash and agreed  to pay the balance  of
the  $25 million note ($16.7 million) prior to June 30, 1995, and the contingent
consideration was  cancelled.  The additional  payments,  plus $0.7  million  of
acquisition  costs, bring the total purchase price to $90.95 million. Summers is
a distributor of  electrical parts  and supplies with  locations principally  in
Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, California and Arkansas.

    Each  of these 1993  acquisitions has been  recorded as a  purchase, and the
excess of  the total  purchase  price over  the fair  value  of the  net  assets
acquired  ($7.1  million  for Sacks  and  $25.6  million for  Summers)  is being
amortized over 40 years. Sacks' and Summers' results of operations are  included
in the Company's financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

    As  discussed in Note  2 of the Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements,
the Company acquired all of the issued capital stock of SES in exchange for  the
issuance  of 4,636,994 shares of the  Company's common stock. The total purchase
price was $21,370, representing market value  of the shares and certain  closing
costs.  The  shares  include 628,430  shares  issued  in 1993.  SES'  results of
operations are included in the Company's  financial statements from the date  of
acquisition.  The acquisition has been recorded as  a purchase and the excess of
the total  purchase  price  over the  fair  value  of the  net  assets  acquired
($10,475) is being amortized over 40 years.

    The  following table summarizes the effect  on consolidated sales and income
(loss) from  continuing operations  of the  Company  for 1993  and 1992,  on  an
unaudited  pro forma basis, assuming the Sacks and Summers acquisitions had been
consummated as of January 1, 1992  and the SES acquisition had been  consummated
as of January 1, 1991.

4.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
    In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company decided to sell its apparel parts
and supplies distribution business ("Apparel") and engaged an investment banking
firm,  of which a director of the Company is president, to seek a purchaser. The
sale was consummated on July 13, 1994 for consideration valued at  approximately
$44.0 million, consisting of cash of $38.6 million ($37.2 million net of costs),
a  $3 million subordinated note from the  buyer valued at $2.3 million, warrants
to purchase approximately 15%  of the buyer valued  at $0.7 million and  324,814
shares of Company common stock valued at $2.1 million. The net proceeds from the
sale approximated book value of the net assets sold,

but  resulted in a loss on disposal of $0.7 million, net of taxes, due primarily
to the  recognition  of  previously  established  deferred  foreign  translation
adjustments.  In connection with the sale,  the investment banking firm was paid
$0.5 million.  Accordingly,  this  business  is  included  in  the  Consolidated
Statements  of Income as  discontinued operations for  all periods presented. As
discussed in Note  2, the  covered yarn  operation is  included as  discontinued
operations in 1992. Summarized results of the discontinued operations (excluding
the loss on disposal) are as follows:

5.  SHORT-TERM DEBT
    The Company entered  into a  Revolving Credit  and Reimbursement  Agreement,
dated  as of  December 17,  1993 (the  "Credit Agreement"),  with NationsBank of
Florida, N.A.,  and  Credit  Lyonnais  New York  Branch.  The  Credit  Agreement
originally provided for borrowings from time to time through December 1997 of up
to  the lesser of (i) $90 million ($50 million as of July 13, 1994) and (ii) the
sum of 80% of  eligible accounts receivable and  50% of eligible inventory.  The

was  amended on March 30, 1995 to  provide for borrowings through March 31, 2000
of up to $40 million with no limitation due to levels of accounts receivable and
inventory. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at  NationsBank's
prime  rate, or at a rate based on rates in the certificate of deposit market or
LIBOR, plus a margin, which margin  varies depending on the Company's  financial
performance.   The  Credit  Agreement   includes  various  covenants,  including
restrictions on liens, debt and lease obligations and requirements that  certain
financial ratios be maintained.

8.  STOCK OPTION PLANS, STOCK ACQUISITION PLAN AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP
PLAN (CONTINUED)
    All options were granted at market value on the date of grant.

    As  of December 31,  1994, options for  the purchase of  245,753 shares were

    The Company's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which became effective in 1981,
provides eligible employees with an opportunity to purchase the Company's common
stock through payroll deductions, which are  matched by the Company, subject  to
certain  limitations. Contributions to  the plan are  invested by an independent
trustee  in  common  stock  of  the  Company.  Stock  attributable  to   Company
contributions  vests at the rate of 10%  for each twelve months of contributions
by the employee, with  100% vesting after five  years of service. The  Company's
contributions  to the plan, net of forfeitures, charged to income for 1994, 1993
and 1992 were $592, $695 and $758, respectively. Effective January 1, 1995, this
plan was merged  into a  new plan  known as the  Willcox &  Gibbs, Inc.  Section
401(k) Savings Plan.

9.  PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
    The  Company has  a qualified  noncontributory defined  benefit pension plan
covering certain eligible domestic employees.  The Company also had a  qualified
noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan covering certain eligible domestic
employees in the  discontinued apparel operation.  As part of  the agreement  to
sell  the apparel  operation, the purchaser  assumed all  obligations under this
plan. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually the maximum  amount
that  can be deducted  for Federal income  tax purposes. The  Company also has a
non-qualified  defined  benefit  supplemental   retirement  plan  covering   key
employees,  which is not funded. The benefits of all plans are based on years of
service and defined levels of compensation.

    The Company  also  had  a  defined  benefit  plan  maintained  for  eligible
employees  of certain United  Kingdom subsidiaries included  in the discontinued
apparel operation. The plan is funded annually for the maximum amount  permitted
by  statute. The benefits  are based on  years of service  and defined levels of
compensation.

    Under the collective bargaining agreement of the textile industry in France,
employees of  a  subsidiary Worldtex  are  entitled  to a  lump-sum  payment  at
retirement  based on their  length of service  at retirement and  final pay. All
obligations under this  plan were  assumed by  Worldtex in  connection with  the
dividend.

    For the non-qualified domestic plan, no  salary increase was assumed as  the
Company  has frozen salaries under the plan at current levels. Liabilities under
this plan  attributable  to  Worldtex  employees were  assumed  by  Worldtex  in
connection with the dividend of Worldtex.

    For  the United Kingdom plan, the assumed discount rate at December 31, 1993
and 1992  was 9.0%  and 10.0%,  respectively.  The rate  of increase  in  future
compensation  levels was 9.0% for both years  and the expected long-term rate of
return on assets was 9.0% at December 31, 1993 and 10.0% at December 31, 1992.

    For the  French plan,  the assumed  discount rate  and rate  of increase  in
future compensation levels were 9.0% and 5.0%, respectively.

    Certain  subsidiaries have noncontributory  profit-sharing plans and defined
contribution pension  plans  providing  for  minimum  contributions  based  upon
defined levels of subsidiary income or employee compensation.

    In 1995, all defined benefits and profit sharing plans have been merged into
a new Willcox & Gibbs, Inc. Section 401(k).

    Pension  and profit-sharing expense  for the years  ended December 31, 1994,
1993 and 1992 amounted to approximately $2,880, $1,338 and $2,141, respectively.

    A subsidiary of the Company, acquired in 1993, provides certain health  care
benefits  for eligible retired employees. The status of the plan at December 31,
1994 and 1993 is as follows:

PLANS (CONTINUED)
    The  plan is unfunded. The discount rate  used in determining APBO was 8.25%
and 7.25% at December 31, 1994  and 1993, respectively. The assumed health  care
trend rate assumed for 1995 was 11.5%. Increasing assumed health care trends one
percentage point will increase the APBO by $83 as of December 31, 1994.

10. INCOME TAXES
    Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income  Taxes." Under Statement 109, the  liability method is used in accounting
for income taxes.  Under this method,  deferred tax assets  and liabilities  are
determined  based on  differences between financial  reporting and  tax bases of
assets and liabilities  and are measured  using the enacted  tax rates and  laws
that  will be in effect  when the differences are  expected to reverse. Prior to
the adoption  of Statement  109, income  tax expense  was determined  using  the
deferred  method. Deferred tax expense was based  on items of income and expense
that were  reported in  different  years in  the  financial statements  and  tax
returns  and were measured at the tax rate  in effect in the year the difference
originated.

    As permitted by Statement  109, the Company has  elected not to restate  the
financial  statements of  any prior  years. The effect  of the  change on pretax
income from continuing operations for the  year ended December 31, 1993 was  not
material;  however, the cumulative  effect of the  change as of  January 1, 1993
increased net income by $660 or $.03 per share.

    The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries  file Federal income tax returns on  a
consolidated basis. The provision (benefit) for income taxes has been classified
as follows in the consolidated statements of income:

</TABLE>

    The minimum annual commitments include amounts payable to an officer of  the
Company  and/or members of his  and his wife's family  and amounts payable to an
officer of a subsidiary as follows: 1995 - $855; 1996 - $731; 1997 - $671;  1998
-$630; 1999 - $630; thereafter - $1,417.

    Total  rent expense charged  to operations for the  years ended December 31,
1994, 1993  and  1992  amounted  to approximately  $9,498,  $6,589  and  $5,148,
respectively.

    In  the  normal course  of business,  the  Company is  sometimes named  as a
defendant in litigation. In the opinion of management, based upon the advice  of
counsel,  any uninsured  liability which may  result from the  resolution of any
present litigation or  asserted claim  will not have  a material  effect on  the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

13. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    In connection with the resignation of  an executive of the Company on  March
18,  1994,  the  Company entered  into  an  agreement with  such  executive that
provided, among other things, certain payments and acceleration of certain other
payments in  connection  with  the  executive's  related  employment  agreement.
Results  for  1994  include charges  of  $1.7  million in  connection  with this
agreement.

    The Company has recorded charges to operations of $5,586 for the years ended
December 31,  1992 related  to certain  restructuring actions  initiated by  the
Company ($1,248 is included in discontinued apparel operations).

    In  1992, the  Company sold  its data  communications equipment distribution
business and an  apparel-related unit in  return for $3,350  in cash, $1,858  of
short  and long-term notes and  a marketable equity security  with a fair market
value of $1,500. The disposal of  these businesses relate to actions  originally
initiated  in  1991. The  Company  also initiated  other  restructuring actions,
including the disposal of other operations, that do not relate to the  Company's
core business.

    In  1992, certain restructuring actions initiated  in 1991 and 1990 required
more costs to implement than originally expected. The additional costs, included
in the  restructuring charges  for this  period, changed  based on  the  revised
estimates and experience to date.

          EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT dated as of March 18, 1994, between Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc., a New York corporation ("W&G"), whose business address is 530 Fifth
Avenue, New York, New York 10036, and Alain C. Viry, whose address is 36 rue de
Richelieu 75001, Paris, France ("Employee").

          Employee is currently a senior executive of Rexel, S.A., a substantial
stockholder of W&G, based in Paris, France.  In order to induce Employee to
become a senior executive of W&G, W&G desires to enter into this Employment
Contract with Employee, effective as of the date hereof, and Employee is willing
to do so, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

          Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements hereafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

          1.   TERM

          W&G agrees to employ Employee to perform services in a senior
executive capacity for a period (the "Employment Period") commencing as of the
date hereof and ending on the third anniversary of the date hereof, which period
shall be automatically extended thereafter for successive one year terms,
subject to termination at such time as is provided by Section 8.

          2.   NATURE OF SERVICES

          Initially and for so long during the Employment Period as is required
by W&G's Board of Directors, Employee shall be employed as chief executive
officer of W&G.  Employee's principal services shall be rendered in Coral
Gables, Florida.

          3.   AGREEMENT TO SERVE

          Employee agrees to his employment as described in Section 2 and
agrees to devote all of his business time and efforts during the Employment
Period to the performance of his duties under this Employment Contract;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that he shall be permitted to pursue personal and family
business and investment activities of a non-competitive nature so long as such
activities in the aggregate do not consume a material amount of business time
and effort and do not, in any event, interfere with the performance of his
duties under this Employment Contract.

                                                                               2


          4.   COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

          Employee's salary during the Employment Period shall be fixed from
time to time by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of W&G (the "Committee") but shall not be less than $300,000 per annum.
Employee's salary during the Employment Period shall be paid in equal
installments no less frequently than monthly.  In addition:

          (a)  Employee shall be entitled to receive such bonus or bonuses, with
respect to each calendar year or portion thereof during which the Employment
Period is in effect, as may be determined in accordance with such incentive plan
applicable to the executive officers of W&G as shall be approved by the
Committee; provided that Employee shall be entitled to a bonus of not less than
$75,000 with respect to 1994.  The bonus with respect to any year shall be paid
by March 1 of the next succeeding year.

          (b)  During the Employment Period, Employee shall be entitled to:  (i)
reimbursement for reasonable travel, entertainment and other expenses
necessarily incurred in the performance of his duties hereunder upon submission
and approval of written statements in accordance with W&G's standard policies as
in effect from time to time; (ii) reasonable vacations in accordance with W&G's
then current regular procedures governing executives: (iii) use of an automobile
in the business of W&G, for which W&G agrees to pay all insurance, maintenance
and fuel costs and license and registration fees; (iv) participation in all
compensation, pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs and policies
of W&G applicable to senior executives of W&G (except that Employee shall not be
included in W&G's medical and hospital insurance plan or retirement plans unless
he requests in writing to be included); and (v) such additional compensation, in
the form of incentive compensation or otherwise, and such participation in W&G
stock option, stock award, stock purchase or other stock plans, as the Committee
may from time to time provide.

          (c)  As reimbursement for Employee's costs and expenses of relocating
from France to the United States in 1994, W&G shall pay Employee $10,000 and
reimburse him for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Employee in moving his
property from France to Florida and one air fare (business class) from France to
the U.S. for each of Employee, his wife and his children.  In addition, W&G
shall pay Employee such additional amounts as shall be necessary to reimburse
him for any U.S. federal, state or local or French income taxes required to be
paid by Employee with respect to payments to him pursuant to this subsection (c)
(including this sentence), after taking into account any deductions to which
Employee is entitled with respect to the reimbursed expenses.

                                                                               3

(business class) for up to eight trips between the U.S. and France taken after
the date hereof and before September 1, 1995.

          (e)  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason (except
pursuant to Section 8(a)(iii) or Section 8(c), W&G will reimburse Employee for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Employee in moving his property to France
and one return air fare (business class) from the U.S. to France for each of
Employee, his wife and his children.

          5.   NON-COMPETITION

          Employee agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly (individually
or for, with or through any other person, firm or corporation), compete with W&G
or any of its subsidiaries (i) during the Employment Period with respect to any
business carried on by W&G or any such subsidiary or (ii) for a period of two
years after the end of the Employment Period with respect to any business
carried on at the end of the Employment Period by W&G or any of its subsidiaries
in North America.  Notwithstanding the foregoing:

          (a)  If W&G terminates the Employment Period other than as expressly
provided pursuant to this Employment Contract, this Section 5 shall cease to
apply from and after such wrongful termination.

          (b)  Employee shall be permitted to own not in excess of one percent
of any class of securities or any publicly traded company, PROVIDED Employee is
not part of any controlling group and is solely a passive investor.

          (c)  Employee shall be entitled to perform services for Rexel, S.A. or
any of its subsidiaries after the end of the Employment Period.

          6.   PATENTS, INVENTIONS

inventions, technological innovations, copyrights, developments and processes
now or hereinafter during his employment by W&G owned or developed by Employee
relating to the business of W&G or any subsidiary of W&G, shall belong to W&G,
and without further compensation, but at W&G's expense, forthwith upon request
of W&G, Employee shall execute any and all such assignments and other documents
and take any and all such other action as W&G may reasonably request in order to

<PAGE>

                                                                               4


vest in W&G all Employee's right, title and interest in and to such patents,
patent applications, inventions, technological innovations, copyrights,
developments or processes, free and clear of liens, charges and encumbrances.

          7.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

          All confidential information which Employee may now have or may obtain
during his employment by W&G relating to the business of W&G or any affiliate
thereof shall not be disclosed to any other person (except as required by law)
either during or after the termination of the Employment Period without the
prior written permission of W&G, and Employee shall return all tangible evidence
of such confidential information to W&G prior to or at the termination of the
Employment Period.  Such information shall not include any information otherwise
publicly known.

          8.   TERMINATION

          Notwithstanding anything herein contained:

          (a)  If, during the Employment Period, Employee shall (i) die, (ii)
become physically or mentally incapacitated or disabled for a period of six
consecutive months to an extent which renders Employee unable to perform his
services under this Employment Contract as evidenced by the written confirmation
of an independent physician selected by W&G and not unreasonably rejected by
Employee or his legal representatives, or (iii) be convicted of or plead guilty
or no-contest to a felony or commit an act of personal dishonesty which was
intended to personally enrich Employee or members of his family at the financial
expense of W&G or any affiliate of W&G, then W&G shall have the right to give
immediate notice of termination of the Employment Period whereupon the same
shall be deemed terminated.

          (b)  Employee shall have the right to give notice of termination for
any reason of the Employment Period as of a date (not earlier than six months
after such notice) to be specified in such notice.

          (c)  If during the Employment Period Employee shall materially breach
any of the terms of this Agreement, then W&G shall have the right to give
written notice describing such breach in reasonable detail to Employee, and if
Employee shall not within 60 days after the date such notice is given correct
such breach or pay reasonable compensation to W&G for its direct damages
attributable to such breach, W&G shall have the right to terminate the
Employment Period, by written notice to

<PAGE>

                                                                               5

Employee given within 90 days after the aforesaid notice of breach.  Such
termination shall occur on the 30th day after such notice of termination is
given.

          (d)  Either Employee or W&G may give written notice to the other of
his or its election not to extend the Employment Period at least three months
prior to the scheduled automatic extension of the Employment Period.

          (e)  W&G shall have the right to terminate the Employment Period
immediately upon written notice by W&G to Employee.

          (f)  Employee (or his estate or legal representatives) shall be
entitled to receive, in the event of termination of the Employment Period
pursuant to Sections 8(a), 8(b), 8(c) or 8(d), (i) salary at the highest
annual rate in effect at any time during the period of 12 months preceding the
giving of notice of termination (the "Then Current Rate") to the day on which
termination shall take effect, (ii) such bonus and other benefits as Employee
is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof payable in accordance
with the terms thereof and (iii) any other bonus or benefit as may be provided
by the Committee.  Benefits, or other amounts to which Employee has become
entitled during his employment, under Section 4 or any other program or plan of
W&G, including those which are payable at or following termination of the
Employment Period shall be paid in accordance with the particular program or
plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Employment Contract.  If the
Employment Period is terminated pursuant to Section 8(e), W&G shall pay to
Employee for a period of 90 days after termination of the Employment Period
salary at the Then Current Rate, minus any amount received by Employee as
payment for services during such 90 day period rendered to any other person.

          9.   INDEMNIFICATION

          In addition to (and not in lieu of) any of Employee's rights to
indemnification or otherwise, contained in W&G's certificate of incorporation,
by-laws, the Indemnity Agreement dated November 12, 1992, between Employee and
W&G or any other agreement, if any action, suit, proceeding (including any
arbitration proceeding) or claim shall be brought or asserted with respect to
the enforcement or interpretation of this Employment Contract or any provision
contained herein, W&G, to the full extent permitted by applicable law and its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws as in effect on the date hereof, hereby
indemnifies Employee for his reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses
incurred in connection with such action,

<PAGE>

                                                                               6


suit, proceeding or claim and agrees to pay or reimburse the same promptly upon
demand by Employee (plus interest at the applicable Federal rate provided in
Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), provided
that W&G shall not be obligated to indemnify Employee under this Employment
Contract with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or claim brought by
Employee in which it is finally determined that Employee's interpretations of
this Employment Contract at issue, taken as a whole, are less correct than the
interpretations asserted by W&G.  W&G shall preserve and make available to
Employee all documents and information now or hereafter in the possession of W&G
which may be required by Employee for the prosecution or defense of any such
action, suit, proceeding or claim.

          10.  PAYMENT OBLIGATION ABSOLUTE

          W&G's obligation to make payments provided for in this Employment
Contract and otherwise perform its obligations hereunder shall be absolute and

Re:     Transfer to Willcox & Gibbs Corporate Staff
        -------------------------------------------

Dear Alain:

This letter outlines the terms on which we have agreed I will transfer from my
current position with Summers Group, Inc. to then be employed by Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc. (the "Company").

DUTIES.  I will be employed in a senior executive capacity as CFO of the Company
and would have such responsibilities as are normally associated with such
position.  I will report directly to you.  I will be elected a Vice President of
the Company at the next meeting of the Board.  Upon my election as Vice
President, the Company will enter an Officers' and Directors' Indemnity
Agreement with me in the same form as those entered with other senior executive
officers.  I will work in Coral Gables, Florida area with travel as necessary.

COMPENSATION.  My minimum base annual salary will be at the rate of $160,000
subject to increase from time to time in the discretion of the Board.  Base
salary will be paid in installments in conformity with the Company's payroll
periods.  The base salary is subject to a one-time adjustment for cost of
housing differential between the Dallas/Fort Worth area costs and the Miami area
costs per square foot in accordance with the following paragraph on COST OF
HOUSING DIFFERENTIAL.  In addition to base salary, I will receive bonuses each
year based on the Willcox & Gibbs Executive Bonus Program criteria to be
determined by January 1, 1995.  My 1994 bonus will be based on the 1994
Executive Management Bonus Program for Summers Group, Inc. according to Annex A
to Schedule 1.1 of the Purchase Agreement dated as of November 20, 1993 between
Willcox & Gibbs and BTR Dunlop, Inc. (copy attached).

CAR AND CLUBS.  In addition to the above, I will also receive a car allowance of
at least $1,250 per month, payable on the first of each month, in addition to
gas and oil, plus payment by the Company for one golf club membership and club
dues not to exceed $20,000 in membership cost.

STOCK OPTION.  I will participate in the Company's 1988 Incentive Stock Option
Plan, as amended, and will receive such options as from time to time are granted
by the Compensation Committee.

TERM AND TERMINATION.  My employment will continue indefinitely subject to
termination as outlined in this paragraph.  Either I or the Company may
terminate employment by no less than 30 days' written notice to the other.  In
the event my employment is terminated by the Company, I shall be entitled to
termination pay on the date of my termination in the amount of six months' base
salary as of the date of termination and one month for each year of service to a
maximum of twelve months, and continued coverage under the medical, life and
disability plans of the Company for a period of one year from the termination
date.  I will receive credit for my years of service with Summers Group, Inc. in
determining termination pay.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.  I will continue to participate in the Summers Group,
Inc. employee benefit programs through December 31, 1994, at which time I will
be entitled to participate in all Willcox  & Gibbs employee benefit programs in
accordance with the terms of each plan.  I will receive credit for my years of
service with Summers Group, Inc. in determining vesting or eligibility for any
Willcox & Gibbs employee benefit program.

VACATION.  I will be eligible for vacation in accordance with the Willcox &
Gibbs vacation policy with credit for my years of service with Summers Group,
Inc.  In no event will my allowable vacation be less than three weeks per year.

CPA LICENSE AND CPE EXPENSE.  The Company agrees to pay my annual CPA license
fee and membership fees for the AICPA and the State Society and agrees to pay my
continuing education expenses in order to keep my CPA designation current.

RELOCATION EXPENSE.  The Company agrees to pay all moving and relocation
expenses in accordance with the relocation expense policy (the "Policy") of
Summers Group, Inc., which is attached, with the following amendments:

        1.      The Company guarantees to pay me the difference between the net
                proceeds to Seller received upon the sale of my home at 2324
                Table Rock Court, Arlington, Texas and $95,000 and gives me the
                flexibility to set the sell price to effect a quick sale of
                the home.

        2.      Interim living expenses according to the Policy will be paid
                by the Company until my house is sold.

        3.      The Company agrees to pay for my trips home each weekend until
                my house is sold.

        4.      If an apartment is rented during the interim living period, the
                Company agrees to pay the cost of furniture rental, renter's
                insurance and any lease cancellation costs.

        5.      The Company agrees to pay up to three house hunting trips for my
                family to the Miami area.

COST OF HOUSING DIFFERENTIAL.  If the cost of housing in the Miami area exceeds
the cost of my house in Arlington, Texas ($86 per square foot) on a per square
foot basis, for a house comparable to the house I now own in Arlington, Texas,
the Company agrees to make some adjustment in my base salary for the cost of
housing differential.  The intent of this paragraph is to provide me with some
level of protection against a significant increase in house payment as a result
of the relocation while allowing the Company some discretion in the amount of
the adjustment.

TAX EFFECT OF RELOCATION COSTS.  The Company agrees to reimburse me for the
increase in personal income taxes due to relocation, if any, to be calculated as
the difference in my personal income tax including and excluding the costs and
reimbursements of relocation expenses covered by the Policy as amended under
RELOCATION EXPENSE above.

I believe the above is in conformity with our agreement to date.  If you agree,
please sign a copy of this letter and return it to me.

Very truly yours,
/s/
Steven M. Hitt
                             Agreed to an accepted this 26th day of June, 1994.

by Employer's Board of Directors, Employee shall be employed as President and

          Employee agrees to his employment as described in Section 2, and
agrees to devote all his business time and efforts to the performance of his

                    installments.

               (b)  A bonus payment determined pursuant to the Profit Sharing
                    Plan, as amended, attached hereto as Annex A.


<PAGE>
                                                                         2

          5.   EXPENSES; VACATIONS; FRINGE BENEFITS

          Employee shall be entitled to: (i) reimbursement for reasonable
travel, entertainment and other expenses properly incurred in the performance of
his duties hereunder upon submission of vouchers in accordance with W&G's
standard procedures as in effect from time to time, (ii) reasonable vacations in
accordance with Employer's regular practices governing employees having duties
generally comparable to Employee's, (iii) group insurance and other group
benefits comparable to those provided by Employer to its employees and (iv) an

substantially equivalent to those provided by Employer as of the date hereof
under the employee benefit plans listed on Annex B hereto, subject to
modifications required by law or prudent business practices.

          6.   NON-COMPETITION

          Employee agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly (individually
or for, with or through any other person, firm or corporation), (i) compete with
W&G, Employer or any subsidiary or other affiliate of W&G or Employer or any
successors or assigns of their businesses during the Employment Period with
respect to any business carried on by W&G, Employer or any such subsidiary or
other affiliate, successor or assign at any place within the United States, or
(ii) for a period of one year after the end of the Employment Period, compete
with W&G, Employer or any subsidiary or other affiliate of W&G or Employer or
any successors or assigns of the businesses conducted by W&G or Employer, with
respect to any line of business conducted by such entities that Employee was
involved with at anytime during the Employment Period at any place within the
United States.  If any court shall determine that the duration or geographical
limit of the foregoing restriction is unenforceable, it is the intention of the
parties that the foregoing restriction shall not be terminated but shall be
deemed amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable, such
amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of this Section 6(a) in
the jurisdiction of the court that has made the adjudication.

of either of them shall belong to the Employer, and without further
compensation, but at Employer's expense, forthwith upon request of Employer,
Employee shall execute any and all such assignments and other documents and take
any and all such other action as Employer may reasonably request in order to
vest in the Employer all Employee's right, title and interest in and to such
patents, patent applications, inventions, technological innovations, copyrights,
developments or processes, free and clear of liens, charges and encumbrances.

                                                                         3

          8.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

          All confidential information which Employee may now have or may obtain
during the Employment Period relating to the business of W&G, Employer or any
subsidiary or other affiliate of either of them shall not be disclosed to any
other person during and after the termination of the Employment Period without
the prior written permission of Employer, and Employee shall return all tangible
evidence of such confidential information to Employer prior to or at the
termination of the Employment Period.  Such information shall not include any
information otherwise publicly known without assistance from Employee.

          9.   SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

          Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Sections 6, 7
and 8 above are a reasonable and necessary protection of the immediate interests
of Employer, that any violation of these restrictions would cause substantial
injury to Employer and that Employer would have not entered into this Employment
Contract with Employee without receiving the additional consideration offered by
Employee in binding himself to these restrictions.  In the event of a breach or
threatened breach by Employee of these restrictions, Employer shall be entitled
to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction restraining
Employee from such breach or threatened breach; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
right to apply for an injunction shall not be construed as prohibiting Employer
from pursuing any other available remedies for such breach or threatened breach.

          10.  WITHHOLDING OF TAXES

          Any payments to Employee or his designated beneficiary or
beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of this Employment Contract shall be reduced
by such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect thereto under all
present and future federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other
laws and regulations.

          11.  TERMINATION

          Notwithstanding anything herein contained:

               (a)  If Employee shall die during the Employment Period, his
                    estate shall be entitled to receive his salary at the rate
                    provided in Section 4(a) to the end of the calendar month in
                    which his death occurs.

               (b)  If, during the Employment Period, Employee shall become
                    physically or mentally incapacitated or disabled for a
                    period of three consecutive months, then Employer shall have
                    the right to give immediate notice of termination of
                    Employee's services hereunder, whereupon Employee shall be
                    entitled to receive his salary at the rate provided in
                    Section 4(a) to the end of the calendar month in which
                    termination occurs.

                                                                         4

               (c)  Employer shall have the right to give immediate notice of
                    termination of Employee's services hereunder as of a date
                    specified in such notice for "cause," in which case all
                    rights of Employee hereunder shall terminate as of such
                    specified date.  For purposes of this provision, "cause"
                    shall mean Employee's conviction of, or plea of "no contest"
                    to, a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty or
                    moral turpitude, failure to follow a directive of the Board
                    of Directors of Employer or a breach by Employee of his
                    obligations under this Agreement.

          12.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT

          This Employment Contract sets forth the entire understanding of the
parties with respect to the subject matter herein and may be modified only by a
written instrument duly executed by each party.

hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed by registered mail, return
receipt requested, transmitted by telecopier or similar means, sent by overnight
delivery service such as Federal Express or delivered against receipt to the
party to whom it is to be given (i) at such party's address set forth in the
preamble to this Employment Contract or (ii) to such other address as the party
shall have furnished in writing in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 13.  Any notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been
given as of the date so delivered or transmitted by telecopier or similar means,
the next business day after mailed by overnight delivery service or five days
after the date so mailed.

          14.  ASSIGNMENT

          In the event of a future disposition of (or including) the properties
and business of Employer, substantially as an entirety, by merger,
consolidation, sale of stock or assets or otherwise, then Employer may elect to
assign this Employment Contract and all of its rights and obligations hereunder
to the acquiring or surviving corporation, provided that (i) such corporation
shall assume in writing all of the obligations of Employer hereunder and upon
such assumption Employer shall be relieved from all of its obligations hereunder
and (ii) to the extent that such acquiring or successor corporation engages in
any business other than the business conducted by Employer prior to such
assignment, the formula for determining the bonus payable pursuant to
Section 4(b) shall be appropriately adjusted so that it is based entirely on the
results of the business conducted by the Employer and not on any other business
conducted by such acquiring or surviving corporation.  Employee's rights under
this Employment Contract shall not be transferable by assignment or otherwise.

unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term hereof,
such provision shall be fully severable; this Employment Contract shall be
construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.  In lieu of
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added
automatically as a part hereof a provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and
enforceable.

          17.  EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS

Board.  Upon my election as Vice President, the Company will enter an Officers'
and Directors' Indemnity Agreement with me in the same form as those entered
with other senior executive officers. My position in the Company would parallel
that of the CFO.  I would work in the Coral Gables, Florida area with travel as
necessary.

COMPENSATION.  My minimum base annual salary would be at the rate of $170,O00,
subject to increase from time to time in the discretion of the Board.  Base
salary would be paid in installments in conformity with the Company's payroll
periods. In addition to base salary, I would receive a minimum bonus for the
balance of 1994 of $25,000, and a minimum bonus of three times my monthly
salary for calendar year 1995 and thereafter, if the Company meets it's overall
performance goals (which will be the same basis on which you qualify for a
bonus).  Bonuses would be paid on or before March 1 of each year.

CAR AND CLUB DUES.  In addition to the above, I would also receive a car
allowance of at least $550 per month, plus payment by the Company of club dues
for one club as we may mutually agree upon.

STOCK OPTION.  I would receive a stock option with tandem SARs in 1994 of at
least 30,000 shares (with such option to be granted at the time I am elected as
a Vice President of the Company) exercisable at $6.50 per share or such higher
per share price as the stock may be trading for on the date of grant.  Such
option shall be for nonrestricted shares, may be exercised in whole or in
increments at any time during the 10-year period after its grant, and shall
remain exercisable for such 10-year period even if my employment is terminated
for any reason.

TERM AND TERMINATION.  My employment will continue indefinitely subject to
termination as outlined in this paragraph.  Either I or the Company may
terminate employment by no less than 30 days' written notice to the other. In
the event the Company should terminate my employment by such notice on or prior
to January 1, 1996, I shall be entitled to termination pay on the date of my
termination in the amount of one year's base compensation, or $170,000.  In the
event my employment is terminated by the Company after January 1, 1996, I shall
be entitled to termination pay on the date of my termination in the amount of
six months' base compensation (computed using my base salary for the six months
immediately preceding such termination).  The above payments shall not apply if
the Company terminates me for gross misconduct or fraud or if my termination is
by reason of death, or disability continuing for more than six consecutive
months.

HEALTH INSURANCE.  No later than January 1, 1995, I shall be entitled to family
medical coverage on the same basis as other employees at my level in the
Company.  There shall be no preexisting condition exclusion or waiting period on
the health insurance to be provided by the Company on or prior to January 1,
1995.  Between the date of my employment and January 1, 1995, the Company agrees
to pay each month to me the cost of continuing my current family health coverage
under COBRA, plus any tax costs to me of continuing my present coverage under
COBRA.

OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS.  I shall be entitled to participate in accordance with
the terms of each plan in all other fringe benefit plans maintained by the
Company, including life insurance and disability insurance and all employee
benefit plans.

MOVING EXPENSES.  The Company agrees to pay all reasonable moving and relocation
expenses (including reasonable expenses of trips to search for housing) and
travel expenses associated with moving my family to the Miami area and any
temporary living and travel expenses (including weekend travel to visit my wife
or for my wife to visit me) in connection with my work in the New York office or
the Coral Gables office.  In addition, the Company agrees to pay me the sum of
$1O,000 on or before September 1, 1994 to cover miscellaneous non-itemized
relocation expenses.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION.  The Company agrees that I would participate in a non-
funded deferred compensation plan at a level which would provide a minimum
benefit of $3,000 per month for a period of ten years assuming I have remained
in the employment of the Company until May 31, 2002.  The payments from such
plan would commence within 30 days after any termination of my employment.
Vesting of this benefit would occur ratably by month over the period of my
employment in the event my employment were terminated prior to May 31, 2002.

VACATION.  As we have discussed, I ordinarily take four weeks of vacation per
year and would continue to do so.

BAR DUES AND CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION EXPENSE.  The Company agrees to pay my
bar dues and reasonable continuing legal education expenses in order to keep my
bar admissions current.

If the above is in conformity with our discussions, please sign a copy of this
letter and return it to me.  I would then be available on June 1, 1994 and would
become an employee of the Company on that date to begin work and to assist with
the move to the

Company's medical expense reimbursement plan will cease as of July 31, 1994, and
no request for medical expense reimbursement after that date will be honored
regardless of the date incurred.

disability insurance in the same amount and in the same manner as the Company
has been doing in the past, but only such date as the Company has estimated a
new disability plan for all employees in the corporate office.

                       SEVERANCE AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT



     AGREEMENT, dated as of February 10,1995, by and among WILLCOX & GIBBS,
INC., a New York corporation ("W&G"), SOUTHERN ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY, INC.
("SES"), a Delaware corporation, d/b/a  CONSOLIDATED ELECTRIC SUPPLY ("CES"),
and WAYNE E. CAMPBELL (the "Executive").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS, the Executive has been employed as an executive of W&G pursuant to
an Employment Contract dated as of January 1, 1991 (the "Employment Contract");
and

     WHEREAS, the parties wish to terminate the Employment Contract and end
their employment relationship on mutually agreeable terms and to provide for the

<PAGE>

"Consultation Period"), Executive agrees to consult with and assist W&G and SES
to the extent called upon to do so by W&G or SES in connection with the
operation of its electrical supplies distribution businesses.  The Executive
agrees to be available no more than fifteen (15) business days per year for such
consulting duties during the Consultation Period, unless Executive has become
disabled and his physician has advised W&G that Executive's health does not
permit such consultation activities.  Executive further agrees that such
consultation shall be rendered at such times as the Executive and W&G agree are
appropriate giving the effect to the then regular personal and other business

payroll periods.

          (2)  The sum of $4,311.41 per month for 120 consecutive months

as Amended July 12, 1988.

          B.   In consideration of the Executive's consulting services, W&G

     5.   OPTIONS AND BENEFIT PLANS.

          (a)  The Executive will be entitled to exercise in accordance with

                                       -2-
<PAGE>

entitled to all vested benefits under W&G's 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan
(which now includes Executive's account in the CES Profit Sharing Plan and the
W&G ESOP Plan, as a result of merger of these Plans on January 1, 1995) and all
vested benefits under the Retirement Plan maintained by WG, Inc. (formerly the
Apparel Division of W&G).  W&G acknowledges that the Executive's benefits are

          (b)  The Executive agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly
(individually or for, with or through any other person, firm or corporation),
compete with W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for a period of one
year following the termination of the Consultation Period with respect to any
business carried on by W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as of
February 10, 1995.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall be
permitted to own not in excess of one percent of any class of securities of any
publicly traded company, which is in competition with W&G,  provided the
Executive is not part of any controlling group and is solely a passive investor.

          (c)  All confidential information which the Executive may now have or


                                       -3-
<PAGE>

may have obtained during his employment by W&G relating to the business of W&G
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof shall not be disclosed to any other
person (except as required by law) without the prior written permission of W&G,
and the Executive has returned all tangible evidence of such confidential
information to W&G and will promptly return any such information following the
Executive's discovery thereof in the future.  Such information shall not include
any information otherwise publicly known.

          (d)  Except as provided in Section 7(c) hereof, the Executive has
returned (or will return promptly thereafter following the Executive's discovery
thereof)  to W&G any credit cards, cardkey passes, computer access codes, door

          (e)  All of Executive's interest in patents, patent applications,
inventions, technological innovations, copyrights, developments and processes
during his employment by W&G owned or developed by Executive relating to the
business of W&G or any affiliate of W&G, shall belong to W&G, and without
further compensation, but at W&G's expense, forthwith upon request of W&G,
Executive shall execute any and all such assignments and other documents and
take any and all such other action as W&G may reasonably request in order to
vest in W&G all Executive's right, title and interest in and to such patents,
patent applications, inventions, technological innovations, copyrights,
developments or processes, free and clear of liens, charges and encumbrances.

          (f)  Subject to Section 21 hereof, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 7, the Executive
acknowledges that W&G will be entitled to seek from a court any interim or
provisional relief that may be necessary to protect W&G's rights or property
pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy.

          (g)  If it is determined that any of the provisions of this Section 7,
or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or scope of such
provision, it is the intention of the parties that the duration or scope of such
provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes
enforceable.

     8.   RELEASES.

          (a)  The Executive, having received independent legal advice,
voluntarily and knowingly releases W&G, each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
and their respective officers and directors from any and all claims, actions,
and causes of action he has or may have arising on or before the date of this
Agreement, whether known or unknown, relating to his employment by, or
termination of employment with, W&G or any of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
including, without limitation (a) those arising under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967, as amended, and other federal, state or local human and
civil rights or labor laws, and (b) those arising under the


                                       -4-
<PAGE>

Employment Contract, except that the Executive does not release (i) his right to
have W&G perform its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) his right to
benefits under the Retirement Plan, the ESOP and the 401(k) Plan and CES Profit
Sharing Plan (Executive recognizes that the ESOP, 401(k) and CES Profit Sharing
Plan are now merged into the W&G 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan), (iii) his
right to indemnification under (1) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of which he has been an officer or
director, (2) the laws of the state of incorporation of W&G or any such
Subsidiary or Affiliate, (3) the Indemnity Agreement dated November 11, 1986,
between the Executive and W&G (the "Indemnity Agreement"), or (4) any insurance
policy maintained by W&G or any such Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may
be.

          (b)  W&G voluntarily and knowingly releases the Executive from any and
all claims, actions and causes of action it has or may have arising on or before
the date of this Agreement, whether known or unknown, except that W&G does not
release its right to have the Executive perform his obligations under this
Agreement or any claim, action or cause of action that W&G may have against the
Executive to the extent it is determined by a final judgment adverse to the
Executive that the Executive's acts or omissions were in bad faith or involved
in intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or the Executive
personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was
not legally entitled.

     9.   COOPERATION REGARDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION.

          The Executive shall not assist any person or firm in asserting or
considering the assertion of any claim against W&G, SES or any Subsidiary of

notice of any process served or contact made by any person considering or
asserting such a claim and permit W&G at its sole option and expense to
represent Executive or provide representation for Executive in any such
proceeding or claim.  The Executive shall cooperate and generally make himself
available to give testimony and assistance in connection with any such claim,
litigation or arbitration proceeding or any proceeding or investigation
initiated by any governmental authority or agency involving W&G or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and arising out of activities of W&G or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement and during the
period of his employment with W&G.  W&G or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall reimburse the Executive for, or advance to the Executive, all reasonable
out-of-pocket travel and other expenses incurred by the Executive at the
specific request of W&G in connection with the Executive's testimony,
cooperation and assistance under this Section 9.  Such expenses shall be
reimbursed or advanced promptly after the Executive's submission to W&G of
statements in such reasonable detail as W&G may require.  Time spent performing
Executive's obligations under this Section 9 shall be deemed to be time spent
consulting pursuant to the consulting provisions of this Agreement, and,
accordingly, the Executive's compensation for performing his obligations under
this


                                       -5-
<PAGE>

Section 9 shall be deemed included in the payments set forth in Paragraph 4, and
no additional payments shall be due Executive.

     10.  OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW BY COUNSEL AND PERIOD TO REVOKE AGREEMENT.

          The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with an
attorney before executing this Agreement.  Until the close of business on March
14, 1995, the Executive may revoke this Agreement by notice to W&G pursuant to
Section 13 whereupon the rights and obligations of the parties to this Agreement

shall return to each other any amounts or other benefits provided under this
Agreement or the Consulting Agreement.

     11.  RIGHTS RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT AND TERMINATION.

          This Agreement integrates and embodies all understandings and
agreements among the Executive, W&G, SES, and/or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates in connection with the Executive's employment and termination of
employment with W&G, SES or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.  Except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, the Executive shall not be entitled to
any payments or other benefits on account of his having been employed by, or
having terminated his employment with, W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

     12.  WITHHOLDING.

Agreement all federal, state and local taxes required by law to be withheld with
respect to such payments.

          Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, duly addressed to the party concerned at the address

     14.  AMENDMENT OR WAIVER:

          No provision in this Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is
agreed to in writing, signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of
W&G.  No waiver by either party hereto of any breach by the other party of any
condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party
shall be deemed a waiver of a similar or dissimilar provision or condition at
the same or any prior or subsequent time.  Any waiver must be in writing and
signed by the Executive or an authorized officer of W&G, as the case may be.

     15.  SEVERABILITY.

          In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in
full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     16.  HEADINGS.

          The headings of sections contained in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to control or affect the meaning or
construction of any provision of this Agreement.

     17.  COUNTERPARTS.

          This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts.

     18.  REFERENCES.

          In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination of
his incompetence, references in this Agreement to the Executive shall be deemed,
where appropriate, to refer to his legal representative or to his beneficiary or
beneficiaries.

     19.  BINDING AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT.

          Except as provided in Section 10 hereof, this Agreement is binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs and assigns.  No
rights or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by the
Executive except that the Executive's rights to compensation and benefits
hereunder shall, in the event of death, pass to his estate, or to his designated
beneficiary, and may be transferred by will or operation of law.  The
Executive's rights under this Agreement


                                       -7-
<PAGE>

shall not be transferable by assignment or otherwise, shall not be subject to
commutation or encumbrance and shall not be subject to the claims of the
Executive's creditors.

          In the event of a future disposition of (or including) the properties
and business of W&G, substantially as an entirety, by merger, consolidation,
sale of stock or assets or otherwise, then W&G shall require the acquiring or
surviving corporation (which shall be substituted for W&G hereunder) to
expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that W&G would have been required to perform it had no such
disposition occurred.

     20.  PAYMENT OBLIGATION ABSOLUTE.

          Except as provided in Section 10 hereof, and for any claims arising by
reason of Executive's violation of Paragraph 7 of this Agreement, W&G's
obligation to make payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise perform
its obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by an setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other circumstance
or rights which W&G may have against the Executive or anyone else, all of which
shall be required to be asserted in independent proceedings.  The Executive
shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for herein
by seeking other employment or taking any other action nor shall the amount of
any payment provided for herein be reduced by amounts earned by the Executive
from other employment or otherwise.

     21.  ARBITRATION; INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a)  Any controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration held in Miami, Florida, in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in
effect, and judgment upon the award rendered (including an award for money
damages) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The cost of the
arbitration proceeding shall be apportioned between the parties by the
arbitration panel.  Either party may, without inconsistency with this Agreement,
seek from  a court any interim or provisional relief that may be necessary to
protect the rights or property of that party pending the arbitral tribunal's
determination of the merits of the controversy.

          (b)  In addition to (and not in lieu of) any of the Executive's rights
to indemnification or otherwise, contained in W&G's certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, the Indemnity Agreement or any other agreement, if any
action, suit, proceeding (including any arbitration proceeding) or claim shall
be brought or asserted with respect to the enforcement or interpretation of this
Agreement or any provision contained herein, W&G, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws as in effect
on the date hereof, hereby indemnifies the Executive for his reasonable
attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred in connection


                                       -8-
<PAGE>

with such action, suit, proceeding or claim and agrees to pay or reimburse the
same promptly upon demand by the Executive (plus interest at the applicable
Federal rate provided in Section 7872(f)(2) of the internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended), provided that W&G shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Executive under this Agreement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
claim brought by the Executive in which it is finally determined that the
Executive's interpretations of this Agreement at issue, taken as a whole, are
less correct than the interpretations asserted by W&G.  W&G shall preserve and
make available to the Executive all documents and information now or hereafter
in the possession of W&G which may be reasonably required by the Executive for
the prosecution or defense of any such action, suit, proceeding or claim.

     22.  GOVERNING LAW.

          This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida
without reference to the principles of conflict of laws.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive, W&G, and SES have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written.
