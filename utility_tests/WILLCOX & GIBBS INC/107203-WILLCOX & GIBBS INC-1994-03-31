                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

    Willcox  & Gibbs, Inc.  (the "Company" or  "W&G") is a  New York corporation
that was incorporated in 1866. It is the fifth largest distributor of electrical
parts and supplies in the United States, based on 1993 pro forma sales.

    During  the  last  several  years,  the  Company  has  undertaken  a   major
restructuring.  On April 22,  1992, the Company, Rexel,  S.A. (formerly known as
Compagnie de  Distribution  de  Materiel  Electrique)  ("Rexel"),  International
Technical  Distributors,  Inc.  ("ITD"),  a subsidiary  of  Rexel,  and Southern
Electric Supply  Company, Inc.  ("SES"),  a subsidiary  of  ITD engaged  in  the
distribution  of electrical  materials, entered  into a  Purchase Agreement (the
"Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to
Rexel and ITD 6,284,301 shares  of Company Common Stock  in exchange for all  of
the stock of SES and approximately $10 million in cash. In addition, pursuant to
the  Purchase Agreement, the Company declared a dividend consisting of one share
of common stock of the Company's subsidiary Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex") for each
share  of  Company  Common   Stock  outstanding  on   November  23,  1992   (the
"Distribution").  In August 1992, the Company transferred to Worldtex all of the
stock of  the  Company's subsidiaries  engaged  in the  manufacture  of  covered
elastic yarn.

    Also  during 1992, the Company disposed of its data communications equipment
distribution business, conducted by Data  Net, Inc. and Dataspan Systems,  Inc.,
and  its Montrose Supply and Equipment  Division, which distributed equipment to
the knitting trade.

    In April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks Electrical Supply Co. ("Sacks"), a
distributor of electrical supplies and components with three locations in  Ohio,
for  $13,635,000. On December 17, 1993,  the Company acquired Summers Group Inc.
("Summers") for $60,000,000 in cash and a $25,000,000 three year note issued  to
the  seller, plus  contingent consideration to  be determined  based on Summers'
profits before  interest and  taxes for  1993  and 1994,  subject to  a  maximum
purchase price of $120,000,000. Summers is a distributor of electrical parts and
supplies  with locations  principally in Texas,  Oklahoma, Louisiana, California
and Arkansas.

    The Company  has  also decided  to  sell  its remaining  apparel  parts  and
supplies  distribution business  and has engaged  an investment  banking firm to
seek a  purchaser.  Accordingly,  this  business  is  shown  as  a  discontinued
operation  in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this report.

    On March 1, 1994, the Company sold 3,491,280 newly-issued shares of  Company
Common Stock to Rexel for $31,421,520 in cash. In connection with that sale, the
size  of the Company's Board of Directors was reduced to nine and two additional
nominees of Rexel  became directors of  the Company.  As a result,  five of  the
Company's nine current directors are nominees of Rexel.

ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS

    The  Company  operates 170  electrical  distribution centers  in  18 states,
principally in the southern tier of the United States. The Company conducts  its
electrical   distribution  operations  through  four  principal  divisions:  the
Consolidated Electric Supply group ("Consolidated"), Sacks, SES and Summers.

    Consolidated, which was acquired  by the Company in  January 1984, has  been
engaged  in  the  wholesale  distribution of  electrical  materials  since 1947.
Headquartered in Miami, Consolidated operates 61 distribution centers, of  which
33  are located in Florida, 11 in Ohio,  three in Delaware, two in Maryland, one
in Washington,  D.C.,  four  in  the Atlanta,  Georgia  area,  six  in  Southern
California  and one in Freeport, Grand  Bahamas. Thirty-four of the distribution
centers have been added during the time the Company has owned Consolidated.

    Sacks, acquired  by  the  Company  in  April  1993,  distributes  electrical
materials through three locations in Ohio.

                                       2
<PAGE>
    SES,  acquired by the Company in November  1992, is engaged in the wholesale
distribution of  electrical materials  through 29  distribution centers  in  six
states,  consisting of  six distribution centers  in Alabama,  seven in Florida,
four in Louisiana, nine in Mississippi, two in Tennessee and one in Oklahoma.

    Summers, acquired by  the Company in  December 1993, distributes  electrical
materials  through 79 locations in 10 states, consisting of thirty-six in Texas,
eleven in Louisiana, eight in Oklahoma, eight in California, seven in  Arkansas,
four  in Missouri, two in Arizona, and one in each of Colorado, Illinois and New
Mexico. Unless  otherwise expressly  stated below,  the statistical  information
discussed  below concerning the Company's  electrical distribution business does
not include Summers' operations.

    Each of the Company's  electrical distribution centers  serves an area  with
approximately  a 50 mile radius and specializes in serving the needs of small-to
medium-sized electrical  contractors engaged  in  construction work  on  plants,
schools,  utilities,  office buildings,  hotels,  condominiums, town  houses and
single family homes. In 1993, the Company's electrical distribution subsidiaries
served over 23,000 customers  with no single customer  accounting for more  than
1.9%  of  total  annual  sales.  The Company's  ten  largest  customers  in 1993
represented less than 6% of sales.

    Management believes that  approximately 60%  of the sales  of the  Company's
electrical distribution subsidiaries are from products used in new construction.
The  remainder  are  sold  for maintenance  and  residential  remodeling  and to
original equipment manufacturers.

    Management believes that  the Company  is the fifth  largest distributor  of
electrical  parts and  supplies in the  United States, although  there are other
companies which account for significantly greater national volume. The Company's
subsidiaries compete with  national chains  (some of which  are affiliated  with
manufacturing  companies) and other independent distributors operating single or
multiple outlets.  Because  the electrical  supply  business is  fragmented  and
highly  competitive, service and  price are essential  components of success. In
order to achieve a competitive advantage in serving its customers, the Company's
subsidiaries maintain  an  inventory  of  approximately  15,000  items  at  each
distribution center, employ a sales staff that calls on customers and works with
architects,  engineers and manufacturers'  representatives on major construction
projects, provide next day  and same day on-site  delivery with its truck  fleet
and  endeavor to obtain volume discounts  to maintain profit margins while being
competitive in price.

    The extensive product line of the Company's subsidiaries includes electrical
supplies, including wire, cable, cords, boxes, covers, wiring devices,  conduit,
raceway  duct, safety switches,  motor controls, breakers,  panels, lamps, fuses
and related  supplies and  accessories, residential,  commercial and  industrial
electrical  fixtures and  other special use  fixtures, as well  as materials and
special cables for computers and  advanced communications systems. The  products
sold  by the Company's subsidiaries are  purchased from over 5,000 manufacturers
and other suppliers, the three largest  of which accounted in the aggregate  for
approximately   13%  of  the   total  purchases  by   the  Company's  electrical
distribution subsidiaries during 1993, with none of the remainder accounting for
more than three percent.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

    APPAREL PARTS AND SUPPLIES DISTRIBUTION -- SUNBRAND

    The Company's Sunbrand Division markets to the apparel industry a wide range
of sewing equipment parts, supplies and other equipment, including pressing  and
finishing  equipment, fabric spreading machines and reconditioned equipment. Its
product line  includes  needles,  tools, electric  and  electronic  devices  and
warehouse  equipment. Sunbrand's executive offices are located in Atlanta and it
catalogs over  140,000 items.  Sunbrand  has seven  office/distribution  centers
located  near major apparel manufacturing areas  in Atlanta, El Paso, Fall River
(Massachusetts), Miami,  Mexico City,  Nashville, and  Santo Domingo  (Dominican
Republic).

                                       3
<PAGE>
    For over 20 years, Sunbrand has been a major distributor of a number of name
brand  ("genuine")  parts to  the apparel  industry. It  has agreements  for the
importation and  sale of  genuine sewing  equipment parts  manufactured by  G.M.
Pfaff AG of Germany ("Pfaff") and Pegasus Sewing Machine Mfg. Co., Ltd. of Japan
("Pegasus")  for the United States and Puerto Rico which extend through 1998 and
which are exclusive (with certain exceptions) through 1994.

    Sunbrand services over 13,000 customers, the largest of which accounted  for
approximately  5.4% of total 1993 sales. Its ten largest customers accounted, in
the aggregate, for approximately 17.5% of Sunbrand's sales for 1993.

    Sunbrand is  well  known for  its  1,200 page  catalog,  which serves  as  a
reference standard for the industry. This catalog, which is published once every
three  years, is  a valuable marketing  tool that  is used by  many existing and
potential buyers of parts and supplies.

    Products sold by Sunbrand are purchased from some 1,200 different companies,
of which  Pfaff and  Pegasus account  for  the largest  volume. In  1993,  Pfaff
accounted for 12.4% and Pegasus accounted for 10.0% of purchases from suppliers.
The five largest suppliers accounted for 36.8% of total purchases in 1993.

    There  is  strong  competition  throughout  the  marketing  areas  served by
Sunbrand. Most of its competitors are small regional distributors, though  there
are  two national competitors.  The principal competitive  factors in Sunbrand's
business are  availability  of parts  and  timely delivery.  Customers  rely  on
Sunbrand  to supply parts that minimize downtime. Sunbrand's management believes
that it is one of the largest distributors of its type in the United States.

    OTHER APPAREL PARTS AND SUPPLIES DISTRIBUTION

    In addition to Sunbrand, during 1993 the Company was engaged in three  other
operations involving distribution to the apparel and textile trades.

    The  Company's  Unity Sewing  Supply Division  ("Unity"), which  the Company
believes is one of the two largest importers and distributors of non-trademarked
("generic") parts for industrial sewing  machines, is headquartered in New  York
with  branch  offices in  Los Angeles  and Miami.  It sells  to dealers,  not to
manufacturers or end users.  Generic parts have  become increasingly popular  in
the  needle trades as a  method to reduce manufacturing  costs. In recent years,
Unity has emphasized its  export business to South  and Central America and  the
Caribbean.  The majority of Unity's parts are manufactured in Japan, Germany and
the United States.

    Willcox & Gibbs,  Ltd., a  wholly-owned United  Kingdom subsidiary,  markets
sewing  equipment in  certain Common Market  countries and  sells generic sewing
equipment parts in the United Kingdom.

    The Company's subsidiary, Leadtec Systems, Inc. ("Leadtec"), distributes  to
the  apparel  industry  a computer-based  real-time  production  control system,
marketed under the name "Satellite  Plus", which utilizes hardware  manufactured
by others and proprietary software designed by Leadtec.

    In  the markets in which  Unity, Willcox & Gibbs,  Ltd. and Leadtec operate,
there is vigorous competition both in the United States and abroad.

    COVERED ELASTIC YARN

    Prior to  1993,  the Company  owned  Worldtex and  its  subsidiaries,  which
engaged  in  the  manufacture of  covered  elastic yarn.  These  operations were
disposed of by the  Company pursuant to the  Distribution on November 12,  1992.
While  owned  by the  Company, Worldtex's  principal  product was  nylon covered
spandex used in the manufacture of women's pantyhose, which accounted for 58% of
Worldtex's 1992  sales. Worldtex  also sold  covered spandex  and covered  latex
rubber for use in the manufacture of men's, women's and children's socks.

                                       4
<PAGE>
EMPLOYEES

    As  of December  31, 1993,  the Company had  a total  of approximately 3,100
employees, including approximately 2,800 who were employed by Consolidated, SES,
Sacks and Summers, and approximately 300  who were employed by Sunbrand and  the
Company's  other distribution  divisions. Approximately 45  employees of Summers
and Sacks  are covered  by  collective bargaining  agreements. The  Company  has
experienced no significant labor problems during recent years and considers that
its employee relations are good.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

    The  Company's executive offices  are located in leased  office space at 530
Fifth Avenue, New York, New York.

    Consolidated's headquarters in  Miami, Florida, and  most of  Consolidated's
distribution  centers are  in facilities owned  by subsidiaries  of the Company.
Leases of remaining premises, which  are classified as operating leases,  expire
in various years through 2001.

    SES'  headquarters in Meridian, Mississippi, and eleven of its locations are
leased from Robert Merson, a Vice President of the Company and President of SES,
and/or members of  his or his  wife's family, for  terms extending through  2002
(except  for one lease expiring in 1994). The Company believes that these leases
are on  terms  at  least  as  favorable as  SES  could  have  obtained  from  an
unaffiliated  third party. The remainder of  SES' locations are leased for terms
expiring in various years through 1999.

    Summers' headquarters  in  Dallas,  Texas,  is leased,  as  are  67  of  its
distribution centers. Summers owns 12 of its distribution centers.

    The  Sunbrand Division's  headquarters in Atlanta  consists of approximately
110,000 square feet under  a lease which runs  through 1994. The other  Sunbrand
branches  also  occupy leased  space. The  Company's  other parts  and equipment
distribution divisions operate  from leased  premises in  London, England,  Long
Island, New York, Los Angeles and Miami.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

    There  are no  material pending  legal proceedings  as of  the date  of this
Report to which the Company  or any of its subsidiaries  is a party or to  which
any of their property is subject.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

    During  the  last quarter  of  the Company's  fiscal  year, no  matters were
submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders.

condition of the Company.

    The Company's  Note  Agreement, dated  as  of  April 2,  1991,  as  amended,
restricts  dividends and  certain other payments  with respect  to the Company's
capital stock if the sum thereof for the period since December 31, 1992, exceeds
the sum of  (i) 35%  of net cash  proceeds from  the sale of  stock and  certain
subordinated  debt for such period, plus (ii) 35% of consolidated net income (as
defined) for such  period. In  addition, the  Note Agreement  and the  Company's
Revolving  Credit and  Reimbursement Agreement, dated  as of  December 17, 1993,
require that the Company meet certain financial tests that could have the effect
of restricting the Company's ability to pay dividends.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

    SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS

    During  the  last  several  years,  the  Company  has  undertaken  a   major
restructuring.  On April 22,  1992, the Company, Rexel,  S.A. (formerly known as
Compagnie de  Distribution  de  Materiel  Electrique)  ("Rexel"),  International
Technical  Distributors,  Inc.  ("ITD"),  a subsidiary  of  Rexel,  and Southern
Electric Supply  Company, Inc.  ("SES"),  a subsidiary  of  ITD engaged  in  the
distribution of

                                       7
<PAGE>
electrical   materials,  entered  into  a   Purchase  Agreement  (the  "Purchase
Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Rexel and
ITD 6,284,301 shares of Company Common Stock in exchange for all of the stock of
SES and approximately $10 million in cash. In addition, pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, the Company  declared a dividend  consisting of one  share of  common
stock  of the Company's subsidiary Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex") for each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding on  November 23, 1992 (the "Distribution"  and,
together  with such transactions with Rexel, the "1992 Transactions"). In August
1992, the Company  transferred to  Worldtex all of  the stock  of the  Company's
subsidiaries  engaged in the  manufacture of covered  elastic yarn. Accordingly,
these businesses  are  reflected as  discontinued  operations in  the  Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Also  during  1992,  the  Company  sold  its  data  communications equipment
distribution business and an apparel related unit.

    In April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks Electrical Supply Co. ("Sacks"), a
distributor of electrical supplies and components with three locations in  Ohio,
for $13.6 million. On December 17, 1993, the Company acquired Summers Group Inc.
("Summers")  for $60 million in cash and a $25 million three year note issued to
seller, plus contingent consideration to be determined based on Summers' profits
before interest and taxes for 1993 and 1994, subject to a maximum purchase price
of $120 million. Summers is a distributor of electrical parts and supplies  with
locations principally in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, California and Arkansas.

    The  Company  has  also decided  to  sell  its remaining  apparel  parts and
supplies distribution businesses  (the "Apparel  Division") and  has engaged  an
investment  banking firm to seek a  purchaser. Accordingly, the Apparel Division
is shown as  a discontinued  operation in the  Company's Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

    On  March 1, 1994, the Company sold 3,491,280 newly-issued shares of Company
Common Stock to Rexel for $31.4 million  in cash, which the Company has used  to
reduce short-term debt.

    As  a  result of  the aforementioned  transactions and  discontinuances, the
Company is  now  engaged in  only  one  business segment:  the  distribution  of
electrical  parts and supplies,  principally in the southern  tier of the United
States. If the above-mentioned acquisitions had occurred as of January 1,  1992,
the  Company's  unaudited pro  forma sales  would have  been $958.5  million and
$907.3 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

    RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS

                                       8
<PAGE>
    1993 V. 1992

    The  Company's sales increased by $162.4 million in 1993, to $521.5 million.
Excluding the impact of  the acquisitions of SES,  Sacks and Summers,  full-year
sales  were up about  3.8%. The Company's  Consolidated Electric Supply division
("CES") increase resulted primarily from the improving housing market,  although
commercial  construction continues to  lag. Full-year sales  for SES, Sacks, and
Summers as a group were up in 1993 compared with 1992, reflecting the  continued
market-share strength of these units in their respective geographic areas. Sales
for  these divisions totalled $601.3 million in 1993. Certain geographic regions
showed an upturn in  1993. However, no  assurance can be  given that this  trend
will  continue. Declining copper prices and  strong competition for market share
continue to put pressure on the Company's gross margin, which increased slightly
in 1993, to 20.6%.

    Selling  and  administrative  expenses  increased  $24.4  million  in  1993,
reflecting   the  additional   operations  added   through  the  above-mentioned
acquisitions. However, as a percentage of sales such expenses decreased to 17.3%
in 1993 as compared to 18.3% in 1992, reflecting cost containment programs and a
higher level of sales.

    Interest expense in 1993 was $5.9 million, compared with $5.4 million a year
ago. Although the Company reduced its debt at the end of 1992 in connection with
the 1992  Transactions,  it  increased  its  borrowings  in  1993  to  fund  the
acquisitions  of Sacks  and Summers. Other  income-net in 1993  was $.7 million,
compared  to  $0.1  million  in  1992,  reflecting  principally  earnings   from
short-term investments during the first half of 1993.

    Income from continuing operations increased $19.3 million to $6.9 million in
1993,  reflecting principally the costs  for 1992 Transactions and restructuring
charges that were accrued in 1992.

    1992 V. 1991

    Sales in 1992 decreased $11.0 million, or 3.0%, to $359.1 million. The  1991
period  includes results of two data  communications units that the Company sold
during 1992. 1992 sales included $14.9 million from SES from mid-November.

    Excluding sales  of  units sold,  electrical  supply sales,  including  SES,
increased  by $11.9  million, or 3.4%,  to $359.1 million.  Excluding SES, sales
decreased by $3.0 million or 0.9%. The business continued to be impacted  during
the  year by  the softness  in the  housing market  and the  effect of tightened
Company credit policies. Strong  competition for market  share continued to  put
pressure  on profit margins, but margins held when compared to the prior period.
SES sales for 1992 totalled $114.5 million.

    Selling and administrative expenses for the Company were 18.3% of sales  for
1992 as compared with 19.1% for 1991, reflecting the absence of expenses related
to units sold and cost containment programs instituted in 1991. Such expenses in
1992 decreased $4.5 million, or 6.4%, to $66.0 million.

    In  connection with the 1992  Transactions, including the Worldtex spin-off,
the Company  incurred costs  totalling $15.3  million, principally  relating  to
certain  investment advisor  services, legal  and accounting  fees and executive
incentive payments.

    Restructuring actions  ($4.3 million  and  $5.5 million  in 1992  and  1991,
respectively) included principally the disposal of two data communications units
which  no  longer related  to the  Company's  core business.  In 1992  and 1991,
certain restructuring actions initiated in 1991 and 1990 required more costs  to
implement   than  originally   expected.  The  additional   costs,  included  in
restructuring charges for these periods, changed based on the revised  estimates
and experience to date.

    The  decrease in interest  expense of $1.3  million for 1992  as compared to
1991 reflects the net effect of the  sale of the $50 million 9.78% Senior  Notes
in  April, 1991, the redemption of the $23 million 13% Senior Subordinated Notes
in August,  1991 and  changing levels  of borrowing  under the  Company's  prior
revolving credit arrangement.

                                       9
<PAGE>
    Loss  from continuing operations increased $8.0  million to $12.4 million in
1992, reflecting principally  the impact  of transaction costs  relating to  the
1992  Transactions, partially  offset by  the absence  of operating  losses from
units sold, certain cost containment measures, and reduced restructuring charges
and interest expense.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

    As discussed above,  the results of  the Apparel Division  and Worldtex  are

</TABLE>

    Sales for the Apparel Division decreased $2.1 million for 1993 compared with
1992. Excluding  units sold,  sales increased  4.3%. 1992  sales (excluding  the
units  sold) increased $9.6 million, or 13.9%, compared to 1991. These year over
year increases resulted  from increased  market share,  particularly in  foreign
markets such as Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean.

    Covered  yarn  sales  increased  $1.6  million  in  1992  compared  to 1991,
reflecting growth  in  each  of  covered  yarn's  markets,  offset  somewhat  by
inclusion of such sales in the Company's results only through mid-November 1992.

    INCOME TAXES

    The Company had effective income tax rates of 43%, (6.3)% and 62.5% in 1993,
1992  and 1991.  The 1993  rate reflects  the impact  of state  and local taxes,
non-deductible goodwill  amortization and  increase in  the deferred  tax  asset
valuation allowance, reduced by the impact of the utilization of federal capital
loss  carryforwards, the increase  in the federal corporate  income tax rate and
the current deductibility of certain prior year transaction costs. The 1992 rate
reflects the benefit of the Company's  operating loss, reduced by the impact  of
state and local taxes, goodwill amortization, and certain transaction costs.

    Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting from
the  deferred  method  to  the  liability  method  required  by  SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income  Taxes" (see  Note 10 of  the Notes  to the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements). As permitted under Statement 109, prior years' financial
statements have not been restated.  The cumulative effect of adopting  Statement
109 as of January 1, 1993 was to increase net income by $660 or $.03 per share.

    At December 31, 1993, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards
for  tax purposes  of approximately $16.5  million that expire  between 1998 and
2008.

    Under Statement 109 the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of  $11.3
million, arising primarily from basis differences between the recorded value for
financial reporting purposes and tax basis of accounts receivable, inventory and
various liabilities and reserves, including restructuring and transaction costs.
Such  deferred tax  assets have  been reduced by  a valuation  allowance of $1.1
million. In  addition,  the  Company has  recognized  deferred  tax  liabilities
totalling $7.8 million arising principally from a higher recorded value over tax
basis  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  certain  acquisitions.  It  is
management's belief  that  the  net  deferred tax  asset  as  reflected  on  the
consolidated  financial statements will be realized based upon forecasted future
pretax earnings and

                                       10
<PAGE>
taxable income as well as  utilization of certain carryback and/or  carryforward
opportunities.  Such forecasts reflect  the disposals of  operations that do not
relate to the Company's  core business as  well as the  expected results of  the
Company's most recent acquisitions.

    NET INCOME (LOSS)

    The  Company reported net income (loss) of $9.1 million, ($4.9) million, and
$0.2 million in 1993, 1992,  and 1991. Earnings per share  was 43 cents in  1993
compared  with a loss per share of 33 cents  in 1992 and earnings per share of 2
cents in 1991. Results during this three-year period were significantly impacted
by the 1992 Transactions and restructuring charges in 1992 and 1991.

    LIQUIDITY; CAPITAL RESOURCES

    At December  31,  1993, the  Company  had $19.1  million  in cash  and  cash
equivalents,  compared to  $15.6 million  at December  31, 1992,  and had $196.7
million of indebtedness for borrowed  money (including current installments  and
short-term  debt), compared to $109.6 million at December 31, 1992. Total assets
increased $143.5 million at year end 1993 to $428.8 million, due almost entirely
to the acquisitions as discussed below.

    During 1993, the Company generated $5.8  million in cash from its  operating
activities  compared to $14.4  million in 1992,  reflecting primarily changes in
various working capital items.  Net cash used  in investing activities  totalled
$62.8  million and $17.6 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively. The increase in
cash usage in  1993 reflected the  Company's acquisitions of  Sacks and  Summers
($68.3   million),  offset  partially  by  proceeds  from  sales  of  short-term
investments ($12.9 million). Capital expenditures decreased $5.8 million in 1993
to $5.4 million,  reflecting primarily  the absence  of historical  expenditures
related  to Worldtex. Net cash provided by financing activities in 1993 totalled
$60.6 million compared  to $10.7  million in  1992. The  $49.9 million  increase
reflects  borrowings  under the  Company's current  credit arrangements  to fund
acquisitions.

    In April 1993, the Company acquired Sacks for $13.6 million in cash, and  in
December  1993 the Company  acquired Summers for  $60 million in  cash and a $25
million three year  note, plus  contingent consideration, subject  to a  maximum
purchase   price  of  $120  million.  The  Company  regularly  reviews  possible
acquisitions of businesses,  and may  from time to  time in  the future  acquire
other  businesses.  The Company  otherwise  currently expects  that  its capital
expenditures during 1994 will be consistent with historical requirements for the
electrical distribution business.

    In connection with the  acquisition of Summers,  the Company terminated  its
$20   million  line  of  credit  and  entered  into  the  Revolving  Credit  and
Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of December 17, 1993 (the "Credit Agreement"),
with NationsBank of  Florida, N.A.,  and Credit  Lyonnais New  York Branch.  The
Credit Agreement provides for borrowings from time to time through December 1997
of  up to  the lesser of  (i) $70 million  and (ii)  the sum of  80% of eligible
accounts receivable  and 50%  of eligible  inventory. The  Company borrowed  $60
million  under the Credit Agreement  in December 1993 to  fund the cash purchase
price for Summers. On March 1, 1994, the Company sold 3,491,280 shares of  newly
issued  Company Common Stock  to Rexel for  $31.4 million, which  was applied to
repay debt under  the Credit  Agreement. Borrowings under  the Credit  Agreement
bear  interest at NationsBank's  prime rate or at  a rate based  on rates in the
certificate of  deposit market  or  LIBOR plus  a  margin, which  margin  varies
depending  on the Company's financial performance. The Credit Agreement includes
various covenants, including restrictions on  liens, debt and lease  obligations
and  requirements that  certain financial ratios  be maintained. As  of March 1,
1994, $26.8 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement and $43.2 million
was available for future borrowings. It is expected that any cash proceeds  from
the  sale of  the Apparel Division  will be  used to repay  borrowings under the
Credit Agreement.  Upon  the  closing  of such  sale,  the  $70  million  amount
available  for  borrowings under  the Credit  Agreement must  be reduced  to $50
million.

    The Company's working capital requirements  are generally met by  internally
generated  funds and short-term borrowings.  Management believes sufficient cash
resources will be available to  support its long-term growth strategies  through
internally generated funds, credit arrangements and the

                                       11
<PAGE>
ability of the Company to obtain additional financing. However, no assurance can
be  given that financing will  continue to be available  on attractive terms. In
addition, any  issuance by  the  Company, of  its  capital stock  or  securities
convertible  into its capital stock prior to  December 31, 1994 must be approved
by Rexel.

    THREE-YEAR COMPARISONS

    The following financial data were  impacted by the distribution of  Worldtex
and  acquisitions of SES, Sacks and Summers, as discussed in Notes 2, 3 and 4 of
the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements. The Net  assets of the  Apparel
Division are shown as "Net assets of discontinued operations" as of December 31,
1993. The balance sheet at December 31, 1992 has not been reclassified.

    Total  long-term debt was $126.0 million, $109.2 million and $113.4 million,
respectively, at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.

    Working capital  was  $71.3  million,  $122.3  million  and  $84.4  million,
respectively,  at December  31, 1993,  1992 and  1991, reflecting  a decrease of
$51.0 million and an increase of  $37.9 million, respectively, in 1993 and  1992
and  a current ratio of 1.34,  2.40 and 1.61 at the  end of 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Working capital is impacted by the fact that the net assets of the  discontinued
Apparel  Division are  included as  noncurrent assets  as of  December 31, 1993,
including $37.0 of net current  assets. Any cash proceeds  from the sale of  the
Apparel Division will be used to repay short-term debt.

    Net worth was $92.5 million, $84.2 million and $111.9 million, respectively,
at  December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,  with the decrease in 1992 attributable to
the charge  to  retained  earnings  for  the  distribution  of  Worldtex  ($58.5
million), partially offset by adjustments to common stock and capital surplus in
connection  with the stock issuance to Rexel as discussed in Notes 2, 3 and 4 of
the Notes  to  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements.  (See  the  Consolidated
Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity for additional information).

    The  ratio of net worth to long-term debt was .73 to 1 at December 31, 1993,
.77 to 1 at December 31, 1992 and .99 to 1 at December 31, 1991. On a pro  forma
basis,  had the additional equity  investment by Rexel been  made as of December
31, 1993, the ratio of net worth to long-term debt would have been .98 to 1.

    The number of days sales represented  by accounts receivable was 51.8,  59.1
and  59.1, respectively, at December 31, 1993,  1992 and 1991. Inventories, as a
percentage of cost of sales, were 20.5%, 25.2% and 23.8%, at December 31,  1993,
1992  and  1991. These  differences  for 1993  as  compared to  prior  years are
principally due to  the increase  in the Company's  receivables and  inventories
attributable to the electrical distribution business in 1993.

    The  Company continually reviews  the impact of  inflation. Pricing policies
are reviewed regularly and, to the extent permitted by competition, the  Company
passes  increased costs on by increasing  sales price. The Company will continue
to monitor the impact  of inflation and will  consider these matters in  setting
its pricing policies.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Willcox & Gibbs, Inc.:

    We  have audited the  accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc.  as of  December 31,  1993 and  1992, and  the related  consolidated
statements  of income, stockholders'  equity and cash flows  for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991.  We have also audited the financial  statement
schedules  as noted in the accompanying index listed in Item 8 of this Form 10-K
for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. These financial statements
and financial  statement  schedules  are the  responsibility  of  the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an  opinion on  these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

    We conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles used  and  significant estimates  made  by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial  statements referred to above present  fairly,
in  all  material respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of  Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the years  ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and  1991
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in
relation  to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information required to be included therein.

    As discussed in Note  10 of the consolidated  financial statements, in  1993
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    (a) CONSOLIDATION

        The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of the
        Company and  all  of  its  subsidiaries.  All  significant  intercompany
        transactions and balances have been eliminated.

    (b) CASH EQUIVALENTS

        Highly  liquid investments with a maturity  of three months or less when
        purchased are generally considered to be cash equivalents.

    (c) SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

        Short-term investments are stated at  cost plus accrued interest,  which
        approximates  market,  and consist  of  direct obligations  of  the U.S.
        Government.

    (d) INVENTORIES

        Inventories are stated  at the  lower of  cost (determined  by LIFO  for
        continuing operations or FIFO for discontinued operations) or market.

        The  cost of inventories determined on  a LIFO basis comprised 80.9% and
        68.9% of total inventories at December 31, 1993 and 1992,  respectively.
        Had   the  FIFO  method  been  used  to  value  all  inventories,  total
        inventories would have increased $5,884 and $6,569 at December 31,  1993
        and 1992, respectively.

    (e) INVESTMENTS AND NONCURRENT RECEIVABLES

        Investments  and  noncurrent  receivables  are  carried  at  cost, which
        approximates market, except for investments in companies over which  the
        Company has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, which
        are   carried  under  the  equity   method,  and  noncurrent  marketable
        securities, which are  carried at the  lower of quoted  market value  or
        cost.  Unrealized  losses  are  accumulated  in  the  marketable  equity
        securities adjustment component of stockholders' equity.

    (f) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

        Depreciation,  computed  by  means  of  straight-line  and   accelerated
        methods,  is based on the estimated  useful lives of the related assets.
        Leasehold improvements are amortized  over their respective lease  terms
        or their estimated useful lives, if shorter.

        Cost  in excess  of net  assets of  acquired businesses  ("goodwill") is
        amortized over 40 years. The  Company periodically reviews the  carrying
        value  of goodwill in relation to current and expected operating results
        of the businesses  which benefit  therefrom in order  to assess  whether
        there has been a permanent impairment of goodwill.

    (g) FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

        The  Company enters into  forward exchange contracts  as a hedge against
        accounts payable denominated  in foreign currency.  These contracts  are
        used  by the Company to minimize  exposure and reduce risk from exchange
        rate fluctuations in the regular  course of its foreign business.  Gains
        and  losses  on  forward  contracts are  deferred  and  included  in the
        measurement of the related  foreign currency transaction. Cash  provided
        and  used for forward contracts is  included in the cash flows resulting
        from changes in accounts and notes payable - trade. Contracts  amounting
        to $128 were outstanding at December 31, 1993.

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    (h) INCOME TAXES

        No  provision  is  made  for  income  taxes  which  may  be  payable  if
        undistributed earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries were  to  be  paid  as
        dividends  to the Company, since the  Company intends that such earnings
        will continue to be invested in  those countries. At December 31,  1993,
        the  cumulative  amount of  foreign  undistributed earnings  amounted to
        approximately  $6,312.  Foreign  tax  credits  may  be  available  as  a
        reduction   of  United  States  income  taxes   in  the  event  of  such
        distributions.

    (i) EARNINGS PER SHARE

        Primary earnings per share are based  on the weighted average number  of
        common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year.

    (j) RECLASSIFICATIONS

        Certain  prior year amounts  have been reclassified  to conform with the
        1993 presentation.

2.  SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS
    On November 12, 1992, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated April 22,  1992
among  the Company, Rexel, S.A. (formerly  known as Compagnie de Distribution de
Materiel  Electrique)  ("Rexel"),  International  Technical  Distributors,  Inc.
("ITD"),  a subsidiary of Rexel, and Southern Electric Supply Company ("SES"), a
subsidiary of  ITD engaged  in  the distribution  of electrical  components  and
supplies,  the Company issued to Rexel and ITD 6,284,301 shares of the Company's
common stock. In exchange for such  stock issuance, the Company received  $9,885
in  cash and all the capital stock of SES. The SES acquisition was accounted for
by the purchase method (see Note 3). Common stock and capital surplus have  been
adjusted  for the  proceeds received from  the common stock  issuance less issue
costs of $2,056.

    Pursuant to  the Purchase  Agreement  (including an  Investment  Agreement),
Rexel  had agreed  to certain  limitations on  its ownership  of the outstanding
common stock of the  Company and to certain  other restrictions during the  five
years  after closing. However, the Company,  Rexel and ITD executed an amendment
to the Investment Agreement which, among other things, permits Rexel to increase
its beneficial  ownership  of Company  common  stock  to 45%  and  provides  for
termination  of the Investment Agreement on December 31, 1994. On March 1, 1994,
the Company sold to Rexel 3,491,280 newly issued shares of Company common  stock
for  a total cash purchase  price of $31,422 which  was used to repay short-term
debt (see Note 5). As a result, Rexel increased its beneficial ownership of  the
outstanding common stock of the Company from 30% to 40%.

    In   connection  with  the  November   12,  1992  transaction,  the  Company
distributed Worldtex, Inc. ("Worldtex"), its covered yarn manufacturing segment,
as a dividend to  its stockholders during the  fourth quarter of 1992.  Worldtex
owns  the  former subsidiaries  of  the Company  engaged  in the  manufacture of
covered yarn. Effective with the dividend, retained earnings was charged $58,547
for the book value of the  net assets distributed, including assets of  $152,407
and  liabilities of  $93,860. Liabilities  included $32,000  of debt  assumed by
Worldtex which was  previously outstanding under  the Company's prior  revolving
credit  arrangement. The results of the covered yarn operation for 1992 and 1991
are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as discontinued operations
(see Note 4).

    Results for  1992 include  transaction-related costs  of $15,344,  including
certain  investment advisor  services, legal  and accounting  fees and executive
incentive payments, in connection with these transactions.

                (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

3.  ACQUISITIONS
    On April 12, 1993 the Company acquired the common stock of Sacks  Electrical
Supply  Co. ("Sacks"), a distributor of  electrical supplies and components with
three  locations  in  Ohio,  for  $13.9  million  (including  $0.3  million   of
acquisition costs).

    On  December  17, 1993,  the Company  acquired the  common stock  of Summers
Group, Inc. ("Summers")  for $60.7 million  in cash (including  $0.7 million  of
acquisition  costs) and a $25 million three-year note issued to the seller, plus
contingent consideration to be determined  based on defined profits of  Summers,
subject to a maximum purchase price of $120 million. Summers is a distributor of
electrical  parts and  supplies with  locations principally  in Texas, Oklahoma,
Louisiana, California and Arkansas.

    Each of these  1993 acquisitions has  been recorded as  a purchase, and  the
excess  of  the total  purchase  price over  the fair  value  of the  net assets
acquired ($6.9  million  for Sacks  and  $11.5  million for  Summers)  is  being
amortized  over 40 years. Sacks' and Summers' results of operations are included
in the Company's financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

    As discussed in Note  2 of the Notes  to Consolidated Financial  Statements,
the  Company acquired all of the issued capital stock of SES in exchange for the
issuance of 4,636,994 shares of the  Company's common stock. The total  purchase
price  was $21,370, representing market value  of the shares and certain closing
costs. The  shares  include 628,430  shares  issued  in 1993.  SES'  results  of
operations  are included in the Company's  financial statements from the date of
acquisition. The acquisition has been recorded  as a purchase and the excess  of
the  total  purchase  price over  the  fair  value of  the  net  assets acquired
($10,475) is being amortized over 40 years.

    The following table summarizes the  effect on consolidated sales and  income
(loss)  from continuing  operations of  the Company,  on an  unaudited pro forma
basis, assuming the Sacks  and Summers acquisitions had  been consummated as  of
January  1, 1992 and the  SES acquisition had been  consummated as of January 1,
1991.

    The Company has decided to sell its apparel parts and supplies  distribution
business  ("Apparel") and  has engaged  an investment  banking firm,  of which a
director of the  Company is president,  to seek a  purchaser. Accordingly,  this
business   is   included   in   the  Consolidated   Statements   of   Income  as

5.  SHORT-TERM DEBT
    In connection with the  acquisition of Summers,  the Company terminated  its
$20   million  line  of  credit  and  entered  into  the  Revolving  Credit  and
Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of December 17, 1993 (the "Credit Agreement"),
with NationsBank  of Florida,  N.A., and  Credit Lyonnais  New York  Branch.  At
December  31,  1993, $61.5  million was  outstanding under  this agreement  at a
weighted average interest rate of 4.57%.  The $31.4 million cash received  March
1,  1994 from the sale of common stock  to Rexel was applied to repay debt under
this agreement. The Credit Agreement provides  for borrowings from time to  time
through   December   1997   of   up   to  the   lesser   of   (i)   $90  million

receivable  and 50% of eligible inventory. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement
bear interest at NationsBank's  prime rate or  at a rate based  on rates in  the
certificate  of deposit market or LIBOR plus a margin, which varies depending on
the Company's  financial  performance.  The Credit  Agreement  includes  various
covenants,  including  restrictions on  liens,  debt and  lease  obligations and
requirements that certain financial ratios be maintained. The Company pays a fee
of 1/4 of 1% of the total unused portion of the line of credit. Upon the sale of
the apparel operation, the $70 million amount available for borrowings under the
Credit Agreement must be reduced to $50 million.

    In April  1991,  the Company  sold  $50,000 of  Senior  Notes in  a  private
placement.  The notes  are payable ratably  over a  seven-year period commencing
March 15, 1995 with interest payable semiannually at a rate of 9.78% per  annum.
Based  on borrowing rates currently available  to the Company for long-term debt
with similar  terms and  average maturities,  the  fair value  of the  notes  is
approximately  $54,055. Under  the terms of  the Senior Notes  (as amended), the
Company may pay dividends and make other restricted payments (as defined) to the
extent of 35% of consolidated net income (as defined) plus certain other amounts
and is subject to certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  and
other  transactions and to other covenants calling for minimum levels of working
capital and certain financial ratios.

    The 7%  Convertible Subordinated  Debentures  are due  August 1,  2014  with
interest  payable semiannually  on February 1  and August 1.  The debentures are
convertible into common stock of the Company at $9.57 per share, as adjusted  in
connection  with the dividend  of Worldtex, and  are subject to  a sinking fund,
commencing August 1, 2000, calculated to  retire 70% of the debentures prior  to
final  maturity. The  debentures are subordinated  to present  and future senior
indebtedness (as defined) of the Company. In certain circumstances involving the
occurrence of a Risk  Event (as defined)  prior to August  1, 1999, the  Company
will be required to offer to repurchase all or part of the debentures at 100% of
their  principal amount plus accrued interest. The Company has the option to pay
the repurchase price  in cash or  shares of  its common stock.  At December  31,
1993, approximately 6,452,000 shares would have been necessary to repurchase the
debentures.  At December 31, 1993,  the debentures, which trade  on the New York
Stock Exchange, had a fair market value of $49,000.

6.  LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
    The Senior Note due December 17, 1996 was issued to the seller in connection
with the  Summers  acquisition  and  is payable  in  three  annual  installments
commencing on December 17, 1994 with interest at 4.375% per annum.

    The mortgage notes payable are due in monthly installments of $59, including
interest at 9.5% through December 31, 1996. The principal balance outstanding on
December  31,  1996  is  due  in  one  payment  on  that  date.  The  notes  are
collateralized by a mortgage and security agreement and a collateral  assignment
of  rents and leases relative  to various property located  in Florida. Based on
borrowing rates  currently available  to  the Company  for long-term  debt  with
similar   terms  and  average  maturities,  the  fair  value  of  the  notes  is
approximately $7,036.

    Long-term debt maturities during the next five years are as follows:

7.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
    The authorized capital stock of the Company is 37,600,000 shares, consisting
of 600,000  shares  of Preferred  Stock  with a  par  value of  $12  per  share,
2,000,000  shares  of Preference  Stock with  a par  value of  $1 per  share and
35,000,000 shares of Common Stock with a par value of $1 per share. The Board of
Directors may issue the Preference Stock from time to time in one or more series
and fix  the  dividend rates,  voting  rights and  liquidation  preferences  and
establish  redemption,  sinking fund,  conversion,  exchange and  other relative
rights, preferences and limitations of a particular series.

    On January 10, 1989, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution
of one preference stock purchase right  (the "Rights") for each share of  common
stock  outstanding. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one one-hundredth
of a share  of newly created  Junior Participating Preference  Stock, par  value
$1.00  per share. The Rights Agreement was amended on November 12, 1992 pursuant
to the agreement with Rexel and the dividend discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  was  amended  on  March  1,  1994,  in
connection  with the purchase by  Rexel of additional shares  of common stock of
the Company. The Rights will become  exercisable upon the occurrence of  certain
events  at an exercise price  of $15 for each  one one-hundredth of a preference
share. In the  event a person  or group acquires  20% or more  of the  Company's
outstanding  common stock, each  right shall entitle the  holder to purchase, by
paying the $15 exercise price,  stock of the Company with  a value of twice  the
exercise  price provided that ownership of the  Company's stock by Rexel and its
Affiliates (as such term  is defined in the  Rights Agreement) will not  trigger
such  exercise right so long as Rexel and  all its Affiliates do not own, in the
aggregate, voting securities of the Company  which, on a fully exercised  basis,
are  in excess  of 45% of  the aggregate  number of votes  which may  be cast by
holders of outstanding  voting securities of  the Company. In  addition, if  the
Company  is acquired in a merger  or other business combination, the rightholder
shall be entitled to purchase, by paying the $15 exercise price, common stock of
the acquiring  company with  a value  of  twice the  exercise price,  except  as
otherwise  provided in  the Rights Agreement.  The Rights are  redeemable by the
Company at $.01 per Right under  certain circumstances and will expire  December
31,  1994. 500,000  shares of preference  stock have been  reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the Rights.

    The  Company's Stock  Acquisition Plan  provides for  the issuance  of up to
237,037 shares  of  common stock  to  key employees  over  specified  employment
periods.  As of  December 31,  1993, 229,889  shares of  common stock  have been

certain  limitations. Contributions to  the plan are  invested by an independent
trustee  in  common  stock  of  the  Company.  Stock  attributable  to   Company
contributions  vests at the rate of 10%  for each twelve months of contributions
by the employee, with  100% vesting after five  years of service. The  Company's

9.  PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
    The  Company has two qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
covering certain eligible domestic employees. The Company's funding policy is to
contribute annually the maximum amount that  can be deducted for Federal  income
tax  purposes. The Company also has a non-qualified defined benefit supplemental
retirement plan covering  key employees, which  is not funded.  The benefits  of
both plans are based on years of service and defined levels of compensation.

    The  Company  also  has  a  defined  benefit  plan  maintained  for eligible
employees of  certain  United  Kingdom  subsidiaries  included  in  the  apparel
operation.  The  plan is  funded annually  for the  maximum amount  permitted by
statute. The  benefits are  based on  years  of service  and defined  levels  of
compensation.

    Under the collective bargaining agreement of the textile industry in France,
employees  of  a  subsidiary Worldtex  are  entitled  to a  lump-sum  payment at
retirement based on  their length of  service at retirement  and final pay.  All
obligations  under this  plan were  assumed by  Worldtex in  connection with the
dividend.

    The following table sets forth the plans' funded status at December 31, 1993
and 1992:

</TABLE>

    For both the qualified domestic plans, the weighted average discount used in
determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation  was
7.25% at December 31, 1993 and the rates of increase in future compensation used
were  4.5% and 4.0% at December 31, 1993. The weighted average discount rate and
the rate of increase in future compensation levels used at December 31, 1992 and
1991 for the one plan were 8.25% and 6.0%, respectively. The expected  long-term
rates  of return on  assets were 8.0% and  8.5% for 1993 and  9.5% for all other
years.

    For the non-qualified domestic plan, the weighted average discount rate used
was 7.5% at December 31, 1993 and 9.5%  for all other years. For 1993 and  1992,
no salary increase was assumed as the Company has frozen salaries under the plan
at current levels. The rate of increase in future compensation in 1991 was 5.0%.
Liabilities  under this plan attributable to  Worldtex employees were assumed by
Worldtex in connection with the dividend of Worldtex.

    For the United Kingdom plan, the assumed discount rate at December 31,  1993
was  9.0% and for  all other years the  rate was 10.0%. The  rate of increase in
future compensation levels  was 9.0% for  all years and  the expected  long-term
rate  of return on assets was 9.0% at  December 31, 1993 and 10.0% for all other
years.

9.  PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT
PLANS (CONTINUED)
    For the  French plan,  the assumed  discount rate  and rate  of increase  in
future compensation levels were 9.0% and 5.0%, respectively.

    Certain  subsidiaries have noncontributory  profit-sharing plans and defined
contribution pension  plans  providing  for  minimum  contributions  based  upon
defined levels of subsidiary income or employee compensation.

    Pension  and profit-sharing expense  for the years  ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991 amounted to approximately $1,338, $2,141 and $1,234, respectively.

    A subsidiary of the Company, acquired  in 1993 provides certain health  care
benefits  for eligible retired employees. The status of the plan at December 31,
1993 is as follows:

                                                                               ---------
</TABLE>

    The postretirement benefit cost in 1993 consisted of interest cost of $39 on
the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation  ("APBO").  The  plan   is
unfunded.  The  discount rate  used in  determining  APBO was  7.25%. Increasing
assumed health care trends one percentage point will increase the APBO by $66 as
of December 31, 1993.

10. INCOME TAXES
    Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, the  liability method is used in  accounting
for  income taxes.  Under this method,  deferred tax assets  and liabilities are
determined based on  differences between  financial reporting and  tax bases  of
assets  and liabilities and  are measured using  the enacted tax  rates and laws
that will be in effect  when the differences are  expected to reverse. Prior  to
the  adoption  of Statement  109, income  tax expense  was determined  using the
deferred method. Deferred tax expense was  based on items of income and  expense
that  were  reported in  different  years in  the  financial statements  and tax
returns and were measured at the tax  rate in effect in the year the  difference
originated.

    As  permitted by Statement 109,  the Company has elected  not to restate the
financial statements of  any prior  years. The effect  of the  change on  pretax
income  from continuing operations for the year  ended December 31, 1993 was not
material; however, the  cumulative effect of  the change as  of January 1,  1993
increased net income by $660 or $.03 per share.

    The  Company and its U.S. subsidiaries file  Federal income tax returns on a
consolidated basis. The provision (benefit) for income taxes has been classified
as follows in the consolidated statements of income:

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
    In  the  normal course  of business,  the  Company is  sometimes named  as a
defendant in litigation. In the opinion of management, based upon the advice  of
counsel,  any uninsured  liability which may  result from the  resolution of any
present litigation or  asserted claim  will not have  a material  effect on  the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

    In  connection with the resignation of an  executive of the Company on March
18, 1994, the Company  has entered into an  agreement with such executive  which
provides, among other things, certain payments and acceleration of certain other
payments  in connection with the executive's related employment agreement. As of
December 31,  1993, the  Company's remaining  commitments under  this  agreement
total approximately $1.1 million.

13. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    The Company has recorded charges to operations of $5,586 and $6,508 for  the
years  ended  December  31,  1992 and  1991,  respectively,  related  to certain
restructuring actions initiated by  the Company ($1,248 and  $959 for the  years
ended  December 31,  1992 and 1991,  respectively, are  included in discontinued
apparel operations.)

    In 1992, the  Company sold  its data  communications equipment  distribution
business  and an apparel-related  unit in return  for $3,350 in  cash, $1,858 of
short and long-term notes  and a marketable equity  security with a fair  market
value  of $1,500. The disposal of  these businesses relate to actions originally
initiated in  1991.  The Company  also  initiated other  restructuring  actions,
including  the disposal of other operations, that do not relate to the Company's
core business.

    In 1991, the Company initiated certain restructuring actions, including  the
disposal  of  certain operations,  that  did not  relate  to the  Company's core
business. These operations included the above-mentioned data communications  and
apparel-related businesses.

    In  1992 and 1991, certain restructuring  actions initiated in 1991 and 1990
required more costs to implement than originally expected. The additional costs,
included in the restructuring  charges for these periods,  changed based on  the
revised estimates and experience to date.

    On  August 16, 1991, the Company redeemed  all of the outstanding 13% Senior
Subordinated Notes due  April 15,  1997 at  a redemption  price of  100% of  the
principal  amount  thereof  ($23,000)  together  with  accrued  interest  to the
redemption date. An  extraordinary charge  of $1,436, net  of a  tax benefit  of
$794, was recorded to reflect the write-off of unamortized discount and expense.

having a par value of one dollar ($1) each and thirty-five million (35,000,000)

limitations as are stated and expressed in this Article and in the resolution or
resolutions providing for the issue of such series adopted by the Board of
Directors as hereinafter provided.

(2)  Authority is hereby expressly granted to the Board of Directors, subject to
the provisions of this Article, to establish and designate one or more series of
Preferred Stock and to fix the variations in the relative rights, preferences
and limitations of each series, including without limitation:

     (a)  The number of shares to constitute such series and the distinctive
designations thereof;

     (b)  The dividend rate to which such shares shall be entitled and the
restrictions, limitations and conditions upon the payment of such dividends,
whether dividends shall be cumulative, the date or dates from which dividends
(if cumulative) shall accumulate and the dates on which dividends (if declared)
shall be payable;

     (c)  Whether or not the shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if
so, the terms, limitations and restrictions with respect to such redemption,
including without limitation the manner of selecting shares for redemption if
less than all shares are to be redeemed, and the amount, if any, in addition to
any accrued dividends thereon, which the holders of shares of such series shall
be entitled to receive upon the redemption thereof, which amount may vary at
different redemption dates and may be different with respect to shares redeemed
through the operation of any purchase, retirement or sinking fund and with
respect to shares otherwise redeemed;

     (d)  The amount in addition to any accrued dividends thereon which the
holders of shares of such series shall be entitled to receive upon the voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, which
amount may vary at different dates and may vary depending on whether such

     (e)  Whether or not the shares of such series shall be subject to the
operation of a purchase, retirement or sinking fund and, if so, the terms,
limitations and restrictions with respect thereto, including without limitation
whether such purchase, retirement or sinking fund shall be cumulative or non-
cumulative, the extent to and the manner in which such fund shall be applied to
the purchase, retirement or redemption of the shares of such series for
retirement, or to other corporate purposes and the terms and provisions relative
to the operation thereof;

     (f)  Whether or not the shares of such series shall have conversion
privileges and, if so, prices or rates of conversion and the method, if any, of
adjusting the same;

     (g)  The voting powers, if any, of such series in addition to the voting
powers provided in paragraph A(6) below; and

     (h)  Any other relative rights, preferences and limitations thereof as

(3)  All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall be identical with
each other in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at
different times may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be
cumulative; and all series shall rank equally and be identical in all respects,
except as permitted by the foregoing provisions of paragraph A(2).

(4)  The Board of Directors may provide that dividends on Preferred Stock shall
be declared and paid, or set apart for payment, and that the Corporation shall
not be in default under any obligation to redeem shares of Preferred Stock,
before any dividends shall be declared and paid, or set apart for payment, and
before any other distributions shall be made, on the Common Stock (except
dividends or other distributions in shares of Common Stock) or before the
Corporation shall acquire any shares of Common Stock (except in exchange for or
out of the proceeds of sale of Common Stock).

Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or
distribution of the assets of the Corporation shall be made to or set apart for

ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, the holders of the shares of each series
of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the amount per
share fixed by the Board of Directors for the particular series, plus an amount
equal to all dividends accrued thereon to the date of final distribution to such
holders; but they shall be entitled to no further payment.  For the purposes of
this paragraph A(5), the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash,
shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all
of the property or assets of the Corporation or a consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a
dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

alter or repeal any of the provisions of this Article so as adversely to affect
the preferences, rights or powers of the Preferred Stock;

series of the Preferred Stock consenting or voting, as the case may be,
separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions herein or
in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for
the issue of such series so as adversely to affect the preferences, rights or
powers of the Preferred Stock of such series; provided, however, that any vote
or consent required by clause (ii) of subparagraph (a) above may be given and
made effective by the filing of an appropriate amendment of the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation without obtaining the vote or consent of the
holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation, the right to give such vote or
consent being expressly waived by holders of such Common Stock, unless the
action to be taken would adversely affect the preferences, rights or powers of
the Common Stock; and provided further that any vote or consent required by this
subparagraph (b) may be given and made effective by the filing of an appropriate
amendment of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation without obtaining
the vote or consent of the holders of any other series of the Preferred Stock or
the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation, the right to give such vote
or consent being expressly waived by all holders of such other series of
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, unless the action to be taken would adversely
affect the preferences, rights or  powers of such other series of Preferred
Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be; and

     (c)  the term "outstanding", when used in reference to shares of stock,
shall mean issued shares, excluding shares held by the Corporation and shares
called for redemption, funds for the redemption of which shall have been set
aside or deposited in trust.

(7)  The shares of Preferred Stock may be issued by the Corporation from time to
time for such consideration, not less than the par value thereof, as may be

series of Preference Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on

                                     FOURTH:
     The said Corporation shall commence on the second day of March in the year
one thousand eight hundred and sixty six, and its duration shall be perpetual.

                                     FIFTH:

     The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business
and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders:

(1)  The number of directors of the Corporation (exclusive of directors (the
"Preferred Stock Directors") who may be elected by the holders of any one or
more series of Preferred Stock which may at any time be outstanding, voting
separately as a class or classes) shall not be less than nine nor more than
twelve, the exact number to be fixed from time to time solely by resolution of
the Board of Directors, acting by not less than a majority of the entire Board
and to be fixed initially at nine.

(2)  The Board of Directors (exclusive of Preferred Stock Directors) shall be
divided into three classes; with the term of office of one class expiring each
year.  At the annual meeting of stockholders in 1983, three directors of the
first class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1984
annual meeting, three directors of the second class shall be elected to hold
office for a term expiring at the 1985 annual meeting and three directors of the

elected to hold office for a three year term and until the election and
qualification of their respective successors in office.  In case of any increase
in the number of directors (other than Preferred Stock Directors), the number of
directors in each class shall be as nearly equal as possible.

<PAGE>

                                                                               8


(3)  Subject to the rights of the holders of any one or more series of Preferred
Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase
in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors
resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from
office for cause or other reason shall be filled solely by the Board of
Directors, acting by not less than a majority of the directors then in office.
Any director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of the class
for which such director shall be elected and qualified (subject to any
requirement of law specifically calling for an earlier vote of stockholders).
No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

(4)  Except as otherwise provided in Article THIRD of this certificate of
incorporation with respect to the holders of any one or more series of Preferred
Stock or as otherwise provided by law, special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes shall be called solely by resolution of the Board of
Directors, acting by not less than a majority of the entire Board, and the power
of stockholders to call a special meeting is specifically DENIED. The place and
notice of any special meeting shall be as set forth in the by-laws. No business

Stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of Directors of the
Corporation may be removed, but such removal shall be only for cause.  At any

stockholders of the Corporation the notice of which shall state that the removal
of a director or directors is among the purposes of the meeting, the holders of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, by vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares thereof, may remove such director or directors for cause.

(6)  No action required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a
meeting except by unanimous written consent of all stockholders entitled to vote
thereon, and the power of less than all such stockholders to consent in writing,
without such a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.

(7)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this certificate of incorporation
or the by-laws of the Corporation (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser
percentage may be specified by law, this certificate of incorporation or the by-
laws), the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 75 percent of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors (which shall mean 75% of the votes
entitled to be cast by such shares) shall be required (i) to amend or repeal any
provision of this Article FIFTH (including, without limitation, this
section (7)) or (ii) to adopt any provision in this certificate of incorporation
or the by-laws of the Corporation which is inconsistent with any provision of
this article FIFTH or (iii) in general, to adopt, amend or repeal any provision
of the by-laws of the Corporation relating to meetings of stockholders or
directors (including, without limitation, voting or quorum requirements) or
qualification, election or removal of directors or officers.

                              WILLCOX & GIBBS, INC.

                Under Section 805 of the Business Corporation Law
                              ---------------------

     WE THE UNDERSIGNED, RICHARD J. MACKEY and ALLAN M. GONOPOLSKY, being
respectively the President and Assistant Secretary of Willcox & Gibbs, Inc. (the
"Corporation"), do hereby certify:

     1.   The name of the Corporation is WILLCOX & GIBBS, INC.  The original
name was WILLCOX & GIBBS SEWING MACHINE COMPANY.

     2.   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed by the
Department of State on the 2nd day of March, 1866.

     3.   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as heretofore
amended, is hereby further amended by the following provisions stating the
number, designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations of a series of
Preference Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation, designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preference Stock, as fixed by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation pursuant to the authority vested in it by the
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation:

     Series A Junior Participating Preference Stock:

     Section 1.  DESIGNATION.  This series shall be designated as "Series A
Junior Participating Preference Stock" (hereinafter "this Series").

     Section 2.  NUMBER.  The number of shares of this Series authorized to be
issued is 220,000.
     Section 3.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares
of any series of Preference Stock or Preferred Stock, par value $12.00 per
share, of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock") ranking prior and superior to
this Series with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of this Series
shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors
out of funds legally available therefor, semiannual dividends payable in cash on
the last day of April and October in each year (each such date being referred to
herein as a "Semiannual Dividend Payment Date") commencing on the first
Semiannual Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction
of a share of this Series, in an amount per share (rounded to


                                       12


<PAGE>

                                                                              13


the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $5.625 or (b) subject to the
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per
share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount
(payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common
Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since
the immediately preceding Semiannual Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to
the first Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any
share or fraction of a share of this Series.  In the event the Corporation shall
at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of this
Series were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the
preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on this
Series as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it
declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend
payable in shares of Common Stock); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event no
dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the
period between any Semiannual Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent
Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $5.625 per share on this Series
shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Semiannual Dividend Payment
Date.

     (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding
shares of this Series from the Semiannual Dividend Payment Date next preceding
the date of issue of such shares of this Series, unless the date of issue of
such shares is prior to the record date for the first Semiannual Dividend
Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from
the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Semiannual
Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination
of holders of shares of this Series entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and
before such Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such
dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Semiannual Dividend
Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends
paid on the shares of this Series in an amount less than the total amount of
such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated
pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination
of holders of shares of this Series entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 50 days
prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

     Section 4.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation (a "Liquidation"), no distribution shall be made (x) to the holders
of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation)
to this Series unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of this

<PAGE>

                                                                              14


Series shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and
unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date
of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of this Series shall be
entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for
adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be
distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (y) to the holders of stock
ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) with this
Series, except distributions made ratably on this Series and all other such
parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such
shares are entitled upon such Liquidation.  In the event the Corporation shall
at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of
this Series were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in
clause (x) of the preceding sentence shall be  adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

     For purposes of this Certificate, the voluntary sale, lease, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all
or substantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation to, or a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with, one or more corporations shall
not be deemed to be a Liquidation.

     Section 5.  REDEMPTION.  The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.

     Section 6.  VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of shares of this Series shall have
the following voting rights:

     (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each
share of this Series shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all
matters submitted to a vote of the Common shareholders of the Corporation.  In
the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
number of votes per share to which holders of shares of this Series were
entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or by law, the holders of shares of this Series
and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on
all matters submitted to a vote of Common shareholders of the Corporation.


                                       14


<PAGE>

                                                                              15


     (C)  (i)  If at any time dividends on any shares of this Series shall be in
arrears in an amount equal to three full semiannual dividends thereon, the
holders of this Series and all other series of Preference Stock (in each case to
the extent then entitled pursuant to the terms of such series), voting together
as one class, shall have the exclusive and special right to elect two directors
of the Corporation, and the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two (if not previously
increased in connection with the right of other series of Preference Stock
entitled to vote together with this Series to elect directors of the
Corporation) for such purpose.

     (ii) Whenever any such right of the holders of this Series shall have
vested, such right may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the
holders of this Series and all other series so entitled to vote, if any, called
as hereinafter provided, or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and
thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders.  The right of the holders of this
Series voting separately as a class with such other series to elect members of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation  as aforesaid shall continue until
such time as all dividends accrued on all shares of this Series shall  have been
paid in full, or declared and set apart for payment, at which time the special
right of the holders of this Series so to vote separately as a class with such
other series for the election of directors shall terminate, subject to revesting
in the event of each and every subsequent occurrence of an arrearage specified
in subparagraph (C)(i) above.

    (iii) At any time when such special voting power shall have vested in the
holders of this Series as provided in the preceding subparagraph (C)(i), the
proper officer of the Corporation shall, upon the written request of the holders
of record of at least 10% of the then outstanding voting power of shares of this
Series and all other series entitled to vote in the election of such directors
addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation, call a special meeting of the
holders of this Series for the purpose of electing directors pursuant to this
paragraph (C).  Such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date.  If
such meeting shall not be called by the proper officer of the Corporation within
twenty days after personal service of such written request upon the Secretary of
the Corporation, or within twenty days after mailing the same within the United
States of America, by registered mail addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at its principal office, then the holders of record of at least 10%
of the then outstanding voting power of shares of this Series and  all other
series entitled to vote in the election of such directors may designate in
writing one of their  number to call such meeting at the expense of the
Corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated by
giving the notice required for annual meetings of shareholders.  Any holder of
this Series so designated shall have access to the stock books of the
Corporation for the purpose of causing meetings of shareholders to be called
pursuant to these provisions.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subparagraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period
within ninety days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual
meeting of shareholders.

     (iv) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the
holders of this Series and any other series of Preference Stock shall have the
special right to elect directors as provided in  this paragraph (C), the
presence, in person or by  proxy, of the holders of one-third of the voting
power of the then outstanding aggregate number of shares of this Series


                                       15

                                                                              16


and such other series shall be required to  constitute a quorum for the election
of any director by the holders of such series.  At any such meeting or
adjournment thereof, (a) the absence of a quorum shall not prevent the election
of directors other than those to be elected by all such series of Preference
Stock voting separately as a class, and the absence of a quorum for the election
of such other directors shall not prevent the election of the directors to be
elected by this Series and any other series of Preference Stock that may be
voting with it separately as a class, and (b) in the absence of either or both
such quorums, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares
present in person or by proxy of the stock or stocks which lack a quorum shall
have power to adjourn the meeting for the election of directors who they are
entitled to elect from time to time without notice other than announcement at
the meeting until a quorum shall be present.

     (v)  During any period when the holders of this Series have the right to
vote separately as a class for directors as provided in this paragraph (C), (1)
the directors so elected by the holders of the one or more series of Preference
Stock entitled to vote for such directors shall continue in office until the
next succeeding annual meeting or until their successors, if any, are elected by
such holders and qualify or, until termination of the right of the holders of
the one or more series of Preference Stock entitled to vote for such directors
to vote separately as a class for directors as provided in this paragraph (C)
and (2) vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be filled only by vote of a
majority (even if that be only a single director) of the remaining directors
theretofore elected by the holders of the one or more series of Preference Stock
which elected the directors whose office shall have become vacant or if there be
no such remaining director, directors to fill such vacancies shall be elected by
the holders of the one or more series of Preference Stock entitled to vote for
such directors at a special meeting called pursuant to the provisions of
subparagraph (C)(iii) hereof.  Immediately upon any termination of the right of
the holders of this Series and any other series of Preference Stock to vote
separately as a class for  directors as provided in this paragraph (C), the term
of office of the directors then in office so elected by the holders of this
Series and any such other series shall terminate.  Whenever the term of office
of the directors so elected by the holders of this Series and any such other
series shall terminate and the special voting power vested in the holders of
this Series and any such other series as provided in this paragraph (C) shall
have terminated, the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided
for in the by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions
of this paragraph (C).

     (D)  So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, the Corporation
shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of this Series, given by such holders as one class, amend the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation in any manner which would
materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of this
Series so as to affect them adversely.

     (E)  Except as provided herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation or by law, holders of shares of this Series shall have no special
voting rights and their consent shall not be required for taking any corporate
action.

     Section 7.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.

     (A)  Whenever semiannual dividends or other dividends or distributions
payable on this Series as provided in Section 3 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
declared, on shares of this Series outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
Corporation shall not:

     (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or
redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) to this Series;

    (ii)  declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any
shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation)
with this Series, except dividends paid ratably on this Series and all such
parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the
total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;

   (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of
any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) with
this Series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation may at any time redeem,
purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for
shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or
upon Liquidation) to this Series; or

    (iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of this
Series, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or
upon Liquidation) with this Series, except in accordance with a purchase offer
made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to
all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after
consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights
and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good
faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or
classes.

     (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the
Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 7,
purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

     Section 8.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.  In case the Corporation shall
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which
the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of
this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged for or changed into an
amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth)
equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any
other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which
each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the
Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number
of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the
preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of this
Series shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     Section 9.  RANKING.  This Series shall rank junior to all other series of
the Corporation's Preference Stock and Preferred Stock as to the payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets upon Liquidation, unless the terms of
any such series shall provide otherwise.

     Section 10.  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  This Series may be issued in fractions of
a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's
fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in
distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of this
Series.

                            CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT

                       OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

                                       OF

                              WILLCOX & GIBBS, INC.

                Under Section 805 of the Business Corporation Law
                              ---------------------

     WE THE UNDERSIGNED, John K. Ziegler and Allan M. Gonopolsky, being
respectively the Chairman of the Board and Assistant Secretary of Willcox &
Gibbs, Inc. (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify:

     1.   The name of the Corporation is WILLCOX & GIBBS, INC.  The original
name was WILLCOX & GIBBS SEWING MACHINE COMPANY.

     2.   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation was filed by the
Department of State on the 2nd day of March, 1866.

     3.   The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as heretofore
amended, is hereby further amended by the following provisions stating the
number, designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations of a series of
Preference Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation, designated as
Series B Junior Participating Preference Stock, as fixed by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation pursuant to the authority vested in it by the
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation:

     Series B Junior Participating Preference Stock:

     Section 1.  DESIGNATION.  This series shall be designated as "Series B
Junior Participating Preference Stock" (hereinafter "this Series").

     Section 2.  NUMBER.  The number of shares of this Series authorized to be
issued is 500,000.

     Section 3.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

     (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares
of any series of Preference Stock or  Preferred Stock, par value $12.00 per
share, of the Corporation (the "Preferred Stock") ranking prior and superior to
this Series with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of this Series
shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors
out of funds legally available therefor, semiannual dividends payable in cash on
the last day of April and October in each year (each such date being referred to
herein as a "Semiannual Dividend Payment Date") commencing on the first
Semiannual Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction
of a share of this Series, in an amount per share (rounded to


                                       19


<PAGE>

                                                                              20


the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $5.625 or (b) subject to the
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per
share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount
(payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than a
dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common
Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock") since
the immediately preceding Semiannual Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to
the first Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any
share or fraction of a share of this Series.  In the event the Corporation shall
at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of this
Series were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the
preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on this
Series as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it
declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend
payable in shares of Common Stock); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event no
dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the
period between any Semiannual Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent
Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $5.625 per share on this Series
shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Semiannual Dividend Payment
Date.

     (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding
shares of this Series from the Semiannual Dividend Payment Date next preceding
the date of issue of such shares of this Series, unless the date of issue of
such shares is prior to the record date for the first Semiannual Dividend
Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from
the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Semiannual
Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination
of holders of shares of this Series entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and
before such Semiannual Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such
dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Semiannual Dividend
Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends
paid on the shares of this Series in an amount less than the total amount of
such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated
pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination
of holders of shares of this Series entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 50 days
prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

     Section 4.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation (a "Liquidation"), no distribution shall be made (x) to the holders
of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation)
to this Series unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of this


                                       20


<PAGE>

                                                                              21


Series shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and
unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date
of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of this Series shall be
entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for
adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be
distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (y) to the holders of stock
ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) with this
Series, except distributions made ratably on this Series and all other such
parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such
shares are entitled upon such Liquidation.  In the event the Corporation shall
at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of
this Series were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in
clause (x) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

     For purposes of this Certificate, the voluntary sale, lease, exchange or
transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all
or substantially all of the property or assets of the Corporation to, or a
consolidation or merger of the Corporation with, one or more corporations shall
not be deemed to be a Liquidation.

     Section 5.  REDEMPTION.  The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.

     Section 6.  VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of shares of this Series shall have
the following voting rights:

     (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each
share of this Series shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all
matters submitted to a vote of the Common shareholders of the Corporation.  In
the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or
combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
number of votes per share to which holders of shares of this Series were
entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or by law, the holders of shares of this Series
and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on
all matters submitted to a vote of Common shareholders of the Corporation.

                                                                              22


     (C)  (i)  If at any time dividends on any shares of this Series shall be in
arrears in an amount equal to three full semiannual dividends thereon, the
holders of this Series and all other series of Preference Stock (in each case to
the extent then entitled pursuant to the terms of such series), voting together
as one class, shall have the exclusive and special right to elect two directors
of the Corporation, and the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two (if not previously
increased in connection with the right of other series of Preference Stock
entitled to vote together with this Series to elect directors of the
Corporation) for such purpose.

    (ii)  Whenever any such right of the holders of this Series shall have
vested, such right may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of the
holders of this Series and all other series so entitled to vote, if any, called
as hereinafter provided, or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and
thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders.  The right of the holders of this
Series voting separately as a class with such other series to elect members of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation as aforesaid shall continue until such
time as all dividends accrued on all shares of this Series shall have been paid
in full, or declared and set apart for payment, at which time the special right
of the holders of this Series so to vote separately as a class with such other
series for the election of directors shall terminate, subject to revesting in
the event of each and every subsequent occurrence of an arrearage specified in
subparagraph  (C)(i) above.

   (iii)  At any time when such special voting power shall have vested in the
holders of this Series as provided in the preceding subparagraph (C)(i), the
proper officer of the Corporation shall, upon the written request of the holders
of record of at least 10% of the then outstanding voting power of shares of this
Series and all other series entitled to vote in the election of such directors
addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation, call a special meeting of the
holders of this Series for the purpose of electing directors pursuant to this
paragraph (C).  Such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date.  If
such meeting shall not be called by the proper officer of the Corporation within
twenty days after personal service of such written request upon the Secretary of
the Corporation, or within twenty days after mailing the same within the United
States of America, by registered mail addressed to the Secretary of the
Corporation at its principal office, then the holders of record of at least 10%
of the then outstanding voting power of shares of this Series and all other
series entitled to vote in the election of such directors may designate in
writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the
Corporation, and such meeting may be called by such person so designated by
giving the notice required for annual meetings of shareholders.  Any holder of
this Series so designated shall have access to the stock books of the
Corporation for the purpose of causing meetings of shareholders to be called
pursuant to these provisions.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subparagraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period
within ninety days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual
meeting of shareholders.

    (iv)  At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the
holders of this Series and any other series of Preference Stock shall have the
special right to elect directors as provided in this paragraph (C), the
presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of one-third of the voting power
of the then outstanding aggregate number of shares of this Series and


                                       22

                                                                              23


such other series shall be required to constitute a quorum for the election of
any director by the holders of such series.  At any such meeting or adjournment
thereof, (a) the absence of a quorum shall not prevent the election of directors
other than those to be elected by all such series of Preference Stock voting
separately as a class, and the absence of a quorum for the election of such
other directors shall not prevent the election of the directors to be elected by
this Series and any other series of Preference Stock that may be voting with it
separately as a class, and (b) in the absence of either or both such quorums,
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or
by proxy of the stock or stocks which lack a quorum shall have power to adjourn
the meeting for the election of directors who they are entitled to elect from
time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.
     (v)  During any period when the holders of this Series have the right to
vote separately as a class for directors as provided in this paragraph (C),
(1) the directors so elected by the holders of the one or more series of
Preference Stock entitled to vote for such directors shall continue in office
until the next succeeding annual meeting or until their successors, if any, are
elected by such holders and qualify or, until termination of the right of the
holders of the one or more series of Preference Stock entitled to vote for such
directors to vote separately as a class for directors as provided in this
paragraph (C) and (2) vacancies in the Board of Directors shall be filled only
by vote of a majority (even if that be only a single director) of the remaining
directors theretofore elected by the holders of the one or more series of
Preference Stock which elected the directors whose office shall have become
vacant or if there be no such remaining director, directors to fill such
vacancies shall be elected by the holders of the one or more series of
Preference Stock entitled to vote for such directors at a special meeting called
pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (C)(iii) hereof.  Immediately upon
any termination of the right of the holders of this Series and any other series
of Preference Stock to vote separately as a class for directors as provided in
this paragraph (C), the term of office of the directors then in office so
elected by the holders of this Series and any such other series shall terminate.
Whenever the term of office of the directors so elected by the holders of this
Series and any such other series shall terminate and the special voting power
vested in the holders of this Series and any such other series as provided in
this paragraph (C) shall have terminated, the number of directors shall be such
number as may be provided for in the by-laws irrespective of any increase made
pursuant to the  provisions of this paragraph (C).

     (D)  So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, the Corporation
shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of this Series, given by such holders as one class, amend the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation in any manner which would
materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of this
Series so as to affect them adversely.

     (E)  Except as provided herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation or by law, holders of shares of this Series shall have no special
voting rights and their consent shall not be required for taking any corporate
action.

     Section 7.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.

     (A)  Whenever semiannual dividends or other dividends or distributions
payable on this Series as provided in Section 3 are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not
declared, on shares of this Series outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
Corporation shall not:

     (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or
redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) to  this Series;

    (ii)  declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any
shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation)
with this Series, except dividends paid ratably on this Series and all such
parity stock on which dividends are  payable or in arrears in proportion to the
total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are  then entitled;

   (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of
any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon Liquidation) with
this Series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation may at any time redeem,
purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for
shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or
upon Liquidation) to this Series; or

    (iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of this
Series, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or
upon Liquidation) with this Series, except in accordance with a purchase offer
made in writing or by  publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to
all holders of such shares upon such terms as the  Board of Directors, after
consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights
and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good
faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or
classes.

     (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the
Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 7,
purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

     Section 8.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.  In case the Corporation shall
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which
the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of
this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged for or changed into an
amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth)
equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any
other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which
each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the
Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by

payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number
of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the
preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of this
Series shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     Section 9.  RANKING.  This Series shall rank junior to all other series of
the Corporation's Preference Stock and Preferred Stock as to the payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets upon Liquidation, unless the terms of
any such series shall provide otherwise.

     Section 10.  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  This Series may be issued in fractions of
a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's
fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in
distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of this
Series.

     Section 11.  OTHER RIGHTS.  The holders of shares of this Series shall not
have any other preferences or special rights.

     4.   The amendment referred to herein was authorized by resolution duly
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting thereof duly
called and held on November 12, 1992, at which a quorum was present and acting

                                PLACE OF BUSINESS

     The principal office of the Company for the carrying on of its general
business and affairs, for the keeping of its books, papers, and records, for the
making of transfers of stock and for the payment of dividends shall be in the

                                   ARTICLE II

                             STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING.  The Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the
election of Directors and for action upon such other matters as may be brought
before such meeting shall be held on such date and at such place, within or
without the State of New York, as may be fixed in advance by the Board of
Directors.

     No business shall be transacted at an Annual Meeting of Stockholders except
such business as shall be (i) specified in the notice (or supplemental notice)
of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii)
otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or the Chairman of the Board of Directors or (iii) brought before the

Annual Meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice
in writing to the Secretary of the Company.  To be timely, a stockholder's
notice must be delivered or mailed to, and received at, the principal executive
offices of the Company not less than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of

permitted, the foregoing shall apply to actions by or in the right of the

All financial statements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied among the financial statements of the applicable company,
except as stated in the notes to such financial statements and year-end audit
adjustments in the case of unaudited statements and present fairly in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
of the Summers Group, as the case may be, as of the date specified and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods indicated in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principle.  There has been no
material adverse change in the business, financial condition, operations,
prospects, property or assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Summers
Group, taken as a whole, since December 31, 1992.  The aforementioned
information (excluding that referred to in clause (v)), taken as a whole, does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading.
The pro forma consolidated financial statement information referred to in
clause (iv) above fairly presents in all material respects the information shown
therein and, in the opinion of the Company, the assumptions used in the
preparation thereof are reasonable and the adjustments used therein are
appropriate to give effect to the transactions or circumstances referred to
therein.  The projected financial information referred to in clause (v)
delivered to you has been prepared in good faith by the Company and except as
disclosed therein, on a basis consistent in all material respects with the
Company's past practices, and the assumptions made in preparing such projections
are reasonable as of the date of such projections and reflect the best available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the Company as of such
dates.  Such projections provide, as of the date of such projections, reasonable
estimations of future performance subject to the uncertainty and approximation
inherent in any projections.

          4B.      DISCLOSURE.  The information provided to you by the Company
in connection with this Amendment, taken as a whole, does not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.  There is no fact peculiar to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Summers Group which materially adversely affects or in the
future will (so far as the Company can now reasonably foresee) materially
adversely affect the business, property, assets, prospects, financial condition
or operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Summers Group, taken as a
whole, and which has not been set forth in this Amendment or disclosed to you
prior to the Effective Date of this Amendment.

          4C.      OUTSTANDING DEBT.  Neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any Debt outstanding, nor, after the consummation of the
Closing under the Summers Purchase Agreement, will the Summers Group have any
Debt outstanding, except as permitted by paragraphs 6A(3) and 6D(2).  There
exists no default under the provisions of any instrument evidencing such Debt or
of any agreement relating thereto which default would have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition, property, assets, prospects or
operations of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Summers Group, taken as a
whole.

          4D.      TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  To the knowledge of the Company, the
Company has and each of its Subsidiaries and the Summers Group has good and
indefeasible title to its respective real properties and good title to all of
its other properties and assets (other than, in each case, properties which it
leases), including the properties and assets reflected in the balance sheets as
at

subject (in the case of the Summers Group, after consummation of the Closing
under the Summers Purchase Agreement) to no Lien of any kind except Liens
permitted by paragraph 6D(1) of the Agreement.  All leases of the Company or any
Subsidiary or the Summers Group necessary in any material respect for the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Summers
Group, taken as a whole, are valid and subsisting and are in full force and
effect.

Gentlemen:

     We have acted as counsel to Willcox & Gibbs, Inc. (the "Company") in

letter pursuant to paragraph 1A of the Amendment.  Capitalized terms used herein
that are not defined herein have the respective meanings specified in the Note
Agreement.

     In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have examined the Amendment,
the Note Agreement, originals, photostatic or certified copies of certain of the
corporate records and documents of the Company, copies of public documents,
certificates of officers or representatives of the Company and such other
instruments and documents, have made such inquiries as to questions of fact of
officers and representatives of the Company and have made such examination of
law as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for such opinions.  In
such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to
authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or
photostatic copies.  As to questions of fact relevant to the opinions
hereinafter expressed, we have relied upon the representations and warranties of
the Company made in the Amendment and upon certain certificates of or
representations from employees of the Company.  In rendering the opinions

     We are members of the bar of the State of New York, and each of the
opinions expressed below is restricted to matters governed by the Federal laws
of the United States and the laws of the State of New York.

     Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby are within
the corporate power of the Company and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Amendment is a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms (subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and the application of general
principles of equity).

     3.   Neither the execution nor delivery of the Amendment by the Company,
nor fulfillment of nor compliance with the terms and provisions of the Amendment
by the Company, will conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in any
violation of, or result in the creation of any mortgage, pledge, lien or other
encumbrance upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, (i) the charter or bylaws of the Company, or (ii) any
law or regulation, or, to the extent known to us, any award of any arbitrator,
any agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which the Company is

condition to the valid execution or delivery by the Company of the Amendment or
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby.

                            Revolving Credit Facility
                            -------------------------

          2.01 COMMITMENT.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to make Advances to the Borrower from
time to time from the Closing Date until the Revolving Credit Termination Date
on a pro rata basis as to the total borrowing requested by the Borrower on any
day determined by its Applicable Commitment Percentage up to but not exceeding
the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender, PROVIDED, however, that the
Lenders will not be required and shall have no obligation to make any Advance
(i) so long as a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
or (ii) if the Agent has accelerated the maturity of the Notes as a result of an
Event of Default, (iii) if Borrower has not furnished to the Agent the Borrowing
Base Certificate required pursuant to Section 8.01(d) hereof or (iv) any other
term or condition set forth in Sections 5.01 or 5.02 hereof, as the case may be,
to the extent applicable, which has not been satisfied or waived; PROVIDED
further, however, that immediately after giving effect to each Advance, the
principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the amount of all Swing
Line Outstandings, Acceptances, Outstanding Letters of Credit and Reimbursement
Obligations shall not exceed either the Total Revolving Credit Commitment or the
Borrowing Base as set forth on the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently
delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section 8.01(d).  Within such limits, the
Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow hereunder, on a Business Day in the case
of a Floating Rate Loan or Fixed CD Loan, and on a LIBOR Business Day in the
case of a LIBOR Loan, from time to time from the Closing Date until, but (as to
borrowings and reborrowings) not including, the Revolving Credit Termination
Date; PROVIDED, however, that (x) no Fixed CD Loan shall be made less than
thirty (30) days before the Stated Revolving Credit Termination Date and no
LIBOR Loan shall be made less than one month before the Stated Revolving Credit
Termination Date and (y) each Fixed Rate Loan may, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.06, be repaid only on the last day of the Interest Period with respect
thereto.  The Borrower agrees that if at any time the Outstandings shall exceed
either the Borrowing Base or the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower
shall immediately reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Loans such
that, as a result of such reduction, each of the Borrowing Base and the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment shall equal or exceed the Outstandings.

          2.02 AMOUNTS.  Each Revolving Loan hereunder and conversions under
Section 2.12 shall be in an amount of at least $1,000,000, and in integral
multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof except as provided in Section 2.04(c)
and Section 2.17.

          2.03 INTEREST PERIODS.  Each Revolving Loan shall be, at the
option of the Borrower specified in the Borrowing Notice furnished to the Agent
pursuant to subsection 2.04 hereof, either a Floating Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate
Loan, which shall in each case be made or maintained by each Lender at its
applicable Lending Office.  Floating Rate Loans and Fixed Rate Loans may be
outstanding at the same time, PROVIDED, however, there shall not be outstanding
at any one time Loans having more than six (6) different Interest Periods,
excluding Interest Periods for Acceptances; PROVIDED that all Floating Rate
Loans shall be treated as having a single Interest Period.

          2.04 ADVANCES.  (a) The Authorized Officer shall give the Agent (i) at
least two (2) Business Days' irrevocable telephonic notice of each Advance that
will be a Fixed CD Loan (whether representing an additional borrowing hereunder
or the conversion of borrowings hereunder from Floating Rate Loans or other
Fixed Rate Loans to Fixed CD Loans) prior to 10:30 A.M. Charlotte, North
Carolina time; (ii) at least three (3) LIBOR Business Days' irrevocable
telephonic notice of each Advance that will be a LIBOR Loan (whether
representing an additional borrowing hereunder or the conversion of borrowing
hereunder from Floating Rate Loans or other Fixed Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans)
prior to 10:30 A.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time; and (iii) irrevocable
telephonic notice of each Floating Rate Loan representing an additional
borrowing hereunder prior to 10:30 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the
day of such proposed Floating Rate Loan.  Each such Borrowing Notice, which
shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, shall specify the amount of the
borrowing, the type (Floating Rate, Fixed CD or LIBOR) of Revolving Loan, the
date of borrowing and, if a Fixed Rate Loan the Interest Period to be used in
the computation of interest.  The Authorized Officer shall provide the Agent
written confirmation of each such telephonic notice in the form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT F-1 with appropriate insertions but failure to provide such
confirmation shall not affect the validity of such telephonic notice.  Notice of
receipt of such Borrowing Notice shall be provided by the Agent to each Lender
by telephone with reasonable promptness, but not later than 12:00 noon,
Charlotte, North Carolina time on the same day as Agent's receipt of such
notice.  The Agent shall provide each Lender written confirmation of such
telephonic confirmation but failure to provide such notice shall not affect the
validity of such telephonic notice.  Failure to give notice of a conversion
shall not constitute a Default.

          (b)  Not later than 1:00 P.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time on the
date specified for each borrowing under this Article II, each Lender shall,
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make the
amount of the Advance or Advances to be made by it on such day available to the
Agent, by depositing or transferring the proceeds thereof in immediately
available funds at the Principal Office.  The amount so received by the Agent
shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be made available
to the Borrower by the Agent by 1:00 P.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time by
depositing the proceeds thereof in immediately available funds, in the
Borrower's Account.

          (c)  If a drawing is presented under any Letter of Credit in
accordance with the terms thereof or presentment is made of an Acceptance prior
to the Revolving Credit Termination Date and the Borrower shall not have
reimbursed NationsBank for the amount thereof in accordance with Section
3.04(a), then to the extent of the availability under the Swing Line, the amount
of such drawing or payment paid by NationsBank shall be declared an Advance
under the Swing Line on the date such payment is made by NationsBank.  If a
drawing is presented under any Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms
thereof or presentment is made of an Acceptance and to the extent that an
Advance under the Swing Line as provided in the preceding sentence (an
"Unreimbursed Drawing") shall not be available for the amount of such draw or
payment, then notice of such drawing or payment shall be provided promptly by
NationsBank to the Agent and the Agent shall provide notice to each Lender by
telephone.  If such notice to the Lenders of a drawing under any Letter of
Credit or payment pursuant to any Acceptance is given by the Agent at or before
12:00 noon Charlotte, North Carolina time on any Business Day, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have requested, and each Lender shall, pursuant to the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make an Advance that is a
Floating Rate Loan in the amount of such Lender's Applicable Commitment
Percentage of such Unreimbursed Drawing and shall pay such amount to the Agent
for the account of NationsBank at the Principal Office in Dollars and in
immediately available funds before 2:30 P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time
on the same Business Day.  If such notice to the Lenders is given by the Agent
after 12:00 noon Charlotte, North Carolina time on any Business Day, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have requested, and each Lender shall, pursuant to
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, make an Advance that
is a Floating Rate Loan in the amount of such Lender's Applicable Commitment
Percentage of such Unreimbursed Drawing and shall pay such amount to the Agent
for the account of NationsBank at the Principal Office in Dollars and in
immediately available funds before 12:00 noon Charlotte, North Carolina time on
the next following Business Day.  Such Floating Rate Loan shall be deemed made
for a period ending on the following Business Day, which shall be extended
automatically to the next succeeding Business Day unless and until the Borrower
converts such Floating Rate Loan in accordance with the terms of Section 2.12
hereof.  Upon receipt by the Agent of proceeds of such Advance, the
Reimbursement Obligation represented by such drawing shall be deemed satisfied.

          2.05 PAYMENT OF INTEREST.  (a) The Borrower shall pay interest to the
Agent at the Principal Office for the account of each Lender on the outstanding
and unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Lender for the
period commencing on the date of such Revolving Loan until such Revolving Loan
shall be due at the then applicable Floating Rate for Floating Rate Loans, CD
Rate for Fixed CD Loans or LIBOR Rate for LIBOR Loans, as designated by the
Authorized Officer pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof or as otherwise provided
herein; provided, however, (i) upon the occurrence of the Rexel Event, that
portion of the additional interest PROVIDED for in clause (ii) of the definition
of Applicable Margin in Article I hereof upon the occurrence of such event
payable for the period from the Closing Date to the date of the Rexel Event,
shall be and become immediately due and payable on demand of the Agent from and
after the date of such Rexel Event, and (ii) that if any amount shall not be
paid when due (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such amount shall
bear interest thereafter (i) in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan, until the end of
the Interest Period with respect to such Fixed Rate Loan, at a rate of two
percent (2%) above such Fixed Rate and (ii) thereafter, and with respect to

                                       20

<PAGE>

                                                                           21


Floating Rate Loans, at a rate of interest per annum which shall be two percent
(2%) above the Floating Rate or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law,
whichever is lower, from the date such amount was due and payable until the date
such amount is paid in full.

          (b)  Interest on each Loan shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed.  Interest on each
(a) Floating Rate Loan and Swing Line Loan shall be paid in arrears on the last
Business Day of each December, March, June or September, (b) Fixed Rate Loan on
the last day of the applicable Interest Period for each Fixed Rate Loan and if
such Interest Period extends for more than three months or 90 days,
respectively, at intervals of three months or 90 days, as appropriate, after
the first day of such Interest Period, and (c) upon payment in full of the
principal amount of such Loan.  Payments of interest with respect to each Fixed
Rate Loan pursuant to the preceding sentence shall consist of accrued and unpaid
interest on the applicable Fixed Rate Loan from and including the first day of
the Interest Period applicable to such Fixed Rate Loan (or, in the case of the
payment of interest on the last day of an Interest Period of six months for a
LIBOR Loan or 180 days for a Fixed CD Loan, from and including the date of prior
payment of interest on such Loan during such Interest Period) to but excluding
the date of payment.  Payments of interest with respect to each Floating Rate
Loan and Swing Line Loan pursuant to the second preceding sentence shall consist
of accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Floating Rate Loan or Swing
Line Loan from and including the first day such Floating Rate Loan or Swing Line
Loan is outstanding to but excluding either the date of payment or conversion of
such Loan.  The Agent shall endeavor to send the Borrower written notice of all
interest payments not later than the Business Day immediately prior to the
payment date therefor; provided, any failure of the Agent to send such notice
shall not affect the Borrower's obligations with respect to payment of interest
hereunder.

          (c)  Promptly after the determination of any interest rate provided
for herein or any change therein, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the
Borrower.

          2.06 PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL.  (a) The principal amount of each Revolving
Loan and Swing Line Loan shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving
Credit Termination Date.  The duration of the initial Interest Period for each
Fixed Rate Loan shall be as specified in the Borrowing Notice.  The Borrower
shall have the option from time to time to elect the duration of subsequent
Interest Periods and to convert the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section
2.12 hereof.  If the Agent does not receive a notice of election of duration of
an Interest Period or to convert by the time prescribed by Section 2.12 hereof,
such Fixed Rate Loan shall automatically convert to a Floating Rate Loan.

          (b)  The Borrower shall have the right, upon telephonic notice by
10:30 A.M., Charlotte, North Carolina time on the date of any payment, from time
to time to prepay all or any portion of the Loans without penalty other than as
provided in Section 4.03.  Prepayments of Loans, other than Swing Line Loans and
other than those required under Section 4.03, shall be in minimum denominations
of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $250,000 in excess thereof. Each
payment of principal (including any prepayment) and payment of interest shall be
made to the Agent at the Principal Office, for the account of each Lender's
applicable Lending Office, in Dollars and in immediately available funds before
2:00 P.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the date such payment is due.
Dollar payments received by the Agent after 2:00 P.M., Charlotte,

North Carolina time on any day shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, debit the amount of
any such payment which is not made by such time to the Borrower's Account or any
ordinary deposit account of the Borrower with the Agent.

          (c)  In the event that any payment hereunder or under the Notes
becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, then such due date
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day; provided that interest
shall continue to accrue during the period of any such extension.

          2.07 BORROWER'S ACCOUNT.  The Agent shall render to the Borrower each
quarter a Loan ledger statement and a copy of the statement of the Borrower's
Account.

          2.08 NOTES.  Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by, and be
repayable with interest in accordance with the terms of, a promissory note
payable to the order of such Lender in the amount of its Applicable Commitment
Percentage of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, which Note shall be dated
the Closing Date or such later date pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance and
shall be duly completed, executed and delivered by the Borrower.

          2.09 PRO RATA PAYMENTS.  Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) each
payment on account of the principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans, the
Acceptance Margin and fees (other than any underwriting or structuring fee and
the Agent's fees payable under Section 11.11 hereof, which shall be retained by
NationsBank or the Agent, as the case may be) described in this Agreement shall
be made to the Agent for the account of the Lenders pro rata based on their
Applicable Commitment Percentages, (b) all payments to be made by the Borrower
for the account of each of the Lenders on account of principal, interest,
Acceptance Margin and fees, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim, and
(c) the Agent will promptly distribute payments received to the Lenders.

          2.10 REDUCTION IN COMMITMENT.

          (a)  OPTIONAL REDUCTIONS.  The Borrower shall have the right from time
to time (but not more frequently than twice during each quarterly period), upon
not less than ten (10) Business Days' written notice to the Agent to reduce the
Total Revolving Credit Commitment.  The Agent shall give each Lender, within one
(1) Business Day, telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) of such reduction.
Each such optional reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or
such greater amount which is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and shall
permanently reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Lenders pro rata.  No
such reduction shall result in the payment of any Fixed Rate Loan other than on
the last day of the Interest Period of such Loan.

          (b)  MANDATORY REDUCITONS.  The Total Revolving Credit Commitment
shall be reduced (with a simultaneous reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitment of the Lenders pro rata):

                                       22

<PAGE>

                                                                           23


               (i)  In an amount equal to $20,000,000 (or such lesser amount of
                    proceeds as shall cause the Total Revolving Credit
                    Commitment to be not greater than $70,000,000 after giving
                    effect to such reduction) upon the sale by the Borrower to
                    Rexel of equity securities (or securities exchangeable for,
                    convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) of
                    the Borrower, such reduction to be effective as of the
                    effective date of such sale; and

              (ii)  On the first anniversary of the Closing Date in the amount,
                    if any, by which the Total Revolving Credit Commitment on
                    such date exceeds $70,000,000.

          Each reduction of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall be
accompanied by prepayment of the Notes to the extent that the Outstandings
exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, after giving effect to such
reduction, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid.
Any prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be applied first to
prepayment of Floating Rate Loans, next to the prepayment of Swing Line Loans
and next to the prepayment of Fixed Rate Loans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in connection with any reduction in the Total Revolving Credit Commitment
required under clause (b)(i) above, if such required reduction would result in
payment of a Fixed Rate Loan prior to the end of its Interest Period, which
prepayment would require a payment under Section 4.03, then the Borrower may
defer the date of such prepayment until, but not later than, the earlier of the
last day of such Interest Period or 31 days if such deferral of payment would
eliminate the requirement that a payment be made under Section 4.03 hereof;
provided, the amount of such prepayment shall be either held in a demand
deposit account or invested in the manner permitted in any one or more of
Sections 9.06(i), (ii) or (iii).


          2.11 INCREASE AND DECREASE IN AMOUNTS.  The amount of the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment which shall be available to the Borrower shall be
reduced by the stated amount of all Swing Line Outstandings, Outstanding Letters
of Credit and outstanding Reimbursement Obligations and Acceptances.

          2.12 CONVERSIONS AND ELECTIONS OF SUBSEQUENT INTEREST PERIODS.
Provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and subject to the limitations set forth below and in Sections
4.01(c) and 4.02 hereof, the Borrower may:

          (a)  on two (2) Business Days' notice to the Agent on or before 10:30
A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time:

               (i)  elect a subsequent Interest Period for all or a portion of
                    Fixed CD Loans to begin on the last day of the Interest
                    Period for such Fixed CD Loans;

              (ii)  convert all or a portion of Floating Rate Loans to Fixed CD
                    Loans on any date; and

                                       23


<PAGE>

                                                                              24

             (iii)    convert all or a portion of LIBOR Loans to Fixed CD Loans
                      on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR
                      Loans.

          (b)    on three (3) LIBOR Business Days' notice to the Agent on or
                 before 10:30 A.M. Charlotte, North Carolina time:

               (i)    elect a subsequent Interest Period for all or a portion of
                      LIBOR Loans to begin on the last day of the Interest
                      Period for such LIBOR Loans;

              (ii)    convert all or a portion of Fixed CD Loans to LIBOR Loans
                      on the last day of the Interest Period for such Fixed CD
                      Loans; and

             (iii)    convert all or a portion of Floating Rate Loans to LIBOR
                      Loans on any date.

          Notice of any such elections or conversions shall specify the
effective date of such election or conversion and the Interest Period to be
applicable to the Revolving Loan as continued or converted.  Each election and
conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be subject to the limitations on
Fixed CD Loans and LIBOR Loans set forth in the definition of "Interest Period"
herein and in Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04 hereof.  All such continuations
or conversions of Revolving Loans shall be effected pro rata based on the
Applicable Commitment Percentages of the Lenders.


          2.13  FEES.  (a) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or such earlier date on which
the Revolving Credit Facility has terminated), the Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders based on their Applicable
Commitment Percentages, an unused fee for such period at a rate of one-fourth
percent (1/4%) per annum on the sum of the daily amount by which the average
daily amount of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment exceeds the sum of average
daily (a) outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, (b) Outstanding Letters of Credit
and (c) outstanding Acceptances.  The Swing Line Outstandings shall not be
outstanding Loans for purposes of determining such fee.  Such payments of fees
provided for in this Section 2.13 shall be due in arrears on the last Business
Day of each December, March, June and September beginning December 31, 1993 to
and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or such earlier date on which the
Revolving Credit Facility has terminated).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so
long as any Lender fails to make available any portion of its Revolving Credit
Commitment when requested, such Lender shall not be entitled to receive payment
of its pro rata share of such fee until such Lender shall make available such
portion.

          (b)   In addition to the fees otherwise expressly provided for herein,
the Borrower agrees to pay to NationsBank, the Lenders and the Agent, as the
case may be, such other fees in connection with the Loans and the Letters of
Credit as the Borrower shall be or become committed to pay pursuant to any other
document to which Borrower is a signatory.

          2.14  DEFICIENCY ADVANCES.  No Lender shall be responsible for any
default of any other Lender in respect to such other Lender's obligation to make
any Loan hereunder nor

                                       24

<PAGE>

                                                                              25

shall the Revolving Commitment of any Lender hereunder be increased as a result
of such default of any other Lender.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event any Lender shall fail to advance funds to the Borrower
as herein provided, the Agent may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated
to, advance under the Note in its favor as a Lender all or any portion of such
amount (the "deficiency advance") and shall thereafter be entitled to payments
of principal of and interest on such deficiency advance in the same manner and
at the same interest rate or rates to which such other Lender would have been
entitled had it made such advance under its Note; provided that, upon payment to
the Agent from such other Lender of the entire outstanding amount of such
deficiency advance, together with interest thereon, from the most recent date or
dates interest was paid to the Agent by the Borrower on each Revolving Loan
comprising the deficiency advance at the interest rate per annum for overnight
borrowing by the Agent from the Federal Reserve Bank, then such payment shall be
credited against the Note of the Agent in full payment of such deficiency
advance and the Borrower shall be deemed to have borrowed the amount of such
deficiency advance from such other Lender as of the most recent date or dates,
as the case may be, upon which any payments of interest were made by the
Borrower thereon.

          2.15  ADJUSTMENTS BY AGENT.  Notwithstanding the construction of "pro
rata" to mean based on the Applicable Commitment Percentages and any provisions
contained herein for the advancement of funds or distribution of payments on a
pro rata basis, the Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to,
adjust downward or upward (but not in excess of any applicable Revolving Credit
Commitment) the principal amount of any Revolving Loan to be made by any Lender
to the nearest amount which is evenly divisible by $100, and make appropriate
related adjustment in the distribution of payments of principal and interest on
the Loans.

          2.16  USE OF PROCEEDS.  The proceeds of the Loans made pursuant to the
Revolving Credit Facility and Swing Line hereunder shall be used by the Borrower
to acquire the Summers Group, to refinance existing Indebtedness and for working
capital and other general corporate purposes of the Borrower.

          2.17  SWING LINE.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in order to administer the Revolving Credit Facility
in an efficient manner and to minimize the transfer of funds between the Agent
and the Lenders, NationsBank shall make available Swing Line Loans to the
Borrower prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date.  NationsBank shall not
make any Swing Line Loan pursuant hereto (i) if the Borrower is not in
compliance with all the conditions to the making of Revolving Loans set forth in
this Agreement, (ii) if after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan, the Swing
Line Outstandings exceed $5,000,000, or (iii) if after giving effect to such
Swing Line Loan, the Outstandings exceed either the Borrowing Base or the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment.  Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall be
limited to Loans bearing interest at the Swing Line Rate.

             (i)    On each Business Day, in the absence of contrary
                    instructions from the Borrower (by telephone confirmed in
                    writing), NationsBank shall fund the Borrower's operating
                    account with NationsBank through credits to such account to
                    the extent necessary based on the balance in the account on
                    such day in order to fund that day's presentments for

                    payment against the account.  Each such credit shall
                    constitute an Advance as a Swing Line Loan hereunder and
                    each Business Day's Advances on Swing Line Loans shall be in
                    an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or such greater
                    amount as is an integral multiple of $10,000.  Upon each
                    such Advance, the Borrower shall be indebted to NationsBank
                    in the amount of such Advance, plus interest thereon, in
                    accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

            (ii)    Not later than 3:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on
                    each Business Day on which Advances under the Swing Line are
                    to be made, NationsBank shall inform the Borrower by
                    telephone (confirmed in writing) of the amount of such
                    Advances.

          (iii)     All Advances made by NationsBank under the Swing Line
                    pursuant to this Section 2.17 outstanding on any day shall
                    bear interest at the Swing Line Rate.

            (iv)    The Borrower and each Lender which is or may become a party
                    hereto acknowledge that all Swing Line Loans are to be made
                    solely by NationsBank to the Borrower but that such Lender
                    shall share the risk of loss with respect to such Advances
                    in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Commitment
                    Percentage of such Swing Line Loan.  Upon demand made by
                    NationsBank, each Lender (including NationsBank) shall,
                    according to its Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage
                    of such Swing Line Loan, promptly provide to NationsBank its
                    purchase price therefor in an amount equal to its
                    Participation therein, in which case such Swing Line Loan
                    shall be deemed from and after such date a Floating Rate
                    Loan made in accordance with this Agreement.  The obligation
                    of each Lender to so provide its purchase price to
                    NationsBank shall be absolute and unconditional and shall
                    not be affected by the occurrence of an Event of Default or
                    any other occurrence or event.

             (v)    Prepayments and repayments of Swing Line Loans shall be in
                    minimum amounts of $100,000 and multiples of $10,000 in
                    excess thereof.

            (vi)    Borrower at its option may request an Advance as a Revolving
                    Loan pursuant to Section 2.01 in an amount sufficient to
                    repay any or all Swing Line Loans on any date and the Agent
                    shall upon the receipt of such Advance, provide to
                    NationsBank the amount necessary to repay such Swing Line
                    Loan or Loans (which NationsBank shall then apply to such
                    repayment) and credit any balance of the Revolving Loan in
                    immediately available funds to the Borrower's Account.  The
                    proceeds of such Advances shall be paid to NationsBank for
                    application to the Swing Line Outstandings and the Lenders
                    shall then be deemed to have made Revolving Loans in the
                    amount of such Advances.  The

                    obligation of NationsBank to fund the Swing Line shall cease
                    upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence of a Default, or (ii)
                    the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that when a
                    Default is no longer continuing NationsBank shall be
                    obligated to provide Swing Line Loans.

          2.18 EXTENSION OF REVOLVING CREDIT TERMINATION DATE.  At the request
of the Borrower the Lenders may, in their sole discretion, elect to extend the
Stated Revolving Credit Termination Date then in effect for up to two additional
periods of one year each.  The Borrower shall notify the Lenders of its request
for such an extension by delivering to the Agent and the Lenders notice of such
request signed by an Authorized Officer not more than one hundred and eighty
(180) days nor less than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the Stated
Revolving Credit Termination Date.  If all the Lenders shall elect to so extend,
the Agent shall notify the Borrower in writing within sixty (60) days of its
receipt of such request for extension of the decision of the Lenders of whether
to extend the Revolving Credit Termination Date.  Failure by the Agent to give
such notice shall constitute refusal by the Lenders to extend the Revolving
Credit Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.18 or anything to the contrary contained in the definition of "Stated
Revolving Credit Termination Date" or "Revolving Credit Termination Date" in
Article I hereof, in the event that on or before the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date the Borrower shall not have sold equity securities to Rexel or any
affiliate for a cash purchase price of not less than $20,000,000, then the
Revolving Credit Termination Date shall be such one year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and shall not be subject to further extension as provided in this
Section 2.18.

                                   ARTICLE III

                        LETTERS OF CREDIT AND ACCEPTANCES

          3.01  LETTERS OF CREDIT AND ACCEPTANCES.  NationsBank agrees, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon request of Borrower to issue
from time to time for the account of the Borrower Letters of Credit upon
delivery to NationsBank of an Application and LC Agreement in the form attached
hereto as EXHIBIT E; PROVIDED, that the undrawn face amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding plus all outstanding Reimbursement Obligations hereunder
shall not exceed the Total Letter of Credit Commitment.  No Letter of Credit
shall be issued by NationsBank with an expiry date or payment date occurring
subsequent to the fifth Business Day preceding the Stated Revolving Credit
Termination Date (without giving effect to the proviso thereof) and no Letter of
Credit shall have an expiry date occurring more than twelve (12) months after
the date of its issuance.  NationsBank shall not be required to issue any Letter
of Credit if the aggregate amount of the Outstandings and the face amount of any
requested Letter of Credit exceeds either the Borrowing Base or the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment.

          3.02 ACCEPTANCES.  NationsBank agrees, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof until the day prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date,
upon the request of Borrower, to create, from time to time, Acceptances for the
benefit of Borrower.  NationsBank shall create such Acceptances by accepting and
discounting drafts drawn by the Borrower under and pursuant to this Agreement.
NationsBank shall not accept any such drafts unless the resulting Acceptance
shall be an Acceptance as defined in Section 1.01 hereof.  Upon accepting a
draft

                                       27

<PAGE>

                                                                              28

NationsBank may discount the resulting Acceptance at a rate per annum (based on
a year of 360 days) equal to the Acceptance Rate plus the Acceptance Margin.
NationsBank shall not be required to create any Acceptance if the amount payable
under such Acceptance when added to the Outstandings exceeds either the
Borrowing Base or the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.  The face amount of
Acceptances shall be an integral multiple of $500,000 and shall not be less than
$1,000,000.  The creation date and maturity date of each Acceptance shall be a
Business Day.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent shall not be obligated
to create or discount any Acceptance, (i) if creation thereof would cause the
Agent to exceed the maximum amount of outstanding bankers' acceptances permitted
by applicable law, or (ii) if, in the reasonable opinion of the Agent, general
conditions in the public market for rediscounting bankers' acceptances render it
inadvisable to do so.

          3.03 CREATION OF ACCEPTANCE.  Any request for creation of an
Acceptance shall be made at least two (2) Business Days in advance of the day
upon which such Acceptance is to be created (the "Acceptance Date"); such
request to be in writing and in the form of the Borrowing Notice set forth in
EXHIBIT F-2.  No Acceptance shall be created by NationsBank with a maturity date
occurring subsequent to the Revolving Credit Termination Date.  If NationsBank
creates the requested Acceptance, then on or before 11:00 A.M., Miami, Florida
time on the Acceptance Date, NationsBank shall notify the Borrower of the
Acceptance Rate plus Acceptance Margin at which the Acceptance will be
discounted by NationsBank, and NationsBank shall promptly thereafter accept the
draft of Borrower for the amount and Interest Period requested.  Upon the
discounting of each Acceptance, NationsBank shall credit Borrower's Account with
an amount equal to the net proceeds of such discounted Acceptance.  In order to
enable NationsBank to create Acceptances in the manner specified in this Section
3.03, Borrower agrees to promptly upon request furnish to NationsBank a
sufficient number of drafts conforming to NationsBank requirements.

          3.04 REIMBURSEMENT.

          (a)  The Borrower hereby unconditionally agrees immediately to pay to
NationsBank on demand at 150 S.E. Third Avenue, Second Floor, Miami, Florida
33131, Attention: International Bank, Letter of Credit Department (i) all
amounts required to pay all drafts drawn under the Letters of Credit and (ii)
the face amount of each draft accepted by NationsBank on the maturity date of
such draft in the event of an Event of Default or in the event an Acceptance is
determined not to be eligible for discount, and any and all out of pocket
expenses of every kind incurred by NationsBank in connection with the Letters of
Credit and Acceptances and in any event and without demand to place in the
possession of NationsBank (which shall include Advances under the Revolving
Credit Facility if permitted by Section 2.04(c) hereof) sufficient funds to pay
all debts and liabilities arising under any Letter of Credit and Acceptance.
The Borrower's obligations to pay NationsBank under this Section 3.04(a), and
the right of NationsBank to receive the same, shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever.
NationsBank may charge the Borrower's Account or any other account the Borrower
may have with it for any and all amounts NationsBank pays under a Letter of
Credit and Acceptance, plus commissions, charges and expenses as from time to
time agreed to by NationsBank and the Borrower; provided that to the extent
permitted by Section 2.04(c), amounts shall be paid pursuant to Advances under
the Swing Line and/or the

                                       28

                                                                              29

Revolving Credit Facility.  The Borrower agrees that NationsBank may, in its
sole discretion, accept or pay, as complying with the terms of any Letter of
Credit or Acceptance, any drafts or other documents otherwise in order which may
be signed or issued by an administrator, executor, trustee in bankruptcy, debtor
in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver,
attorney in fact or other legal representative of a party who is authorized
under such Letter of Credit or Acceptance to draw or issue any drafts or other
documents.  The Borrower agrees to pay NationsBank interest on any amounts not
paid when due hereunder at the lesser of the Floating Rate plus two percent
(2%), or the maximum rate permitted by law.

          (b)  In accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04(c) hereof,
NationsBank shall notify the Agent (and shall also notify the Borrower) of any
drawing under any Letter of Credit or payment of any draft constituting an
Acceptance issued for the account of the Borrower as promptly as practicable
following the receipt by NationsBank of such drawing or payment.

          (c)  Each Lender (other than NationsBank) shall automatically acquire
on the date of issuance thereof a Participation in the liability of NationsBank
in respect of such Letter of Credit or Acceptance in an amount equal to such
Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage of such liability, and to the extent
that the Borrower is obligated to pay NationsBank under Section 3.04(a), each
Lender (other than NationsBank) thereby shall absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably assume, and shall be unconditionally obligated to pay to NationsBank
as hereinafter described, its Applicable Commitment Percentage of the liability
of NationsBank under such Letter of Credit or Acceptance.  If a Reimbursement
Obligation shall be outstanding, upon demand from NationsBank or the Agent, each
Lender shall pay to NationsBank in the manner provided in Section 2.04(c) its
Applicable Commitment Percentage of such Reimbursement Obligation.  If any
Lender is obligated to pay but does not pay amounts to the Agent for the account
of NationsBank in full upon such request as required by this Section 3.04(c),
such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Agent for the account of NationsBank
interest on the unpaid amount for each day during the period commencing on the
date of notice given to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c) until such
Lender pays such amount to the Agent for the account of NationsBank in full at
the interest rate per annum for overnight borrowing by NationsBank from the
Federal Reserve Bank.

          (d)  Promptly following the end of each calendar quarter, NationsBank
shall deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall deliver to each Lender, a notice
describing the aggregate undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at
the end of such quarter.  Upon the request of any Lender from time to time,
NationsBank shall deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall deliver to such
Lender, any other information reasonably requested by such Lender with respect
to each Letter of Credit and Acceptance then outstanding.

          (e)  The issuance by NationsBank of each Letter of Credit and
Acceptance shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section
5.01 hereof, be subject to the conditions that such Letter of Credit and
Acceptance be in such form, contain such terms and support such transactions or
obligations as shall be reasonably satisfactory to NationsBank consistent with
the then current practices and procedures of NationsBank with respect to similar
letters of credit.  All Letters of Credit shall be issued pursuant to and
subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, 1983
revision, International Chamber of

Commerce Publication No. 400 and all subsequent amendments and revisions
thereto.  The Borrower shall have executed and delivered such other instruments
and agreements relating to such Letter of Credit and Acceptance as NationsBank
shall have reasonably requested consistent with such practices and procedures.

          (f)  Without duplication of Section 11.07 hereof, the Borrower hereby
indemnifies and holds harmless NationsBank and each other Lender and the Agent
from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or
out-of-pocket expenses which NationsBank, such other Lender or the Agent may
reasonably incur (or which may be claimed against NationsBank, such other Lender
or the Agent by any Person other than any party hereto) by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under
such Letter of Credit; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
indemnify NationsBank, any other Lender or the Agent for any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent,
(i) caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the party to be
indemnified, (ii) caused by the failure of NationsBank to pay under any Letter
of Credit or Acceptance after the presentation to it of a request strictly
complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit or Acceptance,
unless such payment is prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or decree,
or (iii) paid or payable by any Lender under Sections 2.14 or 11.10 hereof.

          (g)  Without limitation or prejudice to any right or remedy available
to Borrower by contract or law, the obligation of Borrower to immediately
reimburse Agent for drawings made under Letters of Credit or Acceptance shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under all circumstances whatsoever,
including, without limitation, the following circumstances:

               (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of the Letter of
                     Credit or Acceptance, the obligation supported by the
                     Letter of Credit or Acceptance or any other agreement or
                     instrument relating thereto (collectively, the "Related
                     Documents");

              (ii)   the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other rights
                     which Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary
                     or any transferee of a Letter of Credit or Acceptance (or
                     any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such
                     transferee may be acting), Agent, Lenders or any other
                     Person, whether in connection with the Loan Documents, the
                     Related Documents or any unrelated transaction;

             (iii)   any breach of contract or other dispute between Borrower
                     and any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit
                     or Acceptance (or any persons or entities for whom such
                     beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), Agent,
                     Lenders or any other Person or entity;

              (iv)   any draft, statement or any other document presented under
                     the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
                     invalid or insufficient in any

                     respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate
                     in any respect whatsoever; or

               (v)   any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
                     not similar to any of the foregoing;

provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to release
NationsBank or any other Lender or the Agent of any liability for actual loss
arising as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          (h)    Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the pricing for
Acceptances hereunder is based upon the assumption that such Acceptances are
"eligible" for discount by the Federal Reserve Banks and that the Lenders are
not required to maintain reserves for such Acceptances under the regulations of
the Federal Reserve System.  In the event the Federal Reserve System shall
conclude the Acceptances created hereunder are ineligible or that reserves are
required to be maintained in connection therewith, Borrower shall and does
hereby indemnify and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless, and does hereby
agree to, pay all reasonable costs, expenses, legal fees and penalties, as well
as all retroactive, current and prospective reserve requirements arising in
connection with such Acceptances, except to the extent resulting from the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of NationsBank.  Additionally, Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that upon the Federal Reserve System reaching such
conclusion, NationsBank shall have no further obligation to create Acceptances
and that in the event NationsBank agrees to create further Acceptances, those
created may, at the option of NationsBank, be priced at a rate higher than
indicated in Section 3.02 in order to compensate NationsBank for additional
reserve requirements and other transactional costs.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
otherwise, Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify NationsBank and the
other Lenders or to pay any extraordinary costs in connection with Acceptances
which are determined by the Federal Reserve System to be ineligible solely and
directly as a result of a mistake or error by NationsBank in performing
ministerial functions with respect to the Acceptances.  Additionally, Borrower
shall be entitled, but shall not be obligated, to dispute and contest any
determination of ineligibility which gives rise to Borrower's indemnification
and promise to pay set forth herein, provided, however, Borrower shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute such dispute or contest.  The Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that the refusal of the Federal Reserve System to
recognize a dispute or contest raised by the Borrower shall in no way alter,
impair, diminish or affect the obligations of the Borrower set forth in this
Subsection.  Should Borrower fail promptly to pay for, dispute or contest any
determination of ineligibility as herein provided, NationsBank and the other
Lenders shall be entitled to pay, contest or dispute same and all sums expended
by NationsBank and the other Lenders in doing so shall constitute additional
Indebtedness of Borrower to the Lenders and shall bear interest from the date
paid until the date repaid at the Floating Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum.

          3.05 LETTER OF CREDIT FEE.  For the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the Borrower agrees to
pay to the Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders based on their
Applicable Commitment Percentages, (i) in the

                                       31

<PAGE>

                                                                              32

case of Commercial Letters of Credit a fee equal to one-fourth of one percent
(1/4%) per annum of the face amount of outstanding Commercial Letters of Credit,
and (ii) in the case of Standby Letters of Credit a fee equal to the Applicable
Interest Addition for LIBOR Loans at the date of issuance of such Standby Letter
of Credit.  Such payment of fees provided for in the preceding sentence of this
Section 3.05 shall be due in advance on the Closing Date and on the last
Business Day of each December, March, June and September thereafter; provided
that should any Letter of Credit either terminate prior to its expiry date or be
drawn upon, then the amount of the fee (if any) due hereunder during the next
succeeding quarter shall be adjusted to give the Borrower the benefit of such
reduction in such outstanding Letters of Credit during such preceding calendar
quarter provided the Borrower shall have paid the full amount of such
Reimbursement Obligation either by means of a Swing Line Loan or Revolving Loan.
To the extent the adjustment cannot be made in the succeeding quarter,
NationsBank shall refund to the Borrower the amount of any such fees due it.  In
addition, at the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall
pay to NationsBank a capital adjustment fee equal to one-eighth percent (1/8%)
per annum of the face amount of such Letter of Credit.

          3.06 ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND RESERVES.  The Borrower shall pay to
NationsBank administrative and other fees, if any, in connection with the
Letters of Credit and Acceptances in such amounts and at such times as
NationsBank and the Borrower shall agree from time to time.  In addition, the
Borrower shall reimburse NationsBank for all costs or reduction in yield
occurring by reason of the issuance by NationsBank of the Letters of Credit.

                         YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

          4.01 INCREASED COSTS.

          (a)  If after the date of this Agreement, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements) in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the adoption of any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
other than, in each case, any introduction, change or adoption in respect of net
income, franchise or similar taxes, there shall be any increase in the cost to
any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Fixed Rate
Loan, then the Borrower shall from time to time, within 30 days after demand by
the Agent, pay to the Agent additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender for such increased cost.  A certificate documenting the amount of such
increased cost and indicating a reasonable basis therefor, submitted to the
Borrower by the Agent, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

          (b)  If after the date of this Agreement, either (i) the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
the adoption of any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender
or any corporation controlling any Lender and the Agent determines that the
amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of the
commitments to lend hereunder and

                                       32

                                                                              33

other commitments of this type, then, within 30 days after demand by the Agent,
the Borrower shall pay to the Agent, from time to time as specified by the
Agent, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of
such circumstances, to the extent that the Agent reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of the commitments to lend
hereunder.  A certificate documenting   such amounts and indicating a reasonable
basis therefor submitted to the Borrower by the Agent shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

          (c)  If any Lender requests compensation from the Borrower under this
Section 4.01, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the
Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make additional Advances of the
type with respect to which such compensation is requested until either (A) the
matter giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect or (B) such Lender
gives notice to the Borrower that it will no longer require the Borrower to pay
additional costs arising from such matter; provided that the Borrower shall
reimburse the Agent for its administrative expenses incurred by virtue of all
such suspensions.  In the case of any such suspension, all Fixed Rate Loans that
would otherwise be required to be made by such Lender but for such suspension
shall instead be a Floating Rate Loan.

          (d)  Each Lender will notify the Borrower of any matter that will
entitle such Lender to compensation under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
4.01 as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 120 days, after such
Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided, however, that if any Lender
fails to give such notice within 120 days after it obtains actual knowledge of
such matter, such Lender shall with respect to compensation payable pursuant to
this Section 4.01 in respect of any costs resulting from such matter, only be
entitled to payment under this Section 4.01 for costs incurred from and after
the date 120 days prior to the date that such Lender does give such notice; and
provided, further, that each Lender will designate a different lending office
for the Advances of such Lender affected by the matters requiring compensation,
and take other measures in its sole discretion, if such designation or other
measures will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, result in a material cost to, or
be otherwise disadvantageous to, such Lender.

          (e)  Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower
and the Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, or
other manner or certification, establishing that payment of interest hereunder
are either not subject to or totally exempt from United States Federal
withholding tax and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service For W-8 or W-9 or successor
applicable form.  Each such Lender also agrees to deliver to the Borrower and
the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9,
or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may
be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form
previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and such extensions or renewals
thereof as the may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Agent, unless
in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty,
law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
would otherwise be required which renders all such forms

                                                                              34

inapplicable or which prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering
any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises each of the Borrower
and the Agent.  Such Lender shall certify (i) in the case of a Form 1001 or
4224, that it is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (ii) in
the case of a Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax.

          4.02 ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender to honor its
obligation to make or maintain LIBOR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Agent) and such
Lender's obligation to make or continue LIBOR Loans, or convert Floating Rate
Loans or Fixed CD Loans into LIBOR Loans, shall be suspended until such time as
such Lender may again make and maintain LIBOR Loans, and such Lender's
outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted into Floating Rate Loans or Fixed CD
Loans in accordance with Section 2.12 hereof.

          4.03 COMPENSATION.  The Borrower shall promptly pay to each Lender,
upon the request of such Lender, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient
(in the reasonable determination of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost
or expense incurred by it as a result of:

          (a)  any payment, prepayment (including prepayments pursuant to
Section 2.10) or conversion of a Fixed CD Loan or LIBOR Loan on a date other
than the last day of the Interest Period for such Fixed CD Loan or LIBOR Loan,
including without limitation any conversion required pursuant to Section 4.02;
or

          (b)  any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Fixed CD Loan or LIBOR
Loan on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Borrowing Notice
under Section 2.04 hereof; such compensation to include, without limitation, an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would
have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or converted or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment or conversion
or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Loan which would have commenced on the date scheduled for such borrowing) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Fixed CD Loan or LIBOR Loan provided for
herein, minus the Applicable Interest Addition for such Loan, over (ii) the
Applicable Base Rate (as reasonably determined by the Agent) for Dollar deposits
of amounts comparable to such principal amount and maturities comparable to such
period.  A determination of a Lender as to the amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 4.03 shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on
a reasonable basis.  The Lender requesting compensation under this Section 4.03
shall furnish to the Authorized Officer calculations in reasonable detail
setting forth such Lender's determination of the amount of such compensation.

                         time, or both, would constitute an event of default,
                         under any indenture, agreement or other instrument to
                         which the Borrower or its Subsidiary is a party which
                         breach or event of default would have a Material

                         there has been no material adverse change in the
                         condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and
                         its Subsidiaries or in the businesses, properties and
                         operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in
                         each case, considered as a whole, nor have such
                         businesses or properties, taken as a whole, been
                         materially adversely affected as a result of any fire,
                         explosion, earthquake, accident, strike, lockout,
                         combination of workers, flood, embargo or act of God;

               (c)  SUMMERS GROUP.  As of the Closing Date, the Borrower has
          heretofore furnished to each Lender an audited unqualified
          consolidated balance sheet of the Summers Group as at December 31,
          1992 and the notes thereto and the related consolidated statements of
          income, cash flow and changes in stockholder's equity for the fiscal
          year then ended as examined and certified by Ernst & Young and
          unaudited interim financial statements of the Summers Group consisting
          of a consolidated balance sheet and statement of income, without
          notes, for the eight month period ending August 31, 1993.  Such
          audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes
          thereto) present fairly in all material respects the financial
          condition of the Summers Group as at the end of the period reported
          therein and results of their operations and changes in stockholder's
          equity for the Fiscal Year then ended, all in conformity with
          Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied on a consistent
          basis, and no information has come to the attention of the Borrower or
          its chief executive, financial or accounting officers which would lead
          it or them to believe that the interim financial statements of the
          Summers Group dated August 31, 1993 are not accurate and complete in
          all material respects or that any material financial information has
          been omitted therefrom;

               (d)  TITLE TO PROPERTIES.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
          title to all their respective real and personal properties (except to
          the extent not material to the financial condition of the Borrower and
          the Subsidiaries taken as a whole) subject to no Liens, except for (i)
          Liens included in the notes to the financial statements referred to in
          Section 7.02(b) or otherwise described in EXHIBIT L attached hereto,
          and (ii) Liens permitted under Section 9.01 hereof;

               (e)  TAXES.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or
          caused to be filed all federal, state and local tax returns which are
          required to be filed by them and except for taxes and assessments
          being contested in good faith and against which adequate reserves to
          the extent required in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
          Principles have been established, have paid or caused to be paid all
          taxes as shown on said returns or on any assessment received by them,
          to the extent that such taxes have become due, except where the
          failure to file or pay would not have a Material Adverse Effect;

               (f)  OTHER AGREEMENTS.  As of the Closing Date, neither the
          Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a party to any judgment, order, decree
          or any agreement or instrument or subject to restrictions which could
          reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

               (g)  LITIGATION.  Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 7.02(h) hereto,
          there is no action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or by or
          before any governmental instrumentality or agency or arbitral body
          pending, or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or
          against the Borrower or any Subsidiary which is reasonably likely to
          be determined adversely to the Borrower or such Subsidiary and which,
          if so determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect;

               (h)  MARGIN STOCK.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
          engaged principally in, or has as one of its important activities, the
          business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
          any "margin stock" as such term is defined in Regulation U, as amended
          (12 C.F.R. Part 221), of the Board.  The proceeds of the borrowings
          made pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof will be used by the Borrower only
          for the purposes set forth in Section 2.16 hereof.  None of such
          proceeds will be used by the Borrower, directly or indirectly, for the
          purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose
          of reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred
          to purchase or carry margin stock or for any other purpose which would
          constitute any of the Loans under this Agreement a "purpose credit"
          within the meaning of said Regulation U or Regulation X (12 C.F.R.
          Part 224) of the Board.  Neither the Borrower nor any agent authorized
          to act and so acting in its behalf (other than the Agent and the
          Lenders) has taken or will take any action which would cause this
          Agreement or any of the documents or instruments delivered pursuant
          hereto to violate any regulation of the Board or to violate the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any state securities laws, in each
          case as in effect on the date hereof;

               (i)  INVESTMENT COMPANY.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
          is an "investment company," or a company controlled by an "investment
          company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of
          1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. SECTION 80a-1, et seq.);

               (j)  PATENTS, ETC.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or have

          material patents, licenses, franchises, trademarks, trademark rights,
          tradenames, tradename rights, copyrights, trade secrets and know how
          necessary to the conduct of their businesses as now conducted, without
          known conflict with any patent, license, franchise, trademark, trade
          secrets or confidential commercial or proprietary information,
          tradename, copyright or other proprietary rights of any other Person,
          except where the failure so to own or have the right to use or such
          conflict would not have a Material Adverse Effect;

               (k)  NO UNTRUE STATEMENT.  The representations and warranties of
          the Borrower set forth in this Agreement and any other Loan Document
          do not contain any misrepresentation or untrue statement of material
          fact or omit to state a material fact necessary, in light of the
          circumstance under which it was made, in order to make any such
          representation or warranty not misleading in any material respect;

               (l)  NO CONSENTS, ETC.  As of the Closing Date, neither the
          respective businesses or properties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
          nor any relationship between the Borrower or any Subsidiary and any
          other Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the execution,
          delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and the Acquisition
          Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is such
          as to require a consent, approval or authorization of, or filing,
          registration or qualification with, any governmental or other
          authority or any other Person on the part of the Borrower or any
          Subsidiary as a condition to the execution, delivery and performance
          of, or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
          Agreement or the other Loan Documents or if so, such consent,
          approval, authorization, filing, registration or qualification has
          been obtained or effected, as the case may be or will be obtained or
          effected in the ordinary course or where the failure to obtain or
          effect the same could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
          Adverse Effect;

               (m)  ERISA.  All Plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
          maintained by the Borrower and each Guarantor are in compliance in all
          material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
          regulations thereunder, and no Reportable Event has occurred and is
          continuing with respect to any Plan maintained by the Borrower or any
          Subsidiary, except where non-compliance or such occurrence would not
          subject the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to liability in excess of
          $1,000,000.

               (n)  NO DEFAULT.  As of the date hereof, there does not exist any
          Default or Event of Default hereunder; and

               (o)  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.  Neither the Borrower nor any
          Subsidiary nor, to the best of Borrower's knowledge,  any previous
          owner or operator of any real property currently owned or operated by
          the Borrower or any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Property"), has
          generated, stored, or disposed of any Hazardous Material on any
          portion of the Property, or transferred any Hazardous Material from
          the Property to any other location, giving rise to any liability of
          the Borrower or any Subsidiary which would have a Material Adverse
          Effect.  The Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all
          applicable Environmental Laws, except for any such noncompliance that
          would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither Borrower nor any
          Subsidiary has been notified of any action, suit, proceeding or
          investigation which calls into question compliance by the Borrower or
          any Subsidiary with any Environmental Laws or which seeks to suspend,
          revoke or terminate any license, permit or approval necessary for the
          generation, handling, storage, treatment or disposal of any Hazardous
          Material, which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                              54


          (a)  if default shall be made in the due and    punctual payment of
the principal of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, when and as the same
shall be due and payable, at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise; or

          (b)  if default shall be made in the due and punctual payment of any
amount of interest on any Loan, any Reimbursement Obligation or any fees payable
under this Agreement on the date on which the same shall be due and payable and
such Default shall continue for more than five (5) Business Days; or

          (c)  if default shall be made in the performance or observance of any
covenant set forth in Section 8.11 or Article IX (other than Sections 9.03,
9.05, 9.06, 9.08 and 9.09) hereof;

          (d)  if a default shall be made in the performance or observance by
the Borrower of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents (other than as described in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above
and Section 8.07(a)) and such default shall continue for 30 or more days after
the earlier of receipt of notice of such default by the Borrower from the Agent,
or if any Loan Document ceases to be in full force and effect (other than by
reason of any action by the Agent or any Lender), or if without the written
consent of the Lenders, this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
disaffirmed or shall terminate, be terminable or be terminated or become void or
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever (in each case other than in accordance
with its terms in the absence of default or by reason of any action by the Agent
or any Lender); or

          (e)  if a default shall occur, which is not waived, (i) in the payment
of any principal, interest or premium with respect to any Indebtedness (other
than the Obligations) of the Borrower or any Subsidiary when the same becomes
due and payable and after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the
instrument relating to such Indebtedness or (ii) in the performance or
observance of any term or covenant contained in any agreement or instrument
under or pursuant to which any such Indebtedness may have been issued, created,
assumed, guaranteed or secured by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, and such
default shall continue for more than the period of grace, if any, therein
specified, if the effect of such default is to accelerate or permit the holder
of any such Indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof, provided that in
any of the foregoing circumstances the aggregate unpaid Indebtedness shall
exceed $1,000,000; or

          (f)  if any representation or warranty in any certificate, report or
statement at any time furnished to the Agent or any Lender by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement shall be false in any material respect when given; or

          (g)  if the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary shall be unable to pay
its debts generally as they become due; file a petition to take advantage of any
insolvency statute; make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
commence a proceeding for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator or
conservator of itself or of the whole or any substantial part of its property;
file a petition or answer seeking reorganization or arrangement or similar
relief under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law or statute
of the United States of America or any state or similar law of any other
country; or

          (h)  if a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter an order,
judgment or decree appointing a custodian, receiver, trustee, liquidator or
conservator of the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or of the whole or any
substantial part of its properties, or approve a petition filed against the
Borrower or any Material Subsidiary seeking reorganization or arrangement or
similar relief under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law or
statute of the United States of America or any state or similar law of any other
country, or if, under the provisions of any other law for the relief or aid of
debtors, a court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of
the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary or of the whole or any substantial part
of its properties; or if there is commenced against the Borrower or any Material
Subsidiary any proceeding or petition seeking reorganization, arrangement or
similar relief under the federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable law or
statute of the United States of America or any state which proceeding or
petition remains unstayed and undismissed for a period of 90 consecutive days;
or if the Borrower or any Material Subsidiary takes any action to indicate its
consent to or approval of any such proceeding or petition; or

          (i)  if (i) any judgment where the amount not covered by insurance (or
the amount as to which the insurer properly denies liability) is in excess of
$250,000 is rendered against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, and such judgment
remains unpaid, unstayed and undismissed for a period of sixty (60) consecutive
days; or

          (j)  a Reportable Event with respect to any employee benefit plan
shall have occurred with respect to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary may
incur a liability in excess of $1,000,000 and which continues unremedied for ten
(10) days after notice of such Reportable Event pursuant to Section 4043 (a) of
ERISA or, in the absence of such notice, for thirty (30) days after an Executive
Officer shall learn of the same;

then, and in any such event and at any time thereafter, if such Event of Default
or any other Event of Default shall then be continuing,

               (A)  either or both of the following actions may be taken:  (i)
          the Agent, with the consent of the Required Lenders, may, and at the
          direction of the Required Lenders shall, declare any obligation of
          the Lenders to make further Loans, issue Letters of Credit or create
          Acceptances terminated, whereupon the obligation of each Lender to
          make further Loans or issue Letters of Credit or create Acceptances
          hereunder shall terminate immediately, and (ii) the Agent shall at
          the direction of the Required Lenders, at their option, declare by
          notice to the Borrower any or all of the Obligations to be
          immediately due and payable, and the same, including all interest
          accrued thereon and all other obligations of the Borrower to the
          Lenders, shall forthwith become immediately due and payable without
          presentment, demand, protest, further notice or other formality of
          any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything
          contained herein or in any instrument evidencing the Obligations to
          the contrary notwithstanding; PROVIDED, however, that notwithstanding
          the above, if there shall occur an Event of Default under clause
          (g) or (h) above, then the obligation of the Lenders to lend or issue
          Letters of Credit or create Acceptances hereunder shall automatically
          terminate and any and all of the Obligations shall be immediately due
          and payable without the

          necessity of any action by the Agent or the Required Lenders or
          notice to the Agent or the Lenders; and

               (B)  Borrower shall, upon demand of Agent, deposit cash with the
          Agent in an amount equal to the amount of any Letters of Credit and
          Acceptances remaining undrawn, as collateral security for the
          repayment of any future drawings under such Letters of Credit and
          Acceptances, and Borrower shall forthwith deposit and pay such amounts
          and such amounts shall be held by Agent pursuant to the terms of the
          LC/ Acceptance Account Agreement.

          10.02     AGENT TO ACT.  In case any one or more Events of Default
shall occur and be continuing, the Agent may, and at the direction of the
Required Lenders shall, proceed to protect and enforce their rights or remedies
either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for the specific
performance of any covenant, agreement or other provision contained herein or in
any other Loan Document, or to enforce the payment of the Obligations or any
other legal or equitable right or remedy.

          10.03     CUMULATIVE RIGHTS.  No right or remedy herein conferred upon
the Lenders or the Agent is intended to be exclusive of any other rights or
remedies contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and every such right or
remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other such right or
remedy contained herein and therein or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or by statute, or otherwise.

          10.04     NO WAIVER.  No course of dealing between the Borrower and
any Lender or the Agent or any failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
Agent in exercising any rights or remedies hereunder shall operate as a waiver
of any rights or remedies hereunder and no single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies hereunder shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise
of any other rights or remedies hereunder or of the same right or remedy on a
future occasion.

          10.05     DEFAULT.  The Agent and the Lenders shall have no right to
accelerate any of the Loans upon the occurrence of any Default which shall not
also constitute an Event of Default; PROVIDED, however, nothing contained in
this sentence shall in any respect impair or adversely affect the right, power
and authority of the Agent and the Lenders (i) to take any action expressly
required or permitted to be taken under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence
of any Default (and including any action or proceeding which the Agent may
determine to be necessary or appropriate in furtherance of any such expressly
authorized action) and (ii) to take any action provided under the Loan Documents
or otherwise available by statute, at law or in equity upon the occurrence of
any Default.

          10.06     ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS.  If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, and the maturity of the Notes has been accelerated pursuant
to Article X hereof, all payments received by the Agent hereunder in respect of
any principal of or interest on the Obligations or any other amounts payable by
the Borrower hereunder shall be applied by the Agent in the following order:


                                       56

                                                                              57


              (i)   amounts due to the Lenders or any of them pursuant to
                    Sections 2.13, 2.17, 3.05, 12.05 and 12.14 hereof;

              (ii)  amounts due to the Agent pursuant to Section 3.06 and
                    Section 11.11 hereof;


              (iii) payments of interest, to be applied in accordance with
                    Section 2.09 hereof;

               (iv) payments of principal, to be applied in accordance with
                    Section 2.09 hereof;

               (v)  payment of cash amounts to the Agent for deposit to the
                    Borrower's Account pursuant to Section 10.01(B) hereof; and

               (vi) payments of all other amounts due under this Agreement, if
                    any, to be applied in accordance with each Lender's pro rata
                    share of all principal due to the Lenders.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                                    THE AGENT

          11.01     APPOINTMENT.  Each Lender (including NationsBank in its
capacity as maker of Swing Line Loans and as issuer of the Letters of Credit and
Acceptances) hereby irrevocably designates and appoints NationsBank as the Agent
of the Lenders under this Agreement, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
authorizes NationsBank as the Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
to exercise such powers as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  The Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any of the
Lenders, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist
against the Agent.

          11.02      ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT.  The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be
entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
The Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

          11.03     LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact shall be liable to
the Lenders for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under or in connection with this Agreement except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates
shall be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals,
statements, representations or


                                       57


<PAGE>

                                                                              58


warranties made by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in
or received by the Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or for any failure of the
Borrower to perform its obligations thereunder.  The Agent shall not be under
any obligation to any of the Lenders to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents on the part of the Borrower or to
inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries.

          11.04     RELIANCE.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy or telex message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Agent.  The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as
the owner thereof for all purposes unless an Assignment and Acceptance shall
have been filed with and accepted by the Agent.  The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless
it shall first receive advice or concurrence of the Lenders or the Required
Lenders as provided in this Agreement or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may
be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all present and future holders
of the Notes.

          11.05     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender, the Borrower or
any of the Subsidiaries referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  In the
event that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall promptly give
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower (to the extent such notice was
not received from Borrower).  The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Lenders; provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such
directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

          11.06     No Representations.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that
neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates has made any representations or
warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the financial condition,

                                       58


<PAGE>
                                                                            59

creditworthiness, affairs, status and nature of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and
to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
status and affairs, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the
Agent or any of its affiliates.

          11.07     INDEMNIFICATION.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries and without limiting any obligations of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries so to do), ratably according to the respective principal amount
of the Notes held by them (or, if no Notes are outstanding, ratably in
accordance with their respective Applicable Commitment Percentages as then in
effect) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at
any time following the payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated by or referred to herein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment of the Obligations
and the termination of this Agreement.

          11.08      LENDER.  The Agent and its affiliates may make loans to,
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as though it were not the Agent hereunder.  With
respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in
its individual capacity.

          11.09     RESIGNATION.  If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Agreement, then the Required Lenders may appoint a successor Agent for the
Lenders, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof, having a combined surplus and capital of not less
than $500,000,000, whereupon such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights,
powers and duties of the former Agent and the obligations of the former Agent
shall be terminated and canceled, without any other or further act or deed on
the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement; provided,
however, that the former Agent's resignation shall not become effective until
such successor Agent has been appointed; provided, further, if the Required
Lenders cannot agree as to a successor Agent within

ninety (90) days after such resignation, the Agent shall appoint a successor
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above and the parties hereto agree to
execute whatever documents are necessary to effect such action under this
Agreement or any other document executed pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however in such event all provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents,
shall remain in full force and effect.  After any retiring Agent's resignation
hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article XI shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under
this Agreement.

          11.10      SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off, counterclaim
or otherwise, obtain payment with respect to its Obligations (other than any
payment pursuant to Section 2.17 or Article IV) which results in its receiving
more than its pro rata share of the aggregate payments with respect to all of
the Obligations (other than any payment pursuant to Section 2.17 or Article IV),
then (A) such Lender shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased from the
other Lenders a share in their Obligations so that the amount of the Obligations
held by each of the Lenders shall be pro rata and (B) such other adjustments
shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to insure that the Lenders
share such payments ratably; PROVIDED, however, that for purposes of this
Section 11.10 the term "pro rata" shall be determined with respect to both the
Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender and to the Total Revolving Credit
Commitments after subtraction in each case of amounts, if any, by which any such
Lender has not funded its share of the outstanding Loans and Reimbursement
Obligations.  If all or any portion of any such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the Lender which received the same, the purchase provided in this
Section 11.10 shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery, without
interest.  The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and
agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of the other Lenders'
Obligations may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation,
all rights of set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

          11.11     FEES.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its
individual account, an annual Agent's fee in such amount as shall be agreed to
from time to time, such fee to be paid annually in advance, the first such
installment to be paid on the Closing Date and thereafter on the anniversary
date of the Closing Date.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          12.01     ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

          (a)  At any time after the Closing Date each Lender may, with the
prior consent of the Agent and the Borrower, assign to one or more banks or
financial institutions all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of the Note payable
to its order); PROVIDED, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant,
and not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations (including Loans and Participations) under this Agreement, (ii) the
assigning Lender and the assignee and the Agent shall have executed and
delivered to the Borrower an Assignment and

Acceptance and the Borrower hereby agrees to execute replacement Notes to give
effect to the assignment if the Borrower shall have consented to such
assignment, (iii) the minimum Revolving Credit Commitment which shall be
assigned is $10,000,000 (together with which the assigning Lender's applicable
portion of Participations and the Letter of Credit Commitment shall also be
assigned) and (iv) such assignee shall have an office located in the United
States, provided, that an assignment by NationsBank shall not include any
portion of the Swing Line or the obligation to issue Letters of Credit.  Upon
such execution, delivery, approval and acceptance, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
or under such Note have been assigned or negotiated to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
and a holder of such Note and (y) the assignor thereunder shall, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder or under such Note have been assigned or
negotiated by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement, provided that
the assignor shall not be relieved from any liability arising prior to the
effectiveness of the assumption thereof by the assignee.  No assignee shall have
the right to further assign its rights and obligations pursuant to this Section
12.01.  Any Lender who makes an assignment shall pay to the Agent a one-time
administrative fee of $5,000.00 which fee shall not be reimbursed by Borrower.

          (b)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) the assignment made
under such Assignment and Acceptance is made under such Assignment and
Acceptance without recourse; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial
condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under any Loan Document
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.02(b) and
such other Loan Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement,
the Note and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms
hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender and a holder of such Note.

          (c)  The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to herein a copy
of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it.

          (d)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to Borrower.

          (e)  Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other
financial institutions as to all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement; PROVIDED, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender
shall remain the holder of any Note issued to it for the purpose of this
Agreement, (iv) such participations shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000
and shall include an allocable portion of such Lender's Participation, and (v)
Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any and all payments to be
made under this Agreement; provided, that the participation agreement between a
Lender and its participants may provide that such Lender will obtain the
approval of such participant prior to such Lender's agreeing to any amendment or
waiver of any provisions of this Agreement which would (A) extend the maturity
of the Note, (B) reduce the interest rate hereunder, or (C) increase the
Revolving Credit Commitment of the Lender granting the participation other than
as permitted by Section 2.11, and (vi) the sale of any such participations which
require Borrower to file a registration statement with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission or under the securities regulations or laws
of any state shall not be permitted.

          (f)  No Lender may assign any rights under this Agreement or the Notes
or sell participations therein except in accordance with this Section 12.01.

          (g)  No assignee Lender shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Article IV than the assignee Lender would have been entitled to
receive in respect of the rights assigned.

          12.02     NOTICES.  Any notice shall be conclusively deemed to have
been received by any party hereto and be effective on the day on which delivered

          12.03     SETOFF.  The Borrower agrees that all of Borrower's deposits
or deposit accounts, of any kind, or any of Borrower's interest in any deposits
or deposit accounts thereof, now or hereafter pledged, mortgaged, transferred or
assigned to the Agent or any Lender or otherwise in the possession or control of
the Agent or any Lender (other than for safekeeping or as a fiduciary) for any
purpose for the account or benefit of the Borrower and including any balance of
any deposit account or of any credit of the Borrower with the Agent or any
Lender, whether now existing or hereafter established, shall be subject to the
right of setoff of the Agent and any Lender at any time or times during the
continuance of an Event of Default and Borrower authorizes the agent and any
Lender with or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, without prior notice,
to apply such balances or any part thereof to such of the Obligations of the
Borrower to the Agent or such Lender then past due and in such amounts as they
may elect, and whether or not the collateral or the responsibility of other
Persons primarily, secondarily or otherwise liable may be deemed adequate.  For
the purposes of this paragraph, all remittances and property shall be deemed to
be in the possession of the Agent or such Lender as soon as the same may be put
in transit to it by mail or carrier or by other bailee.

          12.04     SURVIVAL.  All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans and
the expiration of the Letters of Credit and Acceptances and the execution and
delivery to the Lenders of this Agreement and the Notes and shall continue in
full force and effect so long as any of Obligations remain outstanding or any
Lender has any commitment hereunder.  Whenever in this Agreement, any of the
parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
successors and permitted assigns of such party and all covenants, provisions
and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrower which are contained in this
Agreement and the Notes shall inure to the benefit of the successors and
permitted assigns of the Lenders or any of them.

          12.05     EXPENSES.  The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse the
Agent for all its reasonable and customary out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including travel and copy expenses) incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable and customary fees

                                                                              64


and disbursements of counsel to the Agent, (b) to pay on demand all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with any modification, waiver or
amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel
for the Agent with respect thereto, and all reasonable costs and expenses, if
any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses), in
connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings
or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents.  In
addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and documentary taxes payable
or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and agrees to save the
Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities with
respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes.

          12.06     AMENDMENTS.  No amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and no consent by the
Lenders to any departure therefrom by the Borrower shall be effective unless
such amendment, modification or waiver shall be in writing and signed by the
Agent, but only upon having received the written consent of the Required
Lenders, and the same shall then be effective only for the period and on the
conditions and for the specific instances and purposes specified in such
writing; PROVIDED, however, that, no such amendment, modification or waiver

              (i)   which changes, extends or waives any provision of Section
                    11.10 or this Section 12.06, the amount of or the due date
                    of any scheduled installment of or the rate of interest
                    payable on any Obligation, changes the definition of
                    Required Lenders, which increases or extends the Revolving
                    Credit Commitment of any Lender or which increases or
                    extends the Letter of Credit Facility or which waives any
                    condition to the making of any Loan shall be effective
                    unless in writing and signed by each of the Lenders;
                    PROVIDED, however, the Required Lenders may in their sole
                    discretion waive any Default or Event of Default (other than
                    any Event of Default under Section 10.01(a) or (b));

              (ii)  which releases any Subsidiary from its Guaranty (other than
                    in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents) shall be
                    effective unless with the written consent of each of the
                    Lenders; or

              (iii) which affects the rights, privileges, immunities or
                    indemnities of the Agent, shall be effective unless in
                    writing and signed by the Agent.

Notwithstanding any provision of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, as
between the Agent and the Lenders, execution by the Agent shall not be deemed
conclusive evidence that the Agent has obtained the written consent of the
Required Lenders.  No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall
entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

          12.07     COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, and it

                                       64


<PAGE>

                                                                              65



shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account
for more than one such fully-executed counterpart.

          12.08     WAIVERS BY BORROWER.  In any litigation in any court with
respect to, in connection with, or arising out of this Agreement, the Loans, any
of the Notes, any of the other Loan Documents, the Obligations, or any
instrument or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or the validity,
protection, interpretation, collection or enforcement thereof, or any other
claim or dispute howsoever arising between the Borrower and the Lenders or the
Agent, the Borrower and each Lender and the Agent hereby waive trial by jury in
connection with any such litigation.

          12.09     TERMINATION.  The termination of this Agreement shall not
affect any rights of the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent or any obligation of
the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent, arising prior to the effective date of
such termination, and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative
until all transactions entered into or rights created or obligations incurred
prior to such termination have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated
and the Obligations arising prior to or after such termination have been
irrevocably paid in full.  However, after the Revolving Credit Termination Date,
(i) no additional fees shall be payable under Section 2.13 hereof and (ii) if no
Letters of Credit or Acceptances remain outstanding no additional fees shall be
payable under Section 3.02 or Section 3.05 hereof.  If after receipt of any
payment of all or any part of the Obligations, any Lender is for any reason
compelled to surrender such payment to any Person because such payment is
determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, a
diversion of trust funds or for any other reason, this Agreement shall continue
in full force and the Borrower shall be liable to, and shall indemnify and hold
such Lender harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered until such
Lender shall have been finally and irrevocably paid in full.  The provisions of
the foregoing sentence shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any
contrary action which may have been taken by the Lenders in reliance upon such
payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the
Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been
conditioned upon such payment having become final and irrevocable.

          12.10     GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE OF SUCH STATE.

     12.11     REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY OF THE LENDERS.  Each Lender hereby
represents that no part of any funds used by such Lender to fund any Loan or
other extension of credit to the Borrower made by it constitutes or will
constitute assets allocated to any "separate account" maintained by such Lender.
As used herein, the term "separate account" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 3 of ERISA.  Each Lender hereby represents to the Borrower,
the Agent and the other Lenders that the Notes are being acquired by such Lender
as a result of making loans in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and are not being acquired with a view to or for sale in connection
with any distribution of the Notes, nor with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Notes (or any interest therein); provided, however,
that, subject to any contrary requirements of law, disposition of the property
of each Lender shall at all times be and remain within the control of such
Lender.

          12.12     AGREEMENT CONTROLS.  In the event that any term of any of
the Loan Documents other than this Agreement conflicts with any term of this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control.

          12.13     CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Agent and the Lenders agree (on behalf
of themselves and each of their respective affiliates, directors, officers,
employees and representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep
confidential, in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, any non-
public information supplied to it by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall limit the
disclosure of any such information (i) to the extent required by statute, rule,
regulation or judicial process, (ii) to counsel for the Agent or such Lender,
(iii) to bank examiners, auditors, regulators, accountants or appraisers, (iv)
to any assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) so long
as such assignee or participant (or prospective assignee or participant) agrees
(in a written instrument furnished to and for the benefit of the Borrower) to
the provisions of this Section 12.13, (v) to any other Person in the course of
the enforcement of the Agent's or any Lender's rights or remedies hereunder or
under any other Loan Documents or (vi) to any other financial institution
creditor of the Borrower (and counsel to and other representatives of such
creditor) at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default.

          12.14     INDEMNIFICATION.  In consideration of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Agent and each Lender and the extension of the
Revolving Credit Commitments and Swing Line, the Borrower hereby indemnifies,
exonerates and holds the Agent and each Lender and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") free and harmless from and against any and all actions, causes of
action, suits, losses, liabilities and damages, and reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred in connection with any claim or litigation by any Person
(other than a party to this Agreement) (irrespective of whether any such
Indemnified Party is a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder
is sought), including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
(collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), incurred by the Indemnified
Parties or any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to

               (a)  any transaction financed or to be financed in whole or in
                    part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Loan
                    or supported by any Letter of Credit or Acceptance; or

               (b)  the entering into and performance of this Agreement and any
                    other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties,

and if and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for
any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the
payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is
permissible under applicable law; provided, however, that the Borrower shall
have no obligation hereunder with respect to Indemnified Liabilities resulting
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Agent or any Lender or
the breach by the Agent or any Lender of this Agreement or applicable law,
orders or regulations.

     7.   NONSOLICITATION, NONCOMPETITION AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.
          (a)  For a period of one year following the execution of this
Agreement, the Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any person
who is employed by W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (A) terminate
his or her employment with W&G or such other company, or (B) accept employment

          (b)  The Executive agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly

          (c)  All confidential information which the Executive may now have or
may have obtained during his employment by W&G relating to the business of W&G
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof shall not be disclosed to any other
person (except as required by law) without the prior written permission of W&G,

further compensation, but at W&G's expense, forthwith upon request of W&G,

pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy.

          (h)  If it is determined that any of the provisions of this Section 7,
or any part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or scope of such
provision, it is the intention of the parties that the duration or scope of such
provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes

Executive perform his obligations under this Agreement or the Consulting
Agreement or any claim, action or cause of action that W&G may have against the
Executive to the extent it is determined by a final judgment adverse to the

not legally entitled.
     9.   COOPERATION IN LITIGATION.
          The Executive shall cooperate and generally make himself available to
give testimony and assistance in connection with any litigation or arbitration

authority or agency involving W&G or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and
arising out of activities of W&G or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to the
date of this Agreement and during the period of his employment with W&G.  W&G or
one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall reimburse the Executive for, or
advance to the Executive, all reasonable out-of-pocket travel and other expenses
incurred by the Executive at the specific request of W&G in connection with the
Executive's testimony, cooperation and assistance under this Section 9. Such
expenses shall be reimbursed or advanced promptly after the Executive's
submission to W&G of statements in such reasonable detail as W&G may require.
Time spent performing Executive's obligations under this Section 9 shall be
deemed to be time spent consulting pursuant to the Consulting Agreement  and,
accordingly, the Executive's compensation for performing his obligations under
this Section 9 shall be governed by the Consulting Agreement.

hereunder) to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that W&G would have been required to perform it
had no such disposition occurred.  The Executive's rights under this Agreement
shall not be transferable by assignment or otherwise, shall not be subject to
commutation or encumbrance and shall not be subject to the claims of the
Executive's creditors.
     20.  PAYMENT OBLIGATION ABSOLUTE.
          Except as provided in Section 10 hereof, W&G's obligation to make
payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise perform its obligations
hereunder shall be absolute  and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other circumstance or rights which
W&G may have against the Executive or anyone else (including without limitation
any rights which W&G may have against the Executive for violation of Section 7
of this Agreement), all of which shall be required to be asserted in independent
proceedings.  The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any
payment provided for herein by seeking other employment or taking any other
action nor shall the amount of any payment provided for herein be reduced by
amounts earned by the Executive from other employment or otherwise, except as
provided in the Consulting Agreement.
     21.  ARBITRATION; INDEMNIFICATION.
          (a)  Any controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with

damages) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The

costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be borne by W&G.  Either party may,
without inconsistency with this Agreement, seek from a court any interim or
provisional relief that may be necessary to protect the rights or property of
that party pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the
controversy.
          (b)  In addition to (and not in lieu of) any of the Executive's rights
to indemnification or otherwise, contained in W&G's certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, the Indemnity Agreement or any other agreement, if any
action, suit, proceeding (including any arbitration proceeding) or claim shall
be brought or asserted with respect to the enforcement or interpretation of this
Agreement or any provision contained herein, W&G, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws as in effect
on the date hereof, hereby indemnifies the Executive for his reasonable
attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such action,
suit, proceeding or claim and agrees to pay or reimburse the same promptly upon
demand by the Executive (plus interest at the applicable Federal rate provided
in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended),
provided that W&G shall not be obligated to indemnify the Executive under this
Agreement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or claim brought by the
Executive in which it is finally determined that the Executive's interpretations
of this Agreement at issue, taken as a whole, are less correct than the
interpretations asserted by W&G.  W&G shall preserve and make available to the
Executive all documents and information now or hereafter in the possession of
W&G which may be required by the Executive for the prosecution or defense of any
such action, suit, proceeding or claim.
     22.  GOVERNING LAW.
          This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
without reference to the principles of conflict of laws.

                              CONSULTING AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT made as of March 18, 1994, between WILLCOX & GIBBS, INC., a New
York corporation ("W&G"), and JOHN K. ZIEGLER (the "Consultant").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS, the Consultant has previously been employed as an executive of W&G
and the parties now wish to enter into an arrangement whereby the Consultant
will act as a consultant to W&G;
     WHEREAS, the Consultant is entitled to receive certain consulting fees
under the W&G Supplemental Death and Retirement Plan if he enters into and
continues to perform a ten-year consulting agreement;
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
parties hereto agree as follows:
     1    TERM.
          The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of this
Agreement and end on March 18, 2004, unless the Agreement is earlier terminated
due to Cause (as defined below).
     2.   SERVICES.
          During the term of this Agreement, W&G shall retain the Consultant as
a consultant to W&G.  During that period the Consultant shall consult with and
advise the officers of W&G with respect to such matters involving the  business
and affairs of W&G as the officers may from time to time present to him.  The
Consultant shall be available at the Company's executive offices in New York
City during normal business hours from the date hereof through March 31, 1994,
other than five vacation business days during such period.  Thereafter, unless
Disability (as defined below) has occurred, the Consultant shall be obligated to
devote the equivalent of 15 business days to his consulting duties during any
yearly period (treating the balance of 1994 after March 31 as a yearly period
for these purposes) to the extent his physician

                                                                               2

advises his health permits.  Such consultation shall be rendered at such times
as the Consultant shall reasonably advise the Board of Directors are appropriate
giving effect to his then regular personal and other business activities.  W&G's
chief executive officer shall give the Consultant reasonable advance notice of
any requirements for consultation, and the Consultant shall use his reasonable
best efforts to perform such consultation on the schedule requested.  Where the
Consultant is required to render any service on a particular day, he shall
receive credit for a full day's service.  W&G may terminate this Agreement
without any further obligation hereunder in the event Cause has occurred.
     3.   FEES AND EXPENSES.
          (a)  On the first business day of every month during the term of this
Agreement, W&G shall pay the Consultant  a monthly fee of $2,777 in full payment
for his services under this Agreement; provided, however, that such monthly fees
shall be reduced to the extent the Consultant realizes income from regular
employment during the term of this Agreement.  In the event of the Consultant's
death or Disability during the term of this Agreement, any remaining fees
payable during the term of this Agreement shall become payable in monthly
installments to the Consultant's beneficiaries.  If the Consultant is requested
by W&G to perform and the Consultant consents and does perform consulting
services hereunder in excess of 15 days per year (excluding the period through
March 31, 1994) he shall be paid at a rate of $250 per hour.
          (b)  The Consultant shall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses
reasonably and necessarily incurred by him in connection with the performance of
his consultation duties, in accordance with W&G's then applicable procedures,
including without limitation reimbursement for travel and related expenses to
and from whatever may be his then current place of residence or place where he
may be conducting other business activities.
     4.   DEFINITIONS OF DISABILITY AND CAUSE.
          (a)  "Cause" shall have occurred if the Consultant is convicted of a
felony relating to the conduct of the business of W&G or any affiliate of W&G,
the Consultant commits

an act of personal dishonesty which is intended to personally enrich the
Consultant or members of his family at the financial expense of W&G or any
affiliate of W&G, or the Consultant fails to perform his obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect, other than due to death or Disability, after
being given five business days in which to cure his failure to perform.
          (b)  "Disability" shall have occurred if the Consultant has been
physically or mentally incapacitated or disabled for a period of six consecutive
months to an extent which renders the Consultant unable to perform his services
as evidenced by the written confirmation of the Consultant's physician and, if
W&G shall so require, an independent physician.
     5.   NOTICE.
          Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return

agreed to in writing, signed by the Consultant and by an authorized officer of

writing and signed by the Consultant or an authorized officer of W&G, as the
case may be.

          In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in
full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
     8.   HEADINGS.

construction of any provision of this Agreement.

     10.  ASSIGNMENT.
          No rights or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
transferred by the Consultant except that the Consultant's rights to
compensation and benefits hereunder shall, in the event of death, pass to his
estate, or to his designated beneficiary, and may be transferred by will or
operation of law.  In the event of a future disposition of (or including) the
properties and business of W&G, substantially as an entirety, by merger,
consolidation, sale of stock or assets or otherwise, then W&G shall require the
acquiring or surviving corporation (which shall be substituted for W&G
hereunder) to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that W&G would have been required to perform it
had no such disposition occurred.  The Consultant's rights under this Agreement

this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration held in New York City in

inconsistency with this Agreement, seek from a court any interim or provisional
relief that may be necessary to protect the rights or property of that party
pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy.

rights to indemnification or otherwise, contained in W&G's certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, the Indemnity Agreement dated November 18, 1986, between

Ziegler, who has been with W&G for over 27 years, including the last 18 years as

one of the largest distributors of electrical parts and supplies in the United
States.  Given these accomplishments, I have decided that the time has come to
pursue certain personal interests."

Rexel, S.A. and a director of W&G since 1992, had been named President and Chief
Executive Officer of W&G.  In addition, the Company said that Eric Lomas, a

the Company is grateful for his many years of contributions to the Company.  We
look forward to building further on W&G's past accomplishments."
