                                  PART I
Item 1 - BUSINESS

General
- -------
United Bancorp (the "Company") is an Oregon corporation organized in 1971.  Its
principal continuing business is the coordination of the financial resources
of the consolidated enterprise and the making of investments in and advances
to its subsidiaries to fund portions of their capital and credit requirements.

The business of Douglas National Bank (the "Bank"), a subsidiary of the
Company, is, and is expected for the foreseeable future to continue to be, the
principal source of the Company's revenue. See "The Bank" for a discussion of
its subsidiary, Douglas National Bank Insurance Agency, Inc.("DNBIA").

The Company
- -----------
The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Oregon in 1971 as a
bank holding company.  It owns all the capital stock of the Bank, a national
banking association chartered in 1959.

The Company was formed to permit greater flexibility in the operation of the
Bank and related financial services.  In September 1972, through a plan of
reorganization and merger, the Bank became a subsidiary of the Company and the
stockholders of the Bank became the stockholders of the Company.  The Company's
principal sources of funds are dividends and interest from the Bank.  There
are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank can pay dividends to the
Company or otherwise supply funds to the Company or its affiliates.

In December 1995, the Company merged with the one other wholly owned
subsidiary, organized as an Oregon corporation:  U.B.C. Investment
Corporation. U.B.C. Investment Corporation owned certain of the Bank's
buildings and leased them back to the Bank.

The Company's principal executive offices are located at 555 S.E. Kane Street,
P.O. Box 1007, Roseburg, Oregon 97470, and its telephone number is (541)
440-2629.  Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to
the Company are to the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank.

The Bank
- --------
The Bank is a national banking association chartered in 1959.  It is engaged in
the general banking business in Douglas County, Oregon.  Its primary service
area is northern Douglas County.  Its main office is located at 555 S.E. Kane
Street, Roseburg, and it operates five branch offices in Winston, Sutherlin,
Glide, Drain and Roseburg (Garden Valley) and two off premises automatic
teller machines located in Roseburg and Rice Hill Valley.

The Bank's commercial services include acceptance of demand, savings and other
time deposits, lending of money on secured and unsecured basis to individuals,
partnerships and corporations, and purchase of investment securities and
rendering of services generally connected with commercial banking, except
trust services.

The Bank conducts its operations in Douglas County, Oregon. The economy of the
region is, and has always been closely linked to the forest products industry.
The availability of deposits and the exposure to credit loss can be impacted
by the economic performance in the forest products industry.
                                    -3-

Douglas National Bank Insurance Agency, Inc. (DNBIA) was incorporated January
12, 1988, with the Bank owning 100 percent of DNBIA common stock issued.
DNBIA was organized to provide insurance and related financial products and is
licensed in the State of Oregon to market Life, Health and General Lines of
insurance products.  DNBIA is headquartered at the Glide Office of Douglas
National Bank, Glide, Oregon.

Competition
- -----------
All phases of the Company's financial service activities, including banking and
the related businesses in which it is engaged are highly competitive.  The Bank
competes with independent locally controlled banks and banks which are
subsidiaries of bank holding companies based inside and outside Oregon.  The
Bank competes actively with banks, savings and loans, and credit unions for
deposits and loans, and brokerage firms for deposits.  The Bank also competes
with other financial institutions, including personal loan companies, finance
companies and governmental agencies, all of which are actively engaged in
marketing various types of loans and other financial services.

Quality of service to customers and ease of accessibility to facilities are
among the principal methods of meeting competition in the financial services
industries.

Number of Persons Employed
- --------------------------
As of December 31, 1995, the Bank had 51 full-time employees and 22 part-time
employees.  None of the Bank's employees is represented by a labor union.
The Bank considers its relationships with its employees satisfactory.

Supervision and Regulation of the Company
- -----------------------------------------
The Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956
(the "Act"), as amended, and is registered as such with the Federal Reserve
Board.  As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the
Federal Reserve Board reports and any additional information the Federal
Reserve Board may require.  The Federal Reserve Board may make examinations of
the Company and its subsidiaries and it also has the power to issue cease and
desist orders where action or inaction would constitute a threat to the safety,
soundness or stability of the Company.

Under the Act, the Company may not acquire direct or indirect ownership or
control of the voting shares of any company, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board if, after such acquisition, it
would own or control more than 5 percent of the voting shares of such company,
except as specifically authorized.  In addition, the Company is generally
prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of,
voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities.  Subject to the
approval of the Federal Reserve Board, the Company may acquire shares of
nonbanking corporations, the activities of which are deemed by the Federal
Reserve Board to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks.

Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by
regulation to be closely related to banking are, making or servicing loans,
performing certain data processing services, acting as fiduciary or investment
or financial advisor, engaging in mortgage banking, making investments in and


                                    -4-
<PAGE>  5
operating insurance agencies, or making investments in corporations or projects
designed primarily to promote community welfare.  In making any such
determination, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider whether the
performance of such activities by the Company or an affiliate can reasonably be
expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience,
increased competition or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse
effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair
competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.  The Federal
Reserve Board is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced
de novo and activities commenced by acquisitions, in whole or in part.

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving an application by the
Company to acquire voting shares of any commercial bank in another state
unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by the laws of such other
state.

The Company and its subsidiaries are "affiliates" of the Bank within the
meaning of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corportaion ("FDIC"), which impose restrictions on loans by the Bank
to its affiliates, on investments by the Bank in the stock or securities of its
affiliates, on taking such stock or securities as collateral security for loans
to any borrower, on the guarantee of credit of an affiliate and on the purchase
of assets from an affiliate.  The Company, the Bank and their affiliates are
also subject to restrictions on engaging in the business of underwriting or
distributing securities in the United States.

Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
- --------------------------------------
The Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by the Comptroller
of Currency.  It is also subject to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve
Board and FDIC.

There are various requirements and restrictions affecting the Bank and its
operations including: the requirement to maintain reserves against deposits;
restrictions on the nature and amount of loans which may be made by the Bank;
and restrictions relating to investments, branching and other activities of the
Bank; and limitations upon the Bank's ability to declare and pay dividends.

The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank and FDIC and deposits of
$100,000 or less are insured.

Monetary Policies
- -----------------
The Company and its subsidiaries are affected by the national and regional
economic environment and are also affected directly and indirectly by the
monetary and fiscal policies of the United States Government, including the
Federal Reserve System which regulates the nation's money supply primarily
through control of bank credit.  Such regulation has the effect of
influencing the overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and
affects interest rates on loans and deposits.  The monetary policies of the
Federal Reserve System have had a significant effect on the operating results
of commercial banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future. The
impact of these policies cannot be accurately predicted.

NONPERFORMING LOANS
- -------------------
The accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when, in the opinion of
management, the future collectibility of principal or interest is in serious
doubt.  The Bank's policy is to reverse and charge against current income,
interest previously accrued but uncollected.  Subsequent interest collected on
such loans is credited to loan principal if, in the opinion of management,
full collectibility of principal is doubtful.

Loans contractually past due 90 days or more on which interest was being
accrued at December 31, 1995 were $81,000, as compared to $97,000 at December
31, 1994.

The Bank follows guidelines of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency in
evaluating adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease losses.  As outlined
in Banking Circular 201, dated February 20, 1992, the Bank's policy is to
maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that is adequate to absorb all
estimated inherent losses.  Inherent losses are defined as those loan losses
that are probable.

In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, the Bank's evaluation includes the
following:

1.  For individual credits identified with a higher than normal credit risk,
    these loans are identified by the Lenders, Credit Administrators, and Loan
    Review Officer.  The status of the risk associated with these credits is
    reviewed quarterly.  The factors considered in evaluating the risk for
    each loan include:  overall financial condition including cash flows
    (recent and projected), repayment record, and realizable value of
    collateral, if any.

2.  All outstanding loans and unfunded commitments including loans listed on
    the watchlist with no unusual credit risk, such as commercial lines of
    credit, letters of credit, credit cards, and check loans.  The loan losses
    in pools of loans are based on The Bank's historical loss experience,
    adjusted for perceived changes in trends and conditions expected to
    occur in the Bank's local area.  More specifically, the Bank's
    consideration includes, but is not limited to: levels of trends in
    delinquencies and nonaccruals; trends in loan volume; terms of loans;
    effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those
    for underwriting, collection, charge-off and recovery; experience, ability,
    and depth of lending management and staff; national and local economic
    trends and conditions; concentrations of credit (for example, local
    industries, their employees and suppliers that might affect loss experience
    across one or more components of the portfolio).

3.  Potential losses by loan segments, broken down into consumer, commercial,
    residential, commercial real estate, and credit cards.
                                      
In addition to these known items, the Bank is also maintaining reserves to
cover for local economic exposure.  Douglas County's economy is more closely
tied to the forest products industry, which continues to be volatile.  The
industry is expected to continue to weaken in the future.  The economic climate
impacts both the ability of commercial and consumer borrowers to pay and the
value of real estate properties which serve as collateral on loans.  The
unallocated portion of the reserve is intended to cover exposure to credit
losses in anticipation of further weakening of the economy.

Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATION
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------
1995 COMPARED TO 1994
- ---------------------
The Company had improved financial results in 1995 with net income up 95
percent from 1994.  The increase in net income resulted in a return on average
assets of 1.19% and a return on average equity of 10.95%, up from .59% and

                                    -16-
<PAGE> 17
5.94% respectively in comparison to 1994.  Various factors influenced the
increase in net income.  Net interest income was up 5 percent or $187,000,
noninterest income was up 14 percent or $105,000, and noninterest expense was
down 13 percent or $558,000 in comparrison to 1994.

The Company repositioned the Investment portfolio in 1994, taking a $366,000
realized loss.  This repositioning increased yields on investments for 1995
dramatically.  The average yield on taxable securities in 1994 was 5.89
percent, while the average yield in 1995 was 7.02 percent.  Although the yield
on the securities increased, total securities decreased by 21 percent or
$12,338,000 in 1995.  The Company sold about $10,000,000 in securities to
decrease the volitility in the portfolio.  The Company reduced exposure in the
portfolio if rates were to rise substantially.  The Company used the proceeds
from the sale of securities and maturities throughout the year to pay off short
term debt and purchase seasoned real estate loans yielding an average interest
rate of 8 percent.  Hence, net loans increased over 1994 by $6,217,000 and
interest income on loans increased from $3,242,000 in 1994 to $3,982,000 in
1995.  The repositioning of the balance sheet resulted in an increase of
interest income of $594,000 in 1995.  The Company also recognized a provision
for loan losses of $80,000 in 1995, compared with no provision in 1994.  The
allowance for loan losses was $476,000 at December 31, 1995 which represented
1.19 percent of gross loans, compared with $483,000 or 1.43 percent in 1994.
The loan portfolio continues to be of strong credit quality which reflects the
Companys conservative policys.  Non performing loans were $178,604 at year end
compared with $168,000 in 1994.  The Company had net charge off loans of
$87,000 in 1995 compared to $5,000 in 1994.  

Total debt was reduced by nearly $5,000,000 by year end with the proceeds from
the sale of securities.  However, interest expense on these Notes Payable
increased by $246,000 over 1994.  This was due in part, to an increased cost of
funds during 1995, whereby the average cost went from 5.56 percent in 1994 to
6.65 percent in 1995, and as a result of an increase in the average balance of
short term borrowings and long term debt for 1995.  Total deposits, including
Fed Funds Purchased and Repurchase Agreements fell 9 percent or $7,400,000
during 1995.  Bank customers transfered money out of savings and other interest
bearing accounts into Time Certificates, which showed an increase of
$2,001,000.  Time Certificates represent higher cost of funds for the Company
which resulted in an increase of interest expense of $100,000 over 1994.  The
Company feels the reason for the decline in deposits is largely the result of
customers moving money into annuities and mutual funds where they can earn
higher returns.  Net interest income, which is the difference between interest
income and interest expense was up 5 percent as a result of the preceeding
transactions.

In December 1995, the Company took advantage of the amnesty period offered by
FASB 115 to reclassify investment securities from the Held to Maturity (HTM)
portfolio into the Available for Sale (AFS) portfolio with no penalties.  The
Company moved its entire Investment Portfolio to Availabe For Sale.  At
December 31, 1994 the Investment portfolio was comprised of 46 percent Held to
Maturity securities and 54 percent Available For Sale securities.  By moving
all of the securities into the Available For Sale Portfolio, the Company can
better manage liquidity concerns, volitility and  net interest margin risks.
The Company has greater exposure to potential reductions in Stockholders Equity
if there is a large unrealized loss in the investment portfolio.  However, the
Company feels that with the ability to manage the Investment portfolio, the
potential exposure  will be minimized.  The fair value of the Companys
Available for Sale securities exceeded its cost by $291,000 at December 31,

                                    -17-
<PAGE> 18
1995 creating an unrealized gain, compared with 1994 which showed an unrealized
loss of $1,276,000.  Total Stockholders Equity increased by $1,969,000, mainly
due to earnings and the change in unrealized gains/losses in the Investment
Portfolio.

Noninterest income which represents service charges on deposits and other fees
collected, increased by $105,000, due in part, to increased awareness of
service charges waived and restructuring of deposit product types.  Noninterest
expense decreased by $558,000 in 1995 due to the following.  The largest
variance was due to realized gains in the Investment Portfolio of $118,000 in
1995, whereas in 1994 there were realized losses of $336,000.  FDIC assessments
decreased substantially from 1994.  The FDIC lowered the insurance premium for
the Company to the minimum required by any bank.  The Company will see the full
effect of this change in 1996 when they will only pay $2,000 a year compared
with the $156,000 paid in 1994.  The amount paid in 1995 was $78,000 which
represented a $78,000 decrease in expense.  The remainder of noninterest
expenses did not change substantially over 1994.

The Company predicts a prosperous year for 1996, and expects the economy and
the interest rate cycle to remain fairly calm.

- ---------------------
1994 COMPARED TO 1993
- ---------------------
The Company had a 42.8 percent decrease in net income from $1,027,000 in 1993
to $587,000 in 1994.  This decrease resulted primarily from the sale of certain
of the Company's investment securities at a loss and the purchase and
installation of a systems upgrade for the Company. Total assets increased from
$97,729,000 in 1993 to $103,857,000 in 1994, a 6.3 percent increase.  Total
loans increased by approximately 16.3 percent from $29,052,000 in 1993 to
$33,775,000 in 1994.  The increase in loans was due, in part, to the repurchase
from the Oregon Retirement System ("OPERF") of certain seasoned commercial real
estate loans the Bank originally sold to the OPERF. The increase in loans was
also due, in part, to the growth of commercial/agriculture loans. These loans
grew 17.6 percent from $17,211,000 in 1993 to $20,237,000 in 1994.  The
allowance for loan losses equaled $483,000 at December 31, 1994 which
represented 1.43 percent of gross loans.  At December 31, 1993, the allowance
totaled $488,000 and represented 1.6 percent of gross loans.  The Company had
net charge off loans of $5,000 in 1994 compared to $39,000 in 1993.  Non
performing loans were $168,000 at  December 31, 1994, compared with $3,000
December 31, 1993. The loan portfolio continues to be of strong credit quality
which reflects the Company's conservative policy.

The Company's investment in securities decreased slightly from $60,761,000 in
1993 to $59,007,000 in 1994.  The Company continues to increase investments in
state and political subdivisions (e.g., municipal bonds) from $6,266,000 in
1993 to $7,942,000 in 1994 in order to take advantage of the higher returns due
to their tax exempt status.  As a result, tax exempt income increased from
$105,000 in 1993 to $332,000 in 1994.  Interest income on taxable securities
decreased slightly from $3,054,000 in 1993 to $3,013,000 in 1994.  Net interest
income was up $746,000 from $3,908,000 in 1993 to $4,654,000 in 1994, an
increase of 19.1 percent, boosted in large part by the Federal Reserve Board's
action to raise the prime interest rate five times in 1994. On the other hand,
interest expense on deposits decreased by $215,000 from $1,443,000 in 1993 to
$1,228,000 in 1994, a 14.9 percent reduction, while deposits decreased 3.6
percent from $70,930,000 in 1993 to $68,386,000 in 1994.  With the increase in


                                    -18-
<PAGE> 19
interest rates, many customers moved their deposit accounts to higher yielding
investments such as treasury bills, annuities, and mutual funds.  The bank's
subsidiary, Douglas National Bank Insurance Agency, benefited from the
disintermediation of the deposit accounts as the Bank's customers used such
subsidiary's brokerage services to move their accounts.  During the fourth
quarter of 1994, the Company sold a portion of its Available For Sale
securities at a $366,000 loss.  The Company originally purchased these
securities when the yields offered were low.  It has now replaced them by
purchasing new securities with higher yields. The repositioning of a portion of
the securities portfolio, while resulting in a loss in 1994, in the view of
management, will improve the Company's earnings for 1995 and beyond.

At December 31, 1994, the Company had investment securities with average
maturities of approximately three years.  The fair value of the Company's
current portfolio of Available for Sale securities is lower than cost by
$1,276,000, compared to an excess of market cost of $436,000 in 1993.  The
fair value of its current portfolio of Held to Maturity securities is also
lower than cost by $1,354,000, compared to an excess of market over cost of
$106,000 in 1993. As a result, Stockholders Equity was decreased by $788,000:
$1,276,000 excess of cost over fair value, less $488,000 deferred income
benefit.

The Company purchased in 1994 computer equipment to support the FIserve
Comprehensive Banking System, a new system upgrade.  The purchase of this
equipment is reflected in the increase of Bank Premises from $2,608,000 in
1993 to $2,941,000 in 1994.  The systems upgrade includes computers, networking
equipment, etc. and in management's view, will result in increased efficiency
and customer service.  Salaries and benefits for employees also increased
from $1,590,000 in 1993 to $2,150,000 in 1994 due to the change in estimate of
retirement benefits and due to the overtime and training costs in connection
with the installation and purchase of the new computer system.  Cash flows
for the purchase of premises, furniture, and equipment was up from $108,000 in
1993 to $622,000 in 1994, also due to the installation and purchase of the
systems upgrade.  The total noninterest expenses were up 18 percent in 1994
for a total of $4,600,000, representing an annualized ratio of noninterest
expense to total revenue of 62.1 percent in 1994 compared to 59.8 percent in
1993.

- ---------------------
1993 COMPARED TO 1992
- ---------------------
Total assets increased slightly from $97,085,000 in 1992 to $97,729,000 in
1993.  Loans, on the other hand, increased by approximately 20 percent from
$24,028,000 in 1992 to $29,052,000 in 1993.  The amount of the loans increased
as a result of the Company's commitment to increase its loan-to-deposit ratio
in order to improve the return on its assets.  Consumer loans almost doubled
from $4,440,000 in 1992 to $7,264,000 in 1993 and commercial/agricultural
loans jumped up 20 percent from $14,352,000 in 1992 to $17,211,000 in 1993. The
Company reduced the allowance for loan loss by $537,000 to satisfy the
requirements of the Comptroller of Currency, which allowance now represents 1.6
percent of the Company's gross loans.  At December 31, 1992, the allowance for
loan loss represented 4.4 percent of the Company's gross loans.  The Company
recognized as income the $537,000 reduction in the allowance for loan loss in
1993 as a negative provision for a loan loss.  The Company had net charge off
loans of $39,000 in 1993 as compared to net recoveries of $64,000 in 1992. 
Non-accrual loans at December 31, 1993, totaled only $3,000 compared with 1992
in which they totaled $315,000.

                                    -19-
<PAGE> 20
The Company's investments in securities increased slightly from $59,535,000 in
1992 to $60,761,000 in 1993.  The Company substantially increased investments
in obligations of state and political subdivisions (municipal bonds) from
$1,891,000 in 1992 to $6,266,000 in 1993.  Interest income on taxable
securities decreased by $802,000 from $3,856,000 in 1992 to $3,054,000 in 1993,
which represents a 20 percent decrease.  This decrease is attributable to the
low interest rate environment, resulting in the early paying off of mortgage
backed products and the repricing of other securities at lower rates. The
Company offset a part of interest income by reducing the cost of deposits.
Interest expense on deposits decreased by $444,000 in 1993, while deposits were
up by less than one percent from $70,087,000 in 1992 to $70,930,000 in 1993.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had investment securities with average
maturities of approximately two years.  The Company adopted SFAS 115 at
December 31, 1993, which separates these securities into three categories:
Held-to-Maturity, Available-for-Sale, and Trading Account. At December 31,
1993, the Company had $31,540,000 of the portfolio classified as
"Held-to-Maturity" and $28,785,000 classified as "Available-for-Sale", for
liquidity and asset liability management purposes.  The Available-for-Sale
securities are shown at fair value.  Stockholders' Equity increased by
$269,000: $437,000 excess of fair value over cost, less $168,000 of deferred
income taxes.

The Company also adopted SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" as of January
1, 1993.  Under this liability method, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are for differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts at currently enacted tax rates. The Company also
changed its estimate of prior years taxes which increased income in 1993 by
$166,000.

Cash flows from operating activities show the amortization of securities'
discounts and premiums as a net amortization expense rather than a net
accretion into income as occurred in 1992.  This is because in 1992, the
Company held large balances of zero coupon discount bonds which accrue income.
These bonds were paid in early 1993.

The Company had an 11 percent decrease in net income from $1,156,000 in 1992
to $1,027,000 in 1993 due to the items described above.  The Company also
incurred certain unanticipated expenses in 1993 which affected net income,
including losses resulting from a robbery and the incurrence of additional
professional fees in connection with certain nonrecurring matters.

- ---------
LIQUIDITY
- ---------
Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to insure that adequate funds
are available to meet customer's borrowing needs and fluctuations in deposits.

The most significant volatility, resulting in the need for cash outlays, is
in the purchased funds and time deposits.  The Company matches the proceeds
from purchased funds with investments, largely term federal funds, of
approximately the same maturity.  Time deposits have varying maturities and are
of varying amounts.  The Company can control, to some extent, the balance of
these time deposits by adjusting the rate offered on these funds.  Core
deposits represent demand, interest-bearing transactions and savings deposits.
As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, core deposits were $50,688,000 and
$56,966,000 respectively.  Core deposits have no stated maturity, but in total
are less volatile than purchased funds and time deposits.
                                    -20-
<PAGE> 21
The Company has the ability to purchase federal funds from other financial
institutions to meet liquidity needs.  Investments and interest bearing
deposits with banks with a carrying value of $14,418,000 will mature or payoff
within the next year to meet additional cash requirements and, if necessary,
investment securities which are classified as Available For Sale, can be sold
prior to maturity to meet any unexpected cash demands.  The Company can also
control, to some extent, the cash outlays made for new loans to customers.
The Company does, however, have $8,181,000 of commitments to lend under lines
of credit and standby letters of credit which must be met if required.  The
Company does not anticipate all such commitments will be exercised, but would
meet these cash demands through the available sources previously discussed.

The Company has implemented a funds management program. These measures are
designed to achieve a minimum level of primary and secondary resources based
upon analysis of the volatility of the deposits and loan demands as well as
asset and liability mixes, yields and maturities.
- -----------------
CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -----------------
Capital resources to the Company represent the sources of liquidity previously
discussed.  These sources of liquidity can be obtained at various costs.  The
cost of these funds can change as market interest rates change.  Capital
resources are needed to meet investing and lending demands of the Company.
The rates at which these funds can be invested (generally in Treasury and
Agency securities or Collateralized Mortgage Obligations) or loaned to
customers also vary as market interest rates change.

Interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on the interest
income and interest expense of the Company.  The Company has relatively little
control over the rates it can earn on most assets and the rates it must pay on
most liabilities.

Within this environment, management's goal is to assure liquidity to meet the
needs of customers while maximizing the contribution of net interest income
to the Company's operating results without assuming undue risk.

The intent of management is to limit swings in net interest income resulting
from changes in interest rates.  An asset or liability is described as rate
sensitive when either it can be repriced (the rate changed) or it matures,
whichever comes first.  The difference between the amount of rate sensitive
assets and the amount of rate sensitive liabilities is referred to as the
interest rate sensitivity "gap".  If as many assets as liabilities can be
repriced within a specific time interval, the Company is said to be matched.
In general, such a position will result in less volatile swings in net
interest income.  It is management's goal to minimize swings in net interest
income due to interest rate fluctuation.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT, AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
ARRANGEMENTS
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Company and Mr. Kjensrud entered into a Restated Employment Agreement
dated November 29, 1988, by the term of which the Company employed him to
serve as President of the Bank and to perform such other reasonably related
duties as may be designated by the Board of Directors from time to time. In
consideration therefor, the Company pays to him a minimum annual salary in the
amount of $77,600 and any director's fees it pays to him during such year for
his services as a director of the Company.  Mr. Kjensrud also receives paid
vacations, pension benefits, medical benefits, disability insurance, and other
benefits as the Company may allow or provide to its employees in general
and receives certain perquisites, such as an automobile, gasoline for such
automobile, and membership in a country club.

The Agreement provides for certain other benefits.  First, it provides for
the payment of an annual bonus, determined on the basis of the achievement of
certain goals.  If Mr. Kjensrud does not achieve any of the specified goals,
then the Company does not pay him any bonus; if he achieves a percentage of
the goals, then he receives an interpolated percentage based on the proportion
achievement of the goals; if he achieves all such goals, then he receives all
of the bonus; and, if he exceeds such goals, he receives 110 percent of the
specified bonus amount.  The amount of the bonus each year for the achievement
of all of the goals equals 25 percent of his annual salary. Mr. Kjensrud may
elect to defer the payment of such bonus until the date of his death, permanent
disability, or termination of employment.  If he elects to defer its payment,
the Company will credit to him interest thereon monthly at an interest rate
equal to the interest rate the Company pays on money market instruments for
like amounts of funds.  At the date of death, disability, or termination of
employment, Mr. Kjensrud (or his beneficiaries) may receive such amount in a
lump sum or payable in 120 monthly installments.

The Agreement also provides that in the event the Company or the Bank are
sold or merged during the term of Mr. Kjensrud's employment and the Company has
not terminated Mr. Kjensrud for cause prior to the date of such sale and
merger, the Company agrees to pay to him two years additional compensation
equal to his base salary, his allowance for his automobile, and his annual
bonus for the year in which the merger or sale took place.  It is payable
beginning as of the date of the sale or merger, even if the Company or the
Bank (or their successor in interest) elects to continue to employ him.  Mr.
Kjensrud is also entitled to terminate his employment and receive such
compensation if the Company or the Bank (or their successor in interest) do not
offer to continue to employ him at the same level of duties and authority
taking into account his background and abilities and consistent with his
position before the sale and merger.

                                    -26-
<PAGE> 27
Finally, the Agreement provides that Mr. Kjensrud participate in the Company's
Executive Supplemental Retirement Income Plan which the Company established for
its executives to provide to them supplemental income upon retirement.  Under
this Plan, the Company agrees to pay Mr. Kjensrud upon retirement the amount
of $5,192 per month for life or for 180 months, whichever is longer.  The
Company purchased an insurance policy upon the life of Mr. Kjensrud to permit
the Company to provide such retirement benefits to him. If Mr. Kjensrud should
become disabled, before retirement, under the Plan, the Company also agrees
to provide to him a maximum monthly benefit of $1,400 for a period of time of
not less than 2 years up until he reaches the age of 65.

                        (amounts in thousands of dollars)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Bancorp
(the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Douglas National Bank
(the Bank) (including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Douglas National Bank
Insurance Agency, Inc.) and UBC Investment Corporation,which was merged into
United Bancorp in December 1995.  The Company and the Bank provide banking,
commercial financing, mortgage lending and brokerage, investing, insurance
and other services primarily to customers in the Douglas County area of Oregon.
All significant inter-company transations and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation.  Substantially all of the Bank's depositors are businesses
and individuals located in Douglas County.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
on hand, amounts due from or deposited with banks, and interest bearing
balances due from banks.  Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day
periods.

Securities

On December 31, 1993,  the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" and reported an increase to December 31, 1993 stockholders'
equity of $269 ($437 before deferred income taxes).  Investments in securities
are classified by management as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or
trading.  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities
at the time of purchase.  On December 1, 1995, the Company transferred all of
its held-to-maturity securities, with an amortized cost and net unrealized gain
of $23,552 and $128, respectively, to the available-for-sale classification.

Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are acquired
with the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are stated at cost, and are
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.  Securities
sold from the held-to-maturity portfolio within 90 days of maturity when
interest rate risk has been substantially eliminated as a pricing factor
are considered to have matured.

                        (amounts in thousands of dollars)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued:

Securities classified as available-for-sale are to be held for indefinite
periods of time and may be sold in response to movements in market interest
rates, changes in the maturity mix of bank assets and liabilities, or demands
on liquidity.  These securities are carried at fair value and unrealized
holding gains and losses (net of deferred income taxes) are reported as a
separate component of stockholders' equity.

Securities classified as trading are to be carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.  The Company has no
securities classified as trading securities.

Interest income on debt securities is included in income using the level yield
method.  Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized on a specific
identification basis.

Loans

Loans are reported at their principal outstanding balance net of charge-offs,
deferred loan fees and costs on originated loans, unearned income, and
unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans.  Interest income is
generally recognized when income is earned using the interest method.  Loan
origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the
net amounts are amortized as adjustments of the loans' yields.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The Bank adopted SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan", on January 1, 1995.  Under the new Standard a loan is considered
impaired based on current information and events if it is probable that the
Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest
when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The
measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest
rate, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment
based on the fair value of the collateral.

The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is periodically evaluated by
the Bank in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is sufficient to
absorb probable credit losses.  Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on a review of the Bank's historical loss experience, known
and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, including adverse circumstances that
may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and/or principal, the
estimated value of collateral, and an analysis of the levels and trends of
delinquencies, charge-offs, and the risk ratings of the various loan
categories.  Such factors as the level and trend of interest rates and the
condition of the national and local economies are also considered.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued:
                        (amounts in thousands of dollars)

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued:

The allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in
the form of a provision for credit losses.  Increases and decreases in the
allowance due to changes in the measurement of the impaired loans are included
in the provision for credit losses.  Loans continue to be classified as
impaired unless they are brought fully current and the collection of scheduled
interest and principal is considered probable.

When a loan or portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the portion
deemed uncollectible is charged against the allowance and subsequent
recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

Income Recognition on Impaired and Nonaccrual Loans

Loans, including impaired loans, are generally classified as nonaccrual if they
are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of
more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of
collection.  If a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or is
partially charged off, the loan is classified as nonaccrual.  Loans that are on
a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified
as nonaccrual if repayment in full of principal or interest is in doubt.

Loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts
contractually due (including arrearages) are reasonably assured of repayment
within an acceptable period of time, and there is sustained period of repayment
performance (generally a minimum of six months) by the borrower, in accordance
with the contractual terms of interest and principal.

While a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectibility of the
recorded loan balance is doubtful, collections of interest and principal are
generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding.  When the future
collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected, interest income may be
recognized on a cash basis.  In the case where a nonaccrual loan had been
partially charged off, recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to
that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the
contractual interest rate.  Cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are
recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge-offs
have been fully recovered.

Bank Premises, Furniture and Equipment

Premises, furniture, equipment, improvements and replacements are stated at
cost. Depreciation is recognized on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the asset.  Gains and losses from disposal of assets are
reflected in noninterest expense.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed and
betterments are capitalized.  Costs of purchased software are amortized over
five years.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued

Income Taxes

The Company files consolidated federal and State of Oregon income tax returns.
Subsidiaries of the Company are allocated a share of the consolidated income
tax provision by use of the separate return method.  On January 1, 1993, the
Company prospectively adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109.  The cumulative and 1993 effect on net income of adopting SFAS No. 109 was
immaterial.  The Statement requires the use of an asset and liability approach
to account for income taxes.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share is net income divided by weighted average common shares
outstanding.

Reclassifications

Certain 1993 and 1994 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1995
presentation.

At December 31, 1995, the Bank had no loans requiring a specific valuation
allowance in accordance with SFAS No. 114.  During 1995, the Bank did not have
any loans which would be classified as impaired under the guidelines of SFAS
No. 114.

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Bank had nonaccrual loans of $4 and $168,
respectively.  Interest income of $12 and $11 was recognized on these loans in
1995 and 1994, respectively.  Had these loans performed in accordance with
their original terms, additional interest income of $1 and $5 would have been
recorded in 1995 and 1994, respectively.

A substantial portion of the Bank's loans are made to businesses and residents
located in Douglas County, Oregon.  The Bank's credit policies require an
evaluation of each borrower's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.
Collateral generally consists of real and personal property.  At the discretion
of management, personal guarantees of the borrower may be obtained in addition
to the collateral.  The ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the
Bank's loan portfolio is susceptible to adverse changes in the local market
conditions.  It is management's opinion that the allowance for loan losses is
adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio.

9.  CASH AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS:

The Bank is required to maintain reserves in the form of cash on hand or cash
on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank equal to a percentage of its
reservable deposits.  Required reserves at December 31, 1995 were $755.

The Bank, as a National Bank, is subject to the dividend restrictions set forth
by the Comptroller of the Currency.  Under such restrictions, the Bank may not,
without the prior approval of the Comptroller of the Currency, declare
dividends in excess of the sum of the current year's earnings (as defined) plus
the retained earnings (as defined) from the prior two years.

The dividends that the Bank could declare, without the approval of the
Comptroller of the Currency, amounted to approximately $2,300 as of December
31, 1995.

10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Profit Sharing Plan

The Company's Employee Profit Sharing Plan covers substantially all the
employees of the Company.  Annual contributions are determined by the Board of
Directors.  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, contributions to the plan were $19, $16
and $17, respectively.

Executive Incentive Plan

The Executive Incentive Plan rewards key officers for performance and
continuity of service.  The plan is a long-term deferred compensation plan.
Awards earned under the plan vest ratably over four years and were $36, $14
and $38 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Expenses recognized under the
plan were $32, $55 and $76 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Debt

The Company sponsors a leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) that
covers substantially all employees of the Company.  The Company makes annual
contributions to the ESOP.  The amount of the annual contributions is
discretionary, except that it must be sufficient to enable the ESOP to service
its debt.  The ESOP shares initially were pledged as collateral for its debt.
As the debt is repaid, shares are released and allocated to active employees,
based on the proportion of debt paid. The debt of the ESOP is recorded as a
liability and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP
compensation in the equity section of the balance sheet.  As shares are
released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the
current market price of the shares for all shares acquired by the ESOP
subsequent to December 31, 1992, and equal to the book value of shares acquired
prior to January 1, 1993.  The shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share
(EPS) computations, at the time of allocation to the active employees.  ESOP
compensation expense related to the payment of debt was $78, $10, and $60 in
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

12.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank issues commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit.  The Bank applies the same credit
standards to these commitments as it uses in all its lending processes and
considers these commitments in its lending risk evaluations.  Off balance sheet
commitments at December 31 are as follows:

<CAPTION>
                                                           1995       1994

     Commitments to extend credit..................       $  7,889   $  8,281
     Standby letters of credit.....................            292        136
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of the contract agreement.  Commitments generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of
a fee.  Commitments may expire without being drawn upon and do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements.  Customer creditworthiness is evaluated on
a case-by-case basis with collateral obtained as necessary based on
management's evaluation of the credit.  Collateral varies, but may include
accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-
producing commercial property.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
in extending loan facilities to customers.

13.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The following methods and assumptions were used by management to estimate the
fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable
to estimate that value.  The resulting estimates of fair value require
subjective judgments and are approximate.  Changes in the following
methodologies and assumptions could significantly affect the estimates:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value.

Investment Securities

For investment securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices.  If
a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted
market prices for similar securities.

13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, continued:

Loans

The fair value of fixed-rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  Variable
rate loans with rate adjustments have carrying amounts which are a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

Deposits and Repurchase Agreements

The fair value of demand, interest-bearing demand, repurchase agreements and
savings deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.  The
fair value of time deposits is estimated using the interest rates currently
offered for the deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Federal Funds Purchased, Bank Line of Credit, Notes Payable and Debt of ESOP
(Debt)

The fair value of federal funds purchased, bank line of credit borrowings,
notes payable and debt of ESOP (debt) at December 31, 1995 is estimated by
discounting future cash flows at rates currently available for debt with
similar terms and remaining maturities.

Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments

Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit represent the principal
categories of off-balance-sheet financial instruments.  The fair value of
these commitments, based on fees currently charged for similar commitments is
not material.

The estimated fair values of  financial instruments are as follows at
December 31, 1995:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of United Bancorp:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Bancorp
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of United Bancorp's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Bancorp
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for income taxes and investment securities in 1993.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS:

To our Shareholders and  Friends:

It is always a pleasure to report the results of actions that were favorable.
1995 proved to be an almost exact opposite of 1994, with interest rates closing
at a 3-year low. As a result our decision to restructure our investment
portfolio during 1994 was correct, allowing the Bank to lock into higher yields
and increased earnings for 1995. United Bancorp reported net income of
$1,143,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995, a substantial increase over
the $587,000 net earnings in 1994. On a per share basis, earnings for 1995
averaged $2.70 compared to $1.39 for the previous year. Cash dividends declared
per share in 1996, payable to Shareholders of Record on February 29, 1996,
were $.44, compared to $.42 paid in 1995. Our capital position continues to
remain strong and exceeds the 6 percent regulatory requirements. Tier 1 capital
to total risk weighted assets (leverage ratio) was 18.6 percent compared to
15.9 percent for last year. Average assets have increased from $76 million in
1991 to $98 million in 1995 totally supported by internally generated capital.
United Bancorp's book value per share (shareholder's equity) has grown from
$18.27 in 1991 to $26.02 in 1995, a 42 percent increase in shareholder value.

By year-end 1995, loans had increased to $39.9 million, up 18.4 percent over
year-end 1994, primarily due to expanded activity in small business and
agricultural lending. The allowance for loan losses at year end 1995, was at
$476,000 or  1.20 percent of loans, compared to 1.43 percent for year-end 1994.
Loan quality continues to be good. Non-performing loans totaled only $178,604
at December 31, 1995, compared to $416,896 last year.

The investment portfolio is our largest asset at $46.7 million at year-end.  
This portfolio is well-diversified and has good asset quality.  Last year we
sold bonds purchased during the low interest rate cycle and replaced them with
higher yielding bonds. As a result, our security portfolio book yield to
maturity at December 31, 1995 was 8.6 percent, well in excess of industry
norms. This compares to a book yield of 7.0 percent last year.

The low interest rates during 1995 had an impact on our deposits which were
down $4.2 million. However, we continue to meet our customer's needs by
offering higher yielding mutual funds and annuities through our non-bank
subsidiary, Douglas National Bank Insurance Agency. This company continues to
expand and provide alternative investment choices for our bank customers.

There are two important measures for shareholders to use when determining bank
performance. The first is reviewing net interest income and non-interest
income.  These two numbers, when added together, indicate a bank's sales volume
and provide a good analysis of how the bank's revenue stream is progressing.
The company has shown steady net revenue increases going from $5.0 million in
1991 to $5.7 million in 1995. The second important measure of a bank's
performance is its net interest margin. This measures profitability and the
success of the bank's business of banking.  That is, collecting deposits and
lending these dollars to customers. Douglas National Bank's net interest margin
in 1995 was 5.20 percent, compared to 5.41 percent in 1991. On a historical
basis, revenue and net interest income has remained strong for the past five
years which is essential in maintaining long-term profitability.




                                    -13.1.28-
<PAGE> 13.1.29

The company's non-interest expenses were down 12.0 percent in 1995 to a total
of $4.1 million, a $558,000 decrease. This represents an annualized ratio of
non-interest expense to total revenue of 50.0 percent, compared to 62.1 percent
a year ago. While substantially improved, this ratio continues to be higher
than industry norms and higher than we would like it to be. We are working to
continue to reduce non-essential expenses. We have emphasized that every
employee should think about the way we work in order to develop more efficient
and cost-effective methods of running our operations and servicing our
customers.

Following our theme of "Banking One on One" we continue to work on
strengthening the service and products we offer. Our expanded investment
products provide a diversified selection of investments available to our
customers. The bank's Checkloan personal line of credit allows qualified
customers to borrow money without applying for each loan. Our investment
deposit accounts enable our customers to earn current market rates on their
deposited funds. We also had success in 1995 with an inflation fighter
"Step Up" certificate of deposit, which helped offset some disintermediation
into mutual funds. And the highly successful Prime Timers program, for the
mature market, offers many benefits and group activities.  A recent U.S. Small
Business Administration study found that Douglas National Bank ranked 3rd in
the State of Oregon among banks in lending to small businesses.  Douglas
National Bank makes a high percentage of small business loans in Douglas County
and we are proud to earn the distinction as the most user-friendly business
bank in Douglas County.  In addition, the bank earned high rankings on two
mystery customer service surveys conducted in 1995.

To emphasize our commitment to service we introduced the "Best of the Best"
award. It is given quarterly to outstanding employees who best exemplify the
high level of quality service and professional standards of the bank. From the
select group of winners, we chose Meddie Kinder to receive the annual award.
We congratulate Meddie for her excellent performance.

We continue to take pride in the substantial investment of time and money we
make in the communities we serve. The Roseburg Chamber of Commerce recognized
Douglas National Bank for our commitment to community service and support of
many organizations. Eleven years ago we established the George Gratke
Community Service Award to encourage a high level of employee involvement in
community service. We are pleased to present this award for 1995 to Henry
"Huck" Zellweger, Prime Timers Manager, for his many contributions to the
senior citizens of Douglas County.

Douglas National Bank has been given the prestigious Blue Ribbon Bank award
again in 1995 by Veribanc, Inc. and is ranked among the highest rated banks
in the United States. We live up to our customers' expectations of safety and
soundness. Our capital ratios are high. Asset quality is sound. Our liquidity
is strong. We have all the components of a very successful bank.

In February, 1995, Bill Roberts, the bank's Credit Administrator for the past
15 years, left the field of banking. Bill served our company with dedication
and integrity. We thank him for the many contributions he made and wish him
continued success in all his future endeavors. Replacing Bill as Credit
Administrator is Don McDonel. He has many years of extensive community bank
experience and uses sound fundamental credit principles in managing the loan
functions of the bank.


                                    -13.1.29-

In November, 1995, Joseph Taucher retired from the Board of Directors. He
served on the Boards of United Bancorp, Douglas National Bank, U.B.C.
Investment Corporation, and Douglas National Bank Insurance Agency since
joining the Board in 1987. Joe's counsel as a director has been invaluable and
deeply appreciated. The Board of Directors elected Brian Pargeter, President of
Umpqua Insurance Agency, to fill this vacancy. Brian's professional business
background and community involvement will make an important contribution to our
bank.

A message to our shareholders would not be complete without acknowledging the
strong support we receive from our employees, board of directors, and share-
holders. Please continue to refer your friends to us.  Douglas National Bank is
YOUR bank, and we want to serve all of YOUR financial services needs.

For the Board of Directors,

BANK OF AMERICA OREGON                                 BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENT
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Agreement dated as of March 27, 1995, is between Bank of America Oregon
(the "Bank") and United Bancorp (the "Borrower").

1.   TERM LOAN AMOUNT AND TERMS

1.1  Loan Amount. The Bank agrees to provide a term loan to the Borrower in the
     amount of Two Hundred Twenty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety Two and
     13/100 Dollars ($227,892.13) (the "Commitment").
                                      
1.2  Availability Period. The loan is available in one disbursement from the
     Bank between the date of this Agreement and June 15, 1995 unless the
     Borrower is in default.

1.3  Interest Rate.

(a)  The interest rate is ninety percent (90%) of the Reference Rate.

(b)  The Reference Rate is the rate of interest publicly announced from time to
     time by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association ("BofA
     California") in San Francisco, California, as its Reference Rate. The
     Reference Rate is set based on various factors, including BofA
     California's costs and desired return, general economic conditions and
     other factors, and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans.
     The Bank may price loans to its customers at, above, or below the
     Reference Rate. Any change in the Reference Rate shall take effect at the
     opening of business on the days specified in the public announcement of
     a change in the Reference Rate.

1.4  Repayment Terms.

(a)  The Borrower will pay all accrued but unpaid interest on June 15, 1995,
     and then quarterly thereafter and upon payment in full of the principal
     of this loan.

(b)  The Borrower will repay principal in 20 successive equal quarterly
     installments of Eleven Thousand Three Hundred Ninety-Four and 61/100
     Dollars ($11,394.61) starting June 15, 1995. On March 15, 2000, the
     Borrower will repay the remaining principal balance plus any interest
     then due.

(c)  The Borrower may prepay the loan in full or in part at any time. The
     prepayment will be applied to the most remote installment of principal
     due under this Agreement.

2.   FEES AND EXPENSES

2.1  Loan Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay a Five Hundred Dollar ($500) fee due
     upon the execution of this Agreement.

2.2  Expenses. The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank for any expenses it
     incurs in the preparation of this Agreement and any agreement or
     instrument required by this Agreement. Expenses include, but are not
     limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, including any allocated costs of
     the Bank's in-house counsel.
                                    -10.11.1-
<PAGE> 10.1.2
3.   DISBURSEMENTS, PAYMENTS AND COSTS

3.1  Disbursements and Payments. Each disbursement by the Bank and each
     payment by the Borrower will be:

(a)  made at the Bank's branch (or other location) selected by the Bank from
     time to time;

(b)  made for the account of the Bank's branch selected by the Bank from time
     to time;

(c)  made in immediately available funds, or such other type of funds selected
     by the Bank;

(d)  evidenced by records kept by the Bank. In addition, the Bank may, at its
     discretion, require the Borrower to sign one or more promissory notes.

3.2  Banking Days. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, a banking day
     is a day other than a Saturday or a Sunday on which the Bank is open for
     business in Oregon and banks are open for business in California. All
     payments and disbursements which would be due on a day which is not a
     banking day will be due on the next banking day. All payments received on
     a day which is not a banking day will be applied to the credit on the next
     banking day.

3.3  Additional Costs. The Borrower will pay the Bank, on demand, for the
     Bank's costs or losses arising from any statute or regulation, or any
     request or requirement of a regulatory agency. The costs and losses will
     be allocated to the loan in a manner determined by the Bank, using any
     reasonable method. The costs include the following:
                                      
(a)  any reserve or deposit requirements; and

(b)  any capital requirements relating to the Bank's assets and commitments for
     credit.

3.4  Interest Calculation. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, all
     interest and fees, if any, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
     and the actual number of days elapsed. This results in more interest or a
     higher fee than if a 365-day year is used.

3.5  Interest on Late Payments. At the Bank's sole option in each instance, any
     amount not paid when due under this Agreement (including interest) shall
     bear interest from the due date at ninety percent (90%) of the Reference
     Rate. This may result in compounding of interest.

     On October 24, 1995, the Registrant's Board ofDirectors elected Brian
     Pargeter to the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy left when Joe

     President of Umpqua Insurance, Inc. since 1980.
                                      
     Another member of the Registrant's Board of Directors, Donna Woolley, will
     retire in January of 1996, after twenty years of service to the
     Registrant.  David Geddes, a five year Board member, has announced
     that he will resign from the Board of Directors in January 1996 for
     personal reasons.  The Registrant is searching for two new directors to
     fill these vacancies on the Board of Directors.
