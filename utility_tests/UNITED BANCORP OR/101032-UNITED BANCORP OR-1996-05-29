                                  OF
                            UNITED BANCORP

     1.  VOTING SECURITIES.  The number of shares of common stock entitled to
vote at the annual shareholders' meeting called for April 23, 1996, at 7:30
p.m., is 439,761.  Only shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. on February 29,
1996, shall be entitled to vote.  Each share of common stock is entitled to one
vote.

     2.  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.  Pursuant to Article 4 of the corporation's
bylaws, the board of directors has determined that ten (10) directors shall
serve the corporation until the 1997 annual meeting.

     At the special shareholders' meeting held December 28, 1993, the
shareholders adopted Second Restated Articles of Incorporation for United
Bancorp.  Among other things, the Second Restated Articles of Incorporation
provide for staggered terms of the directors.  Article IV of the Second
Restated Articles of Incorporation states that the board of directors shall
be divided into three classes of directors.  At the 1994 annual meeting of
shareholders, the shareholders designated Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3
directors.  The Class 1 directors were elected for one (1) year terms.  The
Class 2 directors were elected for two (2) year terms.  The Class 3 directors
were elected for three (3) year terms.  The terms of the Class 2 directors
expire at the 1996 annual shareholders' meeting.  At the 1996 annual
shareholders' meeting, the Class 2 directors will each be nominated to
serve for a three (3) year term expiring at the 1999 annual meeting of
shareholders.

     The persons immediately below will each be nominated to serve as Class 2
directors for three (3) year terms.

Plan.

                                  -99.1.1-
<PAGE> 99.1.2
In addition to the above Class 2 directors who will be nominated, the
shareholders must vote for the election of two (2) Class 3 directors.  Article
4 of the corporation's bylaws provides that if a vacancy occurs on the board of
directors that the vacancy shall be filled by the board of directors.  Article
4 also provides that the term of a director elected by the board of directors
expires at the next shareholders' meeting at which directors are elected.  
Three vacancies have occurred on the board of directors since the last meeting
of shareholders.  The board of directors has opted to reduce the number of
directors to ten (10) and thereby not fill one vacancy.  The board of directors
have filled two of the vacancies.  The directors elected to fill the vacancies
are Brian Pargeter and Clint Newell.  Terms of Class 3 directors expire at the
1997 annual meeting of shareholders.  In order to comply with Article 4 of the
corporation's bylaws, the two (2) Class 3 directors immediately below will each
be nominated to serve as Class 3 directors until the 1997 annual shareholders'
meeting.  At the 1997 annual shareholders' meeting, the two (2) Class 3
Directors appointed by the board of directors, or their successors, will be
nominated to serve for full three (3) year terms.

Each director will serve until expiration of the director's term.  Subject to
Article VIII of United Bancorp's Second Restated Articles of Incorporation,
other nominations may be made at the meeting.

     It is the intention of the persons named in the Proxy to vote for the
individual directors whose names appear above as Class 2 directors and as Class
3 directors.

     While there is no reason to believe that any of the above nominees for the
office of director will, prior to the date of the meeting, refuse or be unable
to accept nomination, should any person so refuse or become unable to accept,
it is the intention of the persons named in the Proxy to vote for such other
person or persons for the office of director as management may recommend.

     3.  UNITED BANCORP STOCK OPTION PLAN.  The purpose of this plan is to
attract and retain key employees and directors of United Bancorp.  The plan is
intended to encourage capital accumulation and stock ownership by key employees
and outside directors in order to increase the proprietary interest
of such individuals in the success of United Bancorp.

     The executive committee of the board of directors, or its successor, shall
grant options under the plan not to exceed ninety-two thousand (92,000) shares
of which forty-two thousand (42,000) shall be reserved for issuance to United
Bancorp's directors and fifty thousand (50,000) shall be reserved for issuance
to key employees.  Options may be granted as "incentive stock options"
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or they may be granted as "nonqualified stock options" subject to the
discretion of the executive committee.  Outside directors who are not also
employees of the Company are not eligible for incentive stock options.

     Twenty-five percent (25%) of each option granted under the plan shall vest
immediately, with the remaining portion vesting twenty-five percent (25%) for
each succeeding twelve (12) months of continuous service -- except in the case
of directors who shall be credited for prior service.  The purchase price for
shares must be no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value
of the shares on the date the option is granted.  No option granted under the
plan may be exercised after ten (10) years from the date the option is granted,
and no options may be granted after March 31, 2006.  Please refer to the
attached copy of the United Bancorp Stock Option Plan for additional details
including circumstances under which vesting schedules may be accelerated.

     The board of directors recommends that the shareholders approve the United
Bancorp Stock Option Plan.

     4.  ANNUAL REPORT.  The annual report of United Bancorp for the year ended
December 31, 1995 is mailed to shareholders concurrently with this statement.

     5.  RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS.  Upon the recommendation of the audit
committee, the board of directors has appointed Knight, Vale & Gregory, Inc.,
P.S. as independent auditors for the balance of the fiscal year ending December
31, 1996.  The board of directors request ratification by the shareholders.
Knight, Vale & Gregory, Inc., P.S. was selected as the 1996 auditors by the
audit committee based on competitive requests for proposals received by United
Bancorp from four firms including Coopers & Lybrand, the current auditor.

     In the event the resolution is defeated, the adverse vote will be
considered as a direction to the board of directors to select other auditors
for the next fiscal year.  However, because of the difficulty and expense
associated with making any substitution of auditors once selected, it is
contemplated that the appointment for the 1996 fiscal year will be permitted to
stand unless the board of directors finds other reasons for making a change.

     Auditing services for 1995, and a portion of 1996, were performed by
Coopers & Lybrand.  Services performed by Coopers & Lybrand included:  the
examination of annual financial statements, limited reviews of quarterly
financial information, preparation of the consolidated tax returns, and
consultations in connection with various financial reporting, tax and
accounting matters.  Fees for the 1995 audit and audit-related services
aggregated approximately $32,500.

     Ratification of the appointment of Knight, Vale & Gregory, Inc., P.S. as
independent auditors requires an affirmative majority vote of shares voting at
the meeting.
