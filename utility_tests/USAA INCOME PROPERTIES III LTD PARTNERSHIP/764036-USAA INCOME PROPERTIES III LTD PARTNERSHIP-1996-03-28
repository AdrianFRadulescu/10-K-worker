Item 1.  Business
                                                              

         USAA Income Properties III Limited Partnership (the
"Partnership") is a limited partnership formed February 22, 1985,
under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware
to invest in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real
properties such as shopping centers, office buildings, apartments,
industrial buildings and other similar income-producing real
property.  The Partnership has four principal business objectives:
(i) to provide the limited partners with cash distributions which
will not constitute taxable income by reason of Partnership tax
deductions and possibly tax losses which may be used to offset
other taxable income, (ii) to preserve and protect the limited
partners' capital and related buying power, (iii) to obtain long-
term appreciation in the value of the properties, and (iv) to
provide a build-up of equity through the reduction of mortgage
loans on the properties.  Defined terms used herein shall have the
meanings as set forth under the caption "Glossary" contained at
pages 71-74 of the Prospectus, dated May 6, 1985, filed pursuant to
rule 424(b), attached as Exhibit 99.a and incorporated herein by
reference.

             The Partnership sold $55,774,500 in Units of Limited
Partnership Interest (111,549 Units at $500 per Unit) from the
commencement of the offering of Units on or about June 1, 1985,
through the completion of the offering on December 31, 1985. 
Limited Partners are not required to make any additional capital
contributions.

         Proceeds available to the Partnership for investment in
properties were used to acquire the following properties in fiscal
year 1986:  Curlew Crossing (formerly Courtyard Shoppes) Shopping
Center, Parkview Plaza Office Buildings, and Ramada World
Headquarters Office Buildings.  These properties comprise the
complete portfolio of the Partnership.  See "Item 2 Properties."

         Competitive conditions for the Partnership's properties in
1995 were as follows:

         Curlew Crossing Shopping Center is located in Clearwater,
Florida in northern Pinellas County on North U.S. Highway 19.  At
December 31, 1995, Curlew Crossing was 99% leased.  The $11,000,000
mortgage on Curlew Crossing is payable monthly, interest only, with
the principal due March 31, 1996.  The loan is expected to be extended
at a market rate by an affiliate of the General Partner.

         Curlew Crossing will undergo a reconfiguration of the
parking lot on a portion of the property adjacent to Curlew Road. 
This is a result of an additional lane being added to the highway. 
This could affect the amount of parking at the center as well as
the desirability of the outparcel closest to the highway.

<PAGE>
         Curlew Crossing is located in the North Pinellas County
retail market.  This submarket experienced approximately 11,000
square feet of positive absorption during 1995 leaving the
occupancy rate at approximately 91%.  In addition, overall Pinellas
County has approximately 289,000 square feet of leased but
unoccupied space which would effectively decrease the occupancy
rate to 89%. 
         
         The Parkview Plaza Office Buildings are located in the city
of Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles County, California, south of the
city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles International Airport.  The
two buildings on the site are leased to Hughes Aircraft Company, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors.  The buildings are 100%
leased by Hughes Electro-Optical Division.  Although the tenant has
vacated the property, a few subtenants remain.  Hughes has hired a
management company to manage the property.  Hughes continues to
service its lease obligation on a timely basis and is obligated to
do so until the lease expires in August 1996.  Parkview Plaza will
experience a significant decrease in cash flow in 1996 as a result
of the expiration of the Hughes lease and the cash requirement for
tenant improvements and lease commissions needed to re-lease the
property.  Marketing efforts are underway as a leasing team has
been selected.  Later in 1996 as control of the daily operations
are assumed at the property, maintenance rehabilitation efforts
will begin.  Current rental rates in the market surrounding the
property are lower than the rate currently being paid by Hughes. 
This tenant provided approximately $6,679,000 of annual rental
income to the Partnership during 1995 and approximately $6,241,000
during 1994 and 1993 which represents approximately 69% of total
Partnership rental income for 1995, 67% for 1994 and 68% for 1993.

         Parkview Plaza is located in the El Segundo/Manhattan Beach
submarket of the South Bay office market.  Total rentable square
feet in this submarket was approximately 9.3 million square feet
with 1.9 million square feet available as of the end of 1995,
resulting in a vacancy rate of 20%.  The vacancy rate as of the end
of 1994 was approximately 18%.  This submarket has the largest
amount of office space and one of the lowest vacancy rates in the
South Bay market.  The El Segundo/Manhattan Beach submarket is
attractive due to its close proximity to LAX airport.
    
         Ramada World Headquarters Buildings are located in central
Phoenix, Arizona, approximately one mile north of Sky Harbor
International Airport, and four miles east of the downtown business
and financial center.  This property is comprised of a complex of
three office buildings and was 100% leased by Ramada Executive
Corporation with a remaining two year term expiring in 1997. 
Ramada vacated the property in 1992 and continued to meet its rent
obligations.  On March 30, 1995, a twelve-year lease was signed
with Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc. ("HFS"), the major
subtenant at this property, for the ten-story building which
contains approximately 100,000 square feet.  Upon execution of the
lease, HFS contributed $3 million to be used toward the cost of
improvements to the property.  Ramada was released from further
obligations on the property.  The total cost of improvements, lease
commissions and other renovations will be approximately $5 million. 


<PAGE>
The Partnership shall pay approximately $2 million of these costs
to be funded from the working capital reserve.  The construction
process is currently underway.  Improvements will include interior
and exterior refurbishment as well as elevator replacement.  Until
the improvements to the property are substantially complete
(estimated to be August 1996), the basic rent due from HFS will be
at a reduced rate; however, HFS will pay all operating expenses
during this period.  Upon substantial completion, the rent will
begin at approximately $14.61 per square foot.  HFS will then pay
its proportionate share of operating expenses which exceed $7.00
per square foot each year.  HFS provided approximately $1,246,000
of rental income to the Partnership during 1995 which represents
approximately 13% of total Partnership rental income for 1995.
The remaining two buildings are currently being marketed in their 
existing condition.  Management is evaluating the possibility of
renovating these two buildings in order to more successfully market
them for lease.

         In the 44th Street Corridor where Ramada is located, year-
to-date 1995 absorption was a positive 72,742 square feet compared
to 69,642 square feet for 1994.  Total inventory in this submarket
was approximately 1.3 million square feet with approximately
134,000 square feet available which equated to a 90% occupancy rate
as of the end of 1995 compared to 82% for 1994.
         
         See "Item 2 Properties" for information pertaining to the
status of the Partnership's properties.

         The Partnership has no employees; it has, however, entered
into an Advisory Agreement with USAA Real Estate Company
("Adviser"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital
Corporation, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Services
Automobile Association ("USAA").  The Adviser is responsible for
managing the day-to-day operations of the Partnership.

         The General Partner ("General Partner") of the Partnership
is USAA Properties III, Inc., a Texas corporation and a subsidiary
of the Adviser.  The General Partner has the general responsibility
for management of the Partnership's business and oversees the
activities of the Adviser.

                           PART II


Item 5.  Market for the Registrant's Limited Partnership Units and
         Related Security Holder Matters

         There is no established public trading market for the
Limited Partnership Units ("the Units"), and it is not anticipated
that a public market will develop.  Upon request, Real Estate
Limited Partnership Investor Services, a department in USAA Real
Estate Company, may assist a Limited Partner desiring to transfer
his Units.  The purchase price for the Units upon resale and all
other terms of a resale transaction are subject to negotiation
between the buyer and the seller.  The limited market for the Units
may adversely affect the value of the Units.  

         As of December 31, 1995, there were 7,738 Limited Partners
of the Partnership, owning an aggregate of 111,549 Units.

         During the year ended December 31, 1995, quarterly
distributions totaling $1,673,236 and $16,902 were distributed to
the Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively, for a total
of $1,690,138 in cash distributions.

         During the year ended December 31, 1994, quarterly
distributions totaling $1,673,236 and $16,901 were distributed to
the Limited Partners and General Partner, respectively, for a total
of $1,690,137 in cash distributions.

             Future cash distributions to Limited Partners are
anticipated.  Due to cash flow requirements in 1996 to re-lease
Parkview Plaza and Ramada, distributions are anticipated to be
reduced in 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31, 1995, the Partnership had cash of $573,020 and
temporary investments of $12,202,023.  Included in the
Partnership's cash and cash equivalents was the working capital
reserve and funds held for current obligations of the Partnership. 
Accounts receivable consisted primarily of tenant receivables. 
Deferred charges and other assets included deferred rent resulting
from recognition of income as required by generally accepted
accounting principles, lease commissions and a land lease
receivable.  Accounts payable included amounts due to affiliates
for reimbursable expenses and management fees, and amounts due to
third parties for expenses incurred for operations.  Accrued
expenses and other liabilities consisted primarily of prepaid rent,
accrued property taxes, security deposits and a deposit held as a
contribution toward tenant improvement costs.

Parkview Plaza in Manhattan Beach, California is 100% leased to
Hughes Aircraft Company until August 1996.  Hughes vacated the
buildings in 1993 with a few subtenants remaining.  Hughes
continues to service its lease obligation on a timely basis and is
obligated to do so until the lease expires.  The Partnership will
experience a significant decrease in cash flow in 1996 as a result
of the expiration of the Hughes lease.  In addition, funds will be
required for tenant improvements and lease commissions as the
buildings are re-leased.  It is anticipated that these expenditures
will be funded from the Partnership's working capital reserve.
Marketing efforts are underway as a leasing team has been selected. 
Later in 1996 as control of the daily operations are assumed at the
property, maintenance rehabilitation efforts will begin.  Current
rental rates in the market surrounding the property are lower than
the rate currently being paid by Hughes.

The Parkview Plaza mortgage loan matures on August 31, 1996.  Prior
to loan maturity, management plans to pursue alternative financing
with third-party lenders; however, if third-party financing is not
obtained, it is anticipated that the loan will be refinanced by an
affiliate of the General Partner.

On March 30, 1995, a twelve-year lease was signed with Hospitality
Franchise Systems, Inc. ("HFS"), the major subtenant at the Ramada
property in Phoenix, Arizona, for the ten-story building which
contains approximately 100,000 square feet comprising 70% of the
net leaseable space at the property.  Upon execution of the lease,
HFS contributed $3 million to be used toward the cost of
improvements to the property.  Ramada was released from further
obligations on the property.  The total cost of improvements, lease
commissions, and other renovations will be approximately $5
million.  The Partnership shall pay approximately $2 million of
these costs to be funded from the working capital reserve.  The 

<PAGE>
construction process is currently underway.  Improvements will
include interior and exterior refurbishment as well as elevator
replacement.  Until the improvements to the property are
substantially complete (estimated to be August 1996), the basic
rent due from HFS will be at a reduced rate; however, HFS will pay
all operating expenses during this period.  Upon substantial
completion, the rent will begin at approximately $14.61 per square
foot.  HFS will then pay its proportionate share of operating
expenses which exceed $7.00 per square foot each year.  The
remaining two buildings are currently being marketed in their
existing condition.  Management is evaluating the possibility of
renovating these two buildings in order to more successfully market
them for lease.

The $11,000,000 mortgage on Curlew Crossing is due March 31, 1996. 
The loan is expected to be extended at a market rate by an
affiliate of the General Partner.  In accordance with the Florida
Department of Transportation, Curlew Crossing will undergo a
reconfiguration of the parking lot on a portion of the property
adjacent to Curlew Road.  This is a result of an additional lane
being added to the highway.  This could affect the amount of
parking at the center as well as the desirability of the outparcel
closest to the highway.

Total cash distributions to Partners for the year ended December
31, 1995 remained consistent with distributions for the year ended 
December 31, 1994.  Due to the expiration of the Hughes lease in
August 1996 and the lease transaction with HFS, tenant improvements
and lease commissions will be required at both Parkview Plaza and
Ramada, and will be funded from the Partnership's working capital 
reserve.  Based on current projections, distributions to Partners 
are anticipated to be reduced in 1996.

Future liquidity is expected to result from cash generated from
operations of the properties, interest on temporary investments and
ultimately through the sale of the properties. 


Results of Operations

For the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, income was
generated from rental income from the income-producing real estate
properties and interest income earned on the funds in temporary
investments.

Expenses incurred during the same period were associated with the
operation of the Partnership's properties, interest on the
mortgages payable and various other costs required for
administration of the Partnership.

During 1995, 1994 and 1993, lease agreements between the
Partnership and tenants at two properties were absolute triple net
leases.  Under an absolute triple net lease, the lessee is required
to make all payments for expenses related to the use and occupation
of the leased premises, including real estate taxes and
assessments, property and liability insurance, repairs and 

<PAGE>
maintenance, utilities and other operating costs associated with
the property.  Accordingly, the Partnership receives rental income
and the lessee absorbs all such expenses.

Rental income increased for the year ended December 31, 1995 as
compared to December 31, 1994 due to the write-down of a deferred
rent receivable on Parkview Plaza in 1993.  Rental income is
recognized under the operating method, whereby aggregate rentals
are reported on a straight-line basis as income over the life of
the lease.  The deferred rent receivable remaining after the
original maturity date of the mortgage loan (March 31, 1995) was
written off in 1993; therefore, income recognized after March 31,
1995 was actual rent received.  Rental income increased during 1994
as a result of an increase in occupancy at Curlew Crossing.  The
remaining  vacancy at the center was filled during 1993, bringing 
the occupancy at Curlew Crossing to 100% by December 31, 1994.  

The write-down on Parkview Plaza in 1994 caused the decrease in
depreciation as of December 31, 1995.  Depreciation decreased for
the year ended December 31, 1994 as compared to December 31, 1993
as a result of the September 1993 investment property write-down on
Parkview Plaza.  Other direct expenses were higher for 1995 as
compared to 1994.  Contributing to this increase was an increase in
property insurance expense at Parkview Plaza and an increase in bad 
debt expense at Curlew Crossing.  Property tax expense was also
higher at Curlew Crossing due to a credit in 1994 resulting from a
tax protest.  Other direct expenses were lower for the year ended
December 31, 1994 as compared to December 31, 1993.  Expenses in
1993 included the write-down of Parkview Plaza deferred rent. 
Investment property write-downs were recognized on Parkview Plaza
in 1994 and 1993.

An increase in interest rates and a higher cash reserve accounted
for the increase in interest income for the years ended December
31, 1995 and 1994.

General and administrative expenses decreased in 1995 as compared
to 1994 due to a decrease in printing charges and legal fees. 
General and administrative expenses were higher in 1994 as compared
to 1993 primarily as a result of legal fees related to negotiations
with the third-party lender on the Parkview Plaza mortgage.  The
management fee is based on cash flow from operations of the
Partnership adjusted for cash reserves and fluctuated accordingly.

The decrease in interest expense for 1995 as compared to 1994 
reflected a decrease in the interest rate charged on the Parkview
Plaza mortgage loan attributable to the loan modifications in 1994
and a decrease in the loan balance from forgiveness of debt and
principal payments.  Slightly offsetting this decrease was an
increase in interest paid on the Curlew Crossing mortgage.  The
Curlew Crossing mortgage is based on the prime rate and the changes
in expense for this mortgage were a result of changes in the prime
rate.  Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31,
1994 due to a decrease in the interest rate charged on the Parkview
mortgage loan attributable to the loan modifications and a decrease
in the loan balance in October 1994, offset slightly by an increase 
in interest paid on the Curlew Crossing mortgage.  

<PAGE>
Inflation


An increase in inflation could affect the Partnership's investments
through increases in the costs of operating and maintaining the
properties and in various administrative costs of Partnership
operations.  The adverse effect inflation may have on operating
expenses would be offset to some extent by increases in rental
rates charged tenants at the Partnership's properties.  If high
occupancy levels are maintained at the properties, increases in
rental income should offset increasing property operating expenses 
with minimal effect on operating income.

          USAA INCOME PROPERTIES III LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993


1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other

  USAA Income Properties III Limited Partnership is engaged
  solely in the business of real estate investment; therefore,
  presentation of information about industry segments is not
  applicable.

  The Partnership owns a shopping center in Clearwater, Florida
  and office buildings in Phoenix, Arizona and Manhattan Beach,
  California.  The Partnership's revenue is subject to changes
  in the economic environments of these areas.

  The General Partner, USAA Properties III, Inc., is a wholly-
  owned subsidiary of USAA Real Estate Company (Realco), which
  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of USAA Capital Corporation,
  which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Services
  Automobile Association (USAA).

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles requires management
  to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
  amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
  contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
  financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
  expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual results could
  differ from those estimates.

  Rental properties are valued at cost.  The carrying amount of
  a property is not changed for temporary fluctuations in value
  unless the carrying value is believed to be permanently
  impaired.  In 1995, the Partnership adopted the provisions of
  Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
  "Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-
  lived Assets to be Disposed of," (Statement 121).  Statement
  121 provides guidance for determining impairment of long-
  lived assets utilizing undiscounted future cash flows.  Based
  on the provisions of Statement 121, the Partnership's long-
  lived assets, real estate and improvements, are not
  considered impaired.  The adoption of this Statement had no
  financial statement impact.
  
  Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of
  the properties using the straight-line method.  The estimated
  useful lives of the buildings and improvements are 30 years
  (19 - 39 years for Federal income tax purposes).

  Rental income is recognized under the operating method,
  whereby aggregate rentals are reported on a straight-line
  basis as income over the life of the lease.  Rental income

<PAGE>
  recognized was $874,036 more, $399,737 and $327,743 less than
  the amount due per the lease agreements for the years ended
  December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
 
  Deferred charges consist primarily of deferred rent resulting
  from recognition of income as required by generally accepted
  accounting principles.

  A land lease receivable, arising from the sale of
  improvements at a rental property, is being accounted for in
  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
  whereby the carrying amount of the receivable is reduced by a
  portion of the payment received on the ground lease.  

  No provision or credit for income taxes has been made as the
  liability for such taxes is that of the Partners rather than
  the Partnership.  The Partnership files its tax return on an
  accrual basis.

  For the purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, all highly
  liquid marketable securities that have a maturity at purchase
  of three months or less, and money market mutual funds are
  considered to be cash equivalents.  

  For financial reporting purposes, net income (loss) is
  allocated 1% to the General Partner and 99% to the Limited
  Partners.  Net income (loss) per limited partnership unit is
  based upon the limited partnership units outstanding at the
  end of each year and the net income (loss) allocated to the
  Limited Partners.

  Cash distributions per limited partnership unit were $15.00
  for 1995 and 1994 and $19.80 for 1993, and were based on the
  limited partnership units outstanding at each quarter end and
  the cash distributions allocated to Limited Partners.


2. Partnership Agreement

  Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, all
  Distributable Cash shall be distributed in the ratio of 1% to
  the General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners within 60
  days after the close of each fiscal quarter.

  Generally, net taxable income or losses not arising from the
  sale or refinancing of properties of the Partnership and
  Distributable Cash are allocated 99% to the Limited Partners
  and 1% to the General Partner.  Cash Distributions from the
  sale or refinancing of property are allocated first to the
  Limited Partners until the Limited Partners shall receive an
  amount equal to their adjusted capital contributions; second,
  to the Limited Partners until the Limited Partners shall
  receive a cumulative amount from cash distributions from
  operations, sales or refinancings equal to 6% per annum of
  their adjusted capital contributions; third, to all Partners,


<PAGE>
  in an amount equal to their respective positive capital
  account balances to the extent such balances exceed the
  amounts provided for in the Partnership Agreement; and
  fourth, the balance, 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to
  the General Partner.

  Generally, all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
  credit from operations will be allocated 99% to the Limited
  Partners and 1% to the General Partner.  Net gain or net loss
  from the sale or other disposition of a property shall be
  allocated as described in the Partnership Agreement.


3. Rental Properties

  Rental properties at December 31 consisted of the following:

                                        1995         1994

     Buildings and improvements      $52,405,717   52,470,797
     Land                              8,961,025    8,961,025
                                      61,366,742   61,431,822
     Less accumulated depreciation   (22,240,995) (20,821,518)
                                     $39,125,747   40,610,304

4. Provision for Investment Property Write-Down
         
  On October 31, 1994, after lengthy negotiations with the
  third-party lender, the $40,800,000 non-recourse loan was
  purchased from the lender for $20,000,000 by Las Colinas Management
  Company (LCMC), an affiliate of the General Partner. 
  Effective with the loan acquisition, LCMC modified the terms
  of the loan to the Partnership whereby $20,800,000 of the
  loan balance was forgiven, resulting in a loan principal
  balance of $20,000,000.  The Partnership recognized an
  extraordinary income item for the gain on debt forgiveness in
  the amount of $20,800,000.  Other modifications in loan terms
  included extension of the loan maturity date from March 15,
  1995 to August 31, 1996, the date of expiration of the
  single-tenant lease at Parkview Plaza.  Payment terms were
  revised from semi-annual payments of interest-only to monthly
  payments including principal of approximately $227,000 plus
  interest at a floating rate based on the London Interbank
  Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus .625%.  On October 31, 1994, the
  Partnership reimbursed LCMC for fees paid to the third-party
  lender, legal fees and filing fees of approximately $693,000,
  in addition to accrued interest of approximately $309,000 for
  the period from September 16, 1994, the date of the previous
  semi-annual interest payment, to October 31, 1994.

  Under generally accepted accounting principles, a review of
  an asset's value is required when events indicate that the
  carrying amount of the asset may not be  recoverable.
  Acquisition of the loan by an affiliate of the General
  Partner at a $20,800,000 discount resulted in a review of value of


<PAGE>
  the Parkview Plaza property.  Through analysis it was
  determined that a permanent impairment in value had occurred
  on Parkview Plaza.  Accordingly, a provision for investment
  property write-down was recorded at December 31, 1994 for
  $21,164,478, the amount by which the carrying value of the
  asset exceeded $20,000,000, the amount determined to be the
  fair value of the property.   An investment property write-
  down of $9,672,292 was recognized during 1993, in addition to
  a write-down of deferred rent of $827,708 for a total of
  $10,500,000.


5. Minimum Future Rentals

  Operating leases with tenants have remaining terms from eight
  months to 27 years.  Minimum future rentals are cash payments
  to be received under non-cancelable leases over the lease
  terms and do not necessarily represent rental income under
  generally accepted accounting principles.  Rental income
  reported in the Statements of Operations is recognized under
  the operating method, whereby aggregate rentals are reported
  on a straight-line basis as income over the life of the
  lease.  Approximate minimum future rentals are as follows:
    
                   1996         $ 6,877,000         
                   1997           2,903,000     
                   1998           3,010,000
                   1999           3,001,000 
                   2000           3,018,000
                   Thereafter    25,324,000         
                                $44,133,000 


6. Triple Net Leases

  During 1995, 1994 and 1993, lease agreements between the
  Partnership and tenants at two properties were absolute
  triple net lease arrangements whereby the lessee was required to
  make all payments for expenses related to the use and
  occupation of the leased premises including real estate taxes
  and assessments, property and liability insurance, repairs
  and maintenance, utilities and other operating costs
  associated with the property.  Accordingly, net operating
  income for 1995, 1994 and 1993 reflects only rental income
  and excludes all expenses directly related to the operations
  of the properties as payments for such expenses are made
  directly by the respective lessees.



<PAGE>
7. Mortgages Payable

  Mortgages payable to affiliates at December 31 consisted of
  the following:

                                         1995          1994    
    First mortgage note payable, 
    interest at the lesser of 12%,
    or prime plus 2%, due March 31,
    1996, interest only payable
    monthly; secured by rental property 
    with a depreciated cost of approxi-
    mately $7,960,000.               $11,000,000    11,000,000   
          
    First mortgage note payable,
    due August 31, 1996, monthly 
    principal payments of approximately 
    $227,000 plus interest at  
    one-month LIBOR plus .625%; 
    secured by rental property with a 
    depreciated cost of approximately 
    $19,205,000.                      16,818,182    19,545,455  
                                     $27,818,182    30,545,455

        
  Cash payments for interest expense were $2,420,902,
  $5,422,625, and $4,778,808 for 1995, 1994, and 1993,
  respectively.


8. Transactions with Affiliates

  USAA Real Estate Company (the Adviser) may receive property
  acquisition fees of up to 4% of the gross offering proceeds,
  real estate brokerage commissions of up to 1% of the
  aggregate  selling prices of property sold and management
  fees equal to 4% of Cash Receipts from Operations not to
  exceed 9% of adjusted cash flow from the Partnership.

  The Partnership had funds invested in USAA Mutual Fund, Inc.
  and earned interest thereon at market rates.

  An affiliate of the General Partner, Las Colinas Management
  Company, receives monthly payments of principal of
  $227,272.72 plus interest at one-month LIBOR plus .625%.

  Quorum Real Estate Services Corporation (also known as USAA
  Realty Company) an affiliate of the General Partner, provides
  property management and leasing services for the properties
  and may receive fees of up to 6% of the property cash
  receipts for those services.

10. Major Customer Information

  During 1995, the Partnership recorded approximately
  $1,246,000 and $6,679,000 of rental income from two major
  tenants which represented approximately 13% and 69%
  respectively, of total rental income for 1995.

  During 1994 and 1993, the Partnership recorded approximately
  $1,652,000 and $6,241,000 of rental income from two major
  tenants which represented approximately 18% and 67%
  respectively, of total rental income for 1994 and 18% and 68%
  respectively, for 1993.


11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The carrying amount of the land lease receivable approximates
  fair value because of its terms.

  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates
  fair value because of the short maturities of these
  instruments.

  The current fair value of the mortgages payable at December
  31, 1995 and 1994 was approximately $27,395,000 and
  $30,545,000, respectively, estimated by discounting the
  future cash flows using interest rates currently being
  offered for mortgage loans with similar characteristics and
  maturities.

<PAGE>
12. Commitment

  On March 30, 1995 a twelve-year lease was signed with
  Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc. ("HFS"), the major
  subtenant at the Ramada property, for the ten-story building
  which contains approximately 100,000 square feet.  Upon
  execution of this lease, HFS contributed $3 million to be
  used toward the cost of improvements to the property.  The
  total cost of improvements, lease commissions and other
  renovations will be approximately $5 million.  The
  Partnership shall pay approximately $2 million of these costs
  to be funded from the working capital reserve.

the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position

                           GLOSSARY


     The following terms are defined in Article III of the
Partnership Agreement, and such definitions, as a matter of law,
will govern all relations between the Limited Partners and the
Partnership.  However, to aid investors in more clearly
understanding the way such terms are used in the Partnership
Agreement and in this Prospectus, certain additional and somewhat
less technical definitions are set forth below:

     "Acquisition Expenses" means all expenses (other than
Acquisition Fees) related to the selection and acquisition of
properties, whether or not acquired, including but not limited to
legal fees and expenses, travel and communications expenses,
costs of appraisals, non-refundable option payments on property
not acquired, accounting fees and expenses, title insurance and
miscellaneous expenses.

     "Acquisition Fees" means the total of all fees and
commissions paid by any party in connection with the purchase or
development of a property by the Partnership.  Included in the
computation of such fees or commissions shall be any real estate
commission, selection fee, development fee, non-recurring
management fee, or any fee of a similar nature, however
designated, except that Acquisition Fees shall not include
development fees paid to non-affiliated parties in connection
with actual development of a property after the acquisition
thereof by the Partnership.  As used in the preceding sentence,
the term "development fees" shall mean fees paid for the
packaging of the Partnership's properties, including negotiating
and approving plans, and undertaking to assist in obtaining
necessary variances and financing for a specific property, either
initially or at a later date.

     "Adjusted Capital Contributions" means, for each fiscal
quarter, an amount equal to the Limited Partners' Capital
Contributions as reduced by all distributions of Sale or
Refinancing Proceeds made to the Limited Partners, including any
such distributions for such fiscal quarter, except for any
distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds required to
compensate for a deficiency in the amount of Distributable Cash
distributed to the Limited Partners pursuant to Section 6.3(ii)
of the Partnership Agreement (but not reduced by any
distributions of Distributable Cash).   

     "Adjusted Cash Flow" means, with respect to any fiscal
period, all Gross Revenues less payments for Operating Cash
Expenses (other than the Management Fee payable to the Adviser
and expenses payable out of the Capital Contributions of the
Partners or other sources not included in determining Gross
Revenues), debt service on Partnership indebtedness, capital
expenditures with respect to properties and any amounts set aside
for restoration or creation of Reserves.

<PAGE>
     "Capital Account" means, with respect to each Partner, the
account established for each Partner which will initially equal
the Capital Contribution of such Partner and throughout the
existence of the Partnership will be (a) increased by the amount
of Taxable Income and tax exempt income allocated to such Partner
and (b) reduced by the amount of Tax Losses and other deductions
allocated to such Partner and the amount of Distributable Cash
and Sale or Refinancing Proceeds distributed to such Partner.

     "Capital Contribution" means the total amount of money
contributed to the Partnership (prior to the deduction of any
selling commissions or expenses) by any Partner or all the
Partners reduced, in the case of the Limited Partners, by any
return of uninvested funds pursuant to Section 5.3A of the
Partnership Agreement (but not reduced by any reductions in the
related Capital Account or by any tax basis adjustments).

     "Cash Receipts from Operations" means, with respect to any
fiscal period, all cash receipts (after deduction of all
applicable sales, use, excise and similar taxes, if any) from
operation of the properties in the ordinary course of business,
without deduction for depreciation or the Management Fee payable
to the Adviser or any other expenses of the Partnership.  In the
event the Partnership enters into any general partnership or
other joint venture, Cash Receipts from Operations shall include
the Partnership's pro rata share of all cash receipts from
operations in the ordinary course of business of such general
partnership or other joint venture without deduction for
depreciation or any other expenses of such general partnership or
other joint venture.

     "Competitive Brokerage Commission" means a real estate
brokerage commission paid for the purchase or sale of a property
which is reasonable, customary and competitive in light of the
size, type and location of the property.

     "Distributable Cash" means, with respect to any fiscal
period, Adjusted Cash Flow and any portion of Reserves deemed by
the General Partner not to be required for the Partnership's
operations (to the extent such Reserves are derived from
operations), reduced by an amount equal to the Management Fee.

     "Front-End Fees" means fees and expenses paid by any Person
for any services rendered during the Partnership's organization
or acquisition phase, including Organization and Offering
Expenses, Acquisition Fees, Acquisition Expenses and any other
similar fees.

     "General Partner" means USAA Properties III, Inc., a Texas
corporation.

     "Gross Revenues" means all cash receipts (after deduction of
all applicable sales, use, excise and similar taxes, if any) of
the Partnership, without deduction for any item of expense, but
excluding all Capital Contributions and cash receipts
constituting Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (subject to Section
7.4F of the Partnership Agreement).

<PAGE>
     "Investment in Properties" means the amount of Capital
Contributions actually paid or allocated to the purchase,
development, construction or improvement of properties acquired
by the Partnership (including the purchase of properties, working
capital reserves allocable thereto (except that reserves in
excess of 4% of the gross proceeds of the offering of the Units
shall not be included) and other cash payments such as interest
and taxes, but excluding Front-End Fees).

     "Management Fee" means the fee payable to the Adviser in an
amount equal to 4% of the Cash Receipts from Operations, but not

     "Operating Cash Expenses" means, with respect to any fiscal
period, except to the extent paid with cash withdrawn from
reserves therefor, the amount of cash disbursed in such period in
order to generate Gross Revenues during such period, including

statistical or bookkeeping services, computing or accounting
equipment use, travel and telephone expenses).

expense allowance payable to USAA Investment Management to cover

offering and sale of the Units.

which shall be maintained in amounts deemed sufficient by the
General Partner for working capital and to pay taxes, insurance,
debt service, repairs, replacements or renewals, or other costs
or expenses, incident to the ownership or operation of the
Partnership's properties.

<PAGE>
     "Sale or Refinancing" means any Partnership transaction
(other than the receipt of Capital Contributions) not in the
ordinary course of its business, including, without limitation,
sales, exchanges or other dispositions of real or personal
property, condemnations, recoveries of damage awards and
insurance proceeds (other than business or rental interruption
insurance proceeds) not reinvested in the repair or
reconstruction of properties or any mortgage refinancings or
borrowings in addition to borrowings initially made to finance
the purchase of properties, but excluding: (i) the disposition of
a property by transfer back to the seller or an affiliate
thereof, whether in the form of a rescission, exchange or resale
or pursuant to an option or other similar arrangement entered
into at or prior to the time of taking title to the property, if
the proceeds from such transfer back are reinvested in another
property and (ii) the disposition of a property within two years
after termination of the offering of the Units contemplated by
Section 4.3 of the Partnership Agreement if the proceeds of such
disposition are reinvested in other properties as permitted by
Section 7.4F of the Partnership Agreement.

     "Sale or Refinancing Proceeds" means all cash receipts (plus
any Reserves previously established from Capital Contributions
with respect to the property which is the subject of the Sale or
Refinancing deemed by the General Partner no longer to be
required for the Partnership's operations because of such Sale or
Refinancing) arising from a Sale or Refinancing less the
following:

          (i) the amount of cash necessary for the payment of all
     debts and obligations of the Partnership (including non-
     recourse debts) related to the particular Sale or
     Refinancing, excluding the real estate brokerage commission
     payable to the Adviser under Section 7.3A(iv) of the
     Partnership Agreement but including any other real estate
     brokerage commission not payable to an affiliate of the
     General Partner;

          (ii) the amount of cash paid or to be paid by the
     Partnership in connection with such Sale or Refinancing
     (which shall include, with regard to damage recoveries or
     insurance or condemnation proceeds, cash paid or to be paid
     in connection with repairs, replacements or renewals, in the
     discretion of the General Partner, relating to damage to or
     partial condemnation of the affected property);

          (iii) the amount of cash considered appropriate by the

owns a particular property) as determined for Federal income tax
purposes, as well as, where the context requires, related Federal
tax items such as capital gain or loss and depreciation recapture

                                           described above. (2)


(1)  The Partnership is required by law to commit not less than a
     specified percentage of the gross proceeds of this offering to
     Investment in Properties.  The percentage required to be
     committed to Investment in Properties must be at least equal
     to the greater of (a) 80% of the gross proceeds of the
     offering reduced by .1625% for each 1% of indebtedness
     encumbering the Partnership's properties (the percent of
     indebtedness encumbering Partnership properties is calculated
     by dividing the aggregate indebtedness encumbering Partnership
     properties by the aggregate purchase price of such properties)
     or (b) 67% of the gross proceeds of the offering.  As an
     example to illustrate the foregoing limitation, assume that
     the Partnership acquires properties subject to aggregate
     indebtedness (including, in the case of an acquisition of
     property by a general partnership or other joint venture, all
     the indebtedness to which such property is subject) equal to
     60% of their purchase prices.  The minimum percentage of gross
     proceeds of the offering required to be committed to
     Investment in Properties in such a case would be 70.25%,
     computed as follows:  80% - (60% x .1625) = 70.25%.  As
     indicated under the "Estimated Use of Proceeds" table
     appearing above, however, it is anticipated that the
     Partnership's Investment in Properties will be well in excess
     of the amount required under these rules.

(2)  The actual amount for this item is not now determinable
     because it depends upon the actual results of operations of
     the Partnership.

(3)  Cash Receipts from Operations consists of all cash receipts
     from operations of the Partnership's properties in the
     ordinary course of business (and such receipts of general
     partnerships or other joint ventures in which the Partnership
     has invested) without deduction for depreciation, the
     Management Fee, or any other expenses.  Adjusted Cash Flow
     consists of Gross Revenues (essentially all Partnership
     revenues) less all Operating Cash Expenses, including any
     adjustments to Reserves, other than the Management Fee. 
     Distributable Cash consists of Adjusted Cash Flow less the
     Management Fee.  See the Glossary.

<PAGE>
     It is anticipated that the Partnership's properties will be
managed by unaffiliated management firms.  The Adviser presently
manages properties for USAA but neither it nor its affiliates
provide property management services for properties owned by an
Prior USAA Partnership. The Partnership Agreement permits the
Partnership to obtain property management services from the General
Partner, the Adviser, or another affiliate of the General Partner
and in the event such services are provided the compensation
therefor will be limited to the lesser of the competitive fee for
similar services in the same geographic area or (i) 5% of gross
revenues from each residential property, (ii) 6% of gross revenues
from each industrial and commercial property if leasing and related
services are performed, (iii) 3% of gross revenues from each
industrial and commercial property if no leasing and related
services are performed and (iv) 1% of gross revenues from each
industrial and commercial property leased on a long-term (10 years
or more) net basis (except for a one-time initial leasing fee of 3%
of the gross revenues on each lease payable over the first five
full years of the original term of the lease).  The actual amount
of such compensation is not now determinable.

     The General Partner may elect to obtain insurance brokerage
services from affiliates in connection with obtaining insurance on
the Partnership's properties provided (i) the cost of providing
such services, including the cost of the insurance, is no greater
than the lowest quote obtained from two unaffiliated insurance
agencies and the coverage and terms are likewise comparable and
(ii) the entity providing the services is independently engaged in
the business of providing such services to non-affiliates and
derives at least 75% of its insurance brokerage service gross
revenue from other than affiliates.

     As indicated in the table of compensation and fees appearing
above, the Partnership will provide USAA Investment Management with
a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 2% of the gross
proceeds of the offering to cover expenses incurred in connection
with the formation of the Partnership and the offering and sale of
the Units.  In addition, the General Partner and its affiliates
will be reimbursed by the Partnership for:  (i) the actual cost to
the General Partner or such affiliates of goods and materials used
for or by the Partnership and obtained from entities which are not
affiliated with the General Partner; (ii) salaries and related
salary expenses for certain services which could be performed
directly for the Partnership by independent parties (subject to
limitations set forth in the Partnership Agreement) and (iii) the
cost of Partnership reports and communications to Limited Partners. 
No reimbursement under (ii) or (iii) above shall be permitted for
services for which the General Partner or any of its affiliates
receives a separate fee.  The following items shall also be
excluded from the allowable reimbursement:  (i) Acquisition
Expenses, (ii) the salaries, fringe benefits, travel expenses and
other administrative items incurred or allocated to persons
controlling the General Partner or affiliates and (iii) any
overhead expenses of the General Partner or its affiliates, such as
rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment and other

<PAGE>
administrative items.  The Partnership's annual report to Limited
Partners will include a breakdown of reimbursements made to the
General Partner and its affiliates.  The foregoing reimbursements
for expenses will be made to the General Partner and its affiliates
regardless of whether any distributions are made to the Limited
Partners.



           PROFITS AND LOSSES AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS

DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS

     Distributable Cash will be paid in the ratio of 1% to the
General Partner and 99% to the Limited Partners.  Distributable
Cash is defined in the Partnership Agreement to mean generally the
Partnership's net cash flow, after adjustments for Reserves, and
after payment of all Operating Cash Expenses including the
Management Fee payable to the Adviser.  Thus, the Management Fee
payable to the Adviser will reduce the amount of Distributable Cash
available for distribution to the Partners in any year.  There can
be no assurance that there will be any cash return to the Limited
Partners.  See the Glossary and the definitions in Article III of
the Partnership Agreement.

     Distributable Cash, when available, will be distributed to the
Limited Partners on a quarterly basis.  Distributions will be made
to the persons recognized as holders of the Units on the last day
of the applicable fiscal quarter in proportion to the number of
Units held by them.  To the extent feasible, the quarterly
distributions will be equal in amount for the first three quarters
of each fiscal year, based upon the General Partner's estimate of
Distributable Cash which will be available for the full year. 
Distributions of cash may be from funds included in Reserves to the
extent not needed for operations.

     The share of Distributable Cash payable to the General
Partner, in relation to the share of Distributable Cash payable to
the Limited Partners, is disproportionate to the Partners' relative
cash contributions of capital to the Partnership.


DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SALE OR REFINANCING OF PROPERTIES

     Sale or Refinancing Proceeds, if any, will be paid:  (i)
first, to the Limited Partners in an amount equal to the Limited
Partners' Adjusted Capital Contributions; (ii) second, to the
Limited Partners in an amount equal to the difference between a
cumulative annual cash return of 6% based upon the Limited
Partners' average annual Adjusted Capital Contributions and an
amount equal to all Distributable Cash plus any Sale or Refinancing
Proceeds previously received; and (iii) third, to all the Partners
in an amount equal to their respective positive Capital Account
balances to the extent such balances, if any, exceed the amounts
provided for in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii).  Thereafter,

<PAGE>
subject to the payment of real estate brokerage commissions to the
Adviser equal to the lesser of 1% of the Selling Prices of all
properties sold or 50% of the Competitive Brokerage Commissions on
such properties, any remaining Sale or Refinancing Proceeds will be
distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General
Partner.  The Partnership will be obligated to pay to the Adviser,
out of subsequent distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds,
all or any portion of any real estate brokerage commissions to the
extent that any distribution of any prior Sale or Refinancing
Proceeds shall be insufficient to pay them in full.  Each Limited
Partner's cumulative annual cash return of 6% cited in (ii) above
will be calculated commencing as of the end of the calendar quarter
in which such Limited Partner makes his Capital Contribution.

     Until all properties are liquidated and a final distribution
is made of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds, the cumulative 6% return
discussed above will be offset and reduced by all distributions of
Distributable Cash and Sale or Refinancing Proceeds throughout the
life of the Partnership.  Any distribution of Sale or Refinancing
Proceeds made in order to satisfy such 6% cumulative return
requirement, to the extent it may turn out to be excessive on the
basis of the Partnership's final accounting, will be treated as a
partial return of Limited Partners' Capital Contributions. 
However, the amount returnable as Limited Partners' Capital
Contributions will not be reduced to the extent that prior
distributions of cash from operations should exceed such 6% return.

     It should be noted that the Limited Partners' preferential
right to a return of their Capital Contributions out of Sale or
Refinancing Proceeds will not be affected by any reduction required
to be made in the basis of their Units for tax purposes.  See
"Income Tax Consequences - Tax Basis for the Units."

     The share of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds payable to the
General Partner, in relation to the share of Sale or Refinancing
Proceeds payable to the Limited Partners, is disproportionate to
the Partners' relative cash contributions of capital to the
Partnership.

     If Sale or Refinancing Proceeds are distributed, the date on
which any assignment of Units was made will determine whether such
proceeds will be paid to the assignor or the assignee.  See
"Taxable Income and Tax Losses" below.


TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX LOSSES

     The Partnership's Taxable Income and Tax Losses from current
operations (which are defined in the Partnership Agreement to mean
income and loss as determined for Federal income tax purposes) as
well as any tax-exempt income will be allocated, with respect to
operations for each taxable year, 99% to the Limited Partners and
1% to the General Partner.  These allocations are in proportion to
the shares of Distributable Cash to which the General Partner and
Limited Partners are entitled with respect to each taxable year

<PAGE>
(although the amount of Distributable Cash available in each year
may be different from the amount of Taxable Income and Tax Losses
so allocated).

     Taxable Income, tax-exempt income and Tax Losses from current
operations will be apportioned among Limited Partners based upon a
weighted average which takes account of the number of days that
each Limited Partner was a Limited Partner and the ratio that each
Limited Partner's number of the Units bears to the total number of
Units.

     Taxable Income from a Sale or Refinancing will be allocated
among the Partners in proportion to the amounts of Sale or
Refinancing Proceeds to which they are entitled, after allocating
such Taxable Income to bring all Partners' negative Capital
Accounts to zero.  Tax Losses from a Sale or Refinancing will be
allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General
Partner, after allocating such Tax Losses to bring all Partners'
positive Capital Accounts to zero.  However, in no event will the
General Partner be allocated less than 1% of Taxable Income or Loss
from a Sale or Refinancing.

     Sale or Refinancing Proceeds, if any, arising from the Sale or
Refinancing of a property will be distributed, and all related
Taxable Income or Tax Losses will be allocated, to the persons
recognized as holders of the Units on the date on which the Sale or
Refinancing occurred in proportion to the numbers of Units held by
them.

     Taxable Income, tax-exempt income and Tax Losses from current
operations for any year will be allocated between a transferor and
a transferee of Units based upon the number of days during the year
that each is recognized as a holder of Units, without regard to
whether Partnership operations during the portion of the year that
the transferor or transferee held the Units produced profits or
losses or cash distributions.  For this purpose and for purposes of
allocating Sale or Refinancing Proceeds transfers will be effective
the day after the transfer is approved by the transfer committee of
the General Partner, but in no event later than the last day of the
calendar quarter following receipt of notice of the assignment and
required documentation.

     The share of Taxable Income and Tax Losses allocable to the
General Partner, in relation to the share of Taxable Income and Tax
Losses allocable to the Limited Partners, is disproportionate based
upon their cash contributions of capital to the Partnership.


TAX TREATMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS

     It is expected that the Partnership will report less Taxable
Income during its initial years of operation than it has
Distributable Cash, primarily because of deductions for
depreciation.  As a result, some or all distributions of
Distributable Cash in the Partnership's initial years would be


<PAGE>
treated for tax purposes as a return of capital which is non-
taxable.  No assurances may be given in this regard, however, since
it is possible that Taxable Income may exceed Distributable Cash
even in the early years of operations if the amount of borrowed
money (i.e., leverage) is low, and if no accelerated depreciation
is taken.


PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTING

     In order to carry out provisions of the Partnership Agreement
giving Limited Partners the right to a cumulative return of their
original Capital Contributions before any proceeds from the sale or
refinancing of properties are distributed to the General Partner,
separate records will be kept by the Partnership showing, for each
Partner, his original Capital Contribution and his Adjusted Capital
Contribution.  The Adjusted Capital Contribution of each Partner
will basically represent his original Capital Contribution reduced
by the cumulative amount of all cash distributions made to him of
Sale or Refinancing Proceeds.  (Adjusted Capital Contributions will
not be reduced by reason of any distributions of Distributable
Cash, and will bear no relation to tax basis for the Units.)  See
the Glossary and Articles III and VI of the Partnership Agreement.

     In addition, in order to give effect to the provisions of the
Partnership Agreement governing the treatment of Sale or
Refinancing Proceeds, as summarized above, separate records will
also be kept showing a Capital Account for each Partner. 
Initially, the Capital Account of each Partner will be the amount
of his original Capital Contribution.  The Capital Account of each
Partner will be reduced to the extent of Tax Losses and other
deductions allocated and Distributable Cash distributed to such
Partner, but increased to the extent of Taxable Income and any tax-
exempt income allocated to each Partner.  Reductions of a Limited
Partner's Capital Account in this manner need not affect his
preferential right to a return of his Capital Contribution out of
Sale or Refinancing Proceeds.

     The Partnership will apply to the Internal Revenue Service for
permission to use a fiscal year beginning on November 1 and ending
on October 31 of each year.  If the Service does not authorize the
Partnership to use such a fiscal year, the Partnership will use a
calendar year as its fiscal year.
