                             PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

VICORP Restaurants, Inc., the registrant, together with its subsidiary, is
referred to herein as "VICORP" or the "Company".  The Company was
incorporated in 1959 and is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.

VICORP operates family style restaurants under the names "Bakers Square",
"Village Inn" and "Angel's Diner and Bakery" and franchises restaurants
under the Village Inn name.  At October 31, 1995, VICORP operated 264
restaurants in 14 states, of which, 160 were Bakers Squares, 99 were
Village Inns and five were Angel's.  On that date, there were 106
franchised Village Inn restaurants in 20 states.  The Company has a pie
manufacturing division supporting its restaurants, which operates under the
name VICOM.  VICOM has five production facilities.

Company Operations

During fiscal 1995, the Company closed 46 restaurants.  The closures 
resulted from a plan adopted in 1994 to close and dispose of restaurants with
both declining sales and operating cash flows which are located in areas no
longer considered appropriate for the Company's existing concepts.  Four
additional restaurants are expected to be closed in fiscal 1996 which were
operating at October 31, 1995.  Also in 1995, the Company discontinued
internal warehousing and distribution of grocery products for its
restaurants and closed its bakery facility in Phoenix, Arizona.  The
Company began utilizing an independent distribution company in order to
focus on its core business of producing pies within its VICOM division.

The Company did not open any new restaurants in fiscal 1995, although it
acquired two Village Inn restaurants from franchisees.  While the Company
plans to resume growth of Company-operated restaurants, none are
anticipated in fiscal 1996 as the Company's principal focus in the near-
term is on improving existing operations.

All of the Company's restaurant concepts serve breakfast, lunch and dinner
with a guest check average between $4 and $7.  Village Inn is primarily
known for its breakfast foods while Bakers Square emphasizes lunch and
dinner and features fresh baked pies as signature items, for internal
consumption or for carryout.  The Angel's restaurants exhibit a diner motif
and feature cakes as signature items.  During 1995, the Bakers Square
division lowered its prices by approximately 10% in order to provide better
value and ultimately attract more customers.

Each Company-operated restaurant offers a relatively standard core menu.
The standard menus are supplemented with daily and monthly specials.  Daily
specials are chosen at the discretion of the restaurant managers to provide
specific locality appeal.

Store management typically consists of a general manager and two
associate/assistant managers.  This management team has primary
responsibility for the efficient and profitable operation of their
restaurant and are provided incentives to do so.  Additionally, the Company
employs area directors, who work closely with the restaurant general
managers in helping them meet the Company's objectives.  Each area director
reports to a Vice President of Operations.

The Company believes the principal measure of success for its restaurants
is the ability to provide each customer with a satisfying experience.
Hiring and retaining the right people, making certain that employees are
adequately trained to do their jobs, clearly communicating the specific
results expected from each employee and providing relevant feedback of
performance are central factors in ensuring customer satisfaction.
Training programs are designed to meet these objectives and focus on
outcome-based training, emphasizing the acquisition of basic skills and
behavior that result in desired performance for specific positions.

Cost effective procurement of quality products is also critical to
providing a satisfying customer experience. The Company makes centralized
purchasing decisions for basic menu ingredients to gain favorable prices
and ensure uniform quality specifications.  Management does not anticipate
any difficulty in obtaining food products of adequate quantity or quality
at acceptable prices.

The Company utilizes advertising where market penetration allows.
Expenditures for advertising were 3.0% of Company-operated restaurant sales
in fiscal 1995.  During 1995, advertising included support of holiday pie
sales, select menu items and lower prices in Bakers Square.

All of the Company-operated restaurants utilize point-of-sale computer
systems.  These systems capture and record sales and payroll data which are
transmitted daily to the Company's corporate office.  These systems are
supplemented with personal computer back office systems that provide
analytical and reporting tools for restaurant managers.

Franchise Operations

The Village Inn restaurants franchised under the Company's current
franchise program generally operate for an initial term of 20 years and
require payments to the Company of an initial franchise fee of $30,000, a
continuing royalty fee of four percent of the franchisee's revenues and a
marketing fee of four-tenths of one percent of such revenues.  In addition,
franchisees are required to spend an amount equal to 1.6 percent of gross
sales on local advertising and promotional activities.  In support of its
franchising activities, the Company employs field consultants who visit the
franchise restaurants regularly to ensure that the franchisees maintain
compliance with certain standards of operations and make recommendations
for improvements.  A Franchise Advisory Board, consisting of seven
franchisees who are elected by their peers every two years, meets regularly
with Company personnel to discuss facets of operations that affect the
Company's franchise community.

During fiscal 1995, five new franchise restaurants were opened and one
restaurant which previously was operated by the Company was franchised.
Also in that year, five franchise restaurants were closed and two franchise
locations were purchased by the Company.  The net number of Village Inn
franchise restaurants in operation over the last five years has not changed
significantly.  However, as franchising provides a profitable revenue
stream and at the same time leverages the strength of the Village Inn brand
into new markets, the Company continues to pursue franchising opportunities
with qualified applicants.  Approximately seven new franchise units are
expected to open in fiscal 1996.

Trademarks and Service Marks

The Company has acquired the right to use the marks which it considers
important to its business through various federal and state registrations.
VICORP has no reason to believe that there are any conflicting rights that
might materially impair the use of the Company's marks.

Working Capital Items

The Company is not required to maintain significant levels of working
capital because its revenues are primarily derived from cash sales while
restaurant inventories are purchased on credit and rapidly converted to
cash.

Competition

The restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by
changes in taste and eating habits of the public, by local and national
economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and
traffic patterns.  The Company competes directly or indirectly with all
types of restaurants, from national and regional chains to local
establishments.  Some of its competitors are corporations much larger than
the Company, having at their disposal greater capital resources and greater
ability to withstand adverse business trends.

Research and Development

No material amount was spent on Company sponsored research and development
activities during the last fiscal year.  Additionally, no material amounts
were spent by the Company on customer sponsored research activities
relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the
improvement of existing products, services or techniques.

Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting
its business.  Restaurants generally are required to comply with a variety
of regulatory provisions relating to zoning of restaurant sites,
sanitation, health and safety.  With respect to the restaurants operated by
the Company which serve alcoholic beverages, VICORP is governed by the laws
regulating the sale of liquor, wine and beer.

The Company is subject to a substantial number of state laws regulating
franchise operations and sales.  Those laws impose registration and
disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises
and, in certain cases, also apply substantive standards to the relationship
between franchisor and franchisee.  The Company also must adhere to the
Federal Trade Commission regulations governing disclosure requirements in
the sale of franchises.

Various federal and state labor laws govern the Company's relationship with
its employees, including such matters as minimum wage requirements,
overtime, and other working conditions.  Environmental requirements have
not had a material effect on the operations of the Company or those of its
franchisees.

Employees

At October 31, 1995, the Company employed approximately 13,500 persons.

(1) Before asset disposal and restructuring charges of $23 million and $1.3
    million in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Restaurant sales decreased 9.6% in 1995 versus 1994.  The Company operated
approximately 25 fewer restaurants in 1995 compared to 1994 due to
restaurant closures and dispositions.  A comparable same store sales
decline of 5.9% also contributed to the overall decrease in sales.  The
Bakers Square division registered the majority of the decrease which was
affected by a menu price reduction of approximately 10% put into place in
the middle of 1995.  This action of reducing prices was taken to reverse a
four-year decline in customer counts in that division.  Compared to the
prior year, same store customer counts for Bakers Square decreased 8.7% in
1995 prior to the price reduction, but only decreased 1.4% thereafter.

Restaurant sales decreased 3.7% in 1994 compared to 1993, despite the
addition of six new restaurants in 1994 and full year inclusion of eleven
restaurants opened in 1993.  Contributing to the sales decrease was an
extra week of operations in 1993.  However, the principal reason for the
decline was a decrease in comparable same store restaurant sales of 5.7%
resulting primarily from lower customer counts.  The customer count
decreases were most predominant in the Company's Bakers Square concept.
These declines were the result of various operational, demographic and
competitive issues and led to substantial organizational changes during
1994.  The disruptive effects of these changes further contributed to the
sales declines in 1994.  Menu price changes had no appreciable effect on
sales in 1994.

Restaurant operating profit decreased 65% in 1995 versus 1994.  Bakers
Square's restaurant operating profit decreased significantly due to the
menu price reductions, lower comparable sales in relationship to fixed
costs, and investments in food, labor and certain other restaurant related
items in order to improve customer counts.  Village Inn's restaurant
operating results were essentially unchanged from the prior year, but
improved as a percentage of sales.  The closure of unprofitable restaurants
and reduced advertising and insurance costs were largely offset by higher
labor costs from increased staffing.  Angel's, the Company's experimental
concept, recorded a restaurant operating loss in 1995 due to preopening
costs and a higher than expected cost structure.  The decision on whether
Angel's is a viable concept for expansion will be made in 1996.

Restaurant operating profit decreased 23% in 1994 compared to 1993.  The
inability to correspondingly decrease the fixed portion of labor costs and
other fixed costs in relationship to declines in comparable restaurant
sales was principally responsible for this decline.  Partially offsetting
this decline were incremental profits from operating new units, reduced
insurance expense and lower marketing costs for Bakers Square.

General and administrative expense decreased in 1995 compared to 1994 as
the result of administrative office consolidations, staff reductions,
reduced incentive and legal expenses and a $1,000,000 sign-up bonus for the
Company's President paid in 1994.  General and administrative expense
increased in 1994 compared with 1993 due primarily to the sign-up bonus,
litigation costs and lower capitalization of overhead as a result of a
slowdown in construction activity.

Other income/expense in 1994 included $1,918,000 of income related to
settlement of litigation against certain of the Company's insurance
carriers.

In 1994, the Company recorded a $23,000,000 charge related primarily to a
plan to close and dispose of underperforming restaurants and discontinue a
portion of the Company's manufacturing and distribution activities.  Also,
included were charges to impair the carrying values on four properties and
to accrue for administrative restructuring costs.  As of October 31, 1995,
46 of the 50 restaurants scheduled for disposition had been closed.  The
remaining four locations are expected to close in fiscal 1996.  Of the
closures, 22 have been disposed through sale, lease termination, or
sublease.  The Company does not anticipate that disposition proceeds or
costs will materially affect the Company's liquidity.  The following table
details sales and operating results of the 50 closure restaurants:

In 1995, the Company discontinued internal warehousing and distribution of
grocery products for its restaurants.  The Company does not anticipate
significant changes in delivered product costs as a result of the change;
however, food inventories were reduced.  Also in 1995, the Company closed
its bakery facility in Phoenix, Arizona.

In 1993, the Company recorded a $1,300,000 charge related to the decision
to close its Matteson, Illinois regional office and combine the functions
performed there with similar functions at its Denver, Colorado
headquarters.  The charge consisted primarily of severance and moving
expenses.  The reorganization was completed during 1994.

The effective income tax rates used for financial reporting were 50.0% in
1995, 37.5% in 1994 and 36.2% in 1993.  The 1995 and 1994 rates were
affected by the FICA tipped income tax credit that took effect January 1,
1994.  The lower effective tax rate for 1993 was due to the increase in the
top federal rate from 34% to 35% enacted in August of 1993, which increased
the Company's net deferred tax asset $1,200,000 and reduced income tax
expense accordingly.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's principal source of funds is cash provided by operations.
Cash flow from operations decreased both in 1994 and 1995 due primarily to
lower operating income and changes in working capital from contraction of
the Company's business.  Operating cash flow in 1995 was supplemented by
the collection of an insurance receivable.

The Company's working capital is generally in a deficit position because,
like most restaurant businesses, substantially all sales are for cash,
while credit is received from trade suppliers.  Furthermore, the Company
has not maintained large excess cash balances, but rather has utilized
available cash for capital spending, repayment of borrowings or the
repurchase of its common stock.

The Company supplements cash provided by operations with bank borrowings
and occasional lease financing.  During fiscal 1995, the Company borrowed
an additional $7,000,000 under its bank credit facility as operating cash
flows were insufficient to fund capital expenditures and stock repurchases.
At October 31, 1995, the Company had $35,250,000 of outstanding borrowings
under its bank credit facility, with approximately $9,750,000 available for
additional direct advances.  The Company's current bank agreement expires
on June 30, 1996 when it converts to a term facility payable in eight equal
quarterly installments through June 30, 1998.  The Company is currently
pursuing a new revolving facility with certain lenders and is optimistic
that a new facility will be in place prior to the current revolving
facility's expiration.  The Company is also exploring other debt financing
sources.

Over the last three years, 1,199,500 shares of the Company's common stock
were repurchased for $20,423,000 under authorizations approved by the Board
of Directors.  At October 31, 1995, authorization to repurchase an
additional 300,500 common shares was available.  Future purchases with
respect to this authorization may be made from time to time in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions and will be dependent
upon various business and financial considerations.

Capital expenditures in 1995 totaled $13,234,000 and consisted of
$1,954,000 to purchase two previously franchised locations and a land site,
$9,167,000 for improvements to existing restaurants, and $2,113,000 for
other support related projects.  Capital expenditures of $14,000,000 are
expected for 1996.  No new restaurants are planned during 1996.  Cash flow
from operations, funds available under a bank credit facility, or other
financing sources are expected to be adequate for planned capital projects
and any repurchases of common stock authorized by the Board.

At October 31, 1995, the Company had $44,375,000 of net deferred tax
assets, the majority of which relates to federal net operating loss
carryforwards totaling $207,082,000.  The Company has established a
valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that the full amount of the
operating loss carryforwards will be applied against future taxable income.
While a continuation of the Company's 1995 taxable income level is not
sufficient to realize the portion of the net deferred tax asset related to
the operating loss carryforwards before the expiration periods, the Company
feels that its 1995 operating results are not indicative of future
performance.  Historically, the Company had taxable income in excess of the
amount necessary for realization and believes it will do so again in future
years.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.  Cumulative taxable income of
approximately $53,000,000 through 1999 will be necessary to realize the net
deferred tax asset before expiration of a majority of the net operating
loss carryforwards.

MANAGEMENT OUTLOOK

The mid-scale segment of the restaurant industry remains extremely
competitive.  The Company has discontinued opening new restaurants until
existing operations improve which affects its overall competitiveness.
Improvements in future operating performance will be dependent upon the
Company's ability to reverse negative comparable sales trends, especially
given the significant profit impact associated with incremental sales at
existing restaurants.  Cost controls will also play a significant factor in
future profit growth.  In addition, numerous external factors could have a
significant impact on future performance, not limited to food commodity
costs, labor availability, site availability, the economy, the weather and
government initiatives such as minimum wage rates, mandated benefits and
taxes.

Historically, the Company has mitigated the effects of inflation through
cost controls and periodic price increases.  Management believes it will be
able to minimize the effects of future inflation through similar measures,
although such price increases will be subject to competitive constraints
and other business considerations.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation".  The SFAS, which would be effective for the Company's
fiscal 1997, recommends a fair value based method of accounting for an
employee stock option.  However, companies may choose to continue to
account for stock options using the intrinsic value based method as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" and provide proforma disclosures of net income
and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied.
The Company anticipates it will continue to account for stock options using
the intrinsic value based method, and thus SFAS No. 123 will not have any
impact on its reported results.


ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

The preparation and integrity of the financial statements of VICORP
Restaurants, Inc. are the responsibility of its management.  This
responsibility includes the selection of accounting procedures and
practices which conform with generally accepted accounting principles
considered appropriate in the circumstances.  Informed judgments and
estimates which the Company believes to be reasonable are required in the
determination of certain data used in the accounting and reporting process.

The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization and properly recorded in all material
respects.  Adequate communication of Company policies to its employees,
segregation of responsibilities for the authorization and execution of
transactions, and proper accountability for the Company's assets are
essential elements of the system.

Each year the Board of Directors appoints an Audit Committee comprised of
directors who are not employees of the Company.  The principal
responsibilities of this Committee are to recommend an independent auditor
for the Company and to periodically meet with representatives of the
independent auditors and with management to obtain reasonable assurances
that the auditors are properly discharging their responsibilities and that
the Company's financial reporting to stockholders and others is adequate
and appropriate.

Arthur Andersen LLP has conducted an independent examination in order to
render their opinion on the Company's financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF VICORP RESTAURANTS, INC.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VICORP
RESTAURANTS, INC. (a Colorado corporation) and subsidiary as of October 31,
1995 and October 30, 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended October 31, 1995.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of VICORP Restaurants,
Inc. and subsidiary as of October 31, 1995 and October 30, 1994, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the three years in the
period ended October 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

VICORP Restaurants, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of operations

VICORP operates family style restaurants under the names "Bakers Square",
"Village Inn" and "Angel's Diner and Bakery" and franchises restaurants
under the Village Inn name.  At October 31, 1995, VICORP operated 264
restaurants in 14 states, of which, 160 were Bakers Squares, 99 were
Village Inns and five were Angel's.  On that date, there were 106
franchised Village Inn restaurants in 20 states.  The restaurants operated
by the Company are located primarily in Arizona, California, Florida, the
Rocky Mountain region, and the upper Midwest.  The Company has a pie
manufacturing division supporting its restaurants, which operates under the
name VICOM.  VICOM has five production facilities.

Basis of presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses.  Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VICORP
Restaurants, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary.  All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Fiscal year

In fiscal 1995, the Company switched its fiscal year end to the last day in
October.  Prior to that, the Company utilized a 52/53 week fiscal year
which ended on the last Sunday in October.  Fiscal year 1993 was 53 weeks,
while fiscal 1994 was 52 weeks and fiscal 1995 was 52 weeks and two days.

Sales for the extra two days in fiscal 1995 ("the transition period")
totaled $1,216,000.  Sales for the extra week in fiscal 1993 totaled $7,400,000.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market
value.  Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands):

                              October 31,         October 30,

                              ==========          ==========

Prepaid expenses

Prepaid expenses consist primarily of supplies, restaurant preopening costs
and prepaid contract costs.  Preopening costs are amortized over a one-year
period following restaurant opening.  Unamortized preopening costs totaled
$21,000 and $386,000 at the end of 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided using
principally the straight-line method at rates based upon estimated useful
lives of the assets, ranging from 20 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 15
years for equipment and improvements.  Amortization of leasehold rights and
excess of cost over net assets acquired in purchase transactions is
provided using the straight-line method, primarily over the remaining lives
of location leases or assets acquired, generally 5 to 25 years.

Franchise revenues

Initial franchise fees are deferred when received and recognized as income
when the franchisee has commenced operations and the Company has performed
all material services and conditions related to the sale of the franchise.
Continuing service fees, which are a percentage of the gross sales of
franchised operations, are accrued as income when earned except for
situations in which collectibility is in doubt.  In those situations,
continuing service fees and rental income are recognized when received, and
gains on property sales are recorded using the cost recovery method.

Net franchise revenues consisted of the following (in thousands):

                                      1995      1994      1993

Advertising Costs

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued
Statement of Position No. 93-7 "Reporting on Advertising Costs" in December
1993.  The Company adopted the new statement in its fiscal 1995 and the
implementation of the statement had no material effect on reported income.

The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the first time the
advertising takes place.  Costs of communicating advertising are expensed
when incurred, generally when airtime or print media is used.  Direct
response advertising is seldom used by the Company and is expensed when
incurred.

Advertising expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $11,106,000, $14,043,000
and $15,219,000, respectively.  At October 31, 1995 and October 30, 1994,
no material amounts of advertising were reported as assets.

Fair value of financial instruments

The Company has notes receivable carried on its balance sheets at values
approximating estimated fair market value.  Because these instruments are
not publicly traded, the Company estimates the value based on the
respective facts and circumstances of each instrument.  The fair value of
the Company's long-term debt approximates carrying value because of its
variable, market-based interest rate feature.

Income taxes

Based on enacted tax laws, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards
and temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets are reduced, if deemed
necessary, by a valuation allowance for the amount of any tax benefits
which, more likely than not based on current circumstances, are not
expected to be realized.

Earnings per common and common equivalent share

Earnings per common and common equivalent share is based upon earnings
attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares for stock options outstanding
during the year.  Common equivalent shares for fiscal years 1995 and 1994
were anti-dilutive due to the net losses recorded in those years.  The
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares used for the
1995, 1994 and 1993 calculations were as follows:

                                               1995         1994         1993
                                            ------------------------------------
Weighted average common shares outstanding  9,246,439    9,656,094    10,007,907
Common equivalent shares outstanding               --           --       292,793
                                            ------------------------------------
                                            9,246,439    9,656,094    10,300,700
                                            ====================================


Statements of cash flows

The Company considers all highly liquid investments and debt instruments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


NOTE 2. RECEIVABLES

                                    October 31,    October 30,

                                    ==========     ==========

The Company's receivables arose primarily from contracts and property
transactions with its franchisees and other sublessees.  The ability of
these parties to honor their obligations is largely dependent on cash flows
generated from their restaurant operations.  The trade receivables are
generally unsecured but the related contracts are cancelable if the debtor
fails to perform.  Under Company policy, the notes receivable are generally
secured with security agreements on the property that gave rise to the
transaction.

In November 1994, the Company settled a lawsuit against certain of its
insurance carriers.  The litigation arose in April 1992 when the Company
claimed the defendants breached their contract of insurance by withholding
payments to fund a $6,500,000 court approved settlement arising from prior
litigation against the Company.  The Company recorded income of $1,918,000
in the fourth quarter of 1994, representing the excess recovery over the
net carrying value of the receivable.  This receivable was collected in the
first quarter of 1995.

NOTE 3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Depreciation  and amortization expense charged to operations for property
and equipment was $22,018,000 in 1995, $25,509,000 in 1994 and $22,763,000
in 1993.

At October 31, 1995, all of the Company's fee owned properties were free of 
mortgages, pledges or other liens.


NOTE 4. LEASES

The Company is the prime lessee under various land and building leases for
restaurants operated by it and certain of its franchisees.  Additionally,
the Company leases certain bakery production facilities.  The leases have
initial terms generally ranging from 15 to 35 years and in certain
instances, provide for renewal options ranging from 5 to 20 years.  Some of
the leases contain purchase options at the end of the lease terms.  Many of
the leases contain escalation clauses, either predetermined or based upon
inflation.  Most of the leases require additional (contingent) rental
payments by the Company if sales volumes at the related restaurants exceed
specified levels.  Most of the agreements require payment of taxes,
insurance and maintenance costs.  The Company is also obligated under
various equipment leases having initial terms ranging from 3 to 7 years.
The implicit interest rates range from 6.4% to 18.6% for capitalized
leases.

The Company as prime lessee has entered into sublease agreements with
franchisees and others on certain locations that are not operated by the
Company.  These leases generally have terms similar to the prime lease with
the sublessee assuming the Company's obligations to pay taxes, insurance
and maintenance costs.

Following is a summary as of October 31, 1995, of future minimum lease
payments under capital and operating leases having an initial or remaining
non-cancelable term of one year or more:

The Company's bank credit agreement provides up to $55,000,000 for direct
advances and letters of credit with a sublimit of $25,000,000 on letters of
credit.  Advances bear interest at the lenders' prime rate or, if elected,
at LIBOR (London Interbank Offering Rate) plus 1 1/8%.  The Company is
required to pay a commitment fee of 3/8% per annum on the unused commitment
plus a quarterly agents' fee of $12,500 and 1 1/8% per annum on issued
letters of credit.  The agreement expires on June 30, 1996, when it becomes
a term facility payable in equal quarterly installments through June 30,
1998.  The Company is currently negotiating a new revolving bank credit
agreement with certain lenders.  In addition, the Company is exploring
other options of refinancing its bank advances.  The largest outstanding
balance under the facility during 1995 was $35,250,000.  The average balance
outstanding was $25,100,000 and the average annual interest rate was 7.2%.
As of October 31, 1995, the Company had placed letters of credit totaling
$9,999,000 in connection with its insurance programs.

The agreement contains various restrictive covenants which include, among
others, maintenance of certain financial ratios, maintenance of a minimum
balance of tangible net worth and limitations on annual capital
expenditures, indebtedness, dividends, dispositions and acquisitions.

At October 31, 1995, principal amounts of long-term debt due during each of
the five succeeding fiscal years were $4,480,000 in 1996, $17,703,000 in
1997, $13,302,000 in 1998, $89,000 in 1999 and none in 2000.

The Company incurred $3,864,000, $3,956,000 and $4,179,000 of interest
charges in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Of these amounts, $9,000,
$89,000 and $301,000 were capitalized in each respective year.

NOTE 6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

The Company's authorized preferred stock consists of 5,000,000 $.10 par
value shares to be issued in series.  The rights of each series are to be
determined by the Company's Board of Directors.

The Company has outstanding one right for each outstanding common share of
the Company.  When exercisable, each right will entitle its holder to buy
1/100th of a share of the Company's Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock at an exercise price of $40.  If, among other things, the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, including
one in which the Company is the surviving corporation, each right will
entitle its holder to purchase, at the then current exercise price of the
right, that number of shares of common stock of the surviving company which
at the time of such transaction would have a market value of twice the
exercise price of the right.  The rights are exercisable only if, without
the Company's prior consent, a party acquires, or obtains the right to
acquire, 25% or more of the Company's outstanding voting securities or
announces a tender offer which would result in such ownership.  At the
Company's option, the rights are redeemable at two cents per right at any
time before a 25% position has been acquired and under limited
circumstances thereafter.  The rights expire May 26, 1997.

At various times since August 1992, the Company's Board of Directors has
authorized the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock.  At
October 31, 1995, authorization to purchase an additional 300,500 common
shares was available.

Under Colorado law, repurchased shares of capital stock are considered
authorized and unissued shares and have the same status as shares which
have never been issued.

Under the most restrictive covenants of the Company's bank credit
agreement, approximately $880,000 of consolidated retained earnings were
unrestricted at October 31, 1995, as to the declaration of cash dividends
and the acquisition of the Company's common stock.

NOTE 7. STOCK OPTION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS

The Company has stock option plans which generally provide for the granting
of options to all employees and non-employee directors of the Company at
exercise prices not less than the market value of the common stock on the
date of the grant.  The options generally vest over three years and expire
ten years after the date of grant or three months after employment
termination, whichever occurs first.

In 1994, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with J. Michael
Jenkins, a Director, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President of the
Company.  Under the agreement, Mr. Jenkins was granted an option to
purchase 300,000 shares of the Company's stock.  The optioned shares are
divided into 50,000 share increments with exercise prices ranging from
$15.00 to $30.17.  The options are scheduled to vest on October 1, 1999 and
are exercisable until October 1, 2004, unless accelerated under certain
conditions.

The following table summarizes stock option activity:

                                   Shares          Option price

================================================================

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation".  The SFAS, which would be effective for the Company's
fiscal 1997, recommends a fair value based method of accounting for an
employee stock option.  However, companies may choose to continue to
account for stock options using the intrinsic value based method as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" and provide proforma disclosures of net income
and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied.
The Company anticipates it will continue to account for stock options using
the intrinsic value based method, and thus SFAS No. 123 will not have any
impact on its reported results.

The Company has an employees' profit-sharing plan, established under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which provides for
annual contributions by the Company to be determined by the Board of
Directors.  The Company's annual contribution, if the Company is profitable
(as defined in the plan), must be equal to at least 2% and may not exceed
15% of the aggregate compensation of the participants while participating.
Any full-time employee 21 years of age or older who has completed one year
of service with the Company is eligible to participate.  Assets of the
profit-sharing plan can be invested in the Company's common stock, or among
several other alternatives.  The Company's expenses related to contributions  
to the plan in 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $455,000, $829,000 and $861,000, 
respectively.


NOTE 8. ASSET DISPOSAL, RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS

In 1994, a $23,000,000 charge was recorded principally related to a plan to
close and dispose of restaurants that had declining sales and profits and
that were in trade areas no longer considered appropriate for the Company's
operating concepts.  The disposition plan also included a portion of the
Company's manufacturing and distribution operations which were no longer
economical to operate.  The disposal charge consisted of estimates to
reduce the carrying amounts of assets to net realizable value, accruals for
closure and carrying costs, and losses on sublease dispositions where it is
expected that sublease rentals will be lower than the Company's obligations
under the prime lease.

Through 1995, the Company closed 46 locations.  Another four locations are
anticipated to close in fiscal 1996.  Of the closed locations, 22 had been
disposed of through sale, lease termination or sublease.  Also in 1995, the
Company discontinued the internal distribution and warehousing of grocery
products for its restaurants and closed its bakery facility in Phoenix,
Arizona.

Operating results for the 50 restaurants for the past three fiscal years
were as follows (in thousands):

                                      1995       1994       1993
                                    --------   --------   --------
Sales                               $ 23,158   $ 37,891   $ 41,733
Restaurant operating profit (loss)    (2,127)    (1,096)       112

Included in the 1994 charge was an impairment of assets of $2,287,000 for
four restaurant properties with projected cash flows insufficient to
recover remaining investments and a $1,291,000 restructuring charge related
to the elimination of 27 administrative positions that were redundant or
non-essential to ongoing operations.

In 1993, the Company recorded a $1,300,000 restructuring charge for the
closure of its Matteson, Illinois administrative office and consolidation
of functions at its Denver, Colorado headquarters.  The charge consisted
primarily of severance and moving expenses.  The consolidation was
completed in 1994 and approximately 70 employees resigned or were
terminated as a result of the office closure.

As of October 31, 1995, the Company had $12,015,000 of reserves remaining
to provide for the disposal of 37 properties, including nine closed prior
to 1994.  The reserves consisted of $6,852,000 to reduce the disposal
property to net realizable value and $5,163,000 to provide for carrying
costs and sublease losses.  The Company believes that these reserves are
adequate to cover the remaining costs and losses associated with the
remaining disposal properties.  During 1995, $2,603,000 of closure and
carrying costs were charged against the established liability.

In August 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was enacted
which increased the top federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%.  This
increase was retroactively applied to January 1, 1993, and was prorated for
fiscal tax years overlapping the effective date.  The increase in rate had
the effect of increasing the deferred tax asset related to the Company's
net operating loss carryforwards.  The Act also instituted a general
business credit for FICA taxes paid by employers on tips received by
foodservice employees, effective January 1994.

The Company had taxable income (loss) for federal income tax purposes and
book income (loss) before income taxes as follows:

Federal taxable income (loss)          $ (17,020)  $ 14,589    $23,436
Book income (loss) before income taxes    (9,064)   (10,620)    25,910

Federal taxable income is generally less than book income before income
taxes due to state income taxes, differences in depreciation rates, and
employee stock option exercises.  In 1994, such differences were more than
offset by the asset disposal charge of $23,000,000 a majority of which was
not deductible for tax purposes in that year.

The components of the net deferred tax assets were as follows:

As of October 31, 1995, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards totaling $207,082,000 which expire $71,036,000 in 1998,
$112,880,000 in 1999, $6,146,000 in 2001 and $17,020,000 in 2010.  The
Company also has investment tax credit carryforwards of $3,506,000 expiring
from 1997 through 2000.  The Company has established a valuation allowance
due to the uncertainty that the full amount of those credits and operating
loss carryforwards will be applied against future taxable income.  This
allowance was reduced by $2,000,000 in 1994 due to the expiration of
investment tax credits to which a portion of the allowance applied.  While a
continuation of the Company's 1995 taxable income level is not sufficient
to realize the portion of the net deferred tax asset related to the
operating loss carryforwards before the expiration periods, the Company
feels that its 1995 operating results are not indicative of future
performance.  Historically, the Company had taxable income in excess of the
amount necessary for realization and believes it will do so again in future
years.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carryforward period are reduced.  Cumulative taxable
income of approximately $53,000,000 through 1999 will be necessary to
realize the net deferred tax asset before expiration of a majority of the
net operating loss carryforwards.  Future adjustments to the valuation
allowance deemed appropriate due to changed circumstances will be
recognized as a separate component of the provision for income taxes.


NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company retains a significant portion of certain insurable risks
primarily in the medical, dental, workers' compensation, general liability
and property areas.  Traditional insurance coverage is obtained for
catastrophic losses.  Provisions for losses expected under these programs
are recorded based upon the Company's estimates of liabilities for claims
incurred, including those not yet reported.  Such estimates utilize prior
Company history and actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance
industry.  The Company has provided letters of credit totaling $9,999,000
in connection with certain of these insurance programs.

The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising from the
conduct of its business and has guaranteed certain indebtedness and leases
of its franchisees and others.  Management believes the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

At October 31, 1995, the Company had contractual commitments for restaurant
construction of approximately $230,000.

(a) (2) The following financial statement schedule for VICORP Restaurants,Inc.,
        as listed in the Index below, is included herein beginning on page 35.

        Report of Independent Public Accountants on Financial Statement 
        Schedule.

        Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the years ended
        October 31, 1995, October 30, 1994 and October 31, 1993.

        All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable
        accounting regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission are
        not required under the related instructions or are inapplicable, and
        therefore have been omitted.

(a) (3) The exhibits filed in response to Item 601 of Regulation S-K are
        listed in the Exhibit Index on Page 37.

        For the purpose of complying with the amendments to the rules
        governing Form S-8 (effective July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act
        of 1933, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows,
        which undertaking shall be incorporated by reference into registrant's
        currently effective Registration Statements on Form S-8:

        Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
        Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers, and
        controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to any statute, charter
        provisions, bylaws, contract, or other arrangements, the registrant
        has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
        in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In
        the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
        (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid
        by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the
        successful defense of any action, suit or proceedings) is asserted by
        such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the
        securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
        opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
        precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question
        whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
        expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
        such issue.

(b) Reports on Form 8-K filed in fourth quarter of 1995:

        Form 8-K dated September 22, 1995.

                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To VICORP Restaurants, Inc.:

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
the consolidated financial statements of VICORP Restaurants, Inc. and
subsidiary included in this form 10-K and have issued our report thereon
dated December 12, 1995.  Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule
listed in the attached index is the responsibility of the Company's management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.  The

first above written.

Employment:  You will be relieved of any further duties with
VICORP on February 16, 1995.  Your status as an employee shall
terminate on February 17, 1995.

Salary:  VICORP shall pay you your base salary through February
17, 1995, plus any accrued and unused vacation through that date.
Federal and state withholding and other authorized deductions
shall be taken from those amounts.  Such payments shall be made
to you by no later than February 17, 1995.

Benefits:  Your entitlement to participate in the benefits
offered by VICORP shall cease as of February 17, 1995.  Any
rights accrued under those plans to the date of termination shall

Notwithstanding that fact, however, you will be provided
continuation rights with respect to medical and dental benefits
as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985 ("COBRA").

Stock Options:  VICORP confirms your right to exercise until May
18, 1995 any options which were granted to you to purchase
VICORP's common stock and which were vested as of February 17,
1995.  In no event, however, shall any granted but unvested
options vest subsequent to February 17, 1995.

Severance:  VICORP shall pay to you $201,666, less appropriate
federal and state withholding, as severance pay in recognition of
your service to VICORP.  The payment shall be made to you in a
lump sum payment immediately after the expiration of the
revocation period provided for in this agreement.

Confidential Information:  In the course of your employment, you
have been exposed to trade secrets and other information which is
of vital importance to VICORP's business.  All information,
whether written or not, regarding VICORP's business, is
confidential.  You agree that you will not, directly or
indirectly, at any time disclose any trade secrets or
confidential information of VICORP which you have obtained during
the course of your employment with VICORP.  Nothing in this
agreement shall prevent you from using your general knowledge,
skill and experience in gainful employment by a third party
subsequent to your termination from VICORP.

Return of Documents:  You have agreed to immediately return to
VICORP any and all keys, charge cards, company documents, and any
and all other items of VICORP which are in your possession.

Continued Assistance:  You have agreed to continue to cooperate
with VICORP as needed with regard to any legal action which may
necessitate your involvement and which arose during your tenure
with VICORP.  Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by you in
connection with your involvement shall be paid by VICORP.

Out-Placement Assistance:  You will be eligible to receive the
three-month out-placement package at the Company's expense
through the firm of AIM/Enterchange.

Mutual Release:  Except for any obligations described in this
letter, you hereby release VICORP and its officers, directors,
shareholders, and employees; and VICORP hereby releases you from
any and all claims, agreements, promises, actions, and
obligations that each may have against the other arising out of
the employment relationship.  This release covers claims and
obligations, even if they are unknown at this time, including but
not limited to any contract or tort claims and any claims based
on rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,
29 U.S.C. 621.  VICORP and you also agree as to any such claim
neither VICORP nor you will start or pursue any complaint or
proceeding against the other before any court, tribunal or
governmental agency.  In consideration for the foregoing release,
VICORP shall pay to you $18,333 at the expiration of the
revocation period defined below.

Miscellaneous:  You are entering into this agreement freely and
voluntarily and acknowledge that you have been advised of your
right to consult legal counsel and that you have had an
opportunity to do so.  In the event any term of this agreement is
unenforceable, then such unenforceable term would be altered so
as to be enforceable.  If that is not possible, then it will be
deleted from this agreement and the remaining part of the
agreement will remain in effect.  This agreement constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties with respect to this matter
and supersedes any prior agreements, whether oral or written.
Any change or modification of this agreement to be valid must be
in writing signed by each of us and the terms and provisions of
this agreement shall be binding upon our respective successors,
assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, and representatives.

Revocation Period:  You (a) shall have a period of twenty-one
(21) days from the date of delivery of this agreement to accept
the agreement, and (b) shall have seven (7) days following your
execution of this agreement during which you may revoke the
agreement by providing VICORP written notice of your revocation.
If this agreement is not revoked by you during said seven (7) day
period, it shall be deemed accepted.  The provisions of this
agreement relating to severance, outplacement assistance, and
mutual release shall not be effective or enforceable until the
revocation period has expired; all other provisions shall be
effective as of February 17, 1995.

Sincerely,

         an at-will basis indefinitely.

     3.  In that position, your duties will be to discharge the duties of the
         President of the Angel's Diner Division and to perform such duties
         and services of an executive administrative and managerial nature as
         shall be specified and designated from time to time by the President
         of VICORP.

     4.  Your immediate supervisor will be the President of VICORP.

     5.  The compensation package you will receive is:

         A.  A bi-weekly base salary of $7,692.31 (representing an annualized
             base salary of $200,000).

         B.  You will be eligible to earn an annual bonus equal to 10% of 
             Angel's Divisional Operating Income.  Divisional operating income
             is defined as dollars of Store Operating Profit minus Division
             Overhead Expenses.  In no event, however, shall your bonus exceed,
             on a cumulative basis, $2.5 million over the fiscal year period
             1995 through 1999.

         C.  You will be eligible to participate in VICORP's standard benefits

             information on each of the benefits offered to officers of
             VICORP at your orientation.

         D.  The company will reimburse you for all travel and other business
             expenses in accordance with VICORP's business expense reimbursement
             guidelines, except, however, when first-class air travel is 
             available, VICORP agrees to pay for up-grade stickers.  Further, 
             VICORP agrees to purchase air pass mileage blocks from American
             Airlines to help reduce your travel costs.

         E.  In the event of your involuntary termination by VICORP, which is
             not for cause, VICORP agrees that it will pay to you a severance
             package equal to one year's base salary, plus benefit coverages 
             for up to the earlier of 12 months or until you secure another 
             position which includes benefits coverages.

Hopefully, the above is a correct expression of our understanding of the terms
of your employment.  To the extent, however, you have additional questions or 
concerns, please feel free to contact me, so that we can clarify any confusions.

On behalf of VICORP, I am happy that you have chosen to become a member of the
