PART I.


ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

        The Registrant, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P. (the
"Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed in October 1986 under the
Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware for the purpose
of investing primarily in income-producing office, industrial and retail
properties.

        The Managing General Partner of the Partnership is Dean Witter
Realty Fourth Income Properties Inc. (the "Managing General Partner"),
a Delaware corporation which is wholly owned by Dean Witter Realty Inc. 
The Associate General Partner is Dean Witter Realty Income Associates IV,
L.P. (the "Associate General Partner"), a Delaware limited partnership,
the general partner of which is the Managing General Partner.  The
Managing General Partner manages and controls all aspects of the business
of the Partnership.  The terms of transactions between the Partnership
and its affiliates are set forth in Item 13 below.

        The Partnership issued 304,437 units of limited partnership interest
(the "Units") for $152,218,500.  The offering has been terminated and no
additional Units will be sold.

        The proceeds from the offering were used to make equity investments
in four office properties which have been acquired without permanent
mortgage debt.  The properties are described below in Item 2, the
Operations section of Item 7 and footnotes 4 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8.

        The Partnership considers its business to include one industry
segment, investment in real property.  Financial information regarding
the Partnership is set forth in the Partnership's financial statements
set forth below.

        The Partnership's real property investments are subject to
competition from similar types of properties in the vicinities in which
they are located.  In recent years, an oversupply condition has persisted
nationally and many markets have experienced high vacancy rates. 
Currently, many real estate markets are beginning to stabilize, primarily
due to the continued absence of significant construction activity;
however, the recovery is expected to be slow.  Further information
regarding competition in the markets where the Partnership's properties
are located is set forth in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

        The Partnership has no employees.

        All of the Partnership's business is conducted in the United States.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

        The Partnership's principal offices are located at Two World Trade
Center, New York, New York, 10048.  The Partnership has no other offices.
        
        The Partnership owns through partnership interests the following
four property interests, none of which is encumbered by indebtedness. 
Generally, the leases pertaining to the properties provide for
pass-throughs to the tenants of their pro-rata share of certain operating
expenses.

     Affiliates of the Partnership are the property manager for Taxter
Corporate Park and Pasadena Financial Center and the co-property manager
of five buildings at the Chesterbrook Corporate Center.

     Further information relating to the Partnership's properties is
included in Item 7 below and footnotes 4 and 5 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 below.

ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

        Neither the Partnership nor any of its properties is subject to
any material pending legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.      SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
to a vote of Unit holders.

                                              PART II.

ITEM 5.      MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
             STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

     An established public trading market for the Units does not exist, and
it is not anticipated that such a market will develop in the future.
Accordingly, information as to the market value of a Unit at any given
date is not available.  However, the Partnership does allow its limited
partners (the "Limited Partners") to transfer their Units. 

     As of December 31, 1994, there were 18,506 holders of limited
partnership interests.

     The Partnership is a limited partnership and, accordingly, does not
pay dividends.  It does, however, make quarterly distributions of cash
to its partners.  Pursuant to the partnership agreement, distributable
cash, as defined, is paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
general partners (the "General Partners").  

     During each of the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, the
Partnership paid cash distributions aggregating $6,765,268, with
$6,088,740 distributed to the Limited Partners and $676,528 to the
General Partners.  The distributions aggregated $20.00 per Unit to the
Limited Partners.

     On January 27, 1995, the Partnership paid the fourth quarter
distribution of $5.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The total cash
distribution amounted to $1,691,317, with $1,522,185 distributed to the
Limited Partners and $169,132 to the General Partners.

     The Partnership anticipates making regular distributions to its
partners in the future.

     Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a return
of the Limited Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative
distributions of distributable cash and sale or refinancing proceeds in
an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on the
Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
General Partner receives a brokerage fee, if earned, of up to 3% of the
selling price of any equity investment.  The Partnership did not
distribute any sale or financing fees in 1994 or 1993.

     Taxable income generally will be allocated in the same proportions as
distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds.  In
the event there is no distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds,
taxable income will be allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to
the General Partners.  Any tax loss will be allocated 90% to the Limited
Partners and 10% to the General Partners.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
           RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

           Liquidity and Capital Resources

           The Partnership raised $152,218,500 in a public offering of
304,437 units which was terminated in 1988.  The Partnership has no plans
to raise additional capital.            

           The Partnership has made four investments in partnerships, which
own interests in properties, on an all-cash basis.  The Partnership's
acquisition program has been completed.  No additional investments are
planned.

           Many real estate markets are stabilizing, primarily due to the
continued absence of significant construction activity.  However, the
recovery of the office market has been and may continue to be slow,
because tenant demand is weak, as a result of continued downsizing by
many major corporations.  

           Real estate markets are generally divided into sub-markets by
geographic location and property type.  Not all sub-markets have been
affected equally by the above factors.

           The Partnership's liquidity depends in part upon cash flow from
operations of its properties, expenditures for tenant improvements and
leasing commissions in connection with the leasing of vacant space. In
1994, all of the Partnership's property investments generated positive
cash flow from operations, and it is anticipated that they will continue
to do so.

           However, in 1994, cost of tenant improvements and leasing
commissions, additional investments in joint ventures and partner
distributions exceeded cash flow from operations and distributions from
joint ventures by approximately $998,000 .  The shortfall was funded from
existing cash reserves.  The Partnership had reduced its distribution
rate in 1992 in order to accumulate such reserves.

           The Vanguard Group vacated its space in two of the buildings at
the Chesterbrook property in November 1993 and October 1994, and will
vacate its remaining space upon the expiration of its leases in November
1995.  In September 1994, the partnership which owns the property signed
leases with two new tenants to fill a significant portion of the space
vacated to date.  During 1994, the Partnership contributed approximately
$2,134,000 for its share of capital expenditures needed to re-lease this
space.

           Countrywide Credit Industries, Inc., the largest tenant at
Pasadena Financial Center, is consolidating its operations in Pasadena, 
and the partnership which owns the property has agreed to a restructuring
of its lease with Countrywide.  Effective January 1, 1995, Countrywide
was allowed to give back approximately 35% of the space it leased, and
its base rent was slightly reduced on its remaining space (approximately
36% of the property) over the next six years, in exchange for an
extension of the lease term on the remaining space for ten years, to
September 2011.  The Partnership completed this restructuring without
incurring any new tenant improvement obligations on the space, and at
below-market leasing commission rates.  In 2005, rents will increase ten
percent for the remainder of the lease term.  Considering the current
market and economic conditions in Pasadena, CA, as discussed below under
Operations, and the credit-worthiness of Countrywide, the Managing
General Partner considers the terms of the new agreement favorable.  The
sixteen-year term for this major tenant will provide stability to the
long term cash flow from this property.

           In 1994, the Partnership incurred approximately $893,000 of
tenant improvements and leasing commissions (net of capital contributions
from the minority interest) at Pasadena Financial Center, primarily
relating to new space occupied by Countrywide in 1994 and the year-end
restructuring of the Countrywide lease mentioned above.

           Pasadena Financial Center has experienced damage to the exterior
walls.  The Partnership's share of these costs is anticipated to exceed
$420,000. The Partnership which owns the property does not expect to
receive any insurance proceeds for this damage; however, it initiated a
lawsuit against the original building contractor and architect to seek
recovery of these costs.

           The Partnership also invested approximately $446,000, its share
of capital expenditures, in the Taxter joint venture in 1994. 

           In 1995, the Partnership expects to fund significant capital
expenditures in order to attract new tenants to vacant space at the
Chesterbrook property and Pasadena Financial Center.

           The Partnership expects that for 1995, capital expenditures and
cash distributions will be funded from operating cash flows,
distributions from joint ventures and existing cash reserves.  

           In 1993, the partnership that owns Taxter Corporate Park
concluded that there was a decline in the value of its property, and that
the decline was other-than-temporary.  Accordingly, the general partners
of this partnership recorded a loss on impairment of its investment in
the property of approximately $21.3 million at December 31, 1993.  The
Partnership's share of this loss, which was included in equity in
earnings (losses) of joint ventures was $8.6 million.

           On January 27, 1995, the Partnership paid the fourth quarter
distribution of $5.00 per Unit to the Limited Partners.  The total cash
distribution amounted to $1,691,317, with $1,522,185 distributed to the
Limited Partners and $169,132 to the General Partners.

Operations

           Fluctuations in the Partnership's operating results for the year
ended December 31, 1994 compared to 1993 and for the year ended December
31, 1993 compared to 1992 are primarily attributable to the following:

           The decrease in rental income in 1994 compared to 1993 is
primarily due to the above-mentioned restructuring of the lease with
Countrywide at Pasadena Financial Center, resulting from the write-off
of approximately $613,000 of tenant receivables related to the accrual
to recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis.

           The increase in equity in earnings (losses) of joint ventures in
1994 compared to 1993 and the decrease in 1993 compared to 1992 are
primarily attributable to the loss incurred in 1993 when the Partnership
recorded its share of the loss on impairment of the Taxter property. 
Excluding the 1993 loss, the equity in earnings (losses) of joint
ventures decreased by approximately $425,000 in 1994 compared to 1993,
primarily because of lower rental income from the Chesterbrook joint
venture, partially offset by lower depreciation charges from the Taxter
joint venture (due to the writedown of the property in 1993).

           The increase in interest and other income is primarily due to
1994 lease termination income of approximately $143,000 at Pasadena
Financial Center. 

           The increase in property operating expenses in 1994 compared to
1993 is due to increased costs incurred at Pasadena Financial Center.

           The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 1994
compared to 1993 is primarily due to the write-off of approximately
$600,000 of tenant improvements and leasing commissions at Pasadena
Financial Center relating to the space which Countrywide gave back.

           A summary of the markets in which the Partnership's office
properties are located and the performance of each property is as 
follows:

           Chesterbrook Corporate Center is located in Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania, a market in which the vacancy rate is approximately 14%. 
During 1994, average occupancy at the property was 85%, and at December
31, 1994, the property was 90% leased to 20 tenants (including one tenant
which moved into its space in 1995).  Vanguard has been vacating its
space to move into its own newly-constructed space in this market.  This,
and other new construction in the Valley Forge area, will cause the
office market to deteriorate further.  The leases of PECO Energy, the
other major tenant at the property (occupying 25% of the space), expire
in 1998.  Other leases totaling 20% of the space are scheduled to expire
in 1995 and 1996.

           The office market in Westchester County, New York, the location
of Taxter Corporate Park, has experienced a significant decline.  The
current vacancy level in the Westchester office market is approximately
25%.  It is unlikely that this vacant space will be absorbed in the
market for several years.  However, during 1994, and at December 31,
1994, average occupancy at the property was 99%.  At December 31, 1994,
the property was leased to 24 tenants. One of the tenants, KLM Airlines,
owns a long-term leasehold interest in approximately 20% of the space at
the property. The leases of Fuji Photo Film, the other major tenant
(covering 21% of the property's space), expire in 1996.  
           
           The Reston market in Virginia, the location of Tech Park Reston,
has a vacancy rate of 16% due to the contraction of the high-tech and
defense firms which are the major tenants in the market.  The leases with
Sprint Communications, which occupies 100% of the space, expire in 2003.
Sprint has the option to terminate its leases on two of the three
buildings beginning in 1997 and 1998.

           In Pasadena, California, the location of Pasadena Financial
Center, the office market overall vacancy rate is approximately 15%, and
it is expected to deteriorate in the near term, primarily as a result of
downsizing by Countrywide and another large employer in the market. 
However, during 1994, the property was 100% occupied by 10 tenants.  No
significant leases are scheduled to expire in the near future.

Inflation

           Inflation has been consistently low during the periods presented
in the financial statements and, as a result, has not had a significant
effect on the operations of the Partnership or its properties.

Independent Auditors' Report





To The Partners of
Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P.:


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dean
Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P. and consolidated partnerships
(the "Partnership") as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  Our
audits also included financial statement schedule III.  These financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Partnership's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly in all material
respects, the financial position of Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership
IV, L.P. and consolidated partnerships as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion,
financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                           DEAN WITTER REALTY INCOME PARTNERSHIP IV, L.P.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                  December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992



1.    The Partnership

      Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership IV, L.P. (the "Partnership")
      is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of
      Delaware on October 31, 1986.  The Partnership is managed by Dean
      Witter Realty Fourth Income Properties Inc. (the "Managing General
      Partner").  

      In 1987 and 1988, the Partnership issued 304,437 units of limited
      partnership interest (the "Units") for $152,218,500.  No additional
      Units will be sold.  The proceeds of the offering were used to make
      investments in income-producing office properties which were not
      encumbered by debt.

2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

      The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
      Partnership and its majority-controlled subsidiaries, Technology Park
      Associates and, commencing January 1, 1992, Lake Colorado Associates,
      the owner of Pasadena Financial Center. 

      The Partnership's 40.6% general partnership interest in Taxter
      Corporate Park and 41.2% general partnership interest in the
      partnership which owns interests in Chesterbrook Corporate Center are
      accounted for on the equity method.

      The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
      accounting for financial reporting and tax purposes.  

      The carrying value of real estate includes the purchase price paid
      by the Partnership and acquisition fees and expenses.  Costs of
      improvements to the properties are capitalized, and repairs are
      expensed.  Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method. 

      The Partnership periodically evaluates the recoverability of the net
      carrying value of its real estate and investments in joint ventures. 
      The evaluation is based on a review of expected future cash flows,
      determination of the Partnership's expected holding period of these
      assets, and other factors.  

      Deferred expenses consist of leasing commissions which are amortized
      over the applicable lease terms.

      Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis.

      The Partnership considers short-term investments with original
      maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

      Net income (loss) per Unit amounts are calculated by dividing net
      income allocated to Limited Partners, in accordance with the
      Partnership Agreement, by the weighted average number of Units
      outstanding. 

      No provision for income taxes has been made in the financial
      statements since the liability for such taxes is that of the partners
      rather than the Partnership.  

      The accounting policies used for tax reporting purposes differ from
      those used for financial reporting as follows: (a) depreciation is
      calculated using accelerated methods; (b) rental income is recognized
      based on the payment terms in the applicable leases; and (c)
      writedowns for impairment of real estate are not deductible.  In
      addition, offering costs are treated differently for tax and
      financial reporting purposes.  The tax basis of the Partnership's
      assets and liabilities is approximately $22.0 million higher than the
      amounts reported for financial statement purposes. 

3.    Partnership Agreement

      The Partnership Agreement provides that distributable cash, as
      defined, will be paid 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the
      General Partners.  

      Sale or financing proceeds will be distributed, to the extent
      available, first, to each Limited Partner, until there has been a
      return of the Limited Partner's capital contribution plus cumulative
      distributions of distributable cash and sale or refinancing proceeds
      in an amount sufficient to provide a 9% cumulative annual return on
      the Limited Partner's adjusted capital contribution.  Thereafter, any
      remaining sale or financing proceeds will be distributed 85% to the
      Limited Partners and 15% to the General Partners after the Managing
      General Partner receives a brokerage fee of up to 3% of the selling
      price of any equity investment.

      Taxable income generally is allocated in the same proportions as
      distributions of distributable cash or sale or financing proceeds. 
      In the event there is no distributable cash or sale or financing
      proceeds, taxable income is allocated 90% to the Limited Partners and
      10% to the General Partners.  Any tax loss is allocated 90% to the
      Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partners.

</TABLE>
      The Partnership owns a 65% general partnership interest in Technology
      Park Associates; the remaining general partnership interest is held
      by an affiliate, Dean Witter Realty Income Partnership III, LP.  

      The Technology Park buildings are 100% leased to a single tenant,
      which is responsible for all operating costs, including real estate
      taxes.  Accordingly, there are no property operating expenses for
      this property in the consolidated statements of income.

      The Partnership owns a 56% general partnership interest in Pasadena
      Lake Associates ("PLA"); the remaining general partnership interest
      in PLA is held by LS Lake Associates, an affiliate of the Managing
      General Partner.  PLA owns an 85% general partnership interest in
      Lake Colorado Associates ("LCA"); the remaining general partnership
      interest in LCA is held by an affiliate of the original seller of the
      property ("PFC").

      LCA's partnership agreement provides for PLA to receive all profits,
      losses and cash flow from both operations and capital transactions
      (except for a special allocation of taxable income to PFC in an
      amount not to exceed $159,000 per year), until PLA has received a
      return of its equity investment and a preferred return thereon as
      defined in the partnership agreement.  Any additional profits and
      cash flow will be distributed 85% to PLA and 15% to PFC.  

      PFC has guaranteed to PLA the repayment of $4.5 million of PLA's
      investment.

      In 1994, the Partnership wrote-off approximately $457,000 of tenant
      improvements and $143,000 of leasing commissions at Pasadena
      Financial Center relating to space given back by the property's
      largest tenant under a restructuring of its lease.

5.    Investments in Joint Ventures

Independent Auditors' Report



To The Partners of
DWR Chesterbrook Associates


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of DWR Chesterbrook
Associates (the "Partnership") as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the
related statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.  Our
audits also included financial statement schedule III.  These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Partnership's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly in all material
respects, the financial position of DWR Chesterbrook Associates as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also,
in our opinion, financial statement schedule III, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                   December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992


1.   Organization

     DWR Chesterbrook Associates (the "Partnership") was formed in 1987
     under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to purchase eight
     of nine office buildings, a parking lot and 75 acres of underlying
     land in the Chesterbrook Corporate Center in Valley Forge,
     Pennsylvania.  The buildings consist of 621,271 net rentable square
     feet.  The property is not encumbered by debt.

     The general partners of the Partnership are Chesterbrook Investment
     Partners, L.P. (67.9%) and Duportail Investment Partners, L.P.
     (32.1%).

     The Partnership Agreement provides that all cash flow, profits,
     losses and credits of the Partnership shall be allocated in
     proportion to the Partners' original capital contributions.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     The Partnership's records are maintained on the accrual basis of
     accounting for financial reporting and tax purposes.

     The carrying value of real estate includes the purchase price paid by
     the Partnership and acquisition fees and expenses.  Costs of
     improvements to the properties are capitalized, and repairs are
     expensed.  Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method.

     Deferred expenses consist of leasing commissions which are amortized
     over the applicable lease terms.

     Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis.

     The Partnership considers short-term investments with original
     maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     No provision for income taxes has been made in the financial
     statements since the liability for such taxes is that of the partners
     rather than the Partnership.

     The accounting policies used for tax reporting purposes differ from
     those used for financial reporting as follows: (a) depreciation is
     calculated using accelerated methods; (b) rental income is recognized
     based on the payment terms in the applicable leases; and (c) payments
     made by the seller of the property in prior years under a rental
     income guaranty were accounted for as rental income.  The tax basis
     of the Partnership's assets and liabilities is approximately $2.1
     million lower than the amounts reported for financial statement
     purposes. 

3.   Lease Commitments

     Minimum future rental income under noncancellable operating leases as
     of December 31, 1994 is as follows:

          Thereafter                                2,464,685

          Total                                   $42,997,476
          </TABLE>
                  
     The Partnership has determined that all leases relating to the
     Property are operating leases.  The terms range from two to ten
     years, and generally provide for fixed minimum rents with rental
     escalation and/or expense reimbursement clauses.

4.   Related Party Transactions

     Beginning in 1993, an affiliate of the partners co-managed five
     buildings at the property.  The Partnership paid the affiliate
     management fees of approximately $58,000 and $61,000 in 1994 and 1993,
     respectively for such services.

     Another affiliate of the general partners earned a fee in 1987 for the
     acquisition of the properties in the amount of $4,258,703.  Of this
     amount, $1,413,167 remains unpaid.
