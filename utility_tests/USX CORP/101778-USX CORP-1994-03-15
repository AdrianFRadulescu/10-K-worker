NOTE ON PRESENTATION

         USX Corporation ("USX" or the "Corporation") is a diversified company
which is principally engaged in the energy business through its Marathon Group,
in the steel business through its U. S. Steel Group and in the gas gathering
and processing business through its Delhi Group.  USX has three classes of
common stock, USX-Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock"), USX-U. S.
Steel Group Common Stock ("Steel Stock") and USX-Delhi Group Common Stock
("Delhi Stock").  The Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock are intended
to provide stockholders with separate securities reflecting the performance of
the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, respectively,
without diminishing the benefits of remaining a single corporation or
restricting future restructuring options.

         USX continues to include consolidated financial information in its
periodic reports required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in its annual
shareholder reports and in other financial communications.  The consolidated
financial statements are supplemented with separate financial statements of the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, together with the
related Management's Discussion and Analyses, descriptions of business and
other financial and business information to the extent such information is
required to be presented in the report being filed.  The financial information
of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, taken
together, includes all accounts which comprise the corresponding consolidated
financial information of USX.

         For consolidated financial reporting purposes, USX's reportable
industry segments correspond with its three groups.  The attribution of assets,
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity among
the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group for the purpose
of preparing their respective financial statements does not affect legal title
to such assets and responsibility for such liabilities.  Holders of Marathon
Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock are holders of common stock of USX and
continue to be subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in USX
and all of its businesses and liabilities.  Financial impacts arising from any
of the groups which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect the
results of operations and financial condition of all groups.  Accordingly, the
USX consolidated financial information should be read in connection with the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial
information.

         For information regarding accounting matters and policies affecting
the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial
statements, see "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to
Financial Statements - 1. Basis of Presentation" and "- 3. Corporate
Activities" for each respective group.  For information regarding dividend
limitations and dividend policies affecting holders of Marathon Stock, Steel
Stock and Delhi Stock, see "Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related
Stockholder Matters".

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

USX CORPORATION

         USX Corporation was incorporated in 1901 and is a Delaware
corporation.  Executive offices are located at 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA
15219-4776.  The terms "USX" and "Corporation" when used herein refer to USX
Corporation or USX Corporation and its subsidiaries, as required by the
context.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

         For consolidated reporting purposes, USX's reportable industry
segments correspond with its three groups.  A description of the groups and
their products and services is as follows:

         o   The Marathon Group is engaged in worldwide exploration,
             production, transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural
             gas; and domestic refining, marketing and transportation of
             petroleum products.

         o   The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, one of the largest
             integrated steel producers in the United States, which is primarily
             engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of steel mill
             products, coke, and taconite pellets.  The U. S. Steel Group also
             includes the management of mineral resources, domestic coal
             mining, engineering and consulting services and technology
             licensing. Other businesses that are part of the U. S. Steel Group
             include real estate development and management, fencing products,
             leasing and financing activities, and a majority interest in a
             titanium metal products company.

         o   The Delhi Group is engaged in the purchasing, gathering,
             processing, transporting and marketing of natural gas.  Data with
             respect to the Delhi Group for periods prior to October 2, 1992,
             represent the historical financial data of the businesses included
             in the Delhi Group.  Such data for periods prior to that date are
             included in the Marathon Group.

         With respect to the number of active employees reported for each of
the groups, USX Headquarters employees, whose functions are of a corporate
nature not directly attributable to a specific group, are excluded from the
total number of employees reported for each group.  The total number of such
USX Headquarters employees at year-end was 292 in 1993, 364 in 1992 and 507 in
1991.  The reduction in total number of such employees between 1991 and 1993
primarily reflected a reorganization in August 1992 which resulted in certain
USX Headquarters employees being reclassified as U. S. Steel Group employees.

         The oil and gas industry is characterized by a large number of
companies, none of which is dominant within the industry but a number of which
have greater resources than Marathon.  Marathon must compete with these
companies for the rights to explore for oil and gas.  Acquiring the more
attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids
involving substantial front-end bonus payments or commitments to work programs.
Based on 1992 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, as
compiled by Oil & Gas Journal, Marathon ranked 13th among U.S. based
petroleum corporations.  Marathon believes it has 28 primary U.S. based
exploration and production competitors, and a much larger number worldwide.
Marathon must also compete with these and many other companies to acquire crude
oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full
array of petroleum products.  Based on the U. S. Department of Energy's
PETROLEUM SUPPLY ANNUAL for 1992, which is the most recent year for which such
information is available and which was published prior to the 1993 temporary
idling of Marathon's 50,000 barrel per day Indianapolis refinery, Marathon
ranked seventh among U. S. petroleum corporations on the basis of crude oil
refining capacity.  In addition, Marathon ranked tenth in refined product sales
based on 1992 data published by NATIONAL PETROLEUM NEWS.  Marathon competes in
three separate markets for the sale of refined products.  Marathon
believes that it competes with primarily 37 companies in the wholesale
distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large
commercial and industrial consumers; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of
branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and over 1,000 petroleum
product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products.  Marathon also
competes in the convenience store industry through its retail market outlets.

         The Marathon Group's operating results are affected by price changes
in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products as well as changes in
competitive conditions in the markets it serves.  Generally, operating results
from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices
while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil
price increases, depending upon market conditions.

         The total number of active Marathon Group employees at year-end was
21,914 in 1993, 22,509 in 1992 and 24,352 in 1991.  The reduction in the total
number of employees between 1991 and 1993 reflected the exclusion in 1992 of
employees of the businesses of the Delhi Group, the consolidation of several
production and marketing offices, the closing of marginal retail outlets, the
temporary idling of Marathon's Indianapolis refinery in 1993 and improved
operating efficiencies.  In addition, Marathon implemented early retirement and
termination programs which resulted in the reduction of nearly 500 employees
during 1992.

         Certain Marathon hourly employees at two of its four operating
refineries and various other locations are represented by labor unions.  Such
employees at the Detroit refinery are represented by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters under a labor agreement which will expire on November
15, 1994.  Such employees at the Texas City refinery are represented by the
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union under a labor agreement which expires on
March 31, 1996.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

         Marathon is currently conducting exploration and development
activities in 16 countries, including the United States.  Principal exploration
activities are in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Bolivia, Gabon, Tunisia, Egypt and the Netherlands.  Principal development
activities are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Norway and Egypt.

         Exploration activities during 1993 resulted in discoveries in the
United Kingdom, Egypt and the United States (both onshore and the Gulf of
Mexico).

         The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the number of net

(a)  Includes the number of wells completed during the year regardless of when
     drilling was initiated.  Completion refers to the installation of
     permanent equipment for the production of oil or gas or, in the case of a
     dry well, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.
(b)  The fluctuations between years primarily reflected a reduction in domestic
     drilling activity in 1992 followed by increased activity in 1993.

UNITED STATES

         Exploration wells completed in the United States during 1993 totaled
32 gross wells (23 net wells) consisting of wildcat and delineation wells.
Principal domestic exploration and development activities were in the U. S.
Gulf of Mexico and the states of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Wyoming.

         Exploration expenses during the three years ended December 31, 1993,
totaled $240 million in the United States, of which $60 million was incurred in
1993.  Development expenditures during the three years ended December 31, 1993,
totaled $543 million in the United States, of which $233 million was incurred
in 1993.

         The following is a summary of recent, significant exploration and
development activity in the United States including discussion, as deemed
appropriate, of completed wells, drilling wells and wells under evaluation.

         Platform fabrication begun in 1992 to develop the Ewing Bank 873 Block
in the Gulf of Mexico was approximately 70% completed by year-end 1993.  The
Ewing Bank 873 discovery well was drilled in early 1991 and tested at 2,400
gross barrels per day ("bpd").  Three delineation wells were completed in 1992
establishing an oil column of 2,300 feet.  First production is planned for late
1994 and is expected to peak at 27,000 gross bpd of oil and 18 gross million
cubic feet per day ("mmcfd") of gas.  Marathon is the operator and has a 66.7%
working interest in this development which is located in 775 feet of water.





                                       6
<PAGE>   8
         Development options are being evaluated for an exploratory well
drilled in 1993.  The well was drilled in 1,900 feet of water at Ewing Bank
1006, located ten miles south of Ewing Bank 873.  The well encountered 77 feet
of oil sand and tested at a rate of 1,200 gross bpd of oil and 0.7 gross mmcfd
of natural gas.  Marathon is the operator and has a 33.3% working interest in
the well.

         Initial development drilling was completed on South Pass 86 Platform
"C" in 1993.  A total of seven wells were producing at December 31, 1993.
Production in 1993 averaged 7,100 gross bpd of oil and 34 gross mmcfd of
natural gas.  Natural gas production is expected to be maintained at about the
1993 level until the year 2000, then rise to a peak of approximately 70 gross 
mmcfd.  Marathon is the operator and has a 25% working interest in this 
property.

         At South Pass 87, drilling in 1992 and 1993 confirmed the presence of
gas and condensates with an associated oil reservoir discovered in 1991.  The
total hydrocarbon column is approximately 2,500 feet.  The No. 4 well was
tested in 1992 at a rate of 2,590 gross bpd of oil and 4.6 gross mmcfd of gas.
Two delineation wells drilled in early 1994 from the South Pass 87 template to
bottom hole locations on West Delta Block 128 and South Pass Block 88,
encountered 222 feet and 60 feet of net gas/condensate pay, respectively. An
additional well is planned for 1994.  Fabrication of "platform D" is
scheduled to commence in 1994 and first production is planned for 1995.
Marathon is the operator and has a 33.3% working interest in South Pass 87,
which is located in 375 feet of water, and a 50% working interest in West Delta
128 and South Pass 88.

         In 1992, Marathon announced that a discovery well drilled on South
Marsh Island Block 192, offshore Louisiana encountered 65 feet of net gas pay.
A subsea completion is tentatively scheduled by the third-party operator for
late 1994 with first production in early 1995.  Marathon has a 33.3% working
interest in this block, which is located in 394 feet of water.

         In the first quarter of 1993, Marathon drilled two successful gas
wells in East Texas.  The Lewis #1 well found 57 feet of net gas and condensate
pay in multiple zones.  The timing of initial sales from the well is contingent
upon the construction of a necessary treatment facility and further development
of the area.  The Poth #1 well found over 300 feet of net gas pay in the Cotton
Valley.  Initial sales from this well totaled 21 gross mmcfd.  Additional three
dimensional seismic data is being acquired in preparation for drilling in this
area in 1994.  Marathon has a 100% working interest in both of these
discoveries.

         In 1993, Marathon drilled 11 gross horizontal wells (11 net wells) in
the Austin Chalk formation, of which 9 were commercially productive.

         During 1993, development activities in northern Louisiana and southern
Arkansas continued with the drilling of seven gross wells (five net wells) in
the established Shongaloo/Red Rock, Haynesville and Springhill Fields.  Gas
cycling projects were commenced in the Shongaloo/Red Rock Field in 1991 and the
Haynesville Field in mid-1992, to enhance ultimate recovery.

         Contract Drilling--FWA Drilling Company, Inc. owns 28 onshore rotary
drilling rigs operating in the state of Texas.

INTERNATIONAL 

         In 1993, Marathon drilled 13 gross wildcat and delineation wells (7
net wells) in seven countries.  Of the 13 wells, 3 encountered hydrocarbons:  2
in the United Kingdom and 1 in Egypt.  Significant net exploration acreage was
obtained by Marathon during 1993 in the United Kingdom (269,687 acres), Ireland
(178,055 acres) and Egypt (41,143 acres).

         Marathon's expenses for international oil and natural gas exploration
activities during the three years ended December 31, 1993, totaled $256
million, of which $85 million was incurred in 1993.  Marathon's international
development expenditures during the three years ended December 31, 1993,
totaled $1.1 billion, of which $319 million was incurred in 1993.  Development
expenditures during this three-year period included $696 million for the
development of the East Brae Field and construction of the Scottish Area Gas
Evacuation ("SAGE") system.  Marathon expects continued expenditures on
international projects.

         U. K. NORTH SEA--Marathon is continuing its development of the Brae
area in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea where it is the operator and
owns a 41.6% revenue interest in the South, Central and North Brae Fields and a
39.1% revenue interest in the East Brae Field.  Marathon has interests in 28
blocks in the U.K. North Sea.





                                       7
<PAGE>   9
         A 1992 appraisal well of the 1987 Middle Jurassic Beinn gas condensate
discovery has been the subject of a U.K. Government approved production test
since December 1992.  A second delineation/development well was drilled in 1993
to the Beinn reservoir, and was initially completed in the shallower, Upper
Jurassic formation adjacent to the North Brae field.  Following depletion 
of that reservoir, the well will be completed as a Beinn development well.  
Marathon began drilling a third Beinn delineation/development well in late 
1993 which is scheduled for completion in 1994.  Formal U.K. Government 
approval to develop the field was received in February 1994.  Marathon has 
a 41.6% revenue interest in these discoveries.  See "Oil and Natural Gas 
Production - International - North Sea" for a description of Brae 
production operations.

         East Brae is a gas condensate field and the largest field yet
discovered by Marathon in the Brae area.  Liquid hydrocarbon production
commenced in late December 1993 and is expected to reach 115,000 gross bpd by
late 1994.  Gross estimated reserves exceed 300 million barrels of liquids and
1.5 trillion cubic feet ("tcf") of natural gas.  Marathon classified its share
of these reserves as proved in 1990.  The East Brae design and development
program is projected to require a gross investment of $1.5 billion, of which
Marathon's share is $620 million, 90% of which was expended as of December 31,
1993.

         Participation in the SAGE system will provide pipeline transportation
for Brae gas.  The Brae group owns 50% of SAGE, which will have a wet gas
capacity of 1.2 gross billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day.  The other 50% is
owned by the Beryl group which operates the system.  The 30-inch pipeline will
connect the Brae and Beryl Fields to a gas processing terminal at St. Fergus in
northeast Scotland.  Construction of the Brae phase of this project is
complete and commissioning of gas processing facilities will be concluded in
1994.  Gross project costs approximate $1.2 billion, of which Marathon's share
is approximately $280 million.  Marathon has entered into agreements for the
sale of more than 1.1 gross tcf of Brae area gas (615 net bcf).  As a result,
approximately 205 gross mmcfd (112 net mmcfd ) will be supplied under separate
gas contracts to U.K. utilities over 15 years, commencing in late 1994.

         EGYPT--Marathon has rejoined a  Nile Delta exploration effort by
agreeing to a three well drilling program.  The first of these wells was a
successful exploration well drilled and tested in 1993 on the Abu Madi West
Development Lease seven miles northwest of Marathon's joint-interest El Qar'a
Gas Field.  The well's production potential and opportunities for delineation
are being evaluated.  Marathon has a 25% working interest in the El Qar'a
Northwest discovery.  Also in the Nile Delta area, contract negotiations
are underway for exploration of the 840,000 acre El Manzala Block.

         RUSSIA--During 1993, significant progress was made on the Sakhalin
project.  An international consortium, led by Marathon, neared completion of
negotiations on a Production Sharing Contract for the development of the
Lunskoye gas field and the Piltun-Astokhskoye oil field.  Marathon has a 30%
equity interest in the consortium.  It is anticipated that the consortium will
form a joint venture company which is expected to sign the Production Sharing
Contract in 1994.  Any commitment of the joint venture company will be
conditioned upon the adoption of a set of laws, regulations and permits by the
necessary Russian authorities such that the Production Sharing Contract would
essentially have the force of law.  The proposed Production Sharing Contract
initially provides for appraisal periods of 2 to 3 years for the oil field and
3 to 5 years for the gas field.  According to Russian experts, these two fields
contain reserves of 750 million barrels of oil and condensate and 14 tcf of
natural gas.

         INDONESIA--On December 31, 1992, the Plan of Development ("POD")for 
the Kakap KRA and KG oil fields in the South China Sea was approved by the 
Indonesian Government. This project will develop an estimated 50 million gross
barrels of oil through existing infrastructure.  A contract was awarded in 
November 1993 for the engineering, construction and installation of the 
platforms, facilities and pipelines along with connection to existing 
production facilities in the Kakap Block.  First oil is anticipated in 
April 1995 and production is expected to peak at an estimated 50,000 gross 
bpd of oil later that year.  Marathon is the operator and has a 37.5% 
working interest in this development.

         IRELAND--In 1993, Marathon drilled the second and third wells in a
seven well exploratory drilling program required by a 1991 agreement between
Marathon and the Irish Government.  None of the wells drilled to date
encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.

         BOLIVIA--Marathon earned, subject to government approval, a 50%
working interest in a six million acre concession in Bolivia by completing a
seismic program in 1993.  The first exploratory well is tentatively scheduled
for late 1994.

         AUSTRALIA--During 1993, Marathon continued an exploration program in
two blocks in Zone-of-Cooperation "A" located between Indonesia and Australia
in the Timor Gap.  An exploratory drilling program is currently planned for
1994 in both blocks.

         TUNISIA--Marathon plans to drill three exploratory wells in 1994, 
two in the Grombalia Block and one in the Cap Bon Block.

         GABON--Marathon began work on the Kowe permit (offshore block F-89)
awarded in 1992.  A seismic program was conducted during 1993 in anticipation
of a one well drilling program in late 1994.  Marathon has a 75% working
interest in the block which is located approximately 90 miles southeast of Port
Gentil.

         SYRIA--Marathon is awaiting approval of a POD submitted to the 
Syria Petroleum Company in May 1993, for the development of Marathon's gas 
reserves in the Palmyra Block.  Negotiation of a gas sales agreement would be 
required following approval of the POD.

         NETHERLANDS--Marathon, through its 50% equity interest in CLAM
Petroleum Company ("CLAM"), drilled one well during 1993 in Block K11 in the
Netherlands North Sea.  Two additional wells are planned for 1994, one in Block
E18 which was awarded in 1993 and one in Block L13 in the existing joint
development area.

         At December 31, 1993, the Marathon Group's combined net proved
reserves of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas were approximately 1.5 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, of which approximately 85% were proved developed
reserves and 15% were proved undeveloped reserves.  (Natural gas reserves are
converted to barrels of oil equivalent using a conversion factor of six
thousand cubic feet ("mcf") of natural gas to one barrel of oil.)    Net proved
reserves are located principally in the United States, the U.K. North Sea, the
Irish Celtic Sea, the Norwegian North Sea and North Africa.  Liquid
hydrocarbons represented approximately 57% of combined net proved reserves.

(c) For a description of CLAM, see "International - North Sea" below.

         Marathon is currently producing crude oil and/or natural gas in eight
countries, including the United States.  Marathon's 1993 liquid hydrocarbon
production averaged 156,000 net bpd, down 18,000 net bpd from the prior year.
The domestic decline of 7,000 net bpd largely reflected natural declines and
property sales.  The 11,000 net bpd decline in international production was
primarily attributable to natural declines at the North, South and Central Brae
Fields in the U.K. sector of the North Sea and a required four-week shut-in of
Brae operations for maintenance of third-party platforms and pipelines.  An
increase in domestic production is expected in 1994 and 1995 attributable to
offshore U. S. Gulf Coast projects, while previously mentioned declines in
international production will be more than offset by new U.K. East Brae 
production (which commenced in late December 1993), along with planned new 
production from the Indonesia KRA/KG development.

         Natural gas production, including Marathon's equity share of CLAM's
production, averaged 937 net mmcfd for 1993.  Net natural gas production in the
U.S. declined by 11% in 1993 as a result of asset sales and natural declines,
but is expected to remain stable  at least through 1995 as natural declines are
offset by increased drilling activity.  International natural gas production
increased by 10% in 1993 with further increases expected in 1994 and 1995
primarily due to Brae area gas sales which are contracted to commence in the
fourth quarter of 1994.

UNITED STATES

         Approximately 71% of Marathon's 1993 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon
production and equity liftings and 56% of worldwide natural gas production were
from domestic operations.  The principal domestic producing areas are located
in Texas, Wyoming, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.

         TEXAS--Marathon owns a 49.48% working interest in, and is the operator
of, the Yates Field Unit, one of the largest fields in the United States.
Marathon's 22,000 net bpd of 1993 liquid hydrocarbon production from the Yates
Field and Gas Plant accounted for 20% of Marathon's total U.S. production.  The
field's average annual production declined less than 3% during 1993,





                                       11
<PAGE>   13
which  was the first year since 1985 that the field's production rate at
year-end exceeded the production rate at the beginning of the year.  The
field's average annual production declined by 9% in 1992, 8% in 1991 and 19% in
1990.  Marathon continues to apply new technologies in the Yates Field to
further extend production life and maximize oil recovery and profitability.

         WYOMING--Since operations began in 1912, Marathon has produced over
one billion gross barrels of oil in the state and was the leading oil producer
in 1993.  Production for 1993 averaged 27,200 net bpd representing 25% of
Marathon's total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon production.  Continuing development of
mature fields such as Oregon Basin, the state's largest  oil producing field,
combined with developments in other fields have offset most recent production
declines.  Marathon continues to apply enhanced recovery and reservoir
management programs and cost containment efforts to maximize oil recovery and
profitability.

         GULF OF MEXICO--During 1993, Marathon produced 10,500 net bpd of
liquid hydrocarbons and 99 net mmcfd of natural gas in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
representing a 9% increase in liquid hydrocarbon production and a 25% decline
in natural gas production from the prior year.  Approximately 50% of the
decline in natural gas production was due to property sales.  At year-end 1993,
Marathon held working interests in 14 fields producing from 31 platforms, 23 of
which Marathon operates.  The Gulf of Mexico remains an area of prime
importance to Marathon with new production platforms planned for the Ewing Bank
873 Field in 1994 and the South Pass 87 development in 1995.  See "Oil and
Natural Gas Exploration and Development -- United States" above.

         ALASKA--Marathon has interests in seven of the 15 drilling and
production platforms in the Cook Inlet, and operates four of the platforms .
The McArthur River Field, located in the Cook Inlet, continues to be Marathon's
largest field in Alaska.  In 1993, the Steelhead platform, the largest platform
in Cook Inlet, produced an average of 152 gross mmcfd of natural gas, a decline
of 11% from the prior year due primarily to reduced demand.  Development 
drilling in the McArthur River Field, in which Marathon has a 51% working 
interest, is planned to continue in 1994.

INTERNATIONAL

         Interests in liquid hydrocarbon and/or natural gas production are held
in the U.K. North Sea, Ireland, the Norwegian North Sea, Indonesia, Tunisia and
Egypt.  In addition, Marathon has an equity interest in the Netherlands North
Sea.

         NORTH SEA--Marathon's crude oil and natural gas liquids liftings from
the North, South and Central Brae Fields for 1993 averaged 23,300 net bpd
compared with 34,400 net bpd in 1992.  Liftings for 1993 from the maturing
South Brae Field averaged 4,200 net bpd compared with 5,200 net bpd in 1992 and
8,400 net bpd in 1991.  The South Brae platform also serves as a vital link in
generating third-party pipeline tariff revenue.  To date, production from seven
third-party fields is contracted to the Brae pipeline system.  Five of the
fields are currently onstream, one is expected to be placed onstream in 1994
and another is scheduled to be brought on in 1996.

         North Brae is a maturing gas condensate field and continues to be
developed using the gas cycling technique.  This technique separates natural
gas liquids and returns the dry gas to the reservoir for pressure maintenance,
increasing the overall liquids recovery.  During 1993, liftings, including
production from the previously mentioned Beinn discovery processed by North
Brae facilities, totaled 14,100 net bpd compared with 21,600 net bpd and 28,400
net bpd in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

         Central Brae is a multi-well subsea development tied to South Brae
facilities.  Liftings averaged 5,000 net bpd in 1993 compared with 7,600 net
bpd in 1992 and 5,300 net bpd in 1991.

         East Brae production commenced in late December 1993 and is expected
to reach 115,000 gross bpd (45,000 net bpd) late 1994.

         Marathon holds an interest in the V-Fields gas development in the
Southern Basin of the U.K. North Sea.  Marathon's sales from the V-Fields
averaged 22 net mmcfd in 1993 compared with 18 net mmcfd in 1992 and 33 net
mmcfd in 1991.  The changes in average equity production during the three-year
period primarily reflected fluctuations in customer demand.

         In the Norwegian North Sea, Marathon has a 24% working interest in the
Heimdal Field with sales of 75 net mmcfd of natural gas and 2,000 net bpd of
condensate in 1993.

         Marathon's 50% equity interest in CLAM,  a natural gas and gas liquids
producer in the Netherlands North Sea, provides a 6% entitlement in the
production of 16 gas fields which provided sales of 35 net mmcfd of natural gas
in 1993.

         IRELAND--Marathon owns a 100% working interest in the Kinsale Head and
Ballycotton Fields in the Celtic Sea.  Combined sales of natural gas averaged
258 net mmcfd, 227 net mmcfd and 230 net mmcfd in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.  Four compressors were installed at Kinsale Head, two in each of
1992 and 1993, to increase the deliverability from the fields.

         TUNISIA--Marathon has a 50% working interest in the
Belli Field which is located 30 miles southeast of Tunis.  Liftings averaged
5,900 net bpd of oil in 1993 compared with 6,500 net bpd in 1992.  

         Marathon also owns a 31% interest in the Ezzaouia Field, located 220
miles south of Tunis.  Liftings from this field averaged 2,300 net bpd in 1993,
a decline of 45% from the prior year due to natural declines.

         INDONESIA--Marathon operates and has a 37.5% working interest in two
producing fields (KH and KF) in the Kakap Block in the Natuna Sea.  The fields
produce into a floating production and storage tanker.  Liftings from
Marathon's Kakap Block averaged 3,300 net bpd in 1993, a decline of 35% from
the prior year primarily reflecting natural declines.

         EGYPT--Marathon has interests in three fields in Egypt.  Liftings from
the Ashrafi field, in which Marathon has a 50% working interest, averaged 5,500
net bpd of oil in 1993.  Marathon has a 25% working interest in the El Qar'a
Gas field which had average production of 17 net mmcfd of natural gas and 500
net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 1993.  Marathon also has a 50% working
interest in, and is the operator of, the Gazwarina field which had average 1993
crude oil liftings of 300 net bpd of oil.

         ABU DHABI--Effective December 31, 1993, Marathon relinquished its
interest in the Arzanah Oil Field in Abu Dhabi.  Liftings from this field
averaged 1,800 net bpd of crude oil in 1993.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

         Marathon's refining, marketing and transportation ("RM&T") operations
are geographically concentrated in the Midwest and Southeast.  This regional
focus allows Marathon to achieve operating efficiencies between its integrated
refining and distribution systems and its marketing operations.

REFINING 

         Marathon is a leading domestic petroleum refiner with 620,000 bpd of
combined stated crude oil refining capacity.  Marathon's refining system
operated at 90% of its in-use capacity in 1993.

         The following table sets forth the location and rated throughput
capacity of each of Marathon's refineries at December 31, 1993:

- - ------------------------
(a)  Temporarily idled in October 1993.

        Marathon's five refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges to
maximize operating efficiency.  The transportation links that connect the
refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations
and the production of higher margin products.  For example, naphtha is moved
from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available.  Gas
oil is moved from Robinson to Detroit, which allows the Detroit refinery to
upgrade diesel fuel to gasoline, using excess fluid catalytic cracking unit
capacity.  Raffinate, a low-octane, low-vapor pressure stream, is moved from
Texas City to Robinson, where it is used to maximize production of blend-grade
fuels.  Light cycle oil is also moved from Texas City to Robinson, for sulfur
removal.

        In October 1993, Marathon temporarily idled its 50,000 bpd Indianapolis
refinery due to unfavorable plant economics and increased environmental
spending requirements.  The idling had no adverse impact on Marathon's supply
of transportation fuels to its various classes of trade in Indiana or to its
Midwest marketing area.

        During 1993, Marathon completed installation of desulfurization
facilities at its Detroit, Garyville and Robinson refineries, which enable
Marathon to meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA")
standards limiting the sulfur content of highway transportation fuels.

        Of the nine cities that will require reformulated gasoline by 1995
under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, only two, Chicago and
Milwaukee, are in Marathon's marketing area, although other areas may opt into
the program.  Moreover, an insignificant share of Marathon's sales are in
carbon monoxide non-attainment areas where oxygenated fuels were required
effective November 1992.  Marathon has oxygenate units - methyl tertiary butyl
ether ("MTBE") units - at its Detroit and Robinson refineries.  See
"Environmental Matters" below.

MARKETING

        In 1993, Marathon achieved record refined product sales volumes
(excluding matching buy/sell transactions) of 10.4 billion gallons, which
reflected an increase of 4% from the previous record in 1992.  Excluding sales
related to matching buy/sell transactions, wholesale distribution of petroleum
products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial





                                       15
<PAGE>   17
consumers, primarily located in the Midwest and Southeast, accounted for about
61% of Marathon's marketing volume in 1993.  Approximately 44% of Marathon's
gasoline volumes and 74% of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale
basis to independent unbranded customers in 1993.

        As of December 31, 1993, Marathon supplied petroleum products to 2,331
Marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, 
Kentucky and Illinois.  Substantially all Marathon branded petroleum products 
are sold to independent dealers and jobbers.  In addition, Marathon branded 
operations are being expanded into areas in proximity to Marathon's existing 
terminal and transportation system where new accounts can be supplied at 
minimal incremental cost.  At December 31, 1993, Marathon supplied 195 
stations in states outside its traditional branded marketing territory 
including Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Wisconsin, North Carolina 
and Pennsylvania.

        Retail sales of gasoline and diesel fuel are also made through limited
and self-service stations and truck stops in 15 states.  These facilities are
operated by a wholly owned subsidiary, Emro Marketing Company ("Emro"), which
sells products primarily under the brand names "Speedway", "United", "Bonded",
"Cheker", "Gastown", "Wake Up", "Port", "Starvin' Marvin" and "Ecol".  A
majority of the retail outlets also sell convenience store items.  As of
December 31, 1993, this subsidiary had 1,568 retail outlets, including 36
retail outlets marketing under the name "Wake Up".  Marathon increased its 50%
ownership interest in Wake Up Oil Co. to 100% in December 1993.  Also, in
December 1993, Emro signed a letter of intent to acquire 36 retail outlets in
the Greater Chicago and Northern Indiana areas, from a leading independent
retailer.  The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of
1994.

        Emro has made substantial progress in streamlining its operations and
reducing costs during the three-year period ended December 31, 1993.  To
enhance profitability, Emro closed 139 marginal outlets during this period.
Petroleum product sales volumes have increased slightly over this period,
despite the reduced number of outlets.  In 1993, Emro sold the assets of a
subsidiary, Bosart Co., which consisted primarily of a convenience store
distribution warehouse facility in Springfield, OH.

        Emro, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Emro Propane Company,
distributes propane to residential heating and industrial consumers through 98
bulk plants (including 42 satellite branches) located in Michigan, Illinois,
Ohio and Indiana under the brand names "Fuelgas", "Bonded Propane" and "Emro
Propane".

SUPPLY AND TRANSPORTATION

        Marathon obtains nearly 70% of its crude oil feedstocks from North and
South America and the balance primarily from the Middle East, the North Sea and
West Africa.  In 1993, Marathon was a net purchaser of 440,000 bpd of crude 
oil from both domestic and international sources, including approximately 
165,000 bpd obtained from the Middle East.

        Marathon's strategy in acquiring raw materials for its refineries is to
obtain supply from secure, long-term sources.  Marathon generally sells its
international equity production into local markets, but has the ability to
satisfy about 80% of its requirements from a combination of its international
equity crude and current supply arrangements in the Western Hemisphere.

        Marathon operates a system of terminals, trucks and pipelines to
provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to marketing outlets.
Fifty-one terminals are strategically located throughout the Midwest and
Southeast, providing petroleum products to its marketing areas.  During late
1993 and early 1994, Marathon installed automated fuel dye-injection equipment
at 30 of these terminals in order to facilitate the sale of low-sulfur fuel
oils for tax-exempt uses.  The dye injection equipment was installed to comply
with a January 1, 1994, requirement that terminal operators collect and remit
federal excise taxes on all fuels suitable for use as on-highway diesel fuel,
unless the fuel is dyed to indicate its tax-exempt status.

        In 1993, Marathon sold two tug/barge units totaling approximately
39,000 deadweight tons, which previously served waterborne refined product
terminals in the Southeast.

        Marathon, through a wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Pipe Line Company
("MPLC"), owns and operates, as a common carrier, approximately 1,100 miles of
crude oil gathering lines; 1,500 miles of crude oil trunk lines; and 1,500
miles of products trunk lines.  MPLC also owns interests in various pipeline
systems, including approximately 11% of the Capline system, a large diameter
crude pipeline extending from St. James, LA to Patoka, IL.  Additionally, MPLC
owns approximately 32% of LOOP INC. which is the owner and operator of the only
U.S. deepwater oil port.  LOOP is located off the coast of Louisiana.  Marathon





                                       16

holds equity interests in a number of pipeline companies, including
approximately 17% of the Explorer Pipeline Company, which operates a light
products pipeline system extending from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest, and 2.5%
of the Colonial Pipeline Company, which operates a light products pipeline
system extending from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast.

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

        Liquefied natural gas ("LNG") is manufactured at the Kenai, AK gas
liquefication plant, in which Marathon has a 30% equity interest, from a
portion of Marathon's natural gas production in Alaska for delivery to two
Japanese utilities under a contract which was renewed in April 1989 for a 15
year period.  Marathon has a 30% participation in this contract which calls for
sales of more than 900 gross bcf over the contract life.  During 1993, LNG
deliveries totaled 56.0 gross bcf (17.0 net bcf), up from 52.5 gross bcf in
1992.  Two new LNG tankers, each of which had greater capacity than the one it
replaced, were chartered and placed in service in 1993.

NATURAL GAS UTILITIES

        Carnegie Natural Gas Company ("Carnegie") is an interstate pipeline
company engaged in the transportation and sale-for-resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce.  In addition, Carnegie functions as a local distribution
company serving residential, commercial and industrial customers in West
Virginia and western Pennsylvania.  Carnegie is a supplier and transporter of
natural gas for U. S. Steel's Mon Valley Works near Pittsburgh.  Apollo Gas
Company ("Apollo") is engaged in the distribution of natural gas to
residential, commercial and industrial customers in western Pennsylvania.

        Both Carnegie and Apollo are regulated as public utilities by state
commissions within their service areas.  Carnegie is also regulated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as an interstate pipeline.  Total natural
gas throughput for Carnegie and Apollo was 37 bcf in 1993, 33 bcf in 1992 and
25 bcf in 1991.

        Property, plant and equipment additions, including capital leases,
have been primarily for the replacement, modernization and expansion of 
facilities and production capabilities including: development of the Brae 
Fields and the related SAGE pipeline system in the U. K. North Sea; refinery 
modifications at Robinson, Garyville and Detroit (including the construction 
of facilities required to meet federal low-sulfur diesel requirements); and 
environmental controls.  For information concerning capital expenditures for 
environmental controls in 1993, 1992, and 1991 and estimated capital 
expenditures for such purposes in 1994 and 1995, see "Environmental Matters" 
below.

        Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for the Marathon Group
were $723 million, $787 million and $870 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

        The research and development activities of the Marathon Group are
conducted mainly at Marathon's Petroleum Technology Center in Littleton, CO.
Expenditures by Marathon for research and development were $19 million in each
of 1993 and 1992 and $22 million in 1991.

        Activities at the Petroleum Technology Center are devoted primarily to
assisting Marathon's operating organizations in finding, producing and
processing oil and gas efficiently and economically.  Current efforts include
new concepts in regional geological interpretation, enhanced seismic
interpretation, development of computer-based techniques for reservoir
description and performance modeling, methods to improve production and
injection well performance and enhanced oil recovery techniques.  The staff at
the Petroleum Technology Center also provides a broad range of technical
assistance and consultation to Marathon's RM&T operating organizations,
including refinery process optimization.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

        The Marathon Group maintains a comprehensive environmental policy
overseen by the Public Policy Committee of the USX Board of Directors.  The
Environmental Affairs, Health and Safety organization has the responsibility to
ensure that the Marathon Group's operating organizations maintain environmental
compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Health, Environmental and Safety Management Committee, which is comprised
of officers of the group, is charged with reviewing its overall performance
with various environmental compliance programs.  Also, the Marathon Group has
formed the Emergency Management Team, composed of senior management, which will
oversee the response to any major emergency environmental incident throughout
the group.

        The Marathon Group participates in the "Strategies for Today's
Environmental Partnership" program, sponsored by the American Petroleum
Institute, which is designed to improve the environmental performance of the
petroleum industry.  Additionally, since 1987, the Marathon Group has reduced
the volume of toxic releases reported under the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Section 313) by 50%, primarily through recycling,
process changes and chemical substitutions.

        The businesses of the Marathon Group are subject to numerous federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment.  These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air
Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with
respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and
disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous
substances, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil
pollution and response.  In addition, many states where the Marathon Group
operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters.  These laws are
constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent.  The ultimate impact
of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or
determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for
laws such as RCRA and the CAA have not yet been promulgated or in certain
instances are undergoing revision.  These environmental laws and regulations,
particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and new water quality standards,
could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance
costs. For a discussion of environmental expenditures, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" for the Marathon Group.

        The Marathon Group has incurred and will continue to incur substantial
capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
environmental laws and regulations.  In recent years, these expenditures have
increased primarily due to required product reformulation and process changes
in order to meet CAA requirements, although ongoing compliance costs have also
been significant.  To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not
ultimately reflected in the prices of the Marathon Group's products and
services, operating results will be adversely affected.  The Marathon Group
believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar
environmental laws and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each
competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and
location of their operating facilities, their production processes and whether
or not they are engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine
transportation of crude oil.

AIR

        The 1990 Amendments to the CAA impose more stringent limits on air
emissions, establish a federally mandated operating permit program and allow
for enhanced civil and criminal enforcement sanctions.  The principal impact of
the 1990





                                       18
<PAGE>   20
Amendments to the CAA on the Marathon Group is on RM&T operations.  The
amendments establish attainment deadlines and control requirements based on the
severity of air pollution in a geographical area.  Under the 1990 Amendments to
the CAA, refiners were required to lower the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
produced for highway transportation use effective October 1993; "reformulated
gasoline" is required by 1995 in the nine metropolitan areas classified as
severe or extreme for ozone non-attainment and other ozone non-attainment areas
may elect to opt into the reformulated gasoline program.

        Marathon will have the capability to produce about 25% of its gasoline 
output as reformulated fuels to comply with the CAA.  This amount is well above
Marathon's requirements within its marketing area. A major cost of 
reformulation will be the mandated use of oxygenates in gasoline.  Marathon has 
constructed MTBE complexes at its Detroit and Robinson refineries.  The 
decision to construct additional complexes is affected by uncertainties 
regarding the EPA's final regulations governing reformulated gasoline and 
whether particular oxygenates will be mandated or supported with economic
incentives.

        In addition to the foregoing, refueling controls are required on fuel
dispensers (so called Stage II Recovery) at gasoline stations located in ozone
non-attainment areas classified as moderate, serious, severe and extreme.  The
potential impact of the requirement may be reduced as a result of a recent
EPA decision requiring vehicles to be equipped with on-board vapor recovery
systems.  Nevertheless, individual states could elect to maintain the
requirement for refueling controls.  Marathon may be required to install
equipment at up to 700 gasoline stations.

WATER

        The Marathon Group maintains numerous discharge permits as required
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA,
and has implemented systems to oversee its compliance efforts.  In addition,
the Marathon Group is regulated under OPA-90 which amended the CWA.  Among
other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a
facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to discharges of oil or
hazardous substances.  Also, in case of such spills, OPA-90 requires
responsible companies to pay removal costs and damages caused by them, provides
for substantial civil penalties, and imposes criminal sanctions for violations
of this law.  Unlike many of its competitors within the oil industry, Marathon
does not operate tank vessels, and therefore, has significantly less exposure
under OPA-90 than competitors who do operate tank vessels. However, it
does operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could
occur.  Furthermore, several coastal states in which Marathon operates have
passed or are expected to pass state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded
liability provisions, including provisions for cargo owners as well as
shipowners.  Marathon has implemented approximately 50 emergency oil response
plans for all its components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and it is an
active member, along with other oil companies, in the Marine Preservation
Association, which funds the Marine Spill Recovery Corporation, a major oil
spill response organization covering a number of U.S. coastal areas.

SOLID WASTE 

        The Marathon Group continues to seek methods to minimize the generation
of hazardous wastes in its operations.  RCRA establishes standards for the
management of solid and hazardous wastes.  Besides affecting current waste
disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain
past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of
underground storage tanks ("USTs") containing regulated substances.
Since the EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all
provisions of RCRA and has not yet made clear the practical application of all
the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of
compliance cannot be accurately estimated.  In addition, new laws are being
enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a
continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be
broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined.
Corrective action under RCRA related to past waste disposal activities is
discussed under "Remediation" below.

REMEDIATION 

        The Marathon Group operates certain gasoline stations where, during the
normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have
occurred.  Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such
releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable
standards.  The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been
delegated to the states which administer their own UST programs.  The Marathon
Group's obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending upon the
extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the
states in which it operates.  A portion of these remediation costs can be
recovered from state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable





                                       19
<PAGE>   21
deductibles have been satisfied.  Accruals for remediation expenses are
established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the
amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable.

        The Marathon Group is involved with a potential corrective action at
its Robinson, IL refinery where the remediation costs have been estimated at
between $4 million and $18 million over the next 20 to 30 years.  There are two
other corrective action sites where the estimated remediation costs are not
significant.  Remediation activities might also be required at other Marathon
Group sites under RCRA.

        USX is also involved in a number of remedial actions under CERCLA and
similar state statutes related to the Marathon Group.  See "Legal Proceedings -
Environmental Proceedings" below.

        It is possible that additional matters may come to USX's attention
which may require remediation.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

        The Marathon Group's capital expenditures for environmental controls
were $123 million in 1993, $240 million in 1992 and $102 million in 1991.  The
increase from 1991 to 1992 and the decline in 1993 was primarily the result of
the Marathon Group's multi-year capital spending program for diesel fuel
desulfurization which was substantially completed in 1993.  The Marathon Group
currently expects such expenditures to approximate $75 million in 1994.
Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which have varied,
and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the
availability of new technologies, among other matters.  Based upon currently
identified projects, the Marathon Group anticipates that environmental capital
expenditures will be approximately $60 million in 1995; however, actual
expenditures may increase as additional projects are identified or additional
requirements are imposed.

U. S. STEEL GROUP

        The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, one of the largest
integrated steel producers in the United States (referred to hereinafter as
"U. S. Steel"), which is primarily engaged in the production and sale of a wide
range of steel mill products, coke and taconite pellets.  The U. S. Steel Group
also includes the management of mineral resources, domestic coal mining,
engineering and consulting services and technology licensing (together with
U. S. Steel, the "Steel and Related Businesses").  Other businesses that are
part of the U. S. Steel Group include real estate development and management,
fencing products, leasing and financing activities and a majority interest in a
titanium metal products company.  U. S. Steel Group sales as a percentage of
USX consolidated sales were 31% in 1993, 28% in 1992 and 26% in 1991.

         The following table sets forth the total sales of the U. S. Steel

     Works in Chicago closed in April 1992.
(b)  Includes all other products sold by Steel and Related Businesses,
     including minerals and coke and all services sold, such as
     technical services.

        The total number of active employees for the U. S. Steel Group at
year-end was 21,892 in 1993, 21,183 in 1992 and 21,968 in 1991.  Most hourly
and certain salaried employees are represented by the United Steelworkers of
America ("USWA").

        U. S. Steel entered into a new five and one-half year contract with the
USWA, effective February 1, 1994, covering approximately 15,000 employees.  The
agreement will result in higher labor and benefit costs for the U. S. Steel
Group each year throughout the term of the agreement.  The agreement includes a
signing bonus of $1,000 per USWA represented employee that will be paid the
first quarter of 1994, $500 of which represents the final bonus payable under
the previous contract.  The agreement also provides for the establishment of a
Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust to prefund health care and
life insurance benefits for retirees covered under the agreement.  Minimum
contributions, in the form of USX stock or cash, are expected to be $25 million
in 1994 and $10 million per year thereafter.  The funding of the trust will
have no direct effect on income of the U. S. Steel Group.  Management believes
that this agreement is competitive with labor agreements reached by U. S.
Steel's major domestic integrated competitors and thus does not believe that
U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to such competitors will be
materially affected by its ratification.

        In January 1994, U. S. Steel Mining Co., Inc. ("U. S. Steel Mining")
entered into a five year agreement with the United Mine Workers of America
("UMW") covering approximately 1,700 employees, approximately 400 of which are
employed at the Maple Creek coal mine which is expected to be permanently
closed on or about March 31, 1994.

STEEL INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND COMPETITION

        The domestic steel industry is cyclical and highly competitive.
Despite significant reductions in raw steel production capability by major
domestic producers over the last decade, the domestic industry continues to be
adversely affected by excess world capacity.  In certain years over the last
decade, extensive downsizings have necessitated costly restructuring charges
which, when combined with highly competitive market conditions, resulted in
substantial losses for most domestic integrated producers.





                                       21
<PAGE>   23
        U. S. Steel is one of the largest integrated steel producers in the
United States and ranked first in both tons of raw steel production and in tons
of steel shipped by domestic producers based on data for 1993.  U. S. Steel
competes with many other domestic steel companies, a number of which have gone
through bankruptcy reorganization.  Compared to integrated producers,
minimills, which rely on less capital intensive hot metal sources, have certain
competitive advantages.  Since minimills are typically not unionized, they
enjoy lower employment costs and more flexible work rules.  In certain product
lines like structural shapes, bars and rods, minimills have provided
significant competition for integrated producers in the domestic market.  One
minimill company has constructed two plants utilizing thin slab casting
technology to produce flat rolled products which previously were produced
domestically only by integrated companies.  These two plants are currently
being expanded, and this company has announced its intention to construct a
third flat-rolled plant with a joint venture partner.  At least two other
flat-rolled mill projects have been announced and several other companies are
currently considering additional projects for construction in the United
States.

        The domestic steel industry has been adversely affected by unfairly
traded imports.  Steel imports to the United States accounted for an estimated
19% of the domestic steel market during 1993, and for an estimated 22% in the
fourth quarter.  Steel imports to the United States accounted for an estimated
17% to 18% of the domestic steel market in 1992 and 1991.  On March 31, 1992,
Voluntary Restraint Agreements restricting the level of steel imports to the
United States expired and in June 1992, USX and other domestic steel firms
filed a number of antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the U.S.
Department of Commerce ("USDC") and the International Trade Commission ("ITC") 
against unfairly traded imported carbon flat-rolled steel.  Beginning in late 
1992, as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by both the ITC 
and the USDC in the vast majority of cases, provisional duties were imposed 
on the imported steel products under investigation.  On June 22, 1993, the 
USDC issued the final determinations of subsidization in the countervailing 
duty cases and final margins for sales at less than fair value in the 
antidumping cases.

        On July 27, 1993, the ITC issued affirmative determinations of material
injury to the domestic steel industry by reason of imports in cases
representing an estimated 51% of the dollar value and 42% of the volume of all
flat rolled carbon steel imports under investigation.  Affirmative
determinations were found in cases relating to 37% of such volume of cold
rolled steel, 92% of such volume of the higher-value-added corrosion resistant
steel and 97% of such volume of plate steel.  Negative determinations were
found in the other cases, including all cases related to hot-rolled steel, 
the largest import market.

        In those cases where negative determinations were made by the ITC,
provisional duties imposed on imports covered by the cases were removed and
final remedial duties were not imposed.  While USX is unable to predict the
effect these negative determinations may have on the business or results of
operations of the U. S. Steel Group, they may result in increasing levels of
imported steel and may adversely affect some product prices.  As discussed
above, steel imports to the United States have increased in recent months.

        Although the affirmative determinations are helpful in offsetting the
harm to the U. S. steel industry caused by subsidized and dumped imports, USX
believes that the negative determinations were improper and, together with
other domestic steel firms, has appealed such determinations to the U. S. Court
of International Trade and, in certain cases involving imports from Canada, to
a bi-national panel in accordance with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement.
Many of the affirmative determinations similarly have been challenged in
appeals filed by foreign steel producers.  USX may file additional antidumping
and countervailing duty petitions if unfairly traded imports adversely impact,
or threaten to adversely impact, the results of the U. S. Steel Group.

        In addition to competition from other domestic and foreign steel
producers, U. S. Steel faces competition from producers of materials such as
aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastics and wood in many markets.

        The U. S. Steel Group's businesses are subject to numerous federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling,
emission and discharge of environmentally sensitive materials.  U. S. Steel
believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by
substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative
position with regard to such other competitors is materially affected by the
impact of environmental laws and regulations.  However, the costs and operating
restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations
may have an adverse effect on U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to
domestic minimills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials
which compete with steel, which may not be required to undertake equivalent
costs in their operations.  For further information, see "Environmental
Matters" below.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

        U. S. Steel's principal raw steel production facilities are Gary Works
in Indiana, Mon Valley Works in Pennsylvania and Fairfield Works in Alabama.

        Over the last ten years, U. S. Steel has responded to competition
resulting from excess steel industry capability by eliminating less efficient
facilities, modernizing those that remain and entering into joint ventures, all
with the objective of focusing production on higher value-added products for
customers in industries such as automotive, appliance, containers and oil
country tubular goods where superior quality and special characteristics are of
critical importance.  U. S. Steel does not intend to sell all steel products
but intends to focus on selected markets with developments such as
bake-hardenable steels and coated sheets for the automobile industry,
lamination sheet for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment and
improved tin mill products for the container industry.  In addition, U. S.
Steel intends to pursue lower manufacturing cost objectives through continuing
cost improvement programs.  These initiatives include, but are not limited to,
reduced production cycle time, improved yields, continued customer orientation
and improved process control.  For example, the Pulverized Coal Injection
project at Gary Works has resulted in reduced dependence on coke and lower
operating expenses.

        Since 1982, the number of U. S. Steel raw steel production facilities
has been reduced from nine to the three mentioned above, and annual raw steel
capability has been reduced from 31 million to 12 million tons.  Steel
employment has been reduced from approximately 89,000 in 1982 to about 18,000
in 1993.  As a result of downsizing its operations, the U. S. Steel Group
recognized restructuring charges aggregating $2.8 billion since 1982 as its
less efficient facilities have been shut down.  During that period, U. S. Steel
also invested approximately $3.2 billion in capital facilities for its steel
operations.  U. S. Steel believes that these expenditures have made its
remaining steel operations among the most modern, efficient and competitive in
the world.  With the completion of new continuous casters at Gary Works in 1991
and at Mon Valley Works in 1992, U. S. Steel has achieved the ability to
continuously cast 100% of its raw steel production.  This method of producing
steel results in higher quality steel at a lower cost than the previously used
ingot method.

        Heavy investment has also been made in technology that complements the
casters.  For example, U. S. Steel's largest blast furnace, located at Gary,
was rebuilt in 1991, at a cost of $110 million, to improve environmental
controls and install a state-of-the-art process control system and a third
high-efficiency hot-blast stove.  The plate mill at Gary was also rebuilt in
1991, and hot strip mill modifications and improvements were made over a number
of years at Fairfield and Gary to improve the quality of coils provided to
customers.  For additional information concerning capital expenditures for the
U. S. Steel Group see "Property, Plant and Equipment Additions" below.

        In addition to the modernization of its production facilities, USX has
entered into a number of joint ventures with domestic and foreign partners to
take advantage of market or manufacturing opportunities in the sheet, tin
plate, tubular, bar and plate consuming industries.  See "Joint Ventures and
Other Investments" below.

STEEL AND RELATED BUSINESSES

        U. S. Steel operates plants which produce steel mill products in a
variety of forms and grades.  Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and Fairfield Works
accounted for 58%, 22% and 20%, respectively, of U. S. Steel's 1993 raw steel
production of 11.3 million tons.  The annual raw steel production capability at
December 31, 1993, of each of the three facilities in millions of net tons was
Gary Works - 7.1, Mon Valley Works - 2.6 and Fairfield Works - 2.2.

(a)  U. S. Steel ceased production of structural products when South Works
     closed in April 1992.
(b)  Includes steel export shipments of approximately 0.4 million tons in
     1993, 0.6 million tons in 1992 and 1.3 million tons in 1991.

         USX and its wholly owned subsidiary, U. S. Steel Mining, have domestic
coal properties with demonstrated bituminous coal reserves of approximately 945
million net tons at year-end 1993 compared with approximately 981 million net
tons at year-end 1992.  This decline primarily reflects the 1993 sale of the
Cumberland coal mine which had reserves of approximately 36 million net tons.
The remaining reserves are of metallurgical and steam quality in approximately
equal proportions.  They are located in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West
Virginia, Illinois and Indiana.  Approximately 77% of the reserves are owned,
and the rest are leased.  Of the leased properties, 85% are renewable
indefinitely and the balance are covered by a lease which expires in 2005. 
U. S. Steel Mining's Maple Creek coal mine and a related preparation plant are
expected to be permanently closed on or about





                                       24

<PAGE>   26
March 31, 1994, because unforeseen and unpredictable geologic conditions made
continued mining economically infeasible.  Reserves associated with the Maple
Creek coal mine were 31 million net tons at December 31, 1993.  In early
February 1994, USX announced its willingness to sell the idled mine and
preparation plant, including coal reserves, surface facilities and certain
equipment.  Any prospective buyer would be a successor to U. S. Steel Mining's
labor agreement with the UMW.

         USX controls domestic iron ore properties having demonstrated iron ore
reserves in grades subject to beneficiation processes in commercial use by
U. S. Steel of approximately 790 million tons at year-end 1993, substantially
all of which are iron ore concentrate equivalents available from low-grade
iron-bearing materials, and the rest are higher grade ore.  All of these
demonstrated reserves are located in Minnesota.  Approximately 40% of these
reserves are owned and the remaining 60% are leased.  Most of the leased
reserves are covered by a lease expiring in 2058 and a group of leases expiring
from 1996 to 2007.  U. S. Steel's iron ore operations at Mt. Iron, MN
("Minntac") produced 16.0 million net tons of taconite pellets in 1993 compared
with 14.7 million net tons and 14.9 million net tons in 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

         USX's Resource Management administers the remaining mineral lands and
timber lands of the U. S. Steel Group, and is responsible for the lease or sale
of these lands and their associated resources, which encompass approximately
300,000 acres of surface rights and 1,500,000 acres of mineral rights in 18
states.

         USX Engineers and Consultants, Inc. sells technical services worldwide
to the steel, mining, chemical and related industries.  Together with its
subsidiary companies, it provides engineering and consulting services for
facility expansions and modernizations, operating improvement projects,
integrated computer systems, coal and lubrication testing and environmental
projects.

JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS

         USX participates directly and through subsidiaries in a number of
joint ventures included in the U. S. Steel Group.  All of the joint ventures
are accounted for under the equity method.  Certain of the joint ventures are
described below, all of which are 50% owned except Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar").

         USX and Pohang Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. ("POSCO") of South Korea
participate in a joint venture ("USS-POSCO Industries") which owns and operates
the former U. S. Steel Pittsburg, CA Plant.  The joint venture markets high
quality sheet and tin products, principally in the western United States market
area.  USS-POSCO Industries produces cold-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tin
plate and tin-free steel.  A capital modernization and expansion program of
nearly $400 million to upgrade the facilities was completed in 1989.
USS-POSCO's annual capacity is 1.4 million tons.

         USX and Kobe Steel Ltd. ("Kobe") of Japan participate in a joint
venture ("USS/Kobe Steel Company") which owns and operates the former U. S.
Steel Lorain, OH Works.  The joint venture produces raw steel for the
manufacture of bar and tubular products.  Bar products are sold by USS/Kobe
Steel Company while U. S. Steel retains sales and marketing responsibilities
for tubular products.  Shipments in 1993 were 1.5 million tons.  USS/Kobe Steel
Company entered into a new five and one-half year labor contract with the USWA,
effective February 1, 1994, covering approximately 2,300 employees.

         USX and Kobe have formed another joint venture ("PRO-TEC Coating
Company") to construct, own and operate a hot dip galvanizing line in Leipsic,
OH.  Capacity is approximately 600,000 tons per year, with substrate coils
provided by U. S. Steel.  The facility commenced operations in early 1993.

         USX and Worthington Industries Inc. participate in a joint venture
known as Worthington Specialty Processing which operates a steel processing
facility in Jackson, MI.  The plant is operated by Worthington Industries, Inc.
and is dedicated to serving U. S. Steel customers.  The facility contains
state-of-the-art technology capable of processing master steel coils into both
slit coils and sheared first operation blanks including rectangles, trapezoids,
parallelograms and chevrons.  It is designed to meet specifications for the
automotive, appliance, furniture and metal door industries.  The joint venture
processes material sourced by U. S. Steel, with a production capacity of almost
708,000 net tons annually.

         USX and Rouge Steel Company participate in Double Eagle Steel Coating
Company, a joint venture which operates an electrogalvanizing facility located
in Dearborn, MI.  This facility enables U. S. Steel to further participate in
the expanding automotive demand for steel with corrosion resistant properties.
The facility utilizes U. S. Steel's proven CAROSEL technology coupled with many
refinements developed through actual operating experience on the No. 1
Electrogalvanizing Line located at Gary Works.  The facility can coat both
sides of sheet steel with zinc or alloy coatings and has the capability to coat
one side with zinc and the other side with alloy.  Capacity is 700,000 tons of
galvanized steel annually, with availability of the facility shared by the
partners on an equal basis.

         National-Oilwell, a joint venture with National Supply Company, Inc.,
a subsidiary of Armco Inc., operates in the oil field service industry and has
six manufacturing plants in the United States and abroad that produce a broad
line of drilling and production equipment.  In the United States and abroad, it
also operates 121 oilfield supply stores, 18 service centers and 17 sales
offices where it sells its own manufactured equipment, tubular goods and other
oilfield operating supplies manufactured by others.

         USX owns a 45% interest in Transtar, which purchased in 1988 the
former domestic transportation businesses of USX including railroads, a dock
company, USS Great Lakes Fleet, Inc. and Warrior & Gulf Navigation Company.
Blackstone Transportation Partners, L.P. and Blackstone Capital Partners L.P.,
both affiliated with The Blackstone Group, together own 52% of Transtar, and
the senior management of Transtar own the remaining 3%. For a discussion of
litigation related to Transtar, see "Legal Proceedings - USX Legal Proceedings
Attributable to the U.S. Steel Group".

OTHER BUSINESSES

         In addition to the Steel and Related Businesses, the U. S. Steel Group
includes various other businesses, the most significant of which are described
below.  The other businesses that are included in the U. S. Steel Group
accounted for 3% of the U. S. Steel Group's sales in both 1993 and 1992 and 5%
in 1991.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS

         During the years 1991-1993, the U. S. Steel Group made property, plant
and equipment additions, including capital leases, aggregating $949 million.
Additions were $198 million, $318 million and $433 million in 1993, 1992 
and 1991, respectively.  The additions have been primarily for the replacement,
modernization and expansion of facilities and production capabilities,
including steel production and finishing, the mining of raw materials, and
environmental controls associated with steel production and other facilities.
Significant expenditures in 1993 included amounts for upgrades of the hot strip
mill and a pickle line at Gary Works and environmental projects at Gary Works
and Mon Valley Works.  The decline in capital spending over this period
primarily reflected the completion of U. S. Steel's continuous cast
modernization program in 1992.  Capital expenditures for 1994 are currently
estimated at $260 million and will include continued expenditures for projects
begun in 1993 relative to environmental, hot-strip mill and pickle line
improvements at Gary Works and initial expenditures for a blast furnace reline
project at Mon Valley Works which is planned for completion in 1995.  Capital
expenditures in 1995 and 1996 are currently expected to remain at about the
same level as in 1994.

         Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for the U. S. Steel
Group were $314 million, $288 million and $254 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

         The research and development activities of the U. S. Steel Group are
conducted mainly at the U. S. Steel Technical Center in Monroeville, PA.
Expenditures for steel research and development were $22 million in 1993, $23
million in 1992 and $22 million in 1991.

         Steel research is devoted to developing new or improved processes for
the mining and beneficiation of raw materials such as coal and iron ore and for
the production of steel; developing new and improved products in steel and
other product lines; developing technology for meeting environmental
regulations and for achieving higher productivity in these areas; and serving
customers in the selection and use of U. S. Steel's products.  Steel research
has contributed to current business performance through expanded use of on-site
plant improvement teams.  In addition, several collaborative research programs
with technical projects directed at mid- to long-range research opportunities
have been continued at universities and in conjunction with other domestic
steel companies through the American Iron and Steel Institute.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         The U. S. Steel Group maintains a comprehensive environmental policy
overseen by the Public Policy Committee of the USX Board of Directors.  The
Environmental Affairs organization has the responsibility to ensure that the U.
S. Steel Group's operating organizations maintain environmental compliance
systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  The
Executive Environmental Committee, which is comprised of officers of the group,
is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental
compliance programs.  Also, the U. S. Steel Group, largely through the American
Iron and Steel Institute, continues its deep involvement in the negotiation of
various air, water, and waste regulations with federal, state and local
governments to assure the implementation of cost effective pollution reduction
strategies, such as the innovative regulatory-negotiation activities for coke
plants, which are regulated under the Clean Air Act ("CAA").





                                       28
<PAGE>   30
         The U. S. Steel Group has voluntarily participated in the EPA 33-50
program to reduce toxic releases and the EPA Greenlights program to promote
energy efficiency. The U. S. Steel Group has also developed an award winning
environmental education program (the Continuous Improvement to the Environment,
or CITE, program), a corporate program to reduce the volume of wastes the U. S.
Steel Group generates, and wildlife management programs certified by the
Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Council at U. S. Steel Group operating facilities.
Additionally, over the past 5 years, it has reduced the volume of toxic
releases reported under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986 (Section 313) by 75%, primarily through recycling and process changes.

         The businesses of the U. S. Steel Group are subject to numerous
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment.  These environmental laws and regulations include the CAA with
respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect to water
discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to
solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA")
with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances.  In addition,
all states where the U. S. Steel Group operates have similar laws dealing with
the same matters.  These laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly
stringent.  The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations
is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that
certain implementing regulations for laws such as RCRA and the CAA have not yet
been promulgated or in certain instances are undergoing revision.  These
environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA
and new water quality standards, could result in substantially increased
capital, operating and compliance costs. For a discussion of environmental
expenditures, see "Management's Discusssion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" for the U.S. Steel 
Group.

         The U. S. Steel Group has incurred and will continue to incur
substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as
a result of environmental laws and regulations.  In recent years, these
expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet CAA
requirements, although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant.
To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
reflected in the prices of the U. S. Steel Group's products and services,
operating results will be adversely affected.  The U. S. Steel Group believes
that all of its domestic competitors are subject to similar environmental laws
and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of their
operating facilities and their production methods.

AIR

         The 1990 Amendments to the CAA impose more stringent limits on air
emissions, establish a federally mandated operating permit program and allow
for enhanced civil and criminal enforcement sanctions.  The principal impact of
the 1990 Amendments to the CAA on the U. S. Steel Group is on the coke-making
operations of U. S. Steel, as described below.  The coal mining operations and
sales of U. S. Steel Mining may also be affected.

         The 1990 Amendments to the CAA specifically address the regulation and
control of hazardous air pollutants, including emissions from coke ovens.
Generally, emissions for existing coke ovens must comply with technology-based
limits by the end of 1995 and comply with a health risk-based standard by the
end of 2003.  However, a coke oven will not be required to comply with the
health risk-based standard until January 1, 2020, if it complied with the
technology-based standard at the end of 1993 and also complies with additional
technology-based standards, by January 1, 1998, and by January 1, 2010.  USX
believes that it met the 1993 requirement and will be able to meet the 1998 and
2010 compliance dates.

         The 1990 Amendments to the CAA also mandate the nationwide reduction
of emissions of acid rain precursors (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) from
fossil fuel-fired electrical utility plants.  Specified emission reductions are
to be achieved by 2000.  Phase I begins on January 1, 1995, and applies to 110
utility plants specifically listed in the law.  Phase II, which begins on
January 1, 2000, will apply to other utility plants which may be regulated
under the law.  U. S. Steel, like all other electricity consumers, will be
impacted by increased electrical energy costs that are expected as electric
utilities seek rate increases to comply with the acid rain requirements.

         In 1993, 77% of the coal production of U. S. Steel Mining was
metallurgical coal, which is used in coke production, and the balance was steam
coal. Most of U.S. Steel Mining's production of steam coal was from the 
Cumberland Coal mine, which was sold in 1993. While USX believes that
the new requirements for coke ovens will not have an immediate effect on U. S.
Steel Mining, the requirements may encourage development of steelmaking
processes that do not require the use of coke.

WATER

         The U. S. Steel Group maintains the necessary discharge permits as
required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of
the CWA and it is in compliance with such permits.  U. S. Steel is currently
negotiating with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") to develop a plan
to remediate the section of the Grand Calumet River that runs through Gary
Works.  Approval of the sedimentation remediation plan is expected in early
1994.  The entire remediation process through validation of the environmental
recovery of the river is expected to take about 10 years.  The program cost
will be approximately $29 million over 5 to 6 years, all of which has
previously been accrued.

SOLID WASTE

        The U. S. Steel Group continues to seek methods to minimize the
generation of hazardous wastes in its operations.  RCRA establishes standards
for the management of solid and hazardous wastes.  Besides affecting current
waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of
certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the
regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Since
the EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of
RCRA and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the
implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance
cannot be accurately estimated.  In addition, new laws are being enacted and
regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing
basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly
appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined. 
Corrective action under RCRA related to past waste disposal activities is
discussed under "Remediation" below.

PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AT GARY WORKS

         In order to facilitate long-term environmental compliance planning and
spending at Gary Works and allow it to remain competitive, USX has entered into
discussions with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management ("IDEM")
and the EPA concerning the development of a 10-year environmental enhancement
program at Gary Works.  This program, as proposed, would cover all state and
federal environmental laws, including air, water and hazardous waste.  Under
such a program, USX would agree in advance to expend up to a specified amount
(possibly in the range of $20 million to $30 million) each year during the 
period for environmental enhancement projects at Gary Works.  These projects 
would include those anticipated under future regulations and voluntary 
projects for which there is no present or anticipated future legal requirement,
including the Grand Calumet River sediment remediation plan discussed above.  
This program would benefit USX by enabling it to better plan for its 
environmental expenditures over the next ten years.  In addition, IDEM, the 
EPA and the public would benefit from having a major industrial facility 
committed to environmental expenditures not presently mandated by law.  This 
project is in the early stages of discussion and there is no present 
commitment that the program will be accepted.

REMEDIATION 

         A significant portion of the U. S. Steel Group's currently identified
environmental remediation projects relate to the dismantlement and restoration
of former and present operating locations.  These projects include continuing
remediation at an IN SITU uranium mining operation, the dismantling and
management of former coke-making facilities and the closure of permitted
hazardous waste landfills.

         The U. S. Steel Group has commenced a RCRA Facility Investigation and
a Corrective Measure Study at its Fairless Works.  This study is expected to
take three years to complete at a cost of $2 million to $3 million.  The cost
associated with any remediation which may ultimately be required is not
presently reasonably estimable.  Remediation activities might also be required
at other U. S. Steel Group sites under RCRA.

         USX is also involved in a number of remedial actions under CERCLA and
similar state statutes related to the U. S. Steel Group.  See "Legal
Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings" below.

         It is possible that additional matters may come to USX's attention
which may require remediation.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

         The U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures for environmental
controls were $53 million in 1993, $52 million in 1992 and $73 million in 1991.
The U. S. Steel Group currently expects such expenditures to approximate $70
million in 1994, including the expected completion of major air quality
projects at Gary Works.  Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based
estimates which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more
stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other
matters.  Based upon currently identified projects, the U. S. Steel Group
anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $25
million in 1995; however, actual expenditures may increase as additional
projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.

DELHI GROUP

         The Delhi Group ("Delhi") consists of  Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation
("DGP") and certain related companies which are engaged in the purchasing,
gathering, processing, transporting and marketing of natural gas.  Prior to
establishment of the Delhi Group on October 2, 1992, these businesses were
included in the Marathon Group.  Sales from the businesses included in the
Delhi Group as a percentage of USX consolidated sales were 3% in both 1993 and
1992 and 2% in 1991.  See "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes
to Financial Statements - 1. Basis of Presentation" for the Delhi Group.

         Delhi is an established natural gas merchant engaged in the
purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting and marketing of natural gas.
It uses its extensive pipeline systems to provide gas producers with a ready
purchaser for their gas or transportation to other pipelines and markets and to
provide customers with an aggregated, reliable gas supply.  Delhi has the
ability to offer a complete package of services to customers, relieving them of
the need to locate, negotiate for, purchase and arrange transportation of gas.
As a result, margins realized in its merchant function, particularly when
providing premium supply services, are generally higher than those realized
when providing separate gathering, processing or transporting services or those
realized from short-term, interruptible ("spot") market sales.

         Delhi provides premium supply services to customers directly connected
to its pipeline systems ("on-system"), such as local distribution companies
("LDCs") and utility electric generators ("UEGs").  These services include
providing reliable supplies tailored to meet the peak demand requirements of
customers.  Premium supply services range from standby service, where the
customer has no obligation to take any volumes but may immediately receive gas
from Delhi upon an increase in the customer's demand, to baseload firm service
where delivery of continuous volumes is assured by Delhi and the customer is
obligated to take the gas provided.

         Delhi attempts to structure its gas sales to balance the peak demand
requirements of LDCs during the winter heating season and of UEGs during the
summer air conditioning season.  In addition, Delhi provides premium supply
services to customers connected to other pipelines ("off-system") through its
interconnections with intrastate and interstate pipelines.  Gas supplies not
sold under premium service contracts are generally sold in the spot market.

         Delhi also extracts and markets natural gas liquids ("NGLs") from
natural gas gathered on its pipeline systems.  Delhi sells NGLs to a variety of
purchasers, including petrochemical companies, refiners, retailers, resellers
and trading companies.  Delhi owns interests in 18 natural gas processing
facilities which include 22 gas processing plants, eleven of which are wholly
owned and eleven of which are 50% owned.  Fifteen of the plants were operating
as of December 31, 1993.  These facilities straddle Delhi's pipelines and have
been located to maximize utilization.

         Delhi faces competition in all of its businesses, including obtaining
additional dedicated gas reserves and providing premium supply services and gas
transportation services.  Delhi's competitors include major integrated oil and
gas companies, more than 100 major intrastate and interstate pipelines, and
national and local gas gatherers, brokers, marketers, distributors and end-
users of varying size, financial resources and experience.  Based on 1992 data
published in the September 1993 Pipeline & Gas Journal, Delhi ranked
seventeenth among domestic pipeline companies in terms of total miles of gas
pipeline operated and second in terms of miles of gathering line operated.
With respect to competition in Delhi's gas processing business, Delhi estimates
there are approximately 400 gas processing plants in Texas and Oklahoma.
Certain competitors, such as major integrated oil companies and intrastate and
interstate pipelines, have financial resources and control supplies of gas
substantially greater than those of Delhi.  Competition for premium supply
services varies for individual customers depending on the number of other
potential suppliers capable of providing the level of service required by the
customers.  In addition, certain regulatory actions of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), designed to deregulate the gas industry,
particularly FERC Order No. 636, have increased competition in providing
premium supply services and gas transportation services.  See "Regulatory
Matters - FERC Regulation" below.

NATURAL GAS GATHERING AND SUPPLY

         Delhi provides a valuable service to producers of natural gas by
providing direct markets for the sale of their natural gas.  Following
discovery of commercial quantities of natural gas, producers generally must
either build their own gathering lines or negotiate with another party, such as
Delhi, to have gathering lines built to connect their wells to a pipeline for
delivery to market.  Delhi typically aggregates natural gas production from
several wells in a gathering system where it may also provide additional
services for the producers by compressing and dehydrating the gas.  Depending
on the quality of the gas stream, the gas may be treated to make it suitable
for market.  Delhi's ability to offer producers treating services and its
willingness to purchase untreated gas give it an advantage in acquiring gas
supplies, particularly in East Texas, where much of the gas produced is not
pipeline quality gas.  After processing, the residue gas flows through
pipelines for ultimate delivery to market.

         Delhi owns and operates extensive gathering systems which are
strategically located in the major gas producing areas of Texas and Oklahoma,
including East Texas, South Texas and the Anadarko and Permian basins, and also
operates in Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana.  Delhi's principal intrastate
natural gas pipeline systems total approximately 7,600 miles and interconnect
with other intrastate and interstate pipelines at more than 120 points.
Interests in two partnerships, one of which operates a FERC regulated
interstate pipeline system, bring total systems miles to approximately 8,100 at
December 31, 1993.  In January 1993, Delhi sold its 25% interest in Red River
Pipeline.  Total throughput, including Delhi's share of partnership volumes,
was 327 billion cubic feet ("bcf") in 1993, 314 bcf in 1992 and 291 bcf in
1991.  Delhi's existing systems are capable of handling substantially increased
throughput without major investment.

(a)  Delhi sold its Colorado gas gathering facilities (including pipeline
     systems) during 1993.
(b)  Reflects Delhi's interest in partnership throughput.

         While Delhi obtains gas supplies from various sources, including major
oil and gas companies and other pipelines, its primary source has been
independent producers.  It offers competitive prices for gas, a full range of
pipeline services and stable, year-round takes of production.  Stable takes are
particularly important to small producers who may not have the financial
capacity to withstand significant variations in cash flow.

         The services Delhi provides to producers include gathering,
dehydration, treating, compression, blending, processing and transportation.
Delhi's ability to provide this wide range of services, together with the
location of its gathering systems within major gas-producing basins, has
allowed it to build a large, flexible gas supply base.

         The pricing mechanisms under Delhi's contracts with producers
generally result in variable market-based prices or periodically renegotiable
fixed prices.  The  majority of Delhi's contracts with producers are
"take-or-release" contracts under which Delhi has the right to purchase the gas
or, if it does not purchase minimum volumes of gas over a specified period, the
producer has the right to sell the gas to another party and have it transported
on Delhi's system for a fee.  Take-or-release contracts present less risk to
Delhi than the formerly prevalent take-or-pay contracts, while affording
producers an opportunity to protect their cash flow by selling to other buyers.
Delhi believes that its liability on take-or-pay contracts, if any, is not
material.

         Delhi must add dedicated gas reserves in order to offset the natural
declines in production from existing wells on its systems and to meet any
increase in demand.  In the past, Delhi has successfully connected new sources
of supply to its pipeline systems.  Management attributes this past success to
the strategic location of Delhi's gathering systems in major producing basins,
the quality of its service and its ability to adjust to changing market
conditions.  Delhi's future ability to contract for additional dedicated gas
reserves also depends in part on the level and success of drilling by producers
in the areas in which Delhi operates.  Delhi has added dedicated reserves at
increasing levels since 1987.

(a) During 1993, dedicated gas reserve additions related to Marathon were less
    than 8% of total additions.  At December 31, 1993, approximately 12% of
    Delhi's dedicated gas reserves were owned by Marathon.

NATURAL GAS SALES

         Delhi sells natural gas nationwide to LDCs, UEGs, pipeline companies,
various industrial end-users and marketers under both long and short term
contracts.  As a result of Delhi's ability to offer a complete package of
services to customers, relieving them of the need to locate, negotiate for,
purchase and arrange transportation and processing of gas, margins realized by
Delhi in its merchant function, particularly when providing premium supply
services, are generally higher than those realized when providing separate
gathering, processing or transportation services or those realized from spot
market sales.  In 1993, merchant gas sales represented approximately 63% of
Delhi's total systems throughput and 77% of Delhi's total gross margin.  Delhi
sells gas under both firm and interruptible contracts at varying volumes and in
1993 sold gas to over 160 customers.

         Delhi principally targets sales to on-system LDCs and UEGs.  LDCs and
UEGs generally are willing to pay higher prices to gas suppliers who can
provide reliable gas supplies and adjust to rapid changes in their demand for
gas service.  Fluctuations in demand for natural gas by LDCs and UEGs are
influenced by the seasonal requirements of purchasers using gas for space
heating and the generation of electricity for air conditioning.  LDCs require
maximum deliveries during the winter heating season, while UEGs require maximum
deliveries during the summer air-conditioning season.  In order to increase
flexibility for supplying gas to premium customers, Delhi entered into an
arrangement in the fourth quarter of 1993 with a large LDC in Texas to store up
to 2.5 bcf of natural gas in an East Texas storage facility.  Delhi serves over
30 LDCs and UEGs and total sales to these customers in 1993 exceeded 84 bcf.
Delhi also sells gas to industrial end-users.  These customers are generally
more price-sensitive, but diversify Delhi's customer base and provide a stable
market for gas.

         Delhi uses the spot market to balance its gas supply with the demands
for premium services.  It attempts to sell all of its available gas each month.
Delhi typically estimates sales to its premium market, then places the rest of
its supply on the spot market.  If the estimated premium load does not
materialize, spot market sales are increased.  If the actual premium load is
greater than expected, spot market sales are interrupted to divert additional
gas to the premium market.  Spot market sales allow Delhi to balance its gas
supply with its sales and to maximize throughput on its systems.

         Because of prevailing industry conditions, most recent sales contracts
are for periods of one year or less, and many are for periods of 30 days or
less.  Pricing mechanisms under Delhi's contracts result in gas sales at either
market sensitive prices or fixed prices with the unit margin fluctuating in
both cases based on the sales price and the cost of gas.  Various contracts
permit the customer or Delhi to interrupt the gas purchased or sold, under
certain circumstances.  Other contracts provide Delhi or the customer the right
to renegotiate the gas sales price at specified intervals, often monthly or
annually.  Sales under these contracts may be terminated if the parties are
unable to agree on a new price.  These contract provisions may make the
specified term of a contract less meaningful.

         During 1993, Delhi's four largest customers, which accounted for
approximately 30% of total sales, were the Oklahoma Natural Gas Company
("ONG"), the largest LDC in Oklahoma; Southwestern Electric Power Company
("SWEPCO"), a UEG primarily serving locations in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas;
Central Power and Light Company ("CP&L"), a UEG serving South Texas; and Lone
Star Gas Company, the largest LDC in Texas, serving the north central part of
the state.  Natural gas sales to these four largest customers accounted for
18%, 14% and 17% of total systems throughput and 45%, 39% and 37% of total
gross margin in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Sales to two customers, ONG
and SWEPCO, accounted for an aggregate of 34%, 30% and





                                       35
<PAGE>   37
29% of total gross margin in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Except for
ONG, discussed below, no customer accounted for 10% or more of sales in such
periods.  SWEPCO and CP&L are owned by a common parent, but operate
independently in different geographical areas.  In the event that one or more
of Delhi's large premium supply service customers reduce volumes taken under an
existing contract or choose not to renew such contract(s), Delhi would be
adversely affected to the extent it is unable to find alternative customers to
buy gas at the same level of profitability.

         Delhi has maintained long-term sales relationships with many of its
customers and has done business with ONG since 1971.  ONG accounted for 14%,
12% and 14% of total sales in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Since 1987,
sales contracts with ONG have been negotiated annually.  During 1992, Delhi
executed a contract with ONG relating to sales for the 1993 and 1994 contract
years.  Delhi is in the second year of this contract and has recently
negotiated specific pricing provisions for both the 1994 and 1995 contract
years.

         Sales to SWEPCO accounted for 7% of total sales in each of 1993 and
1992 and 6% in 1991.  Sales to SWEPCO pursuant to one contract ("original
contract") were at prices substantially above spot market prices and, as a
result, this contract has accounted for more than 10% of Delhi's total gross
margin in each year subsequent to 1990.  On January 26, 1994, a settlement
agreement was executed between DGP and SWEPCO, resolving litigation which began
in 1991 related to the original contract which was due to expire in April 1995.
The settlement agreement provides that SWEPCO will pay Delhi the price under
the original contract through January 1994.  Concurrent with the execution of
the settlement agreement, Delhi executed a new four-year agreement with SWEPCO
enabling Delhi to supply increased volumes of gas to two SWEPCO power plants in
East Texas at market sensitive prices and premiums commensurate with the level
of service provided.  The agreement provides for swing service and does not
require any minimum gas purchase volumes.  Delhi's operating income and cash
flow will be adversely affected by the amount of premiums lost under the 
original contract for the period February 1, 1994, through April 1, 1995.  Broad
estimates of the potential premium losses are $18 million and $4 million in
1994 and 1995, respectively.

         Delhi continues to pursue opportunities for long-term gas sales to
LDCs and UEGs.  During 1992, Delhi executed a new contract with Entex, a
Division of Arkla, Inc., to supply for up to ten years the total gas
requirements for the city of Tyler, TX.  Entex is the second largest LDC in
Texas.  In early 1993, Delhi entered into additional contracts with Entex to
supply gas to Longview, TX and Kilgore, TX.  Delhi believes that there are
additional opportunities to provide premium supply services to both on-system
and off-system LDCs and UEGs at premium prices.  Delhi can sell gas to
off-system customers because of its numerous interconnections with other
pipelines and the availability of transportation service from other pipelines.
Delhi's interconnections with other pipelines give it access to virtually every
significant interstate pipeline in the United States and permit it to take
advantage of regional pricing differentials.  Delhi has both firm and
interruptible transportation agreements with various pipelines.  Delhi attempts
to minimize the payment of reservation fees associated with transportation
arrangements and had only one contract with an obligation for fixed reservation
fees at December 31, 1993.

         In a typical off-system sale transaction, Delhi sells gas to a
customer at an interconnection point with another pipeline and the customer
arranges further pipeline transportation of the gas to the point of
consumption.  Delhi's off-system sales in 1993 included sales to LDCs in
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, California and
Minnesota; UEGs in Pennsylvania, California, Kansas and Louisiana; and
industrial end-users in many of the same states.  Margins realized from 
off-system sales to LDCs and UEGs have traditionally been lower than those 
realized from on-system sales to such customers, reflecting the lower level of 
service typically received by the off-system customers.  However, off-system 
LDCs and UEGs generally are willing to pay a premium over industrial and spot 
market sales prices.

         Delhi believes that with the implementation of FERC Order No. 636, its
opportunities to make premium sales to off-system customers will continue to
improve because interstate pipelines will increasingly become primarily
transporters of natural gas as opposed to marketers of gas to LDCs, UEGs and
large industrial end-users.  During 1993, Delhi negotiated three FERC Order No.
636 sales of gas moving to off-system markets.  For additional information
concerning FERC Order No. 636, see "Regulatory Matters - FERC Regulation"
below.

TRANSPORTATION

         Delhi transports natural gas on its pipeline systems for third parties
at negotiated fees.  When transporting gas for others, Delhi does not take
title but delivers equivalent amounts to designated locations.  The core of
Delhi's transportation business is moving gas for on-system producers who
market their own gas.  Delhi's transportation business complements its sales
and gas processing businesses by generating incremental revenues and margins.
Transportation volumes also may be available for purchase by Delhi during
periods of peak demand to increase Delhi's supply base.  Delhi's more than 120
points of interconnection with both intrastate and interstate pipeline systems
facilitate its transportation business.  In 1993, transportation services
accounted for approximately 37% of Delhi's total systems throughput and 10% of
its total gross margin.

GAS PROCESSING AND NGLS MARKETING

         Natural gas processing involves the extraction of NGLs (ethane,
propane, isobutane, normal butane and/or natural gasoline) from the natural gas
stream, thereby removing some of the British thermal units ("Btus") from the
gas.  Delhi processes most of the gas moved on its pipeline systems in its own
plants, which straddle its pipelines, and processes a smaller portion at
third-party plants.  Delhi has the processing rights under a substantial
majority of its contracts with producers.  By processing gas, Delhi captures
the differential between the price obtainable for the Btus if sold as NGLs and
the price obtainable for the Btus if left in the gas.  Delhi has the ability to
take advantage of such price differentials by utilizing additional processing
capacity at operating plants or by starting up and shutting down processing
plants quickly at relatively minimal cost.  Delhi monitors the economics of
removing NGLs from the gas stream for processing on an ongoing basis to
determine the appropriate level of each plant's operation and the viability of
starting up or idling individual plants.  At December 31, 1993, 15 of Delhi's
22 plants were operating.  Delhi restarted one idled plant in 1993 and two in
1991 because of favorable processing economics.  One plant was idled in
November 1993, due to insufficient volumes of gas for processing.  Delhi
expanded its facilities in Custer County, Oklahoma by installing a two-mile
pipeline and redesigning and moving the idled Cimarron processing plant to this
area.  The plant began operations in March 1994.  Delhi has a 50% interest in
the plant project which has an estimated total project cost of $4.2 million.
Delhi also plans a 21-mile system expansion to provide additional system
capacity to this plant.  This project is scheduled for completion in the third
quarter of 1994.  In October 1993, Delhi purchased the 30 million cubic feet
per day ("mmcfd") Pettus gas plant in South Texas.  Construction of a pipeline
linking the plant to the Delhi system was completed in November 1993.

</TABLE>

- - -----------------------------
(a) 100% owned
(b) 50% owned; NGLs sales volumes reflect Delhi's interest.

         Delhi retains the rights to the NGLs on more than 90% of the gas it
processes.  The remainder is shared with either producers or other pipelines.
For certain 50% owned plants, Delhi shares the retained NGLs equally with the
joint owner.  Delhi pursues incremental processing business from third parties
with unprocessed gas accessible to Delhi's pipeline systems to take advantage
of excess capacity when processing economics are favorable.

         Delhi also receives fees for providing treating services for producers
whose gas requires the removal of various impurities to make it marketable.
The impurities may include water, carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide.  Delhi
owns and operates its own treating facilities, including three sulfur plants,
and also has contracts to treat gas at third-party plants.  The ability to
offer treating services to producers gives Delhi a competitive advantage in
acquiring gas supplies in East Texas, where much of the gas produced is not
pipeline quality gas.

         Delhi markets NGLs either at the two major domestic marketing centers
for NGLs, Mont Belvieu, TX and Conway, KS, or at the processing plant sites.
Delhi also markets NGLs for third parties for a fee.  Condensate (free liquids
in the gas stream before processing) is very similar to crude oil and is
marketed to crude oil purchasers at various separation or collection facilities
located throughout Delhi's pipeline systems.  Prices for NGLs and condensates
are closely related to the price of crude oil.

         Delhi has transportation, fractionation and exchange agreements for
the movement of NGLs to market.  Delhi sells NGLs to a variety of purchasers
including petrochemical companies, refiners, retailers, resellers and trading
companies.  In 1993, Delhi marketed 282 million gallons ("mmgal") of NGLs to
over 64 different customers at spot market prices.  Delhi also has agreements
with third parties to store NGLs, which provide the flexibility to delay NGLs
sales until demand and prices are higher.

         Delhi's average NGLs sales volumes  have increased in each year since
1991, totaling 282.0 mmgal, 261.4 mmgal and 214.7 mmgal in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.  In addition, NGLs volumes which Delhi processed for third
parties for a fee were 45.7 mmgal and 40.5 mmgal in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Delhi also processed nominal amounts of gas for third parties
during 1991.  Gas processing unit margins, which trended downward over the last
three years, averaged 6 cents per gallon in 1993 (1 cent per gallon in the 
fourth quarter) compared with 10 cents per gallon in 1992 and 13 cents per 
gallon in 1991.  The decline primarily reflected increased average natural 
gas prices (feedstock costs) and lower average NGLs prices, which trended 
downward with crude oil.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS

         During the three years 1991-1993, Delhi made property, plant and
equipment additions aggregating $87.8 million.  Additions were $42.6 million,
$26.6 million and $18.6 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  A
portion of these expenditures related to the connection of new dedicated
gas reserves.  Additions to Delhi's dedicated gas reserves totaled 382 bcf, 273
bcf and 255 bcf in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  In addition,
expenditures were made to purchase facilities and to improve and upgrade
existing facilities.  Expenditures in 1993 included amounts for a
multi-pipeline interconnection and compression project in the Carthage area of
East Texas, the acquisition and connection of a 65-mile gas gathering system in
West





                                       38
<PAGE>   40
Texas and the purchase, connection and upgrade of a 30 mmcfd cryogenic gas
processing facility near existing systems in South Texas.  For information
concerning capital expenditures for environmental controls in 1993, 1992 and
1991 and estimated capital expenditures for such purposes in 1994 and 1995, see
"Environmental Matters" below.

         Capital expenditures in 1994 are expected to exceed 1993 levels as
Delhi continues to pursue opportunities at attractive prices to connect
dedicated gas reserves by the expansion or acquisition of gas gathering,
processing and transmission assets, including those made available as a result
of current industry conditions and regulatory initiatives.

         Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for Delhi were $36.3
million, $40.2 million and $38.7 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

REGULATORY MATTERS

         Delhi's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various
governmental agencies.

STATE REGULATION

         The Texas Railroad Commission ("RRC") has the authority to regulate
natural gas sales and transportation rates charged by intrastate pipelines in
Texas.  The RRC requires tariff filings for certain of Delhi's transactions
and, under limited circumstances, could propose changes in such filed tariffs.
Rates charged for pipeline-to-pipeline transactions and to transportation,
industrial and other similar large volume contract customers (other than LDCs)
are presumed by the RRC to be just and reasonable where (i) neither the
supplier nor the customer had an unfair advantage during negotiations, (ii) the
rates are substantially the same as rates between the gas utility and two or
more of these customers for similar service or (iii) competition does or did
exist for the market with another supplier of natural gas or an alternative
form of energy.  Competition generally exists in the markets Delhi serves and
rate cases have been infrequent.

         Delhi's Texas pipeline systems are subject to the "ratable take rules"
of the RRC.  Under ratable take rules, each purchaser of gas is generally
required first to take ratably certain high-priority gas (i.e., principally
casinghead gas from oil wells) produced from wells from which it purchases gas
and, if its sales volumes exceed amounts of such high-priority gas available,
thereafter to take gas well gas from wells from which it purchases gas on a
ratable basis, by categories, to the extent of demand.  Under other RRC
regulations, large industrial customers are subject to curtailment or service
interruption during periods of peak demand.  Certain Delhi customers in Texas
and Oklahoma may also be subject to state ratable take rules.  Such rules have
affected purchases of gas from Delhi in the past and may affect such purchases
in the future.

         The RRC has promulgated Statewide Rules which streamline the process
for determining gas demand and gas allowables in Texas.  By setting allowables
to meet market demand, Delhi believes the RRC rules will foster more accurate
pricing signals between the wellhead and the burnertip.  Although the ultimate
impact of these changes to the proration rules is uncertain, Delhi believes it
is well positioned to benefit from the new pricing structure.

         Delhi generally does not engage in the type of sales or transportation
transactions which would subject it to cost of service regulation in the states
where it does business.  Louisiana exercises limited jurisdiction over certain
facilities constructed in that state by Delhi.

FERC REGULATION

         As a gas gatherer and an operator primarily of intrastate pipelines,
Delhi is generally exempt from regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938
("NGA").  Delhi operates and owns a 25% interest in Ozark Gas Transmission
System ("Ozark"), an interstate pipeline providing transportation services in
western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.  Ozark is subject to FERC regulation
under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ("NGPA").  FERC also
exercises jurisdiction over transportation services provided by Delhi under
Section 311 of the NGPA.  This jurisdiction is limited to a review of the
rates, terms and conditions of such services.

         In April 1992, FERC issued Order No. 636, which makes significant
changes to the regulatory schedule applicable to the services provided by
interstate natural gas pipelines.  The changes are intended to ensure that
pipelines provide transportation





                                       39
<PAGE>   41
service that is equal in quality for all gas supplies, whether the customer
purchases the gas from the pipeline or from another supplier.  FERC believes
these structural changes will benefit the public and all segments of the
natural gas industry by improving the access of gas buyers to a variety of gas
sellers so as to maximize the benefits of the competitive wellhead gas market.
During restructuring proceedings mandated by Order No. 636, current interstate
pipeline customers have an opportunity to reduce their purchases of gas from
the pipeline or to release their firm transportation capacity if they do not
need the capacity.  FERC is in the process of implementing Order No. 636, but
Delhi cannot predict the final requirements of the FERC initiatives or their
effect upon the availability or cost of transportation services to Delhi.

         Delhi anticipates that the merchant function of interstate pipelines
will continue to be reduced as a result of Order No. 636 and Delhi believes
that this reduction will provide Delhi with a number of opportunities to expand
its merchant function.  Under Order No. 636, Delhi will be able to offer its
merchant services to existing customers of interstate pipelines who are seeking
an alternative gas supply source.  During 1993, Delhi negotiated three Order
No. 636 sales of gas moving to off-system markets.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         The Delhi Group maintains a comprehensive environmental policy
overseen by the Public Policy Committee of the USX Board of Directors.  The
Safety and Environmental Affairs organization has the responsibility to ensure
that the Delhi Group's operating organizations maintain environmental
compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

         The businesses of the Delhi Group are subject to numerous federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment.  These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air
Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with
respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and
disposal, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous
substances.  In addition, many states where the Delhi Group operates have
similar laws dealing with the same matters.  These laws are constantly evolving
and becoming increasingly stringent.  The ultimate impact of complying with
existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due
in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for laws such as RCRA
and the CAA have not yet been promulgated or in certain instances are
undergoing revision.  These environmental laws and regulations, particularly
the 1990 Amendments to the CAA,  could result in increased capital, operating
and compliance costs. For a discussion of environmental expenditures, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" for the Delhi Group.

         The Delhi Group has incurred and will continue to incur capital and
operating and maintenance expenditures as a result of environmental laws and
regulations.  To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not
ultimately reflected in the prices of the Delhi Group's products and services,
operating results will be adversely affected.  The Delhi Group believes that
substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws
and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of their
operating facilities and their production proceses.

AIR

         The 1990 Amendments to the CAA impose more stringent limits on air
emissions, establish a federally mandated operating permit program and allow
for enhanced civil and criminal enforcement sanctions.  The principal impact of
the 1990 Amendments to the CAA on the Delhi Group is on its compressor stations
and its processing plants.  The amendments establish attainment deadlines and
control requirements based on the severity of air pollution in a geographical
area.  All facilities that are major sources as defined by the CAA will require
Title V permits.

WATER 

         The Delhi Group maintains the necessary discharge permits as required
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA
and it is in compliance with such permits.

SOLID WASTE

         The Delhi Group continues to seek methods to minimize the generation
of hazardous wastes in its operations.  RCRA establishes standards for the
management of solid and hazardous wastes.  Besides affecting current waste
disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain
past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of





                                       40
<PAGE>   42
underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Since the
EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of RCRA
and has not yet made clear the practical application of all the implementing
regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be
accurately estimated.  In addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations
are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the
costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until
their implementation becomes more accurately defined.

REMEDIATION 

         Minor remediation projects are done on a routine basis and related
expenditures have not been material.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

         The Delhi Group's capital expenditures for environmental controls were
$4.5 million in 1993, $3.0 million in 1992 and $2.0 million in 1991.  The Delhi
Group currently expects such expenditures to approximate $5 million in 1994.
Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which have varied,
and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the
availability of new technologies, among other matters.  Based upon currently
identified projects, the Delhi Group anticipates that environmental capital
expenditures in 1995 will remain at about the same levels experienced in 1994;
however, actual expenditures may increase as additional projects are identified
or additional requirements are imposed.  Expenditures for environmental
controls include amounts for projects which, while benefitting the environment,
also enhance operating efficiencies.





                                       41

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

         The location and general character of the principal oil and gas
properties, plants, mines, pipeline systems and other important physical
properties of USX are described in Item 1, the BUSINESS section of this
document.  Except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are
leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee.  The plants
and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and
vary in age and operating efficiency.  At the date of acquisition of important
properties, titles were examined and opinions of counsel obtained, but no title
examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document.  The
properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years
without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim.

         Several steel production facilities and interests in two liquefied
natural gas tankers are leased.  See "Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 16. Leases".

         The basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in the
"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary 
Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Estimated Quantities of 
Proved Oil and Gas Reserves".

         USX believes that its surface and mineral rights covering reserves are
adequate to assure the basic legal right to extract the minerals, but may not
yet have obtained all governmental permits necessary to do so.

         Unless otherwise indicated, all reserves shown are as of December 31,
1993.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or
threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments related to the Marathon
Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group involving a variety of
matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment.  Certain
of these matters are discussed below.  The ultimate resolution of these
contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
consolidated financial statements and/or to the financial statements of the
applicable group.  However, management believes that USX will remain a viable
and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies
could be resolved unfavorably.

USX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MARATHON GROUP

TEXAS CITY REFINERY LITIGATION

         On October 30, 1987, there was a release of hydrofluoric acid ("HF")
at Marathon's Texas City refinery when a contractor-operated crane failed and
ruptured the HF tank.  As a result, a number of lawsuits were filed against
Marathon and others for property damage and personal injury.  During the third
quarter of 1993, Marathon agreed to settle with over 3,000 plaintiffs. 
Aggregate litigation settlements with respect to these cases (some of which
have been agreed to but not finalized) are less than $14 million.  Excluding
those cases with agreed settlements, there are less than 100 plaintiffs
remaining in the cases still pending.  USX believes that a liability in excess
of the amount which had been provided for in this matter through December 31,
1993, is remote.
         
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS    

         The following is a summary of proceedings attributable to the Marathon
Group that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 1993, under federal
and state environmental laws.  Except as described herein, it is not possible
to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters; however,
management's belief set forth in the first paragraph under "Item 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS" above takes such matters into account.

         Claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites.  CERCLA is
intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to
fault.  Potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") for each site include present
and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the
substances at the site.  Liability is strict and can be joint and several.
Because of the ambiguity of the regulations, the difficulty of identifying the
responsible parties for any particular site,





                                       42
<PAGE>   44
the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the
uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of
damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be
incurred, USX is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance
with CERCLA.

         At December 31, 1993, USX had been identified as a PRP at a total of
14 CERCLA sites related to the Marathon Group.  Based on currently available
information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, USX believes
that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 13 of
these sites will be under $1 million per site and most will be under $100,000.
The other site is the MOTCO site near La Marque, TX, where Marathon was named
as a PRP in a complaint filed by the United States in 1986 concerning the
release of hazardous substances.  In 1993, Marathon and other PRPs entered into
a comprehensive consent decree with the federal government covering both onsite
and offsite remediation, and superseding a 1987 partial consent decree.  In
anticipation of the comprehensive consent decree, Marathon paid approximately
$1.8 million to the major PRP for the site, in exchange for that party's
assumption of Marathon's responsibility for onsite and offsite remediation and
indemnification of Marathon as to the remediation costs.

         In addition, there are 22 sites related to the Marathon Group where
USX has received information requests or other indications that USX may be a
PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the amount
thereof.

         There are also 49 additional sites, excluding retail marketing
outlets and the three RCRA sites mentioned below, related to the Marathon 
Group where state governmental agencies or private parties are seeking 
remediation under state environmental laws through discussions or litigation. 
Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary 
and incomplete, the Marathon Group believes that its liability for cleanup and 
remediation costs in connection with 26 of these sites will be under $100,000 
per site, another 18 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million
 per site and four sites may involve remediation costs between $1 million and 
$5 million per site.  There is one location which involves a remediation 
program in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources at a 
closed and dismantled refinery site located near Muskegon, MI.  The Marathon 
Group anticipates spending between $8 million and $18 million over the next 
10 to 20 years at this site.

         Additionally, the Marathon Group is involved with a potential
corrective action at its Robinson, IL refinery where the remediation costs have
been estimated at between $4 million and $18 million over the next 20 to 30
years.  There are two other corrective action sites where the Marathon Group
believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs will be under
$100,000 per site.

         In January 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
(Region 5, Chicago) served Marathon with a Complaint and Compliance Order for
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") violations at the Robinson
refinery seeking a penalty of $298,990.  The Complaint alleges that the
refinery violated RCRA for failure to properly characterize the waste water
from a truck rinse pad and to maintain records of such characterization and
failure to file a Class I permit modification and to implement the Contingency
Plan.  Marathon has filed its Answer denying liability.

USX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE U. S. STEEL GROUP

B&LE LITIGATION; MDL-587

         On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for Writ
of Certiorari by the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad ("B&LE") in the lower Lake
Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation ("MDL-587").  As a result, the decision of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirming judgments against the
B&LE of approximately $498 million, plus interest, relating to antitrust
violations by the B&LE was permitted to stand.  In addition, the Third Circuit
decision remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of their damage
awards.  At trial these plaintiffs asserted claims of approximately $8 million,
but were awarded only nominal damages by the jury.  A new trial date has not
been set.  Any damages awarded in a new trial may be more or less than $8
million and would be subject to trebling.

         The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX throughout the period
the conduct occurred.  It is now a subsidiary of Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar") in
which USX has a 45% equity interest.  These actions were excluded liabilities
in the sale of USX's transportation units in 1988, and USX is obligated to
reimburse Transtar for judgments paid by the B&LE.





                                       43
<PAGE>   45
         Following the Court of Appeals decision, USX, which had previously
accrued $90 million on a pre-tax basis for this litigation, charged an
additional amount of $619 million on a pre-tax basis against the results of the
U. S. Steel Group in the second quarter of 1993.  In late 1993, USX and LTV
Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the Plaintiffs in MDL-587, agreed to settle all
LTV's claims in that action for $375 million.  USX paid $200
million on December 29, 1993, and the balance on February 28, 1994.  Claims
of three additional plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993.

         These settlements resulted in a pre-tax credit of $127 million in the
fourth quarter financial results of the U. S. Steel Group.  As a result of the
denial of the Petition for Writ of Certiorari, judgments for the other MDL-587
plaintiffs (other than the two remanded for retrial), totaling approximately
$190 million, including post-judgment interest, were paid in the first quarter
of 1994. Claims for legal fees and costs related to these actions, estimated
not to exceed $20 million, remain to to paid.

B&LE LITIGATION; ARMCO

         In June 1990, following judgments entered on behalf of steel company
plaintiffs in MDL-587, Armco Steel filed federal antitrust claims against the
B&LE and other railroads in the Federal District Court for the District of
Columbia.  B&LE successfully challenged the actions for lack of jurisdiction
and venue, and the case was transferred to the Federal District Court for the
Northern District of Ohio.  Other defendant railroads settled with Armco,
leaving B&LE the only remaining defendant.  On April 7, 1993, B&LE's motion to
dismiss the federal antitrust claims on grounds of statute of limitations was
granted.  Subsequently, Armco refiled its claims under the Ohio Valentine Act.
B&LE's motions for summary judgment on time bar issues and for change of venue
to another Ohio county are pending, and not yet fully briefed.  No discovery
has been taken on the merits of Armco's claims, but if Armco survives the
present and possibly further pre-trial motions and the case proceeds to trial
on the merits, Armco's claimed damages are likely to be substantial.  Unlike
MDL-587, it is USX's position that the Armco case was not an excluded liability
in the sale of USX's transportation units to Transtar in 1988, and that USX
therefore is not obligated to reimburse Transtar for any judgments rendered in
the Armco case; however, this position is being disputed by Transtar and The
Blackstone Group, the ultimate owner of 52% of Transtar's outstanding shares.

FAIRFIELD AGREEMENT LITIGATION

         On November 15, 1989, USX and two former officials of the USWA were
indicted by a federal grand jury in Birmingham, AL which alleged that USX
granted leaves of absence and pensions to the union officials with intent to
influence their approval, implementation and interpretation of the December 24,
1983, Fairfield agreement, a local labor agreement which resulted in 
reopening USX's Fairfield Works. On July 10, 1990, USX and the union 
officials were convicted.  On September 27, 1990, the District Court imposed 
a $4.1 million fine on USX and ordered restitution to the U. S. Steel and 
Carnegie Pension Fund of approximately $300,000.  USX believes the verdicts 
were erroneous and has appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the 
11th Circuit.  The payment of the fine and the restitution have been stayed 
pending the appeal.  A former executive officer of USX who was also 
subsequently indicted has pleaded not guilty and has not yet been tried.  A 
related civil action against USX, which was dismissed by the trial court, has 
been appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.

PICKERING LITIGATION 

         On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for the District
of Utah Central Division issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order in PICKERING V.
USX relating to pension and compensation claims by approximately 1,900
employees of USX's former Geneva (UT) Works.  Although the court dismissed a
number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had violated the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act by interfering with the accrual of
pension benefits of certain employees and amending a benefit plan to reduce the
accrual of future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.  Further
proceedings were held to determine damages and, pending the court's
determinations, USX may appeal.  Plaintiffs' counsel has been reported as
estimating plaintiffs' recovery to be in excess of $100 million.  USX believes
any such damages will likely be substantially less than the plaintiff's
estimate.

ENERGY BUYERS LITIGATION

         On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for approximately
$117 million, plus interest under Ohio law, against USX in ENERGY BUYERS
SERVICE CORPORATION V. USX CORPORATION, a case originally filed in the District
Court of Harris





                                       44
<PAGE>   46
County, TX.  Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31, 1992.  On
December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the case for $95 million
and deferred payments of up to $9 million.

ALOHA STADIUM LITIGATION

         A jury trial commenced in late June 1993, in a case filed in the
Circuit Court of the First Circuit of Hawaii by the State of Hawaii alleging,
among other things, that the weathering steel, including USS COR-TEN Steel,
which was incorporated into the Aloha Stadium was unsuitable for the purpose
used. The State sought damages of approximately $97 million for past and 
future repair costs and also sought treble damages and punitive damages for 
deceptive trade practices and fraud, respectively.  On October 1, 1993, the 
jury returned a verdict finding no liability on the part of U. S. Steel.  
In January 1994, the State appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Hawaii.

INLAND STEEL PATENT LITIGATION

         In July 1991, Inland Steel Company ("Inland") filed an action against
USX and another domestic steel producer in the U. S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging defendants had
infringed two of Inland's steel-related patents.  Inland seeks monetary
damages of up to approximately $50 million and an injunction against future
infringement.  USX in its answer and counterclaim alleges the patents are
invalid and not infringed and seeks a declaratory judgment to such effect.  In
May 1993, a jury found USX to have infringed the patents.  The District Court
has yet to rule on the validity of the patents.  In July 1993, the U. S. Patent
Office rejected the claims of the two Inland patents upon a reexamination at
the request of USX and the other steel producer.  A further request was
submitted by USX to the Patent Office in October 1993, presenting additional
questions as to patentability which was granted and consolidated for 
consideration with the original request. Inland is entitled to a hearing 
prior to the time that the decision of the Patent Office becomes final, and 
any final decision by the Patent Office is subject to judicial appeal.

SECURITIES LITIGATION 

         In July 1993, a class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania (FINKEL V. LEHMAN BROTHERS, ET AL.)
naming as defendants USX, Messrs. C.A. Corry, R.M. Hernandez and L.B. Jones,
officers of the Corporation, and the underwriters in a public offering of 10
million shares of Steel Stock completed on July 29, 1993.  The complaint
alleges that the Corporation's prospectus and registration statement was false
and misleading with respect to the effect of unfairly traded imports on the
domestic steel industry and the then pending ITC proceedings and seeks as
damages the difference between the public offering price and the value of the
shares at the time the action was brought or the price at which shares were
disposed of prior to filing the suit.  Two additional actions (SNYDER V. USX,
ET AL. AND ERENBERG V. USX, ET AL.) involving essentially the same issues were
filed in August 1993 in the same court and added Mr. T.J. Usher, also an
officer, as a defendant.  In January 1994, USX filed a motion to dismiss these
cases, which have been consolidated. This motion has not yet been acted upon.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS 

         The following is a summary of the proceedings attributable to the 
U. S. Steel Group that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 1993, 
under federal and state environmental laws.  Except as described herein, it is 
not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters; 
however, management's belief set forth in the first paragraph under "Item 3. 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" above takes such matters into account.

         Claims under CERCLA and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites.  CERCLA is
intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to
fault.  PRP's for each site include present and former owners and operators of,
transporters to and generators of the substances at the site.  Liability is
strict and can be joint and several.  Because of the ambiguity of the
regulations, the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any
particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among
them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the
amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs
may be incurred, USX is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of
compliance with CERCLA.

         At December 31, 1993, USX had been identified as a PRP at a total of
41 CERCLA sites related to the U. S. Steel Group.  Based on currently available
information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, USX believes
that its liability for





                                       45
<PAGE>   47
cleanup and remediation costs in connection with 34 of these sites will be
under $1 million per site and most will be under $100,000. At one site, U. S.
Steel's former Duluth, MN Works, USX had estimated spending approximately $3.3
million over the next three years.  However, in September 1993, USX was
directed to develop alternative methods of remediation for this site, the cost
of which is presently unknown and indeterminable and, as a result, future costs
may be more or less than the $3.3 million previously estimated.  At the
remaining six sites, USX has no reason to believe that its share in the
remaining cleanup costs at any single site will exceed $5 million, although it
is not possible to accurately predict the amount of USX's share in any final
allocation of such costs.  Following is a summary of the status of the six
sites:

      In 1988, USX and three other PRPs agreed to the issuance of an
      administrative order by the EPA to undertake emergency removal work at
      the Municipal & Industrial Disposal Co. site in Elizabeth, PA.  The cost
      of such removal, which has been completed, was approximately $3 million,
      of which USX paid $2.5 million.  The EPA has indicated that further
      remediation of this site may be required in the future, but it has not
      conducted any assessment or investigation to support what remediation
      would be required.  In October 1991, the Pennsylvania Department of
      Environmental Resources ("PaDER") placed the site on the Pennsylvania
      State Superfund list and began a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
      Study ("RI/FS") which is expected to be completed in late 1994.  It is
      not possible to estimate accurately the cost of any remediation or USX's
      share in any final allocation formula; however, based on presently
      available information, USX may have been responsible for approximately
      70% of the waste material deposited at the site.

      In 1989, a consent decree negotiated between the EPA and USX was entered
      in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey requiring USX to undertake
      remedial work at the Tabernacle Drum Dump site in Tabernacle, NJ.  USX
      has expended $2.5 million in completing the remedial design and in
      constructing the treatment system.  It is expected that the remaining
      remedial work will cost approximately $1.0 million.  Additionally, the
      Department of Justice filed a complaint in 1990 against USX and a waste
      disposal firm seeking recovery of $1.7 million expended by the EPA in
      conducting a RI/FS for the site.  USX has cross claimed against the waste
      disposal firm, and its successor in ownership, which improperly disposed
      of the waste material.

      At the Arrowhead Refinery site in Hermantown, MN, USX is one of 17
      defendants named in a complaint filed by the EPA in 1989.  The agency is
      seeking to recover over $4 million in past costs and a declaratory
      judgment as to all future costs that may be expended by the government at
      this site.  The Record of Decision issued by the EPA in 1986 selected a
      remediation plan which was projected by the agency in 1990 to cost over
      $60 million.  In response to a unilateral administrative order issued by
      the EPA in March 1990, USX and 28 other PRPs are implementing the
      groundwater remedial phase of the site remediation, which is expected to
      cost a total of $2 million.  The EPA issued a further administrative
      order in May 1991, to USX and 150 other PRPs mandating remediation of the
      site sludge material.  However, in response to treatability studies
      performed by USX and thirty other PRPs, the EPA amended the Record of
      Decision on February 9, 1994, to allow a more cost effective remediation
      of the site's sludge material and contaminated soils to be implemented.
      The remediation costs under the revised remedy will be under $25 million.
      Subject to completing the ongoing negotiations for a global settlement
      involving all PRPs, the EPA has agreed to forgive its past costs and
      implement a component of the site remediation.  The EPA's contribution
      towards the necessary site expenditures would be over 30%.  Additionally,
      an allocation consultant submitted its final report on January 14, 1994,
      with the approval of the court in an attempt to determine each PRP's
      share of the waste disposed of at the site.  Based upon this report, USX
      should be responsible for no more than 3% of the site costs.  However,
      this percentage may increase slightly due to the inability of some PRPs
      to contribute financially towards the site remediation.

      USX participated with thirty-five other PRPs in performing removal work
      at the Ekotek/Petrochem site in Salt Lake City, UT under the terms of a
      1991 administrative order negotiated with the EPA.  The removal work was
      completed in 1992 at a cost of over $9 million.  In July 1992, the PRP
      Remediation Committee negotiated an administrative order on consent to
      perform a RI/FS of the site.  It is expected the RI/FS will be completed
      by the end of 1994.  USX has contributed approximately $550,000 through
      1993 towards completing the removal work and performing the RI/FS.  USX's
      proportionate share of costs presently being used by the PRP Remediation
      Committee is approximately 5% of the participating PRPs, but a final
      determination has not yet been made and it is expected that the
      percentage may decrease as a result of the participation of additional
      PRPs.  The PRP Remediation Committee is attempting to involve
      non-participating PRPs in financing all the site response work.





                                       46
<PAGE>   48
      USX owns about 51% of the common stock of RMI Titanium Company ("RMI")
      which has been identified as a PRP (together with 31 other companies) at
      the Fields Brook Superfund site in Ashtabula, OH.  In 1986, the EPA
      estimated the cost of remediation at $48 million, although the actual
      costs may be significantly more or less depending on a variety of
      factors.  RMI and twelve other PRPs are conducting a study at an
      estimated cost of $16.5 million.  The thirteen PRPs have agreed to
      non-binding arbitration to allocate the cost of complying with the order
      to do the study.  It is not possible to determine accurately RMI's share
      in any final allocation formula with respect to the study or the cleanup;
      however, on the basis of its current knowledge, RMI believes its share of
      the ultimate costs will be in the range of 5% to 11%.

      The Buckeye Reclamation Landfill, near St. Clairsville, OH, has been used
      at various times as a disposal site for coal mine refuse and municipal
      and industrial waste.  USX is one of fifteen PRPs that have indicated a
      willingness to enter into an agreed order with the EPA to perform a
      remediation of the site.  Until there is a final determination of each
      PRP's proportionate share at the site, USX has agreed to accept a share
      of 9.26% under an interim allocation agreement among all fifteen PRPs.
      Since 1992, USX has spent approximately $250,000 at the site, primarily
      on remedial design work estimated to total $2.5 million.  Implementation
      of the remedial design plan, resulting in a long-term cleanup of the
      site, is expected to cost approximately $21.5 million.

         In addition, there are 28 sites related to the U. S. Steel Group where
USX has received information requests or other indications that USX may be a
PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the amount
thereof.

         There are also nine additional sites, excluding the RCRA site mentioned
below, related to the U. S. Steel Group where state governmental agencies or 
private parties are seeking remediation under state environmental laws 
through discussions or litigation.  Based on currently available 
information, which is in many cases preliminary and ,incomplete, the U. S. 
Steel Group believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs 
in connection with two of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 
another two sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per 
site and one site may involve remediation costs between $1 million and 
$5 million.  The U. S. Steel Group is currently unable to classify the
potential costs associated with remediation at four of the sites.

         Additionally, the U. S. Steel Group has commenced a RCRA Facility
Investigation and a Corrective Measure Study at its Fairless Works.  This study
is expected to take three years to complete at a cost of $2 million to 
$3 million.  The cost associated with any remediation which may ultimately 
be required is not presently reasonably estimable.

The following cases are also pending:

         In 1987, USX and the PaDER entered into a consent order to resolve an
incident in January 1985 involving the alleged unauthorized discharge of
benzene and other organic pollutants from U. S. Steel's Clairton Works in
Clairton, PA.  That consent order required USX to pay a penalty of $50,000 and
a monthly payment of $2,500 for five years.  In 1990, USX and the PaDER reached
agreement to amend the consent order.  Under the amended order, USX has agreed
to continue paying the prior $2,500 monthly penalty until February 1997; to
clean up and close a former coke plant waste disposal site over a period of 15
years; to pay a penalty of $300,000; and to pay a monthly penalty of up to
$1,500 each month until the former disposal site is closed.  A study is
underway to determine clean up and closure requirements.

         In 1988, the United States filed an action in the United States
District Court, Northern District of Indiana, for alleged violations of its
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit effluent
limitations and proposed including U. S. Steel's Gary Works on the EPA's List
of Violating Facilities under Section 508 of the Clean Water Act based upon the
EPA's allegations of continuing or recurring non-compliance with clean water
standards at the facility.  A consent decree signed by USX and approved by the
court in 1990 requires USX to pay a civil penalty of $1.6 million, to study and
implement a program to remediate the sediment in a portion of the Grand Calumet
River and to comply with specified wastewater control requirements entailing up
to $25 million for new control equipment.  In addition, the EPA withdrew the
proposal to include Gary Works on the List of Violating Facilities.  A proposed
sediment remediation plan was submitted to the EPA in February 1993, which is
estimated to cost approximately $29 million.  USX and the EPA are currently
negotiating the terms under which the sediment remediation plan will be
implemented.





                                       47
<PAGE>   49
        In 1990, USX received a Notice of Violation issued by IDEM alleging the
violation of regulations concerning hazardous wastes at U. S. Steel's Gary
Works.  The proposed Agreed Order included with the Notice of Violation
provided for a civil penalty of $145,000.  After several unsuccessful
discussions with the agency in an attempt to resolve the issues raised in the
Notice of Violation, including the amount of any penalty, the agency issued an
Order assessing a civil penalty of $180,225.  USX filed an appeal of the Order.
USX and the agency are pursuing settlement discussions.

        In 1991, the Department of Justice filed an action against USX in the 
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging that
USX used process waste water to quench coke at U. S. Steel's Clairton Works on
381 occasions and had vented unburned coke oven gas into the atmosphere on 13
occasions.  The complaint requested that USX be enjoined from operating the
coke batteries in violation of the CAA and related state and local laws and to
install appropriate pollution control equipment.  The action sought civil
penalties at the maximum statutory rate of $25,000 per day of violation from
December 1, 1985.  An agreement on the final consent decree was reached in late
1992 and the proposed consent decree was filed with the court on February 18,
1993.  The consent decree was approved and entered by the court on June 24,
1993, and USX paid civil penalties of $1.8 million on July 1, 1993.

        In January 1992, USX commenced negotiations with the EPA regarding
the terms of an administrative order on consent, pursuant to the RCRA, under
which USX would perform a RCRA Facility Investigation ("RFI") and a Corrective
Measure Study ("CMS") at USX's Fairless Works.  USX commenced the RFI/CMS
during 1993, which will require over three years to complete at an approximate
cost ranging from $2-3 million.  The RFI/CMS will determine whether there is a
need for, and the scope of, any remedial activities at Fairless Works.

        In January 1992, the EPA filed an Administrative Complaint against
USX's Gary Works alleging violations of the regulations governing releases from
underground storage tanks.  On July 30, 1993, a Consent Agreement and Final
Order was signed by USX and the EPA in resolution of the Administrative 
Complaint.  USX is required to perform additional assessment work and 
complete any soil and groundwater contamination indicated by the 
assessments.  USX also paid a civil penalty in the amount of $164,550.

        On October 9, 1992, the EPA filed a complaint against RMI alleging
certain RCRA violations at RMI's closed sodium plant in Ashtabula, OH.  The
EPA's determination is based on information gathered during inspections of the
facility in 1991.  Under the complaint, the EPA proposed to assess a civil
penalty of approximately $1.4 million for alleged failure to comply with RCRA.
RMI is contesting the complaint.  It is RMI's position that it has complied
with the provisions of RCRA and that the EPA's assessment of penalties is
inappropriate.  A formal hearing has been requested and informal discussions
with the EPA to settle this matter are ongoing.  Based on the preliminary
nature of the proceedings, RMI is currently unable to determine the ultimate
liability, if any, that may arise from this matter.

        On January 17, 1992, USX filed an appeal with the Pennsylvania
Environmental Hearing Board contesting the issuance of a NPDES permit for the
Taylor Landfill in West Mifflin, PA.  On June 23, 1993, the Board approved a
Consent Order and Adjudication between USX and the PaDER resolving issues
raised by USX in its appeal.  The agreement provides USX with a compliance
schedule to install water pollution control equipment.  In addition, USX agreed
to pay a total civil penalty of $300,000 in annual payments of $100,000.  USX
paid the first payment in June 1993.

USX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DELHI GROUP

SWEPCO LITIGATION

        On January 26, 1994, a settlement agreement was executed between
Delhi and Southwestern Electric Power Company ("SWEPCO"), resolving litigation
which began in 1991 related to a 15-year natural gas purchase contract
("original contract") which was due to expire in April 1995.  The settlement
agreement provides that SWEPCO pay Delhi the price under the original contract
through January 1994.  Concurrent with execution of the settlement agreement,
Delhi executed a new four-year agreement with SWEPCO enabling Delhi to supply
increased volumes of gas to two SWEPCO power plants in East Texas at market
sensitive prices and premiums commensurate with the level of service provided.
The agreement provides for swing service and does not require any minimum gas
purchase volumes.  The Delhi Group's operating income and cash flow will be
adversely affected by the amount of premiums lost under the original contract
for the period February 1, 1994, through April 1, 1995.  Broad estimates of the
potential premium losses are $18 million and $4 million in 1994 and 1995,
respectively.





                                       48
<PAGE>   50
ENSERCH LITIGATION

        Delhi is also a defendant in ENSERCH EXPLORATION, INC., AND EP
OPERATING COMPANY V. DELHI GAS PIPELINE CORPORATION, which was filed in the
193rd District Court in Dallas County, TX, in July 1990.  This lawsuit involves
a take-or-pay claim against Delhi under a contract which provided Delhi the
right to suspend the contract if it was uneconomic to purchase gas thereunder.
The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages for breach of the contract, as well as
a declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties under
the contract.  A summary judgment previously granted by the trial court in
Delhi's favor was reversed upon appeal.  The trial date has been set for August
1, 1994, and the case is currently in the discovery phase.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

        Delhi is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations
relating to the environment.  Based on procedures currently in place, including
routine reviews of existing and proposed environmental laws and regulations and
unannounced environmental inspections performed periodically at company
facilities, and the associated expenditures for environmental controls, Delhi
believes that its facilities and operations are in general compliance with
environmental laws and regulations.  However, because some of these
requirements presently are not fixed, Delhi is unable to accurately predict the
eventual cost of compliance.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND
         RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

        The principal market on which Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi
Stock are traded is the New York Stock Exchange.  Information concerning the
high and low sales prices for the common stocks as reported in the consolidated
transaction reporting system and the frequency and amount of dividends paid
during the last two years is set forth in "Consolidated Financial Statements 
and Supplementary Data - Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)".

        As of February 28, 1994, there were 116,979 registered holders of
Marathon Stock, 83,297  registered holders of Steel Stock and 124 registered
holders of Delhi Stock.

        The Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on Marathon
Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock based on the financial condition and results
of operations of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group,
respectively, although it has no obligation under Delaware law to do so.  In
determining its dividend policy with respect to Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and
Delhi Stock, the Board will rely on the separate financial statements of the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, respectively.  The
method of calculating earnings per share for Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and
Delhi Stock reflects the Board's intent that separately reported earnings and
the surplus of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group,
as determined consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation, are available
for payment of dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes of stock do not
necessarily correspond with these amounts.  Dividends on Marathon Stock, Steel
Stock and Delhi Stock are limited to legally available funds of USX, which are
determined on the basis of the entire Corporation.  Distributions on Marathon
Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock would be precluded by a failure to pay
dividends on preferred stock of USX.  In addition, net losses of any group, as
well as dividends or distributions on any class of USX common stock or series
of preferred stock and repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain
series of preferred stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for
payment of dividends on the three classes of USX common stock as well as any
preferred stock.

        Dividends on Steel Stock are further limited to the Available Steel
Dividend Amount.  Net losses of the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group and
distributions on Marathon Stock, Delhi Stock and on any preferred stock
attributed to the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group will not reduce the funds
available for declaration and payment of dividends on Steel Stock unless the
legally available funds of USX are less than the Available Steel Dividend
Amount.  Dividends on Delhi Stock are further limited to the Available Delhi
Dividend Amount.  Net losses of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group
and distributions on Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and on any preferred stock
attributed to the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel Group will not reduce the
funds available for declaration and payment of dividends on Delhi Stock unless
the legally available funds of USX are less than the Available Delhi Dividend
Amount.  See "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements - 21. Dividends".

        The Board has adopted certain policies with respect to the Marathon
Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group, including, without
limitation, the intention to: (i) limit capital expenditures of the U. S. Steel
Group over the long term to an amount equal to the internally generated cash
flow of the U. S. Steel Group, including funds generated by sales of assets of
the U. S. Steel Group, (ii) sell assets and provide services between any of the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group only on an
arm's-length basis and (iii) treat funds generated by sales of Marathon Stock,
Steel Stock or Delhi Stock (except for sales of Delhi Stock deemed to represent
the Retained Interest) and securities convertible into such stock as assets of
the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group, or the Delhi Group, as the case may
be, and apply such funds to acquire assets or reduce liabilities of the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group, respectively.  These
policies may be modified or rescinded by action of the Board, or the Board may
adopt additional policies, without the approval of holders of the three classes
of USX common stock, although the Board has no present intention to do so.

FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE BOARD; RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS

        Under Delaware law, the Board must act with due care and in the best
interest of all the stockholders, including the holders of the shares of each
class of USX common stock.  The interests of the holders of any class of USX
common stock may, under some circumstances, diverge or appear to diverge.
Examples include the determination of whether shares of Delhi Stock offered for
sale will be deemed to represent either part of the Retained Interest or an
additional equity interest in the Delhi Group; the optional exchange of Steel
Stock for Marathon Stock at the 10% premium or of Delhi Stock for Marathon
Stock or Steel Stock at the 10% premium or 15% premium, as the case may be, the
determination of the record date of any such exchange or for the redemption of
any Steel Stock or Delhi Stock; the establishing of the date for public
announcement of the liquidation of USX and the commitment of capital among the
Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group.

        Because the Board owes an equal duty to all common stockholders
regardless of class, the Board is the appropriate body to deal with these
matters.  In order to assist the Board in this regard, USX has formulated
policies to serve as guidelines for the resolution of matters involving a
conflict or a potential conflict, including policies dealing with the payment
of dividends, limiting capital investment in the U. S. Steel Group over the
long term to its internally generated cash flow and allocation of corporate
expenses and other matters.  The Board has been advised concerning the
applicable law relating to the discharge of its fiduciary duties to the common
stockholders in the context of the separate classes of USX common stock and has
delegated to the Audit Committee of the Board the responsibility to review
matters which relate to this subject and report to the Board.  While the
classes of USX common stock may give rise to an increased potential for
conflicts of interest, established rules of Delaware law would apply to the
resolution of any such conflicts. Under Delaware law, a good faith
determination by a disinterested and adequately informed Board with respect to
any such matter would be a defense to any claim of liability made on behalf of
the holders of any class of USX common stock.  USX is aware of no precedent
concerning the manner in which such rules of Delaware law would be applied in
the context of its capital structure.

(a)   For purposes of computing Marathon Stock per share data for periods prior
      to May 7, 1991, the numbers of shares are assumed to be the same as the
      corresponding numbers of shares of USX common stock.  For computing Steel
      Stock per share data for periods prior to May 7, 1991, the number of
      shares are assumed to be one-fifth of the corresponding number of shares
      of USX common stock.
(b)   The initial dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock were paid on
      September 10, 1991; dividends paid prior to that date on the common stock
      were attributed to the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group based
      upon the relationship of the initial dividends on the Marathon Stock and
      the Steel Stock.

                EXPLANATORY NOTE REGARDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION


                Although the financial statements of the Marathon Group, the U.
                S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
                assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
                stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group, such
                attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
                responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-Marathon
                Group Common Stock, USX-U.S. Steel Group Common Stock and
                USX-Delhi Group Common Stock are holders of common stock of USX
                and continue to be subject to all the risks associated with an
                investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
                Financial impacts arising from any of the Marathon Group, the
                U.S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group which affect the overall
                cost of USX's capital could affect the results of operations
                and financial condition of all groups. In addition, net losses
                of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
                class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
                repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain series
                of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
                available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX common
                stock.

                Management's Report

                The accompanying consolidated financial statements of USX
                Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (USX) are the
                responsibility of and have been prepared by USX in conformity
                with generally accepted accounting principles. They necessarily
                include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
                estimates. The consolidated financial information displayed in
                other sections of this report is consistent with that in these
                consolidated financial statements.
                     USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
                financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
                organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate
                division of responsibility and by communications programs aimed
                at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
                throughout the organization.
                     USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
                accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
                that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are
                reliable. Appropriate management monitors the system for
                compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
                effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In
                addition, as part of their audit of the consolidated financial
                statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by
                the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
                controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon
                in determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to
                be applied.
                     The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the
                area of financial reporting and internal accounting control
                through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed solely of
                nonmanagement directors, regularly meets (jointly and
                separately) with the independent accountants, management and
                internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of
                its responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls
                and the consolidated financial statements.

                Report of Independent Accountants

                To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

                In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial
                statements appearing on pages U-4 through U-26 and as listed
                in Item 14.A.2 on page 61 of this report present fairly,
                in all material respects, the financial position of USX
                Corporation and Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 1993 and
                1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
                for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
                1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
                principles. These financial statements are the responsibility
                of USX's management; our responsibility is to express an
                opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
                conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
                generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
                plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
                whether the financial statements are free of material
                misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
                evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
                financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
                and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
                the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
                our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
                above.
                     As discussed in Note 1, page U-10, in 1993 USX adopted new
                accounting standards for postemployment benefits and for
                retrospectively rated insurance contracts. As discussed in Note
                8, page U-15, and Note 9, page U-16, in 1992 USX adopted new
                accounting standards for postretirement benefits other than
                pensions and for income taxes, respectively.

                Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity

                USX has three classes of common stock, being USX -- Marathon
                Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock), USX -- U. S. Steel Group
                Common Stock (Steel Stock), and USX -- Delhi Group Common Stock
                (Delhi Stock), which are intended to reflect the performance of
                the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group, and the Delhi Group,
                respectively. (See Note 6, page U-12 for a description of the
                three groups.)
                     The Marathon Stock and Steel Stock were initially
                authorized and issued on May 6, 1991, when the USX Certificate
                of Incorporation was amended and a distribution was made to
                holders of USX common stock of one-fifth of a share of Steel
                Stock, for each share of USX common stock held. Concurrent with
                the Steel Stock distribution, each share of USX common stock
                was changed into one share of Marathon Stock. Retroactive
                effect has been given to the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock in
                these consolidated financial statements. Also on May 6, 1991,
                all shares of existing USX treasury stock were retired. The USX
                Certificate of Incorporation was amended on September 30, 1992,
                to authorize a new class of common stock. On October 2, 1992,
                USX sold 9,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to the public.
                     On all matters where the holders of Marathon Stock, Steel
                Stock and Delhi Stock vote together as a single class, Marathon
                Stock has one vote per share, and Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
                each have a fluctuating vote per share based on the relative
                market value of a share of Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the
                case may be, to the market value of a share of Marathon Stock.
                In the event of a disposition of all or substantially all the
                properties and assets of either the U. S. Steel Group or the
                Delhi Group, USX must either distribute the net proceeds to the
                holders of the Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the case may be,
                as a special dividend or in redemption of the stock, or
                exchange the Steel Stock or Delhi Stock, as the case may be,
                for one or the other remaining two classes of stock. In the
                event of liquidation of USX, the holders of the Marathon Stock,
                Steel Stock and Delhi Stock will share in the funds remaining
                for common stockholders based on the relative market
                capitalization of the respective Marathon Stock, Steel Stock or
                Delhi Stock to the aggregate market capitalization of all
                classes of common stock.

                Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
                PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated
                financial statements include the accounts of USX Corporation
                and its majority-owned subsidiaries (USX).
                   Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures are
                accounted for on a pro rata basis.  
                   Investments in other entities in which USX has significant 
                influence in management and control are accounted for using
                the equity method of accounting and are carried in the
                investment account at USX's share of net assets plus advances.
                The proportionate share of income from equity investments is
                included in other income.
                     Investments in marketable equity securities are carried at
                lower of cost or market and investments in other companies are
                carried at cost, with income recognized when dividends are
                received.

                NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- The following accounting standards
                were adopted by USX during 1993: 
                   Postemployment benefits -- Effective January 1, 1993, USX 
                   adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112,
                   "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS 
                   No. 112). SFAS No. 112 requires employers to recognize the 
                   obligation to provide postemployment benefits on an accrual
                   basis if certain conditions are met.  USX is affected 
                   primarily by disability-related claims covering indemnity 
                   and medical payments. The obligation for these claims is 
                   measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
                   including appropriate discount rates. The cumulative effect 
                   of the change in accounting principle determined as of 
                   January 1, 1993, reduced net income $86 million, net of $50
                   million income tax effect. The effect of the change in 
                   accounting principle reduced 1993 operating income by $23 
                   million.  
                   Accounting for multiple-year retrospectively rated insurance
                   contracts -- USX adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 
                   Consensus No. 93-14, "Accounting for Multiple-Year 
                   Retrospectively Rated Insurance Contracts". EITF No.  93-14
                   requires accrual of retrospective premium adjustments when 
                   the insured has an obligation to pay cash to the insurer 
                   that would not have been required absent experience under 
                   the contract. The cumulative effect of the change in 
                   accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993, 
                   reduced net income $6 million, net of $3 million income tax
                   effect.

                   USX has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
                Loan" (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114 requires impairment of loans
                based on either the sum of discounted cash flows or the fair
                value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No.
                114 in the first quarter of 1995.  Based on preliminary
                estimates, USX expects the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS
                No. 114 will be less than $2 million.

                CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes
                cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt instruments
                with maturities generally of three months or less.

                INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
                market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the
                last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

                HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- USX enters into futures contracts,
                commodity swaps and options to hedge exposure to price
                fluctuations relevant to the purchase or sale of crude oil,
                refined products and natural gas. Such transactions are
                accounted for as part of the commodity being hedged. Forward
                contracts are used to hedge currency risks, and the accounting
                is based on the requirements of Statement of Financial
                Accounting Standards No. 52.

                EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- USX follows the successful
                efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and
                development.

                GAS BALANCING -- USX follows the sales method of accounting for
                gas production imbalances.

                PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Except for oil and gas
                producing properties, depreciation is generally computed on the
                straight-line method based upon estimated lives of assets.
                USX's method of computing depreciation for steel producing
                assets modifies straight-line depreciation based on level of





                                      U-10
<PAGE>   70
                production. In 1992, USX revised the modification factors used
                in the depreciation of steel assets accounted for by the
                modified straight-line method to reflect that raw steel
                production capability is entirely continuous cast. The revised
                modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a
                production level below 81% of capability, to a maximum of 105%
                for a 100% production level. No modification is made at the 95%
                production level, considered the normal long-range level.
                   Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing
                properties are computed using predetermined rates based upon
                estimated proved oil and gas reserves applied on a
                units-of-production method.
                   Depletion of mineral properties, other than oil and gas, is
                based on rates which are expected to amortize cost over the
                estimated tonnage of minerals to be removed.
                   When an entire property, plant, major facility or facilities
                depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
                disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income. Proceeds
                from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a group basis
                are credited to the depreciation reserve with no immediate
                effect on income.

                INSURANCE -- USX is insured for catastrophic casualty and
                certain property exposures, as well as those risks required to
                be insured by law or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured
                losses are charged against income upon occurrence.
                RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior years'
                data have been made to conform to 1993 classifications.

2. SALES

</TABLE>

                (a)  Gains resulted primarily from the sale of the Cumberland
                     coal mine, an investment in an insurance company and the
                     realization of deferred gain resulting from collection of
                     a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar,
                     Inc. (Transtar). The collection also resulted in interest
                     income of $37 million.
                (b)  Included a $29 million favorable minority interest effect
                     related to a loss of RMI Titanium Company (a 51%-owned
                     company), of which $19 million resulted from restructuring
                     charges.
                (c)  Included a $177 million favorable adjustment related to
                     interest income from a refund of prior years' production
                     taxes.
                (d)  Reflected $164 million related to the B&LE litigation
                     (Note 5, page U-12).
                (e)  Included a $26 million favorable adjustment related to
                     interest accrued for prior years' production taxes.  
                (f)  Excluded financial income and costs of finance operations,
                     which are included in operating income.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
                The 1993 restructuring action involving the planned closure of
                a Pennsylvania coal mine resulted in a $42 million charge to
                operating income, primarily related to the writedown of
                property, plant and equipment, contract termination, and mine
                closure cost. In 1992, restructuring actions resulted in a $125
                million charge to operating income, of which $115 was for the
                disposition of nonstrategic domestic exploration and production
                properties, and $10 million for the completion of the 1991
                restructuring plan related to steel operations. The 1991
                restructuring actions resulted in a $426 million charge to
                operating income, primarily related to write-downs of property,
                plant and equipment and employee costs related to the permanent
                closing of certain steel facilities.


5. B&LE LITIGATION
                Pretax income (loss) in 1993 included a $506 million charge
                related to the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore
                Antitrust Litigation against a former USX subsidiary, the
                Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (B&LE) (Note 25, page U-24).
                Charges of $342 million were included in operating costs and
                $164 million included in interest and other financial costs.
                The effect on 1993 net income (loss) was $325 million
                unfavorable ($5.04 per share of Steel Stock).  At December 31,
                1993, accounts payable included $376 million for this
                litigation.


6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
                USX has three classes of common stock: Marathon Stock, Steel
                Stock and Delhi Stock, which are intended to reflect the
                performance of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and
                the Delhi Group, respectively. The segments of USX conform to
                USX's group structure. A description of each group and its
                products and services is as follows:

                     MARATHON GROUP -- The Marathon Group is involved in
                     worldwide exploration, production, transportation and
                     marketing of crude oil and natural gas; and domestic
                     refining, marketing and transportation of petroleum
                     products.  
                     U. S. STEEL GROUP -- The U. S. Steel Group, which
                     consists primarily of steel operations, includes one
                     of the largest domestic integrated steel producers and is

7. PENSIONS
                USX has noncontributory defined benefit plans covering
                substantially all employees. Benefits under these plans are
                based upon years of service and final average pensionable
                earnings, or a minimum benefit based upon years of service,
                whichever is greater. In addition, contributory pension
                benefits, which cover certain participating salaried employees,
                are based upon years of service and career earnings. The
                funding policy for defined benefit plans provides that payments
                to the pension trusts shall be equal to the minimum funding
                requirements of ERISA plus such additional amounts as may be
                approved from time to time.
                     USX also participates in multi-employer plans, most of
                which are defined benefit plans associated with coal
                operations.

                PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
                plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
                return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
                1991.

                December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively. Plans
                with accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) in excess of plan
                assets were not material in 1992.

8. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

                USX has defined benefit retiree health and life insurance plans
                covering most employees upon their retirement.  Health benefits
                are provided, for the most part, through comprehensive
                hospital, surgical and major medical benefit provisions subject
                to various cost sharing features. Life insurance benefits are
                provided to nonunion and certain union represented retiree
                beneficiaries primarily based on employees' annual base salary
                at retirement. For other union retirees, benefits are provided
                for the most part based on fixed amounts negotiated in labor
                contracts with the appropriate unions. Except for certain life
                insurance benefits paid from reserves held by insurance
                carriers, benefits have not been prefunded. In 1994, USX agreed
                to establish a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association
                (VEBA) Trust to prefund health care and life insurance benefits
                for retirees who are covered under the USWA union agreement.
                Minimum contributions, in the form of USX Corporation stock or
                cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and $10 million
                per year thereafter.
                    In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
                Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
                accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
                pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
                obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
                the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
                for current and future retirees over the fair value of plan
                assets and recorded postretirement benefit cost accruals. The
                cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle reduced
                net income $1,306 million, consisting of the transition
                obligation of $2,070 million, net of $764 million income tax
                effect.

                POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
                defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined assuming
                a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively, and an expected
                return on plan assets of 10% for each year presented below:

</TABLE>

                (a)In 1993, a new multi-employer benefit plan created by the
                   Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 replaced
                   the previous plan provided under the collective bargaining
                   agreement with the United Mine Workers of America. USX is
                   required to make payments to the plan based on assigned
                   beneficiaries receiving benefits and such payments are
                   expected to increase to approximately $15 million to $25
                   million in 1994 and subsequent years. The present value
                   of this unrecognized obligation is broadly estimated to
                   be $220 million, including the effects of future medical
                   inflation, and this amount could increase if additional
                   beneficiaries are assigned.

                     Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care benefits
                to retired employees was recognized as an expense primarily as
                claims were paid, and the cost of life insurance benefits for
                retirees was generally accrued during their working years.
                These costs totaled $155 million for 1991.

                     The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
                6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
                respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
                compensation levels was 4% at December 31, 1993, and December
                31, 1992. The weighted average health care cost trend rate in
                1994 is approximately 8%, gradually declining to an ultimate
                rate in 1997 of approximately 6%. A one percentage point
                increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each
                future year would have increased the aggregate of the service
                and interest cost components of the 1993 net periodic
                postretirement benefit cost by $34 million and would have
                increased the APBO as of December 31, 1993, by $372 million.

                SETTLEMENTS -- Other income disclosed in Note 3, page U-11,
                included a settlement gain of $24 million resulting from the
                sale of the Cumberland coal mine.

9. INCOME TAXES

                In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
                109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
                accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income
                tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect the
                future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
                between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
                liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
                $360 million.

                (a)Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
                   Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $144 million in
                   1991 was primarily the net result of the generation of
                   federal tax loss carryforwards and timing differences
                   related to restructuring charges and pension accruals.

                     In 1993, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                principles for postemployment benefits and for retrospectively
                rated insurance contracts included deferred tax benefits of $50
                million and $3 million, respectively (Note 1, page U-10). In
                1992, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                principle for other postretirement benefits included a deferred
                tax benefit of $764 million (Note 8, page U-15).

                    The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years 1988
                through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
                administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
                adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
                become payable for years not yet settled.
                    Pretax income (loss) included $(53) million, $55 million
                and $162 million attributable to foreign sources in 1993, 1992
                and 1991, respectively.

12. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

                ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE -- USX has entered into agreements to sell
                certain accounts receivable subject to limited recourse.
                Payments are collected from the sold accounts receivable; the
                collections are reinvested in new accounts receivable for the
                buyers; and a yield based on defined short-term market rates is
                transferred to the buyers. Collections on sold accounts
                receivable will be forwarded to the buyers at the end of the
                agreements in 1994 and 1995, in the event of earlier contract
                termination or if USX does not have a sufficient quantity of
                eligible accounts receivable to reinvest in for the buyers. The
                balance of sold accounts receivable averaged $733 million, $703
                million and $704 million for years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
                respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold
                accounts receivable that had not been collected was $740
                million. Buyers have collection rights to recover payments from
                an amount of outstanding receivables equal to 120% of the
                outstanding receivables purchased on a nonrecourse basis; such
                overcollateralization cannot exceed $150 million. USX does not
                generally require collateral for accounts receivable, but
                significantly reduces credit risk through credit extension and
                collection policies, which include analyzing the financial
                condition of potential customers, establishing credit limits,
                monitoring payments and aggressively pursuing delinquent
                accounts. In the event of a change in control of USX, as
                defined in the agreements, USX may be required to forward
                payments collected on sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

                LOANS RECEIVABLE -- Prior to 1993, USX Credit, a division of
                USX, sold certain of its loans receivable subject to limited
                recourse. USX Credit continues to collect payments from the
                loans and transfer to the buyers principal collected plus yield
                based on defined short-term market rates. In 1993, 1992 and
                1991, USX Credit net sales (repurchases) of loans receivable
                totaled $(50) million, $(24) million and $85 million,
                respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold loans
                receivable subject to recourse was $205 million. USX Credit is
                not actively seeking new loans at this time. USX Credit is
                subject to market risk through fluctuations in short-term
                market rates on sold loans which pay fixed interest rates. USX
                Credit significantly reduces credit risk through a credit
                policy, which requires that loans be secured by the real
                property or equipment financed, often with additional security
                such as letters of credit, personal guarantees and committed
                long-term financing takeouts. Also, USX Credit diversifies its
                portfolio as to types and terms of loans, borrowers, loan
                sizes, sources of business and types and locations of
                collateral. As of December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, USX
                Credit had outstanding loan commitments of $29 million and $32
                million, respectively. In the event of a change in control of
                USX, as defined in the agreement, USX may be required to
                provide cash collateral in the amount of the uncollected loans
                receivable to assure compliance with the limited recourse
                provisions.
                    Estimated credit losses under the limited recourse
                provisions for both accounts receivable and loans receivable
                are recognized when the receivables are sold consistent with
                bad debt experience. Recognized liabilities for future recourse
                obligations of sold receivables were $3 million and $1 million
                at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively.

                      two banks, with interest based on their prime rate or
                      London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and carry a
                      commitment fee of 3/8%. Certain other banks provide
                      short-term lines of credit totaling $185 million which
                      require maintenance of compensating balances of 3%. No
                      amounts were outstanding under these agreements at
                      December 31, 1993.
                 (c)  Computed by relating interest expense to average daily 
                      borrowing.

                (a)  An agreement which terminates in October 1995 provides for
                     borrowing under a $1,000 million revolving credit
                     facility and a $500 million term loan. A second agreement
                     provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility with
                     a second revolving credit period terminating on July 1,
                     1994, unless otherwise extended; any participating bank
                     failing to extend the revolving credit period has an
                     obligation, upon the demand of USX, to fund a term loan
                     which would be payable in October 1995. Interest is based
                     on defined short-term market rates. During the term of
                     these agreements, USX is obligated to pay a commitment fee
                     of 3/8% on the unused portions. At December 31, 1993, the
                     unused and available credit was $1,500 million; 
                     accordingly, the 9 1/2% Guaranteed Notes due 1994 have been
                     classified as long-term debt. 
                (b)  Foreign currency exchange agreements were executed in 
                     connection with these foreign currency obligations,
                     which effectively fixed the amount of interest and debt in
                     U.S. dollars, thereby eliminating currency exchange risks. 
                (c)  The Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures have a 
                     principal at maturity of $920 million. The original
                     issue discount is being amortized recognizing a yield to
                     maturity of 7 7/8% per annum. The carrying value represents
                     the principal at maturity less the unamortized discount.
                     Each debenture of $1,000 principal at maturity is
                     convertible into a unit consisting of 8.207 shares of
                     Marathon Stock and 1.6414 shares of Steel Stock subject to
                     adjustment or, at the election of USX, cash equal to the
                     market value of the unit. At the option of  the holder, USX
                     will purchase debentures at the carrying value of $430
                     million and $625 million on August 9, 1995, and August 9,
                     2000, respectively; USX may elect to pay the purchase price
                     in cash, shares of both common stocks or notes. USX may
                     call the debentures for redemption at the issue price plus
                     amortized discount beginning on August 9, 1995, or earlier
                     if the market value of one share of Marathon Stock and
                     one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock equals or exceeds
                     $57.375 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. 
                (d)  The debentures are convertible into one share of Marathon
                     Stock and one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock subject to
                     adjustment for $62.75 and are redeemable at USX's option.
                     Sinking fund requirements for all years through 1995 have
                     been satisfied  through repurchases. 
                (e)  The debentures are convertible into one share of Marathon
                     Stock and one-fifth of a share of Steel Stock subject to
                     adjustment for $38.125 and may be redeemed by USX. The
                     sinking fund begins in 1997. 
                (f)  At December 31, 1993, USX had outstanding obligations 
                     relating to short-term maturity Environmental Improvement 
                     Bonds in the amount of $203 million, which were supported 
                     by long-term credit arrangements. 
                (g)  The notes may be redeemed at par by USX on or after March 
                     1, 1996. 
                (h)  The notes pay interest monthly at 9 3/4% per annum until 
                     March 1, 1994, and at 7% per annum thereafter.  
                (i)  The guaranteed loan was used to fund a portion of the 
                     costs in connection with the development of the East
                     Brae Field and the SAGE pipeline in the North Sea. A
                     portion of proceeds from a long-term gas sales contract is
                     dedicated to loan service under certain circumstances.
                     Prepayment of the loan may be required under certain
                     situations, including events impairing the security
                     interest. 
                (j)  Required payments of long-term debt for the years 1995-
                     1998 are $595 million, $349 million, $233 million and
                     $509 million, respectively. 
                (k)  In the event of a change in control of USX, as defined in 
                     the related agreements, debt obligations totaling $3,795
                     million may be declared immediately due and payable. The
                     principal obligations subject to such a provision are
                     Revolving credit/term loan agreements -- $500 million;
                     Senior Notes -- $100 million; Notes payable -- $2,098
                     million; Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures -- $378
                     million; Guaranteed Loan -- $300 million; and 9 3/4%
                     Guaranteed Notes -- $161 million. In such event, USX may
                     also be required to either repurchase the leased Fairfield
                     slab caster for $116 million or provide a letter of credit
                     to secure the remaining obligation. 
                (l)  At December 31, 1993, $82 million of 4 5/8% Sinking Fund 
                     Subordinated Debentures due 1996, which have been
                     extinguished by placing securities into an irrevocable
                     trust, were still outstanding.

                      USX leases a wide variety of facilities and equipment
                 under operating leases, including land and building space,
                 office equipment, production facilities and transportation
                 equipment. Contingent rental includes payments based on
                 facility production and operating expense escalation on
                 building space. Most long-term leases include renewal options
                 and, in certain leases, purchase options. In the event of a
                 change in control of USX, as defined in the agreements, or
                 certain other circumstances, lease obligations totaling $196
                 million may be declared immediately due and payable.

                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, the LIFO
                 method accounted for 87% and 91%, respectively, of total
                 inventory value. Current acquisition costs were estimated to
                 exceed the above inventory values at December 31 by
                 approximately $340 million and $390 million in 1993 and 1992,
                 respectively.
                     Cost of sales was reduced and operating income was
                 increased by $11 million, $24 million and $36 million in 1993,
                 1992 and 1991, respectively, as a result of liquidations of
                 LIFO inventories.
                     The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the extent
                 that the recorded cost of crude oil and refined products
                 inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is
                 decreased to reflect increases in market prices and inventory
                 turnover and increased to reflect decreases in market prices.
                 Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve resulted in
                 charges (credits) to operating income of $241 million, $(62)
                 million and $260 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

                 amended in 1991 to reflect the distribution of Steel Stock and
                 change of USX common stock into Marathon Stock and in 1992 to
                 reflect the issuance of Delhi Stock. Each option or stock
                 appreciation right outstanding on May 6, 1991, was converted
                 into two awards: one for the same number of shares of Marathon
                 Stock and the other for one-fifth of that number of shares of
                 Steel Stock, separately exercisable at prices based on the
                 former exercise price apportioned on the basis of the fair
                 market value of the two stocks on May 7, 1991. No adjustment
                 of previously granted options or stock appreciation rights was
                 made to reflect the authorization or the issuance of Delhi
                 Stock.
                      The 1990 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee of
                 the Board of Directors to grant the following awards to key
                 management employees; no further options will be granted under
                 the predecessor plans.

                   OPTIONS -- the right to purchase shares of Marathon Stock,
                   Steel Stock or Delhi Stock at not less than 100 percent of
                   the fair market value of the stock at date of grant.

                   STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS -- the right to receive cash
                   and/or common stock equal to the excess of the fair market
                   value of a share of common stock, as determined in
                   accordance with the plan, over the fair market value of a
                   share on the date the right was granted for a specified
                   number of shares.

                   RESTRICTED STOCK -- stock for no cash consideration or for
                   such other consideration as determined by the Compensation
                   Committee, subject to provisions for forfeiture and
                   restricting transfer. Restriction may be removed as
                   conditions such as performance, continuous service and other
                   criteria are met.

                        Such employees are generally granted awards of the
                 class of common stock intended to reflect the performance of
                 the group in which they work. Up to .5 percent of the
                 outstanding Marathon Stock and .8 percent of each of the
                 outstanding Steel Stock and Delhi Stock, as determined on
                 December 31 of the preceding year, are available for grants
                 during each calendar year the 1990 Plan is in effect. In
                 addition, awarded shares that do not result in shares being
                 issued are available for subsequent grant in the same year,
                 and any ungranted shares from prior years' annual allocations
                 are available for subsequent grant during the years the 1990
                 Plan is in effect. As of December 31, 1993, 3,984,949 Marathon
                 Stock shares, 1,246,329 Steel Stock shares and 74,307 Delhi
                 Stock shares were available for grants in 1994.

21. DIVIDENDS

                 In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
                 dividends on the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
                 are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
                 of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group or the Delhi
                 Group as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
                 USX common stock or series of preferred stock and repurchases
                 of any class of USX common stock or certain series of
                 Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
                 available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
                 common stock. Subject to this limitation, the Board of
                 Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on the Marathon
                 Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock based on the financial
                 condition and results of operations of the related group,
                 although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do so. In
                 making its dividend decisions with respect to each of the
                 Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock, the Board of
                 Directors considers, among other things, the long-term
                 earnings and cash flow capabilities of the related group as
                 well as the dividend policies of similar publicly traded
                 companies.
                    Dividends on the Steel Stock and Delhi Stock are further
                 limited to the Available Steel Dividend Amount and the
                 Available Delhi Dividend Amount, respectively. At December 31,
                 1993, the Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least $1.849
                 billion, and the Available Delhi Dividend Amount was at least
                 $125 million. The Available Steel Dividend Amount and
                 Available Delhi Dividend Amount, respectively, will be
                 increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect the
                 respective group's separately reported net income, dividends,
                 repurchases or issuances with respect to the related class of
                 common stock and preferred stock attributed to the respective
                 groups and certain other items.
                    The initial dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock
                 were paid September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to
                 that date were attributed to the Marathon Group and the U. S.
                 Steel Group based upon the relationship of the initial
                 dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                 Net income (loss) per share amounts are presented for the
                 Marathon Stock and Steel Stock to reflect the distribution of
                 the Steel Stock and change of USX common stock into Marathon
                 Stock effective at the close of business on May 6, 1991. For
                 purposes of computing net income (loss) per share data for
                 periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of Marathon Stock
                 shares are assumed to be the same as the corresponding numbers
                 of shares of USX common stock, while the numbers of Steel
                 Stock shares are assumed to be one-fifth of the corresponding
                 numbers of shares of USX common stock.
                    The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for
                 the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the
                 USX Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
                 earnings and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel
                 Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                 USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
                 dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
                 available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes
                 of stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts. The
                 financial statements of the Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel
                 Group and the Delhi Group, taken together, include all
                 accounts which comprise the corresponding consolidated
                 financial statements of USX.
                    The USX Board of Directors initially deemed 14,000,000
                 shares of Delhi Stock to represent 100% of the common
                 stockholders' equity value of USX attributable to the Delhi
                 Group. The Delhi Fraction is the percentage interest in the
                 Delhi Group represented by the shares of Delhi Stock that are
                 outstanding at any particular time and, based on 9,282,870
                 outstanding shares at December 31, 1993, is approximately 66%.
                 The Marathon Group financial statements reflect a percentage
                 interest in the Delhi Group of approximately 34% (Retained
                 Interest) at December 31, 1993. Income per share applicable
                 to outstanding Delhi Stock is presented for the periods
                 subsequent to the October 2, 1992, initial issuance of Delhi
                 Stock.
                    Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
                 adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
                 preferred stock and, in the case of Delhi Stock, for the
                 income applicable to the Retained Interest; and is based on
                 the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
                 common stock equivalents, provided they are not antidilutive.
                 Common stock equivalents result from assumed exercise of stock
                 options and surrender of stock appreciation rights associated
                 with stock options where applicable.
                    Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
                 conversion of convertible securities for the applicable
                 periods outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and
                 surrender of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each
                 case, the effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

                 Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
                 transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
                 adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
                 are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
                 For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
                 currency transaction gains (losses) included in determining
                 net income were $(3) million, $14 million and $(3) million. An

24. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

                 USX's Board of Directors has adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan
                 and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each
                 outstanding share of Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi
                 Stock referred to together as "Voting Stock."  Each right
                 becomes exercisable, at a price of $120, when any person or
                 group has acquired, obtained the right to acquire or made a
                 tender or exchange offer for 15 percent or more of the total
                 voting power of the Voting Stock, except pursuant to a
                 qualifying all-cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of
                 Voting Stock, which is accepted with respect to shares of
                 Voting Stock representing a majority of the voting power other
                 than Voting Stock beneficially owned by the offeror. Each
                 right entitles the holder, other than the acquiring person or
                 group, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
                 Junior Preferred Stock or, upon the acquisition by any person
                 of 15 percent or more of the total voting power of the Voting
                 Stock, Marathon Stock, Steel Stock or Delhi Stock (as the case
                 may be) or other property having a market value of twice the
                 exercise price. After the rights become exercisable, if USX is
                 acquired in a merger or other business combination where it is
                 not the survivor, or if 50 percent or more of USX's assets,
                 earnings power or cash flow are sold or transferred, each
                 right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the
                 acquiring entity having a market value of twice the exercise
                 price. The rights and exercise price are subject to
                 adjustment, and the rights expire on October 9, 1999, or may
                 be redeemed by USX for one cent per right at any time prior to
                 the point they become exercisable. Under certain
                 circumstances, the Board of Directors has the option to
                 exchange one share of the respective class of Voting Stock for
                 each exercisable right.

25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

                 USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
                 threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
                 involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
                 relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are
                 discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these
                 contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be
                 material to the consolidated financial statements. However,
                 management believes that USX will remain a viable and
                 competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
                 contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

                 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --
                  B&LE litigation; MDL-587
                     On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
                 petition for Writ of Certiorari by the B&LE in the Lower 
                 Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation (MDL-587). 
                 As a result, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
                 Third Circuit affirming judgments of approximately $498
                 million, plus interest, relating to antitrust violations by 
                 the B&LE was permitted to stand. In addition, the Third Circuit
                 decision remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of
                 their damage awards. At trial these plaintiffs asserted claims
                 of approximately $8 million, but were awarded only nominal
                 damages by the jury. A new trial date has not been set. Any
                 damages awarded in a new trial may be more or less than 
                 $8 million and would be subject to trebling.
                    The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX throughout the
                 period the conduct occurred. It is now a subsidiary of Transtar
                 in which USX has a 45% equity interest. These actions were
                 excluded liabilities in the sale of USX's transportation units
                 in 1988, and USX is obligated to reimburse Transtar for
                 judgments paid by the B&LE.
    
                    Following the Court of Appeals decision, USX, which had
                 previously accrued $90 million on a pretax basis for this
                 litigation, charged an additional amount of $619 million on a
                 pretax basis in the second quarter of 1993. In late 1993, USX
                 and LTV Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the plaintiffs in MDL-587,
                 agreed to settle all of LTV's claims in that action for $375
                 million. USX made a payment of $200 million on December 29,
                 1993, and is obligated to pay an additional $175 million not
                 later than February 28, 1994. Claims of three additional
                 plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993. 

                 These settlements resulted in a pretax credit of $127 million 
                 in the fourth quarter financial results of the U.S. Steel
                 Group. As a result of the denial of the Petition for Writ 
                 of Certiorari, judgments for the other MDL-587 plaintiffs 
                 (other than the two remanded for retrial), totaling 
                 approximately $210 million, including postjudgment interest, 
                 are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994.

25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

                  B&LE litigation; Armco
                     In June 1990, following judgments entered on behalf of
                 steel company plaintiffs in MDL-587, Armco Steel filed federal
                 antitrust claims against the B&LE and other railroads in the
                 Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. B&LE
                 successfully challenged the actions for lack of jurisdiction
                 and venue, and the case was transferred to the Federal
                 District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Other
                 defendant railroads settled with Armco, leaving B&LE as the
                 only remaining defendant. On April7, 1993, B&LE's motion to
                 dismiss the federal antitrust claims on grounds of statute of
                 limitations was granted. Subsequently, Armco refiled its
                 claims under the Ohio Valentine Act. B&LE's motions for
                 summary judgment on time bar issues and for change of venue
                 are pending, and not yet fully briefed. No discovery has been
                 taken on the merits of Armco's claims, but if Armco survives
                 the present and possibly further pretrial motions and the case
                 proceeds to trial on the merits, Armco's claimed damages are
                 likely to be substantial. Unlike MDL-587, it is USX's position
                 that the Armco case was not an excluded liability in the sale
                 of USX's transportation units to Transtar in 1988, and that
                 USX therefore is not obligated to reimburse Transtar for any
                 judgments rendered in the Armco case; however, this position
                 is being disputed by Transtar and The Blackstone Group, the
                 ultimate owner of 52% of Transtar's outstanding shares.

                  Energy Buyers litigation
                     On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for
                 approximately $117 million, plus interest under Ohio law,
                 against USX in Energy Buyers Service Corporation v. USX, a
                 case originally filed in the District Court of Harris County,
                 Texas. Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31, 1992.
                 On December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the
                 case for $95 million and deferrred payments of up to $9
                 million.

                  Pickering litigation
                     On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for
                 the District of Utah Central Division issued a Memorandum
                 Opinion and Order in Pickering v. USX relating to pension and
                 compensation claims by approximately 1,900 employees of USX's
                 former Geneva (Utah) Works. Although the court dismissed a
                 number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had
                 violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by
                 interfering with the accrual of pension benefits of certain
                 employees and amending a benefit plan to reduce the accrual of
                 future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.
                 Further proceedings were held to determine damages and,
                 pending the court's determinations, USX may appeal.
                 Plaintiffs' counsel has been reported as estimating
                 plaintiffs' anticipated recovery to be in excess of $100
                 million. USX believes actual damages will be substantially
                 less than plaintiffs' estimates.

                 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
                     USX is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws
                 and regulations relating to the environment. These laws
                 generally provide for control of pollutants released into the
                 environment and require responsible parties to undertake
                 remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may
                 be imposed for noncompliance. USX provides for remediation
                 costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is
                 probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably
                 determinable. Generally, the timing of these accruals
                 coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the
                 commitment to a formal plan of action. At December 31, 1993,
                 and 1992, accrued liabilities for remediation, platform
                 abandonment and mine reclamation totaled $312 million and $280
                 million, respectively. It is not presently possible to
                 estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that
                 might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
                     For a number of years, USX has made substantial capital
                 expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance with
                 various laws relating to the environment. In 1993 and 1992,
                 such capital expenditures totaled $181 million and $294
                 million, respectively. USX anticipates making additional such
                 expenditures in the future; however, the exact amounts and
                 timing of such expenditures are uncertain because of the
                 continuing evolution of specific regulatory requirements.

                 LIBYAN OPERATIONS --
                     By reason of Executive Orders and related regulations
                 under which the U.S. Government is continuing economic
                 sanctions against Libya, USX was required to discontinue
                 performing its Libyan petroleum contracts on June 30, 1986. In
                 June 1989, the Department of the Treasury authorized USX to
                 resume performing under those contracts.  Pursuant to that
                 authorization, USX has engaged the Libyan National Oil Company
                 and the Secretary of Petroleum in continuing negotiations to
                 determine when and on what basis they are willing to allow USX
                 to resume realizing revenue from USX's investment of $108
                 million in Libya. USX is uncertain when these negotiations can
                 be completed or how the negotiations will be affected by the
                 United Nations sanctions against Libya.

                 GUARANTEES --
                     Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated and
                 other entities totaled $227 million at December31, 1993, and
                 $258 million at December 31, 1992. In the event that any
                 defaults of guaranteed liabilities occur, USX has access to
                 its interest in the assets of most of the affiliates to reduce
                 losses resulting from these guarantees. As of December 31,
                 1993, the largest guarantee for a single affiliate was $96
                 million.

25. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, USX's pro
                 rata share of obligations of LOOP INC. and various pipeline
                 affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency agreements
                 totaled $206 million and $216 million, respectively. Under the
                 agreements, USX is required to advance funds if the affiliates
                 are unable to service debt.  Any such advances are prepayments
                 of future transportation charges.

                 COMMITMENTS --
                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
                 commitments for capital expenditures for property, plant and
                 equipment totaled $389 million and $423 million, respectively.
                     USX has entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
                 which requires USX to accept pulverized coal each month or pay
                 a minimum monthly charge. In 1993, charges for deliveries of
                 pulverized coal which began in 1993 totaled $14 million. In
                 the future, USX will be obligated to make minimum payments of
                 approximately $16 million per year. If USX elects to terminate
                 the contract early, a maximum termination payment of $126
                 million, which declines over the duration of the agreement,
                 may be required.
                     USX is a party to a transportation agreement with Transtar
                 for Great Lakes shipments of raw materials required by steel
                 operations. The agreement cannot be canceled until 1999 and
                 requires USX to pay, at a minimum, Transtar's annual fixed
                 costs related to the agreement, including lease/charter costs,
                 depreciation of owned vessels, dry dock fees and other
                 administrative costs. Total transportation costs under the
                 agreement were $68 million in 1993 and $66 million in 1992,
                 including fixed costs of $21 million in each year. The fixed
                 costs are expected to continue at approximately the same level
                 over the duration of the agreement.

                 (a) The difference between carrying value and fair value
                     principally represented the subordinated note related to
                     the earlier sale of the majority interest in Transtar
                     which was carried at no value due to the highly leveraged
                     nature of the transaction. The note was paid in full in
                     1993 resulting in other income of $70 million and interest
                     income of $37 million (Note 3, page U-11).
           
                       Fair value of financial instruments classified as
                 current assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due
                 to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of
                 long-term receivables and other investments was based on
                 discounted cash flows or other specific instrument analysis.
                 Fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on market
                 prices where available or current borrowing rates available
                 for financings with similar terms and maturities.
                       USX's unrecognized financial instruments consist of
                 receivables sold subject to limited recourse, commitments to
                 extend credit, financial guarantees, and commodity swaps. It
                 is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these forms
                 of financial instrument obligations. For details relating to
                 sales of receivables and commitments to extend credit see Note
                 12, page U-18. For details relating to financial guarantees
                 see Note 25, page U-25. The contract value of open natural gas
                 commodity swaps, as of December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992
                 totaled $92 million and $13 million, respectively. The swap
                 arrangements vary in duration with certain individual
                 contracts extending into early 1996.

27. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

                 On February 2, 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
                 to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
                 reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
                 statements.

                 ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES
                       The following estimates of net reserves have been
                 determined by deducting royalties of various kinds from USX's
                 gross reserves. The reserve estimates are believed to be
                 reasonable and consistent with presently known physical data
                 concerning size and character of the reservoirs and are
                 subject to change as additional knowledge concerning the
                 reservoirs becomes available. The estimates include only such
                 reserves as can reasonably be classified as proved; they do
                 not include reserves which may be found by extension of proved
                 areas or reserves recoverable by secondary or tertiary
                 recovery methods unless these methods are in operation and are
                 showing successful results. Undeveloped reserves consist of
                 reserves to be recovered from future wells on undrilled
                 acreage or from existing wells where relatively major
                 expenditures will be required to realize production. Liquid
                 hydrocarbon production amounts for international operations
                 principally reflect tanker liftings of equity production. USX
                 did not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves subject to
                 long-term supply agreements with foreign governments or
                 authorities in which USX acts as producer.

                 STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS AND 
                 CHANGES THEREIN RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES

                      Estimated discounted future net cash flows and changes
                 therein were determined in accordance with Statement of
                 Financial Accounting Standards No. 69. Certain information
                 concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of
                 proved reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed
                 below. USX believes such information is essential for a proper
                 understanding and assessment of the data presented.
                      Future cash inflows are computed by applying year-end
                 prices of oil and gas relating to USX's proved reserves to the
                 year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes
                 are considered only to the extent provided by contractual
                 arrangements in existence at year-end.
                      The assumptions used to compute the proved reserve
                 valuation do not necessarily reflect USX's expectations of
                 actual revenues to be derived from those reserves nor their
                 present worth. Assigning monetary values to the estimated
                 quantities of reserves, described on the preceding page, does
                 not reduce the subjective and ever-changing nature of such
                 reserve estimates.
                      Additional subjectivity occurs when determining present
                 values because the rate of producing the reserves must be
                 estimated. In addition to uncertainties inherent in predicting
                 the future, variations from the expected production rate also
                 could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of
                 USX's control, such as unintentional delays in development,
                 environmental concerns, changes in prices or regulatory
                 controls.
                      The reserve valuation assumes that all reserves will be
                 disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in
                 place or subjected to participation by foreign governments,
                 additional economic considerations also could affect the
                 amount of cash eventually realized.
                      Future development and production costs are computed by
                 estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
                 producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the
                 year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of
                 existing economic conditions.
                      Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the
                 appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration
                 of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax
                 net cash flows relating to USX's proved oil and gas reserves.
                 Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and
                 allowances are recognized.
                      Discount was derived by using a discount rate of 10
                 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash
                 flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves.

                    U.S. Steel closed South (IL) Works.
                 (b)In June 1993, U. S. Steel sold the Cumberland coal mine. On
                    or about March 31, 1994, U. S. Steel will permanently close
                    the Maple Creek coal mine.
                 (c)U. S. Steel ceased production of structural products when
                    South Works closed in April 1992.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis


             Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction
         with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated
         Financial Statements.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

             SALES were $18.1 billion in 1993, compared with $17.8 billion in
         1992 and $18.8 billion in 1991. The increase in 1993 primarily
         reflected increased sales for the U. S. Steel Group due mainly to
         higher steel shipment volumes and prices, and increased commercial
         shipments of taconite pellets and coke. These were partially offset by
         lower sales for the Marathon Group (excluding the effect of the
         businesses of the Delhi Group which were included in the Marathon
         Group for periods prior to October 2, 1992) due mainly to lower
         worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices and lower average
         refined product prices, partially offset by increased excise taxes
         (which have no effect on income) and higher refined product sales
         volumes, excluding matching buy/sell transactions. The decrease from
         1991 to 1992 primarily reflected reduced sales for the Marathon Group
         due mainly to lower average refined product prices, reduced volumes
         and prices for crude oil matching buy/sell transactions (which have no
         effect on income) and lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes.

             OPERATING INCOME decreased by $14 million in 1993, following a
         $329 million improvement in 1992. Results in 1993 included a $342
         million charge as a result of the adverse decision in the Lower Lake
         Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation against the Bessemer & Lake Erie
         Railroad ("B&LE litigation") (which also resulted in $164 million of
         interest costs) (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
         a $241 million unfavorable noncash effect resulting from an increase
         in the inventory market valuation reserve and restructuring charges of
         $42 million related to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal
         mine and preparation plant. Results in 1992 included a favorable
         impact of $119 million for the settlement of a tax refund claim
         related to prior years' production taxes and a $62 million favorable
         noncash effect resulting from a decrease in the inventory market
         valuation reserve, partially offset by restructuring charges of $125
         million primarily related to the disposition of certain domestic
         exploration and production properties. Excluding the effects of these
         items, operating income increased $667 million in 1993 predominantly
         due to improved results for the U. S. Steel Group, as well as the
         Marathon Group. The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
         Standards No. 112 - Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits
         ("SFAS No. 112") resulted in a $23 million increase in operating costs
         in 1993, principally for the U. S. Steel Group.

             Operating income in 1991 included restructuring charges of $426
         million mainly related to the shutdown of certain steel facilities and
         a $260 million unfavorable noncash effect resulting from an increase
         in the inventory market valuation reserve, partially offset by a
         favorable $20 million adjustment of prior years' production tax
         accruals. Excluding the effects of these items and the 1992 special
         items previously discussed, operating income declined $393 million
         from 1991 to 1992 due mainly to lower results for the Marathon Group.
         Contributing to the decline was a $58 million increase in operating
         costs resulting from the 1992 adoption of Statement of Financial
         Accounting Standards No. 106 - Employers' Accounting for
         Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions ("SFAS No. 106"), $42
         million for the U. S. Steel Group and $16 million for the Marathon
         Group.

             Net pension credits included in operating income totaled $211
         million in 1993, compared with $260 million in 1992 and $224 million
         in 1991. The decrease in 1993 was primarily due to a lower assumed
         long-term rate of return on plan assets. The increase in 1992 from
         1991 primarily reflected recognition of the growth in plan assets. In
         1994, net pension credits are expected to decline by approximately $95
         million primarily due to a further reduction in the assumed long-term
         rate of return on plan assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated
         Financial Statements.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


             OTHER INCOME was $257 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $2
         million in 1992 and income of $39 million in 1991. The increase in
         1993 primarily resulted from higher gains from the disposal of assets,
         including the sale of the Cumberland coal mine, the realization of a
         $70 million deferred gain resulting from the collection of a
         subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar, Inc.
         ("Transtar") (which also resulted in $37 million of interest income)
         and the sale of an investment in an insurance company. The increase in
         1993 also reflected the absence of a $19 million impairment of an
         investment recorded in 1992. The decline in 1992 relative to 1991
         primarily resulted from the nonrecurrence of 1991's favorable minority
         interest effect related to RMI Titanium Company and the $19 million
         impairment of an investment in 1992.

             INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $78 million in 1993,
         compared with $228 million in 1992 and $38 million in 1991. The 1993
         amount included $37 million of interest income resulting from
         collection of the Transtar note. The 1992 amount included $177 million
         of interest income resulting from the settlement of a tax refund claim
         related to prior years' production taxes. Excluding these items,
         interest and other financial income was $41 million in 1993, compared
         with $51 million in 1992 and $38 million in 1991.

             INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $630 million in 1993,
         compared with $485 million in 1992 and $509 million in 1991. The 1993
         amount included $164 million of interest expense related to the
         adverse decision in the B&LE litigation. Excluding this amount, the
         decrease in 1993 primarily reflected an increase in capitalized
         interest. The 1991 amount included a $26 million favorable adjustment
         related to interest accrued for prior years' production taxes.
         Excluding this item, the decrease from 1991 to 1992 was mainly due to
         the favorable effect of declining variable interest rates.

             THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $72 million,
         compared with credits of $29 million in 1992 and $113 million in 1991.
         The 1993 U.S. income tax credit included an incremental deferred tax
         benefit of $64 million resulting from USX Corporation's ("USX")
         ability to elect to credit, rather than deduct, certain foreign income
         taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes when paid in future years.
         The anticipated use of the U.S. foreign tax credit reflects the
         Marathon Group's improving international production profile including
         income which will be generated by the East Brae platform in the United
         Kingdom sector of the North Sea. The 1993 U.S. income tax credit also
         included a $29 million charge associated with an increase in the
         federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%, reflecting remeasurement of
         deferred federal income tax liabilities as of January 1, 1993.

             THE TOTAL LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
         PRINCIPLES was $167 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $160
         million in 1992 and a loss of $578 million in 1991.

             THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
         PRINCIPLES totaled $92 million in 1993 and $1,666 million in 1992. The
         cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 112, determined as of January
         1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by $86 million, net of the income tax
         effect. The cumulative effect of adopting Emerging Issues Task Force
         Consensus No. 93-14 - Accounting for Multiple-Year Retrospectively
         Rated Insurance Contracts, determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased
         1993 income by $6 million, net of the income tax effect. The immediate
         recognition of the transition obligation resulting from the adoption
         of SFAS No. 106, measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 income
         by $1,306 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative effect
         of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 -
         Accounting for Income Taxes, measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased
         1992 net income by $360 million.

             USX RECORDED A NET LOSS of $259 million in 1993, compared with a
         net loss of $1,826 million in 1992 and a net loss of $578 million in
         1991.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

             CURRENT ASSETS increased $80 million from year-end 1992. The
         increase primarily reflected higher cash and cash equivalents and
         deferred income tax benefits, partially offset by a decrease in
         inventories. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $268 million at
         year-end 1993, compared to $57 million at year-end 1992. Cash from
         operations, new debt borrowings, equity issued and asset sales
         exceeded cash applied to capital spending, debt repayment and
         dividends. Deferred income tax benefits increased $171 million,
         resulting primarily from increases in the inventory market valuation
         reserve and accruals related to the B&LE litigation. The decrease in
         inventories primarily reflected a reduction in inventory values due to
         an increase in the inventory market valuation reserve. This reserve
         reflects the extent to which the recorded cost of crude oil and
         refined product inventories exceeds net realizable value. Subsequent
         changes to the inventory market valuation reserve are dependent on
         changes in future crude oil and refined product price levels and
         inventory turnover.

             PREPAID PENSION ASSETS increased $234 million from year-end 1992
         mainly as a result of pension credits which primarily reflected the
         investment performance of defined benefit plan assets.

             CURRENT LIABILITIES were lower at year-end 1993 mainly due to a
         reduction in long-term debt due within one year, partially offset by
         an increase in accounts payable. The increase in accounts payable
         primarily reflected an increase in litigation accruals, partially
         offset by a decrease in trade payables.

             TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31, 1993, was
         $5.9 billion. The $425 million decrease from year-end 1992 mainly
         reflected cash provided from operating activities, issuance of common
         and preferred stock and disposal of assets, partially offset by
         capital expenditures, dividend payments and an increase in cash and
         cash equivalents. Repayments under USX's revolving credit agreements
         and of commercial paper and other debt were partially offset by new
         issuances of debt. At December 31, 1993, USX had outstanding
         borrowings of $500 million against credit agreements, leaving $1,675
         million of available unused committed credit lines. In addition, USX
         had $185 million of available unused short-term lines of credit, which
         generally require maintenance of compensating balances. In the event
         of a change of control of USX, debt and guaranteed obligations
         totaling $5.1 billion at year-end 1993, may be declared immediately
         due and payable or required to be collateralized (see Notes 12, 14 and
         16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

             EMPLOYEE BENEFITS liabilities increased $355 million compared with
         year-end 1992 mainly due to increases in workers' compensation
         liabilities (including the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 112),
         retiree medical liabilities and pension liabilities.

             DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES decreased $130 million in
         1993 mainly as a result of transfers of certain litigation accruals to
         current liabilities and the reclassification of certain amounts to the
         employee benefits liability account in conjunction with the adoption
         of SFAS No. 112.

             STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $3.9 billion at year-end 1993 increased by
         $155 million from the end of 1992 mainly reflecting the issuance of
         additional common and preferred equity, partially offset by the 1993
         net loss and dividend payments.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

             NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES totaled $944 million
         in 1993, compared with $920 million in 1992. The 1993 period was
         negatively affected by payments of $314 million related to partial
         settlement of the B&LE litigation and settlement of the Energy Buyers
         litigation. The 1992 period included $296 million associated with the
         refund of prior years' production taxes. Excluding these items, net
         cash provided from operating activities improved $634 million from
         1992. The increase primarily reflected improved operations for the 
         U. S. Steel Group, improved refined product margins for the Marathon
         Group and a $103 million favorable effect from the use of available
         funds from previously established (now depleted) insurance reserves to
         pay for certain active and retired employee insurance benefits.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


             Excluding the 1992 refund discussed above, net cash provided from
         operating activities in 1992 declined $399 million from 1991 primarily
         due to lower income, partially offset by favorable changes in working
         capital accounts.

             CAPITAL EXPENDITURES were $1,151 million in 1993, compared with
         $1,505 million in 1992 and $1,392 million in 1991. The $354 million
         decrease in 1993 was due primarily to lower expenditures for the
         Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group. The $283 million decline for
         the Marathon Group mainly reflected decreased expenditures for
         environmental projects and for development of the East Brae Field and
         SAGE system in the United Kingdom and other international projects,
         partially offset by increased exploration drilling and development
         projects in the Gulf of Mexico and increased drilling activity for
         onshore domestic natural gas projects. The $100 million decrease for
         the U. S. Steel Group primarily reflected completion of U. S. Steel's
         continuous cast modernization program in 1992.  Contract commitments
         for capital expenditures at year-end 1993 were $389 million, compared
         with $423 million at year-end 1992.

             For the year 1994, capital expenditures are expected to total
         approximately $1.1 billion. The slight anticipated decrease in 1994 is
         expected to result mainly from lower expenditures for the Marathon
         Group, partially offset by higher expenditures for the U. S. Steel
         Group. The Marathon Group's capital expenditures are expected to
         decrease by approximately $100 million in 1994 mainly reflecting lower
         expenditures for development of the East Brae Field and SAGE system.
         The U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures are expected to increase
         by approximately $60 million in 1994 and will include continued
         expenditures for projects begun in 1993 relative to environmental,
         hot-strip mill and pickle line improvements at Gary (IN) Works and
         initial expenditures for a blast furnace reline project at Mon Valley
         (PA) Works which is planned for completion in 1995.

             CASH FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS was $469 million in 1993,
         compared with $117 million in 1992 and $78 million in 1991. The 1993
         amount primarily reflected the realization of proceeds from a
         subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar, the sale of
         the Cumberland coal mine, the sale/leaseback of interests in two LNG
         tankers, and the sales of various domestic oil and gas production
         properties and of an investment in an insurance company. No
         individually significant sales transactions occurred in 1992 or 1991.

              FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS decreased by $458 million in 1993,
         compared with a decrease of $240 million in 1992 and an increase of
         $662 million in 1991. These amounts represent net cash flows on
         commercial paper and the revolving credit agreements and lines of
         credit, other debt and production financing and other agreements.
         During 1993, USX issued an aggregate principal amount of $800 million
         of fixed rate debt through its medium-term note program and three
         separate series of unsecured, noncallable debt securities in the
         public market. Maturities ranged from 5 to 30 years and interest rates
         ranged from 6-3/8% to 8-1/2% per annum. In addition, an aggregate
         principal amount of $77 million of Marathon Oil Company's ("Marathon")
         9-1/2% Guaranteed Notes Due 1994 was tendered in exchange for its
         Monthly Interest Guaranteed Notes Due 2002, 9-3/4% to March 1, 1994
         and 7% thereafter ("7% Notes"). During 1992, USX issued an aggregate 
         principal amount of $748 million of fixed rate debt through its
         medium-term note program and three separate series of unsecured,
         noncallable debt securities in the public market. Maturities ranged
         from 5 to 30 years and interest rates ranged from 6.65% to 9.375% per
         annum. During 1991, debt borrowings included the issuance of three
         separate series of unsecured, noncallable debt securities in the
         public market in the aggregate principal amount of $550 million and a
         $300 million loan to Marathon Oil U. K., Ltd. from the European
         Investment Bank.

             PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED totaled $336 million in 1993. This
         amount reflected the sale of 6,900,000 shares of 6.50% Cumulative
         Convertible Preferred Stock ($50.00 liquidation preference per share)
         ("6.50% Convertible Preferred") to the public for net proceeds of $336
         million. The 6.50% Convertible Preferred is convertible at any time
         into shares of USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock ("Steel Stock") at a
         conversion price of $46.125 per share of Steel Stock.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


             COMMON STOCK ISSUED, net of repurchases, totaled $371 million in
         1993, compared with $942 million in 1992 and $70 million in 1991.  The
         1993 amount mainly reflected the sale of 10,000,000 shares of Steel
         Stock to the public for net proceeds of $350 million. The increase in
         1992 primarily reflected sales to the public of all three classes of
         common stock. In 1992, USX sold 25,000,000 shares of USX-Marathon
         Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock") for net proceeds of $541
         million, 8,050,000 shares of Steel Stock for net proceeds of $198
         million and 9,000,000 shares of USX-Delhi Group Common Stock for net
         proceeds of $136 million.

             DIVIDEND PAYMENTS decreased in 1993 primarily due to a decrease in
         the dividend rate on Marathon Stock in the fourth quarter of 1992,
         partially offset by increased dividends due primarily to the sale in
         1993 of additional shares of Steel Stock and of the 6.50% Convertible
         Preferred. The increase in 1992 from 1991 primarily resulted from
         higher dividends due to the sale of additional shares of all three
         classes of common stock in 1992, partially offset by the fourth
         quarter decrease in the dividend rate on Marathon Stock.

             In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P") lowered its
         ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt to below investment grade
         (from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock and
         commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial leverage,
         burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation contingencies.
         In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services, Inc. ("Moody's")
         confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and Marathon's
         senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings on USX's subordinated
         debt and commercial paper, but lowered its ratings on USX's preferred
         stock from ba1 to ba2. Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on
         USX debt securities reflected confidence in the expected performance
         of USX during the intermediate term, while the downward revision of
         the preferred stock ratings incorporated a narrow fixed charge
         coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and the downgrade of
         ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could increase USX's cost of
         capital.

             In December 1993, USX filed a universal shelf registration
         statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission which became
         effective on January 6, 1994 and allows USX to offer and issue up to
         $850 million of debt and equity securities. The equity securities
         include preferred stock as well as each class of USX's common stock.
         In February 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock to the
         public for net proceeds of $201 million and issued $300 million in
         aggregate principal amount of 7.2% Notes Due 2004 under the shelf
         registration.

             In February 1994, USX issued $150 million in aggregate principal
         amount of LIBOR-based Floating Rate Notes Due 1996 through its
         medium-term note program under a shelf registration statement which
         became effective on April 26, 1993. In February 1994, an additional
         aggregate principal amount of $57 million of Marathon's 9-1/2%
         Guaranteed Notes Due 1994 was tendered in exchange for its 7% Notes.
         In March 1994, USX Capital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of USX, 
         sold $250 million of 8-3/4% Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred 
         Shares ("MIPS").

             As a result of the settlement of LTV Steel Corp.'s ("LTV") portion
         of the B&LE litigation, USX is obligated to pay an additional $175
         million to LTV in the first quarter of 1994. In addition,
         approximately $210 million in judgments for other plaintiffs in the
         B&LE litigation are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994. See
         Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

             USX anticipates that it will begin funding the U. S. Steel Group's
         pension plan by approximately $100 million per year commencing with
         the 1994 plan year. The funding for both the 1994 and 1995 plan years
         will impact cash flows in 1995.

             USX believes that its short-term and long-term liquidity is
         adequate to satisfy its obligations (including those related to the
         B&LE litigation) as of December 31, 1993, and to complete currently
         authorized capital spending programs. USX actively used its access to
         capital markets during 1993 to meet its business needs beyond
         internally generated funds. Future requirements for its business
         needs, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt maturities
         for the years 1994 to 1996 and amounts which may ultimately be paid in
         connection with contingencies are expected to be financed by a
         combination of internally generated funds, proceeds from the sale of
         stock (including the Steel Stock sold in February 1994 and the MIPS
         sold in March 1994), proceeds from debt issued in February 1994, 
         future borrowings and other external financing sources. Long-term 
         debt of $734 million matures within one year, including $699 million 
         classified as long-term debt at December 31, 1993. The $699 million 
         represents the Marathon 9-1/2 % Guaranteed Notes Due March 1, 1994. 
         See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

             USX has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital,
         operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
         environmental laws and regulations. In recent years, these
         expenditures have increased primarily due to required product
         reformulation and process changes in order to meet Clean Air Act
         obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have also been
         significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are
         not ultimately reflected in the prices of USX's products and services,
         operating results will be adversely affected. USX believes that
         domestic competitors of the U. S. Steel Group and substantially all
         the competitors of the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group are subject
         to similar environmental laws and regulations.  However, the specific
         impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors,
         including the age and location of their operating facilities, their
         production processes and the specific products and services they
         provide.

             USX's environmental expenditures for 1993 and 1992 are discussed
         below and have been estimated for the Marathon Group and the Delhi
         Group based on American Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines
         and for the U. S. Steel Group based on U.S. Department of Commerce
         ("USDC") survey guidelines. These guidelines are subject to differing
         interpretations which could affect the comparability of such data.
         Some environmental related expenditures, while benefitting the
         environment, also enhance operating efficiencies.

             The Marathon Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993 were
         $253 million compared with $370 million in 1992. These amounts
         consisted of capital expenditures of $123 million in 1993 and $240
         million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
         operating and maintenance) of $130 million in both 1993 and 1992.
         Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
         guidelines and represented 1% of the Marathon Group's total operating
         costs in both 1993 and 1992. The decline in environmental capital
         expenditures from 1992 to 1993 primarily reflected lower expenditures
         for the Marathon Group's multi-year capital projects for diesel fuel
         desulfurization. By the end of 1993, these projects were substantially
         completed.

             The U. S. Steel Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993
         were $240 million compared with $220 million in 1992. These amounts
         consisted of capital expenditures of $53 million in 1993 and $52
         million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
         operating and maintenance) of $187 million in 1993 and $168 million in
         1992. Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on USDC
         survey guidelines and represented 3% of the U. S. Steel Group's total
         operating costs in both 1993 and 1992.

             The Delhi Group's total environmental expenditures in 1993 were
         $10 million compared with $8 million in 1992. These amounts consisted
         of capital expenditures of $5 million in 1993 and $3 million in 1992
         and estimated compliance expenditures (including operating and
         maintenance) of $5 million in both 1993 and 1992. Compliance
         expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey guidelines and
         represented 1% of the Delhi Group's total operating costs in both 1993
         and 1992.

             USX's environmental capital expenditures totaled $181 million
         in 1993, $294 million in 1992 and $175 million in 1991. Such
         expenditures accounted for 16%, 20% and 13% of total consolidated
         capital expenditures in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The
         increase from 1991 to 1992 and the decline in 1993 was primarily the
         result of the Marathon Group's multi-year capital spending program for
         diesel fuel desulfurization which was substantially completed in 1993.
         USX expects environmental capital expenditures to approximate $150
         million in 1994 or approximately 13% of total estimated consolidated
         capital expenditures. Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based
         estimates which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the
         ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible
         imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new
         technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently identified
         projects, USX anticipates that environmental capital expenditures in
         1995 will total approximately $90 million; however, actual
         expenditures may increase as additional projects are  identified or
         additional requirements are imposed.

             USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party
         ("PRP") at 55 waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
         Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31,
         1993. In addition, there are 50 sites where USX has received
         information requests or other indications that USX may be a PRP under
         CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
         confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
         amount thereof. There are also 62 additional sites, excluding retail
         gasoline stations, where state governmental agencies or private
         parties are seeking remediation under state environmental laws through
         discussions or litigation. At many of these sites, USX is one of a
         number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well
         as USX's share thereof, is frequently dependent upon the outcome of
         investigations and remedial studies.

             Total environmental expenditures for the Marathon Group included
         remediation related expenditures estimated at $38 million in 1993 and
         $35 million in 1992. Remediation spending was primarily related to
         retail gasoline stations which incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil
         and groundwater contamination associated with underground storage
         tanks and piping. Total environmental expenditures for the U. S.
         Steel Group included remediation related expenditures estimated at $19
         million in 1993 and $11 million in 1992. Remediation spending was
         mainly related to dismantlement and restoration activities at former
         and present operating locations. Remediation related expenditures for
         the Delhi Group were not material. USX accrues for environmental
         remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is
         probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably
         determinable. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward
         ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise,
         charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. See
         Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

             New or expanded requirements for environmental regulations, which
         could increase USX's environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX
         intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the
         environment, but since many of them are not fixed or presently
         determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by
         future legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict the
         ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs which may be
         incurred and penalties which may be imposed. However, based on
         presently available information, and existing laws and regulations as
         currently  implemented, USX does not anticipate that environmental
         compliance expenditures will materially increase in 1994. As discussed
         above, environmental capital expenditures are currently expected to
         decrease in 1994 and again in 1995.

             USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
         threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a
         variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
         environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 25 to the
         Consolidated Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution of these
         contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
         the consolidated financial statements. However, management believes
         that USX will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though
         it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

             Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 - Accounting
         by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS No. 114") requires
         impairment of loans based on either the sum of discounted cash flows
         or the fair value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS
         No. 114 in the first quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary estimates,
         USX expects that the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS No. 114 will
         be less than $2 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS BY INDUSTRY SEGMENT

         THE MARATHON GROUP

             The Marathon Group includes Marathon, a wholly owned subsidiary of
         USX, which is engaged in worldwide exploration, production,
         transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas; and
         domestic refining, marketing and transportation of petroleum products.
         The Marathon Group financial data for the periods prior to the
         creation of the Delhi Group on October 2, 1992, include the combined
         historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows
         for the businesses of the Delhi Group.

             Sales of $12.0 billion in 1993 declined $820 million from 1992
         mainly due to lower worldwide  liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices,
         lower average refined product prices and the absence of sales from the
         Delhi Group. These decreases were partially offset by increased excise
         taxes and higher refined product sales volumes, excluding matching
         buy/sell transactions. Sales of $12.8 billion in 1992 declined $1.2
         billion from 1991 primarily due to lower average refined product
         prices, reduced volumes and prices for crude oil matching buy/sell
         transactions and lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes. Matching
         buy/sell transactions and excise taxes are included in both sales and
         operating costs, resulting in no effect on operating income.

             The Marathon Group reported operating income of $169 million in
         1993, compared with $304 million in 1992 and $358 million in 1991.
         Results included a $241 million unfavorable effect in 1993, a $62
         million favorable effect in 1992 and a $260 million unfavorable effect
         in 1991 resulting from noncash adjustments to the inventory market
         valuation reserve. The 1992 results also included a favorable impact
         of $119 million for the settlement of a tax refund claim related to 
         prior years' production taxes, compared with a favorable $20 million
         adjustment of prior years' production tax accruals in 1991. Also, the
         1992 results included a restructuring charge of $115 million related to
         the disposition of certain domestic exploration and production
         properties, compared with a 1991 restructuring charge of $24 million.
         Excluding the effects of these items, operating income was $410
         million in 1993, $238 million in 1992 and $622 million in 1991. The
         increase in 1993 primarily reflected increased average refined product
         margins and increased domestic natural gas prices, partially offset by
         lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes. The decrease in
         1992 predominantly reflected lower average refined product margins, as
         well as reduced worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes and
         lower international natural gas prices.

             The outlook regarding prices and costs for the Marathon Group's
         principal products is largely dependent upon world market developments
         for crude oil and refined products. Market conditions in the petroleum
         industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political 
         events.

         THE U. S. STEEL GROUP

             The U. S. Steel Group includes U. S. Steel, which is primarily
         engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of steel mill
         products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel Group also
         includes the management of mineral resources, domestic coal mining,
         engineering and consulting services and technology licensing (together
         with U. S. Steel, the "Steel and Related Businesses"). Other
         businesses that are part of the U. S. Steel Group include real estate
         development and management, fencing products, leasing and financing
         activities and a majority interest in a titanium metal products
         company.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


             Sales increased from $4.9 billion in 1992 to $5.6 billion in 1993.
         The increase primarily reflected higher steel shipment volumes and
         prices, and increased commercial shipments of taconite pellets and
         coke. The $55 million increase in sales from 1991 to 1992 primarily
         reflected significantly higher commercial shipments of coke,
         improvements in steel shipment volumes from ongoing operations and an
         improved shipment mix, partially offset by the absence of sales of
         structural products due to the closure of South (IL) Works early in
         1992.

             The U. S. Steel Group reported an operating loss of $149 million
         in 1993, compared with an operating loss of $241 million in 1992 and
         an operating loss of $617 million in 1991. The 1993 operating loss
         included a $342 million charge as a result of the adverse decision in
         the B&LE litigation and restructuring charges of $42 million related
         to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and preparation
         plant. The 1992 operating loss included a charge of $10 million for
         completion of the portion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to
         steel facilities. The 1991 loss included $402 million of restructuring
         charges primarily related to the shutdown of certain steel facilities.
         Excluding the effects of these items, operating income was $235
         million in 1993, compared with operating losses of $231 million in
         1992 and $215 million in 1991. The $466 million improvement in 1993
         was mainly due to higher steel shipment volumes and prices, improved
         operating efficiencies and lower accruals for environmental and legal
         contingencies. In addition, 1993 results benefitted from a $39 million
         favorable effect from the utilization of funds from previously
         established insurance reserves to pay for certain employee insurance
         benefits, lower provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and the
         absence of a 1992 unfavorable effect of $28 million resulting from
         market valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These
         were partially offset by higher hourly steel labor costs, unfavorable
         effects associated with pension and other employee benefits, lower
         results from coal operations and a $21 million increase in operating
         costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112. The slight decrease
         from 1991 to 1992 was primarily due to higher charges for legal
         contingencies, increased costs of $42 million related to the adoption
         of SFAS No. 106, higher depreciation charges, increased provisions for
         loan losses by USX Credit and a $28 million unfavorable effect
         resulting from market valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate
         assets. These factors were partially offset by the favorable effects
         of savings from cost reduction programs, higher utilization of raw 
         steel and raw material production capability and the absence of costs
         incurred in 1991 related to the lack of an early labor agreement with
         the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA").

             Based on strong recent order levels and assuming a continuing
         recovery of the U.S. economy, the U. S. Steel Group
         anticipates that steel demand will remain strong in 1994. The U. S.
         Steel Group believes that domestic industry shipments will reach 89 to
         90 million tons in 1994 as compared to approximately 88 million tons
         in 1993. Price increases on sheet products have been announced
         effective January 2 and July 3, 1994. Price increases on certain other
         products have also been announced. Although early indications suggest
         that the January price increase is holding, full realization of the
         price increases will be dependent upon steel demand and the level of
         imports. Steel imports to the United States have increased in recent
         months. Steel imports to the United States accounted for an estimated
         19% of the domestic steel market in 1993, and for an estimated 22% 
         in the fourth quarter.

             U. S. Steel entered into a new five and one-half year contract
         with the USWA, effective February 1, 1994, covering approximately
         15,000 employees. The agreement will result in higher labor and
         benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group each year throughout the term
         of the agreement. The agreement includes a signing bonus of $1,000 per
         USWA represented employee that will be paid in the first quarter of
         1994, $500 of which represents the final bonus payable under the
         previous agreement. The agreement also provides for the establishment
         of a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust to prefund
         health care and life insurance benefits for retirees covered under the
         agreement. Minimum contributions, in the form of USX stock
         or cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and $10 million per
         year thereafter. The funding of the trust will have no direct effect
         on income of the U. S. Steel Group.  Management believes that this
         agreement is competitive with labor agreements reached by U. S.
         Steel's major domestic integrated competitors and thus does not
         believe that U. S. Steel's competitive position with regard to such
         other competitors will be materially affected by its ratification.

         Management's Discussion and Analysis  CONTINUED


             Severe cold and extreme winter weather conditions disrupted steel
         and raw materials operations and caused forced utility curtailments at
         Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and Fairless (PA) Works in January 1994.
         These events will have some negative effects on operations in the
         first quarter of 1994.

             Net pension credits for the U. S. Steel Group in 1994 are expected
         to decline by approximately $85 million primarily due to a lower
         assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.

         THE DELHI GROUP

             The Delhi Group includes Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation, a wholly
         owned subsidiary of USX, and certain  related companies which are
         engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting and
         marketing of natural gas.

             Sales of $535 million in 1993 increased $77 million from 1992,
         mainly due to increased revenues from premium services and higher
         average natural gas sales prices. Sales of $458 million in 1992
         increased $35 million from 1991 primarily due to higher average
         natural gas sales prices, increased systems throughput volumes and
         increased gas processing revenues.

             Operating income was $36 million in 1993, compared with $33
         million in 1992 and $31 million in 1991. Operating income in 1993
         included favorable effects of $2 million for the reversal of a
         prior-period accrual related to a natural gas contract settlement, $1
         million related to gas imbalance settlements and a net $1 million for
         a refund of prior years' taxes other than income taxes. Operating
         income in 1992 included favorable effects totaling $2 million relating
         to the settlement of various lawsuits and third-party disputes.
         Excluding the effects of these items, 1993 operating income improved
         by $1 million, primarily as a result of higher gas sales margins and
         lower operating and other expenses, partially offset by a 34% decline
         in gas processing margins from the sale of natural gas liquids
         ("NGLs"). Operating income in 1991 included $8 million for favorable
         settlements of certain contractual issues. Excluding the effects of
         the settlements in 1992 and 1991, the $8 million improvement in 1992
         operating income was primarily due to increased NGLs volumes from gas
         processing, higher natural gas systems throughput volumes and lower
         operating and other expenses. These favorable items were partially
         offset by lower unit margins for NGLs, reflecting lower NGLs prices
         and higher feedstock costs.

                          Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information


                          Although the financial statements of the Marathon
                          Group, the U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group
                          separately report the assets, liabilities (including
                          contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity of
                          USX attributed to each such group, such attribution
                          does not affect legal title to such assets and
                          responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of
                          USX-Marathon Group Common Stock, USX-U.S. Steel
                          Group Common Stock and USX-Delhi Group Common Stock
                          are holders of common stock of USX and continue to be
                          subject to all the risks associated with an
                          investment in USX and all of its businesses and
                          liabilities.  Financial impacts arising from any of
                          the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group or the
                          Delhi Group which affect the overall cost of USX's

                          Management's Report

                          The accompanying financial statements of the Marathon
                          Group are the responsibility of and have been
                          prepared by USX Corporation (USX) in conformity with
                          generally accepted accounting principles. They
                          necessarily include some amounts that are based on
                          best judgments and estimates. The Marathon Group
                          financial information displayed in other sections of
                          this report is consistent with that in these
                          financial statements.
                               USX seeks to assure the objectivity and
                          integrity of its financial records by careful
                          selection of its managers, by organizational
                          arrangements that provide an appropriate division of
                          responsibility and by communications programs aimed
                          at assuring that its policies and methods are
                          understood throughout the organization.
                               USX has a comprehensive formalized system of
                          internal accounting controls designed to provide
                          reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
                          that financial records are reliable. Appropriate
                          management monitors the system for compliance, and
                          the internal auditors independently measure its
                          effectiveness and recommend possible improvements
                          thereto. In addition, as part of their audit of the
                          financial statements, USX's independent accountants,
                          who are elected by the stockholders, review and test
                          the internal accounting controls selectively to
                          establish a basis of reliance thereon in determining
                          the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be
                          applied.
                               The Board of Directors pursues its oversight
                          role in the area of financial reporting and internal
                          accounting control through its Audit Committee. This
                          Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement
                          directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately)
                          with the independent accountants, management and
                          internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by
                          each of its responsibilities relative to internal
                          accounting controls and the consolidated and group
                          financial statements.

                          Report of Independent Accountants

                          To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

                          In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
                          appearing on pages M-4 through M-20 and as listed in
                          Item 14.A.2 on page 61 of this report present fairly,
                          in all material respects, the financial position of
                          the Marathon Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
                          the results of its operations and its cash flows for
                          each of the three years in the period ended December
                          31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
                          accounting principles. These financial statements are
                          the responsibility of USX's management; our
                          responsibility is to express an opinion on these
                          financial statements based on our audits. We
                          conducted our audits of these statements in
                          accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
                          which require that we plan and perform the audit to
                          obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
                          financial statements are free of material
                          misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
                          basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
                          disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
                          the accounting principles used and significant
                          estimates made by management, and evaluating the
                          overall financial statement presentation. We believe
                          that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
                          opinion expressed above.
                               As discussed in Note 2, page M-7, in 1993 USX
                          adopted new accounting standards for postemployment
                          benefits and for retrospectively rated insurance
                          contracts. As discussed in Note 10, page M-13, and
                          Note 11, page M-14, in 1992 USX adopted new
                          accounting standards for postretirement benefits
                          other than pensions and for income taxes,
                          respectively.
                               The Marathon Group is a business unit of USX
                          Corporation (as described in Note 1, page M-7);
                          accordingly, the financial statements of the Marathon
                          Group should be read in connection with the
                          consolidated financial statements of USX Corporation
                          and Subsidiary Companies.

                    Notes to Financial Statements

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

                    USX Corporation (USX) has three classes of common stock:
                    USX -- Marathon Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock), USX
                    U. S. Steel Group Common Stock (Steel Stock) and USX --
                    Delhi Group Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which are intended
                    to reflect the performance of the Marathon Group, the U.S.
                    Steel Group and the Delhi Group, respectively.
                         The financial statements of the Marathon Group include
                    the financial position, results of operations and cash
                    flows for the businesses of Marathon Oil Company and
                    certain other subsidiaries of USX, and a portion of the
                    corporate assets and liabilities and related transactions
                    which are not separately identified with ongoing operating
                    units of USX. The Marathon Group is involved in worldwide
                    exploration, production, transportation and marketing of
                    crude oil and natural gas; and domestic refining, marketing
                    and transportation of petroleum products. The Marathon
                    Group financial statements are prepared using the amounts
                    included in the USX consolidated financial statements.
                         The Delhi Group was established October 2, 1992; the
                    Marathon Group financial data for the periods presented
                    prior to this date included the combined historical
                    financial position, results of operations and cash flows
                    for the businesses of the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2,
                    1992, the financial statements of the Marathon Group do not
                    include the financial position, results of operations and
                    cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group except for
                    the financial effects of the Retained Interest (Note 3,
                    page M-9).
                         Although the financial statements of the Marathon
                    Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group separately
                    report the assets, liabilities (including contingent
                    liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed to
                    each such group, such attribution does not affect legal
                    title to such assets and responsibility for such
                    liabilities. Holders of Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and
                    Delhi Stock are holders of common stock of USX and continue
                    to be subject to all the risks associated with an
                    investment in USX and all of its businesses and
                    liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the
                    Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group
                    which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect
                    the results of operations and financial condition of all
                    groups. In addition, net losses of any group, as well as
                    dividends or distributions on any class of USX common stock
                    or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of any class
                    of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred Stock,
                    will reduce the funds of USX legally available for payment
                    of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
                    Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information
                    should be read in connection with the Marathon Group
                    financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                    PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- These financial
                    statements include the accounts of the businesses
                    comprising the Marathon Group. The Marathon Group, the 
                    U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial statements,
                    taken together, comprise all of the accounts included in
                    the USX consolidated financial statements.
                         Investments in unincorporated oil and gas joint
                    ventures are accounted for on a pro rata basis.
                         Investments in other entities in which the Marathon
                    Group has significant influence in management and
                    control are accounted for using the equity method of
                    accounting and are carried in the investment account at the
                    Marathon Group's share of net assets plus advances. The
                    proportionate share of income from equity investments is
                    included in other income.
                         The proportionate share of income represented by the
                    Retained Interest in the Delhi Group is included in other
                    income.
                         Investments in marketable equity securities are
                    carried at lower of cost or market and investments in other
                    companies are carried at cost, with income recognized when
                    dividends are received.

                    NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- The following accounting
                    standards were adopted by USX during 1993:
                         Postemployment benefits -- Effective January 1, 1993,
                         USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                         Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
                         Postemployment Benefits" (SFAS No. 112). SFAS No. 112
                         requires employers to recognize the obligation to
                         provide postemployment benefits on an accrual basis if
                         certain conditions are met. The Marathon Group is
                         affected





                                      M-7

                         primarily by disability-related claims covering
                         indemnity and medical payments. The obligation for
                         these claims is measured using actuarial techniques
                         and assumptions including an appropriate discount
                         rate. The cumulative effect of the change in
                         accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993,
                         reduced net income $17 million, net of $10 million
                         income tax effect. The effect of the change in
                         accounting principle reduced 1993 operating income by
                         $2 million.

                         Accounting for multiple-year retrospectively rated
                         insurance contracts -- USX adopted Emerging Issues Task
                         Force (EITF) Consensus No. 93-14, "Accounting for
                         Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Insurance
                         Contracts".  EITF No. 93-14 requires accrual of
                         retrospective premium adjustments when the insured has
                         an obligation to pay cash to the insurer that would
                         not have been required absent experience under the
                         contract. The cumulative effect of the change in
                         accounting principle determined as of January 1, 1993,
                         reduced net income $6 million, net of $3 million
                         income tax effect.

                    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents
                    includes cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt
                    instruments with maturities generally of three months or
                    less.

                    INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
                    market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under
                    the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

                    HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- The Marathon Group enters into
                    commodity swaps, futures contracts and options to hedge
                    exposure to price fluctuations relevant to the purchase or
                    sale of crude oil, refined products and natural gas.  Such
                    transactions are accounted for as part of the commodity
                    being hedged. Forward contracts are used to hedge currency
                    risks, and the accounting is based on the requirements of
                    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.

                    EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- The Marathon Group follows
                    the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
                    exploration and development.

                    GAS BALANCING -- The Marathon Group follows the sales method
                    of accounting for gas production imbalances.

                    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation and depletion
                    of oil and gas producing properties are computed using
                    predetermined rates based upon estimated proved oil and gas
                    reserves applied on a units-of-production method. Other
                    items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated
                    principally by the straight-line method.
                         When an entire property, major facility or facilities
                    depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
                    disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income.
                    Proceeds from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a
                    group basis are credited to the depreciation reserve with
                    no immediate effect on income.

                    INSURANCE -- The Marathon Group is insured for catastrophic
                    casualty and certain property exposures, as well as those
                    risks required to be insured by law or contract. Costs
                    resulting from noninsured losses are charged against income
                    upon occurrence.

                    RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior
                    years' data have been made to conform to 1993
                    classifications.

3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

                    FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX manages
                    most financial activities on a centralized, consolidated
                    basis. Such financial activities include the investment of
                    surplus cash; the issuance, repayment and repurchase of
                    short-term and long-term debt; the issuance, repurchase and
                    redemption of preferred stock; and the issuance and
                    repurchase of common stock. Transactions related primarily
                    to invested cash, short-term and long-term debt (including
                    convertible debt), related net interest and other financial
                    costs, and preferred stock and related dividends are
                    attributed to the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group and
                    the Delhi Group based upon the cash flows of each group for
                    the periods presented and the initial capital structure of
                    each group. Most financing transactions are attributed to
                    and reflected in the financial statements of all three
                    groups. See Note 5, page M-10, for the Marathon Group's
                    portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
                    three groups. However, certain transactions such as leases,
                    production payment financings, financial activities of
                    consolidated entities which are less than wholly owned by
                    USX and transactions related to securities convertible
                    solely into any one class of common stock are or will be
                    specifically attributed to and reflected in their entirety
                    in the financial statements of the group to which they
                    relate.

                    CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate
                    general and administrative costs are allocated to the
                    Marathon Group, the U. S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group
                    based upon utilization or other methods management believes
                    to be reasonable and which consider certain measures of





                                      M-8
<PAGE>   113
                    business activities, such as employment, investments and
                    sales. The costs allocated to the Marathon Group were $28
                    million, $30 million and $45 million in 1993, 1992 and
                    1991, respectively, and primarily consist of employment
                    costs including pension effects, professional services,
                    facilities and other related costs associated with
                    corporate activities.

                    COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- All financial statement impacts
                    of purchases and issuances of Marathon Stock after the
                    change of USX common stock into Marathon Stock and the
                    distribution of Steel Stock on May 6, 1991, are reflected
                    in their entirety in the Marathon Group financial
                    statements. Financial statement impacts of treasury stock
                    transactions occurring before May 7, 1991, have been
                    attributed to the two groups in relationship to their
                    respective common equity. The initial dividend on the
                    Marathon Stock was paid on September 10, 1991.  Dividends
                    paid by USX prior to September 10, 1991, were attributed to
                    the Marathon Group and the U.S. Steel Group based upon the
                    relationship of the initial dividends on the Marathon Stock
                    and Steel Stock.
                         The USX Certificate of Incorporation was amended on
                    September 30, 1992, to authorize a new class of common
                    stock, Delhi Stock, which is intended to reflect the
                    performance of the Delhi Group. On October 2, 1992, USX
                    sold 9,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to the public. The
                    businesses of the Delhi Group were previously included in
                    the Marathon Group. The USX Board of Directors deemed
                    14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock to represent 100% of the
                    common stockholders' equity value of USX attributable to
                    the Delhi Group. The Delhi Fraction is the percentage
                    interest in the Delhi Group represented by the shares of
                    Delhi Stock that are outstanding at any particular time
                    and, based on 9,282,870 outstanding shares at December 31,
                    1993, is approximately 66%. The Marathon Group financial
                    statements reflect a percentage interest in the Delhi Group
                    of approximately 34% (Retained Interest) at December 31,
                    1993. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial position,
                    results of operations and cash flows of the Delhi Group
                    were reflected in the financial statements of the Marathon
                    Group only to the extent of the Retained Interest. The
                    shares deemed to represent the Retained Interest are not
                    outstanding shares of Delhi Stock and cannot be voted by
                    the Marathon Group. As additional shares of Delhi Stock
                    deemed to represent the Retained Interest are sold, the
                    Retained Interest will decrease. When a dividend or other
                    distribution is paid or distributed in respect to the
                    outstanding Delhi Stock, or any amount paid to repurchase
                    shares of Delhi Stock generally, the Marathon Group 
                    financial statements are credited, and the Delhi Group 
                    financial statements are charged, with the aggregate 
                    transaction amount times the quotient of the
                    Retained Interest divided by the Delhi Fraction.

                    INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group are
                    included in the consolidated United States federal income
                    tax return filed by USX. Accordingly, the provision for
                    federal income taxes and the related payments or refunds of
                    tax are determined on a consolidated basis. The
                    consolidated provision and the related tax payments or
                    refunds have been reflected in the Marathon Group, the
                    U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group financial statements
                    in accordance with USX's tax allocation policy. In general,
                    such policy provides that the consolidated tax provision
                    and related tax payments or refunds are allocated among the
                    Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group and the Delhi Group,
                    for group financial statement purposes, based principally
                    upon the financial income, taxable income, credits,
                    preferences and other amounts directly related to the
                    respective groups.
                         For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax
                    benefits resulting from attributes (principally net
                    operating losses), which cannot be utilized by one of the
                    three groups on a separate return basis but which can be
                    utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or in a
                    carryback year, are allocated to the group that generated
                    the attributes. However, if such tax benefits cannot be
                    utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or in a
                    carryback year, the prior years' allocation of such
                    consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a subsequent year
                    to the extent necessary to allocate the tax benefits to the
                    group that would have realized the tax benefits on a
                    separate return basis.
                         The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or
                    refundable are not necessarily comparable to those that
                    would have resulted if the groups had filed separate tax
                    returns; however, such allocation should not result in any
                    of the three groups paying more income taxes over time than
                    it would if it filed separate tax returns and, in certain
                    situations, could result in any of the three groups paying
                    less.

9. PENSIONS
                The Marathon Group has noncontributory defined benefit plans
                covering substantially all employees. Benefits under these
                plans are based primarily upon years of service and the highest
                three years earnings during the last ten years before
                retirement. Certain subsidiaries provide benefits for employees
                covered by other plans based primarily upon employees' service
                and career earnings. The funding policy for all plans provides
                that payments to the pension trusts shall be equal to the
                minimum funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional
                amounts as may be approved from time to time.

                PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
                plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
                return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
                1991.

10. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

                The Marathon Group has defined benefit retiree health and life
                insurance plans covering most employees upon their retirement.
                Health benefits are provided, for the most part, through
                comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical benefit
                provisions subject to various cost sharing features. Life
                insurance benefits are provided to nonunion and most union
                represented retiree beneficiaries primarily based on employees'
                annual base salary at retirement. Benefits have not been
                prefunded.
                     In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
                Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
                accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
                pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
                obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
                the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO)
                for current and future retirees over the recorded
                postretirement benefit cost accruals. The cumulative effect of
                the change in accounting principle for the Marathon Group
                reduced net income $147 million, consisting of the transition
                obligation of $233 million, net of $86 million income tax
                effect.

                POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
                defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined  
                assuming a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively.

</TABLE>

                     Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care and life
                insurance benefits to retired employees was recognized as an
                expense primarily as claims were paid. These costs totaled $11
                million for 1991.

                OBLIGATIONS -- The following table sets forth the plans'
                obligations and the amounts reported in the Marathon Group's
                balance sheet:

</TABLE>

                     The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
                6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
                respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
                compensation levels was 5.0% and 5.5% at December 31, 1993, and
                December 31, 1992, respectively. The weighted average health
                care cost trend rate in 1994 is approximately 7%, gradually
                declining to an ultimate rate in 1999 of approximately 5.5%. A
                one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
                trend rates for each future year would have increased the
                aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the
                1993 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $6 million and
                would have increased the APBO as of December 31, 1993, by $46
                million.

11. INCOME TAXES
                Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
                attributed to the Marathon Group are determined in accordance 
                with the USX group tax allocation policy (Note 3, page M-9).
                          In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial
                Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
                (SFAS No. 109), which requires an asset and liability approach
                in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
                income tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect
                the future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
                between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
                liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
                $184 million.

                (a) Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
                Opinion No. 11. The deferred tax benefit of $5 million in 1991
                was primarily the net result of timing differences related to
                depreciation, depletion and amortization, intangible
                development costs, pension accruals and the usage of business
                credit carryforwards.

                    In 1993, the cumulative effects of the changes in
                accounting principles for postemployment benefits and for
                retrospectively rated insurance contracts included deferred tax
                benefits of $10 million and $3 million, respectively (Note 2,
                page M-7). In 1992, the cumulative effect of the change in
                accounting principle for other postretirement benefits included
                a deferred tax benefit of $86 million (Note 10, page M-13).

                          The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years
                1988 through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
                administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
                adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
                become payable for years not yet settled.
                          Pretax income (loss) included $(55) million, $54
                million and $155 million attributable to foreign sources in

                In 1992, restructuring actions involving the disposition of
                nonstrategic domestic exploration and production properties,
                resulted in a $115 million charge to operating income. In 1991,
                a $24 million restructuring charge resulted from the planned
                disposition of certain drilling operations and two regulated
                utility companies.

                     Inventories of crude oil and refined products are valued
                by the LIFO method. The LIFO method accounted for 87% and 91%
                of total inventory value at December 31, 1993, and December 31,
                1992, respectively.
                     The inventory market valuation reserve reflects the extent
                that the recorded cost of crude oil and refined products
                inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is
                decreased to reflect increases in market prices and inventory
                turnover and increased to reflect decreases in market prices.
                Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve resulted in
                charges (credits) to operating income of $241 million, $(62)
                million and $260 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

19. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

                The Marathon Group has entered into an agreement, subject to
                limited recourse, to sell certain accounts receivable including
                accounts receivable purchased from the Delhi Group. Payments
                are collected from the sold accounts receivable; the
                collections are reinvested in new accounts receivable for the
                buyers; and a yield based on defined short-term market rates is
                transferred to the buyers. Collections on sold accounts
                receivable will be forwarded to the buyers at the end of the
                agreement in 1995, in the event of earlier contract termination
                or if the Marathon Group does not have a sufficient quantity of
                eligible accounts receivable to reinvest in for the buyers. The
                balance of sold accounts receivable averaged $400 million, $393
                million and $354 million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
                respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of sold
                accounts receivable that had not been collected was $400
                million. Buyers have collection rights to recover payments from
                an amount of outstanding receivables equal to 120% of the
                outstanding receivables purchased on a nonrecourse basis; such
                overcollateralization cannot exceed $80 million. The Marathon
                Group does not generally require collateral for accounts
                receivable, but significantly reduces credit risk through
                credit extension and collection policies, which include
                analyzing the financial condition of potential customers,
                establishing credit limits, monitoring payments and
                aggressively pursuing delinquent accounts. In the event of a
                change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the
                Marathon Group may be required to forward payments collected on
                sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

                     September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to that
                     date were attributed to the Marathon Group and the U. S.
                     Steel Group based upon the relationship of the initial
                     dividends on the Marathon Stock and Steel Stock.

21. DIVIDENDS
                In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
                dividends on the Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock
                are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
                of the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel Group or the Delhi Group,
                as well as dividends or distributions on any class of USX
                common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of
                any class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred
                Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for
                payment of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
                Subject to this limitation, the Board of Directors intends to
                declare and pay dividends on the Marathon Stock based on the
                financial condition and results of operation of the Marathon
                Group, although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do
                so. In making its dividend decisions with respect to Marathon
                Stock, the Board of Directors considers among other things, the
                long-term earnings and cash flow capabilities of the Marathon
                Group as well as the dividend policies of similar publicly
                traded companies.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
                Marathon Stock, Steel Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the USX
                Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
                earnings and surplus of the Marathon Group, the U.S. Steel
                Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
                dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
                available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes of
                stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
                     For purposes of computing net income (loss) per share of
                Marathon Stock for periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of
                Marathon Stock shares are assumed to be the same as the total
                corresponding numbers of shares of USX common stock.
                     Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
                adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
                preferred stock and is based on the weighted average number of
                common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents,
                provided they are not antidilutive. Common stock equivalents
                result from assumed exercise of stock options and surrender of
                stock appreciation rights  associated with stock options, where
                applicable.
                     Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
                conversion of convertible securities for the applicable periods
                outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and surrender
                of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each case, the
                effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

                Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
                transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
                adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
                are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
                For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
                currency transaction gains (losses) included in determining net
                income were $1 million, $16 million and $(1) million. An
                analysis of changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
                adjustments follows:

                     Fair value of financial instruments classified as current
                assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
                short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of long-term
                receivables and other investments was based on discounted cash
                flows or other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of
                long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where
                available or current borrowing rates available for financings
                with similar terms and maturities.
                     The Marathon Group's unrecognized financial instruments
                consist of accounts receivables sold subject to limited
                recourse, financial guarantees and commodity swaps. It is not
                practicable to estimate the fair value of these forms of
                financial instrument obligations. For details relating to sales
                of receivables see Note 19, page M-17. For details relating to
                financial guarantees see Note 26, page M-20. The contract value
                of open natural gas commodity swaps totaled $41 million at
                December 31, 1993. The swap arrangements vary in duration with
                certain individual contracts extending into early 1996.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

                USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
                threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
                relating to the Marathon Group involving a variety of matters,
                including laws and regulations relating to the environment.
                Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate
                resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the
                aggregate, be material to the Marathon Group financial
                statements. However, management believes that USX will remain a
                viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible
                that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the
                Marathon Group. 

                ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
                     The Marathon Group is subject to federal, state, local and
                foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These
                laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into
                the environment and require responsible parties to undertake
                remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be
                imposed for noncompliance. The Marathon Group provides for
                remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to
                remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
                reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of these
                accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
                the commitment to a formal plan of action. At December 31,
                1993, and December 31, 1992, accrued liabilities for
                remediation and platform abandonment totaled $161 million and
                $138 million, respectively. It is not presently possible to
                estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that
                might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
                     For a number of years, the Marathon Group has made
                substantial capital expenditures to bring existing facilities
                into compliance with various laws relating to the environment.
                In 1993 and 1992, such capital expenditures totaled $123
                million and $240 million, respectively. The Marathon Group
                anticipates making additional such expenditures in the future;
                however, the exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
                uncertain because of the continuing evolution of specific
                regulatory requirements.

                LIBYAN OPERATIONS --
                     By reason of Executive Orders and related regulations
                under which the U.S. Government is continuing economic
                sanctions against Libya, the Marathon Group was required to
                discontinue performing its Libyan petroleum contracts on June
                30, 1986. In June 1989, the Department of the Treasury
                authorized the Marathon Group to resume performing under those
                contracts. Pursuant to that authorization, the Marathon Group
                has engaged the Libyan National Oil Company and the Secretary
                of Petroleum in continuing negotiations to determine when and
                on what basis they are willing to allow the Marathon Group to
                resume realizing revenue from the Marathon Group's investment
                of $108 million in Libya. The Marathon Group is uncertain when
                these negotiations can be completed or how the negotiations
                will be affected by the United Nations sanctions against Libya.
                             
                GUARANTEES --
                     Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated and
                other entities of the Marathon Group totaled $18 million and
                $12 million at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
                respectively.
                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, the Marathon
                Group's pro rata share of obligations of LOOP INC. and various
                pipeline affiliates secured by throughput and deficiency
                agreements totaled $206 million and $216 million, respectively.
                Under the agreements, the Marathon Group is required to advance
                funds if the affiliates are unable to service debt. Any such
                advances are prepayments of future transportation charges.

                COMMITMENTS --
                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
                commitments for the Marathon Group's capital expenditures for
                property, plant and equipment totaled $284 million and $360
                million, respectively.

          THE MARATHON GROUP
          Management's Discussion and Analysis


              The Marathon Group includes Marathon Oil Company ("Marathon"), a
         wholly owned subsidiary of USX Corporation ("USX"), which is engaged
         in worldwide exploration, production, transportation and marketing of
         crude oil and natural gas; and domestic refining, marketing and
         transportation of petroleum products. Management's Discussion and
         Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Marathon Group's
         Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements.
        
              Prior to October 2, 1992, the Marathon Group also included the
         businesses of Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation and certain other USX
         subsidiaries engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing,
         transporting and marketing of natural gas which are now included in
         the Delhi Group. The Marathon Group financial data for the periods
         prior to October 2, 1992, include the combined historical financial
         position, results of operations and cash flows for the businesses of
         the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial statements
         of the Marathon Group do not include the financial position, results
         of operations and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group
         except for the financial effects of the Retained Interest (see Note 3
         to the Marathon Group Financial Statements).
        

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

              SALES declined $820 million in 1993 from 1992, following a $1.2
         billion decrease in 1992 from 1991. The 1993 decline primarily
         reflected lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon volumes and prices, lower
         average refined product prices and the absence of sales from the Delhi
         Group. These decreases were partially offset by increased excise taxes
         and higher refined product sales volumes, excluding matching buy/sell
         transactions. The decrease in 1992 from 1991 was mainly due to lower
         average refined product prices, reduced volumes and prices for crude
         oil matching buy/sell transactions and lower worldwide liquid
         hydrocarbon volumes. Matching buy/sell transactions and excise taxes
         are included in both sales and operating costs, resulting in no effect
         on operating income.
        
              OPERATING INCOME decreased $135 million in 1993, following a $54
         million decline in 1992 from 1991. Results in 1993 and 1991 were
         adversely affected, while 1992 was favorably affected, by special
         items (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations).
         Excluding the effects of these special items, operating income in 1993
         increased $172 million from 1992, mainly due to increased average
         refined product margins and increased domestic natural gas prices,
         partially offset by lower worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and
         volumes. Operating income declined $384 million in 1992 from 1991,
         excluding the special items, predominantly due to lower average
         refined product margins, as well as reduced worldwide liquid
         hydrocarbon prices and volumes and decreased international natural gas
         prices.
        
              OTHER INCOME was $46 million in 1993, compared with a loss of $7
         million in 1992 and income of $30 million in 1991. In addition to the
         absence of a $19 million impairment of an investment recorded in 1992,
         other income in 1993 increased primarily due to gains from disposal of
         assets totaling $34 million, which mainly reflected the sale of assets
         of a convenience store wholesale distributor, two tug/barge units and
         various domestic oil and gas production properties. Other income
         decreased $37 million in 1992 from 1991 primarily reflecting the
         investment impairment and lower gains from disposal of assets.
        
              INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $22 million in 1993, 
         compared with $210 million in 1992 and $18 million in 1991. The 1992 
         amount included $177 million of interest income resulting from the 
         settlement of a tax refund claim related to prior years' production 
         taxes.
        
              INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $292 million in 1993, $306
         million in 1992 and $341 million in 1991. The decrease in 1993 from 
         1992 mainly reflected higher capitalized interest for international
         projects, predominantly offset by higher interest costs related to
         increased levels of debt. The 1991 amount included a $26 million
         favorable adjustment related to interest accrued for prior years'
         production taxes. Excluding this item, the 1992 decrease from 1991
         mainly reflected a decline in variable interest rates, higher
         capitalized interest and lower average debt levels.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

               THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $49 million, 
          compared to provisions of $92 million in 1992 and $136 million in 
          1991. The 1993 U.S. income tax credit included an incremental 
          deferred tax benefit of $64 million resulting from USX's ability to 
          elect to credit, rather than deduct, certain foreign income taxes 
          for U. S. federal income tax purposes when paid in future years. The 
          anticipated use of the U. S. foreign tax credit reflects the 
          Marathon Group's improving international production profile including 
          income which will be generated by the East Brae platform in the 
          United Kingdom ("U.K.") sector of the North Sea. The 1993 U. S. 
          income tax credit also included a $40 million charge associated with
          an increase in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%,
          reflecting remeasurement of deferred federal income tax liabilities
          as of January 1, 1993.

               THE TOTAL LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
          PRINCIPLES was $6 million in 1993, compared to income of $109 million
          in 1992 and a loss of $71 million in 1991.

               THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING 
          PRINCIPLES totaled $23 million in 1993 and $331 million in 1992. The 
          cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting 
          Standards No. 112 - Employers' Accounting  for Postemployment 
          Benefits, determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by 
          $17 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative effect of 
          adopting Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 93-14 - Accounting 
          for Multiple-Year Retrospectively Rated Insurance Contracts, 
          determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income by $6 
          million, net of the income tax effect. The immediate recognition of 
          the transition obligation resulting from the adoption of Statement of 
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 - Employers' Accounting for 
          Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, measured as of January 
          1, 1992, decreased 1992 income by $147 million, net of the income 
          tax effect. The cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial 
          Accounting Standards No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes, measured 
          as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 net income by $184 million.

               A NET LOSS of $29 million was recorded in 1993, compared to a 
          net loss of $222 million in 1992 and a net loss of $71 million in 
          1991.
        

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

               CURRENT ASSETS declined $336 million from year-end 1992. The  
          decline was mainly due to lower inventories and receivables, 
          partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The 
          decrease in inventories was mainly due to a reduction in inventory 
          values, which reflected a $241 million increase in the inventory 
          market valuation reserve. This reserve reflects the extent to which 
          the recorded cost of crude oil and refined product inventories 
          exceeds net realizable value. Subsequent changes to the inventory 
          market valuation reserve are dependent on changes in future crude oil
          and refined product price levels and inventory turnover. The 
          reduction in accounts receivable primarily resulted from lower 
          selling prices of crude oil and refined products, decreased forward 
          currency hedging activities and reduced receivables from partners in 
          international joint venture activities. The decrease in receivables 
          related to currency hedging and joint venture activities was largely 
          offset by a related decrease in accounts payable.
        
               CURRENT LIABILITIES declined $610 million in 1993.  The 
          reduction was primarily due to reduced accounts payable and long-term 
          debt due within one year. The reduction in accounts payable was 
          largely due to a decrease in trade payables caused mainly by lower 
          crude oil purchase prices and volumes, decreased forward currency 
          hedging activities and reduced trade payables for international 
          joint venture activities. The decrease in payables related to 
          currency hedging and joint venture activities was largely offset by 
          a related decrease in accounts receivable.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

               TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31, 1993, 
          was $4.3 billion. The $287 million increase from year-end 1992 was
          primarily due to capital expenditures, dividend payments and an
          increase in cash and cash equivalents from year-end 1992, partially
          offset by cash provided from operating activities and disposal of
          assets. The amount of total long-term debt, as well as the amount
          shown as notes payable, principally represented the Marathon Group's
          portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of
          the debt is a direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.
                
               STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $3,110 million at year-end 1993 declined 
          $225 million from year-end 1992 mainly reflecting dividends paid on 
          USX-Marathon Group Common Stock ("Marathon Stock").


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

               THE MARATHON GROUP'S NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES
          totaled $827 million in 1993, down 17% from 1992. Results in 1992
          included $296 million associated with the refund of prior years'
          production taxes. Excluding the impact of this item, net cash
          provided from operating activities in 1993 improved $128 million
          mainly due to the impact of improved average refined product margins
          on operating results. Net cash provided from operating activities in
          1992 declined $315 million from 1991, excluding the previously
          mentioned tax refund, mainly due to the decrease in income.
        
               CAPITAL EXPENDITURES of $910 million in 1993 decreased $283 
          million from 1992, following an increase of $233 million from 1991.
          The decrease in 1993 mainly reflected decreased expenditures for
          environmental projects and for development of the East Brae Field and
          SAGE system in the U.K. and other international projects, partially
          offset by increased exploration drilling and development projects in
          the Gulf of Mexico and increased drilling activity for onshore
          domestic natural gas projects. Contract commitments for capital
          expenditures at year-end 1993 were $284 million, compared with $360
          million at year-end 1992. Capital expenditures are expected to
          decrease in 1994 by approximately $100 million mainly reflecting
          decreased expenditures for development of the East Brae Field and
          SAGE system.

               CASH FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS was $174 million in 1993, a 
          significant increase over $77 million in 1992 and $52 million in
          1991. The 1993 proceeds primarily reflected the sale/leaseback of
          interests in two LNG tankers and the sales of various domestic oil
          and gas production properties, assets of a convenience store
          wholesale distributor and two tug/barge units. No individually
          significant sales transactions occurred in 1992 or 1991.
        
               PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF USX-DELHI GROUP COMMON STOCK by 
          USX were $5 million in 1993 and $122 million in 1992, net of cash
          attributed to the Delhi Group.

               FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS increased $261 million, compared with a 
          decrease of $426 million in 1992, and an increase of $160 million in
          1991. The amount by which the obligations changed in 1993 was
          primarily a reflection of the Marathon Group's net cash flows from
          operating activities, investment activities and dividends paid during
          the period. These obligations consist of the Marathon Group's portion
          of USX debt attributed to all three groups as well as debt and
          production financing and other agreements that are specifically
          attributed to the Marathon Group.

               MARATHON STOCK ISSUED, net of repurchases, totaled $595 million 
          in 1992 and $67 million in 1991. The 1992 amount mainly reflected the
          sale of 25,000,000 shares of Marathon Stock to the public for net
          proceeds of $541 million, which were reflected in their entirety in
          the Marathon Group financial statements. The 1991 amount primarily
          reflected stock issued to employee savings plans.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED

               DIVIDEND PAYMENTS decreased $139 million in 1993, after a $13 
          million increase in 1992. The decline in 1993 was primarily due to a
          decrease in the Marathon Stock dividend rate which was reduced in the
          fourth quarter of 1992. The slight increase in 1992 reflected the
          incremental dividends paid on Marathon Stock shares sold in January
          1992 which were partially offset by the decrease in the dividend
          rate. Dividends attributed to the Marathon Stock prior to September
          10, 1991, were based on the relationship of the initial dividends of
          the Marathon Stock and the USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock. The
          annualized rate of dividends per share for the Marathon Stock based
          on the most recently declared quarterly dividend is $.68.
        
               In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P") lowered its 
          ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt to below investment grade
          (from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock
          and commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial
          leverage, burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation
          contingencies. In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services, Inc.
          ("Moody's") confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and
          Marathon's senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings on USX's
          subordinated debt and commercial paper, but lowered its ratings on
          USX's preferred stock from ba1 to ba2. Moody's noted that the rating
          confirmation on USX debt securities reflected confidence in the
          expected performance of USX during the intermediate term, while the
          downward revision of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a
          narrow fixed charge coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and
          the downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could increase
          USX's cost of capital. Any related increase in interest costs would
          be reflected in the consolidated financial statements and the
          financial statements of each group.
        

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

               The Marathon Group has incurred and will continue to incur 
          substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation
          expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. In
          recent years, these expenditures have increased primarily due to
          required product reformulation and process changes in order to meet
          Clean Air Act obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have
          also been significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all
          costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of the Marathon
          Group's products and services, operating results will be adversely
          affected. The Marathon Group believes that substantially all of its
          competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and
          regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
          depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of
          their operating facilities, their production processes and whether or
          not they are engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine
          transportation of crude oil.

               The Marathon Group's environmental expenditures for 1993 and
          1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based on American
          Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines. These guidelines are
          subject to differing interpretations which could affect the
          comparability of such data. Some environmental related expenditures,
          while benefiting the environment, also enhance operating
          efficiencies.

               Total environmental expenditures for the Marathon Group in 1993 
          were  $253 million compared with $370 million in 1992. These amounts
          consisted of capital expenditures of $123 million in 1993 and $240
          million in 1992 and estimated compliance expenditures (including
          operating and maintenance) of $130 million in both 1993 and 1992.
          Compliance expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
          guidelines and represented 1% of the Marathon Group's total operating
          costs in both 1993 and 1992. The decline in environmental capital
          expenditures from 1992 to 1993 primarily reflected lower expenditures
          for the Marathon Group's multi-year capital projects for diesel fuel
          desulfurization. By the end of 1993, these projects were
          substantially completed.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


               USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible 
          party ("PRP") at 14 waste sites related to the Marathon Group under
          the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
          Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31, 1993. In addition, there are 22
          sites related to the Marathon Group where USX has received
          information requests or other indications that USX may be a PRP under
          CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently available to
          confirm the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
          amount thereof. There are also 52 additional sites, excluding retail
          gasoline stations, related to the Marathon Group where state
          governmental agencies or private parties are seeking remediation
          under state environmental laws through discussions or litigation. At
          many of these sites, USX is one of a number of parties involved and
          the total cost of remediation, as well as USX's share thereof, is
          frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial
          studies.
        
               Total environmental expenditures included remediation related 
          expenditures estimated at $38 million in 1993 and $35 million in
          1992. Remediation spending was primarily related to retail gasoline
          stations which incur ongoing clean-up costs for soil and groundwater
          contamination associated with underground storage tanks and piping.
          The Marathon Group accrues for environmental remediation activities
          when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of
          associated costs is reasonably determinable. As environmental
          remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as
          additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those
          previously accrued may be required. See Note 26 to the Marathon Group
          Financial Statements.
        
               New or expanded requirements for environmental regulations, 
          which could increase the Marathon Group's environmental costs, may
          arise in the future. USX intends to comply with all legal
          requirements regarding the environment, but since many of them are
          not fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation)
          and may be affected by future legislation, it is not possible to
          accurately predict the ultimate cost of compliance, including
          remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be
          imposed. However, based on presently available information, and
          existing laws and regulations as currently implemented, the Marathon
          Group does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures
          will materially increase in 1994. The Marathon Group's capital
          expenditures for environmental controls are expected to be
          approximately $75 million in 1994. Predictions beyond 1994 can only
          be broad-based estimates which have varied, and will continue to
          vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
          requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements
          and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based
          upon currently identified projects, the Marathon Group anticipates
          that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $60
          million in 1995; however, actual expenditures may increase as
          additional projects are identified or additional requirements
          are imposed.
        
               USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or 
          threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments relating to
          the Marathon Group involving a variety of matters, including laws and
          regulations relating to the environment, certain of which are
          discussed in Note 26 to the Marathon Group Financial Statements. The
          ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in
          the aggregate, be material to the Marathon Group financial
          statements. However, management believes that USX will remain a
          viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that
          these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Marathon
          Group. See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and       
          Analysis of Cash Flows.

          Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

               The Marathon Group had operating income of $169 million in 1993, 
          compared with $304 million in 1992 and $358 million in 1991. Results
          for 1993 and 1991 were adversely affected, while 1992 was favorably
          affected, by special items. Results included a $241 million
          unfavorable effect in 1993, a $62 million favorable effect in 1992
          and a $260 million unfavorable effect in 1991 resulting from noncash
          adjustments to the inventory market valuation reserve. The 1992
          results also included a favorable impact of $119 million for the
          settlement of a tax refund claim related to prior years' production
          taxes, partially offset by a $115 million restructuring charge
          related to the disposition of certain domestic exploration and
          production properties. The 1991 results also included a $24 million
          restructuring charge, partially offset by a favorable $20 million
          adjustment of prior years' production tax accruals. Excluding the
          effects of these special items, operating income was $410 million in
          1993, $238 million in 1992 and $622 million in 1991. The increase in
          1993 primarily reflected increased average refined product margins
          and increased domestic natural gas prices, partially offset by lower
          worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes. The decrease in 1992
          predominantly reflected lower average refined product margins, as
          well as reduced worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices and volumes and a
          decrease in international natural gas prices.

              Upstream operating income decreased $92 million in 1993, 
         following an $88 million decrease in 1992. Operating income in 1992
         included a $20 million gain recognized as a result of a settlement of
         a natural gas contract. Excluding this settlement, the decline in 1993
         was mainly due to significant decreases in worldwide liquid
         hydrocarbon prices and volumes and lower international natural gas
         prices, partially offset by increased domestic natural gas prices. The
         decline in 1992, excluding this contract settlement, was also
         primarily caused by decreases in worldwide liquid hydrocarbon prices
         and volumes and lower international natural gas prices, partially      
         offset by ongoing cost reduction efforts.
        
              Domestic upstream operating income in 1993 declined $6 million 
         from 1992, following a $19 million increase in 1992 from 1991.
         Excluding the previously mentioned contract settlement, the 14%
         increase in 1993 was primarily due to increased natural gas prices and
         reduced dry well expenses, partially offset by reduced liquid
         hydrocarbon prices and volumes. In addition, operating income in 1993
         reflected ongoing cost reduction efforts and reduced depletion
         expenses. The results in 1992, excluding the previously mentioned
         contract settlement, remained level with 1991, as ongoing cost
         reduction efforts and reduced exploration expenses were offset by
         lower liquid hydrocarbon prices.
        
              International upstream operating income declined $86 million in 
         1993, following a $107 million decline in 1992. Natural gas prices
         have declined 30% since 1991, primarily reflecting changes in contract
         sales prices in Norway. The decrease in 1993 was primarily due to
         lower liquid hyrdocarbon prices, reduced liftings primarily from the
         U.K. sector of the North Sea as a result of natural production
         declines, lower natural gas prices, and a $17 million charge for the
         relinquishment of the Marathon Group's interest in the Arzanah Oil
         Field, Abu Dhabi. The decrease was partially offset by reduced
         pipeline and terminal expenses and reduced dry well expenses. The
         decrease in 1992 was primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower
         liquid hydrocarbon liftings and increased dry well expenses.
        
              In December 1993, the East Brae Field in the U.K. North Sea was 
         brought onstream. East Brae liquids production is expected to peak at
         45,000 net barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 1994. Worldwide
         liquid volumes are expected to increase approximately 15% in 1994,
         reflecting a full year of East Brae production, which should continue
         to contribute to increased volumes in 1995. Worldwide natural gas
         volumes are expected to increase approximately 5% in 1994, reflecting
         the start of Brae area gas sales in October 1994. The 1995 volumes are
         expected to continue to increase reflecting a full year of Brae area
         production.
        
              In 1992, Marathon and its partners finalized and delivered a 
         feasibility study to the Russian Government assessing the technical
         and economic viability of developing fields offshore Sakhalin Island.
         After positive review by the State Expertise Commission in 1993,
         negotiations to sign a production sharing contract are currently being
         held among the Russian Government and representatives of the
         consortium.
        
              Downstream operating income increased $279 million in 1993, 
         after decreasing $294 million in 1992. The increase in 1993 was
         primarily due to increased average refined product margins from
         refining and wholesale marketing which nearly doubled since 1992 as a
         result of decreased crude oil costs and lower maintenance costs for
         refinery turnaround activities, partially offset by decreased average
         refined product prices. Also contributing to the increase in operating
         income were record margins in both refined products and convenience
         store merchandise experienced by Emro Marketing Company, a Marathon
         subsidiary. Downstream operating income in 1993 also included a $17
         million charge for future environmental remediation. The decrease in
         1992 was chiefly the result of lower average refined product margins
         which were adversely impacted as declines in average refined product
         sales prices exceeded decreases in raw material costs. Results in 1992
         were also negatively affected by increased maintenance costs as a
         result of planned refinery turnaround activities.
        
              In 1993, the Marathon Group temporarily idled its 50,000 
         barrels-per-day Indianapolis Refinery to enhance the efficiency of
         downstream operations. Idling of the Indianapolis facility will have
         no impact on the Marathon Group's supply of transportation fuels to
         its various classes of trade in Indiana or the Midwest marketing area.
         The costs related to the idling did not have a material effect on the
         Marathon Group's 1993 operating results.

               Gas Gathering and Processing results decreased due to the 
          exclusion of the businesses now in the Delhi Group.

               Other Administrative expenses were $77 million in 1993, 
          compared to $83 million in 1992 and $90 million in 1991. These costs
          include the portion of the Marathon Group's administrative costs not 
          allocated to the individual business components and the portion of USX
          corporate general and administrative costs allocated to the Marathon 
          Group. 

               The outlook regarding prices and costs for the Marathon Group's 
          principal products is largely dependent upon world market 
          developments for crude oil and refined products. Market conditions 
          in the petroleum industry are cyclical and subject to global 
          economic and political events.

U. S. Steel Group


                 Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information


                 Although the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group,
                 the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
                 assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
                 stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group,
                 such attribution does not affect legal title to such assets
                 and responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-U.S.
                 Steel Group Common Stock, USX-Marathon Group Common Stock and
                 USX-Delhi Group Common Stock are holders of common stock of
                 USX and continue to be subject to all the risks associated
                 with an investment in USX and all of its businesses and
                 liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the U.S.
                 Steel Group, the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group which
                 affect the overall cost of USX's capital could affect the
                 results of operations and financial condition of all groups.
                 In addition, net losses of any group, as well as dividends or
                 distributions on any class of USX common stock or series of
                 Preferred Stock and repurchases of any class of USX common
                 stock or certain series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the
                 funds of USX legally available for payment of dividends on all
                 classes of USX common stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated
                 financial information should be read in connection with the
                 U.S. Steel Group financial information.

                 Management's Report

                 The accompanying financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group
                 are the responsibility of and have been prepared by USX
                 Corporation (USX) in conformity with generally accepted
                 accounting principles. They necessarily include some amounts
                 that are based on best judgments and estimates. The U. S.
                 Steel Group financial information displayed in other sections
                 of this report is consistent with that in these financial
                 statements.
                        USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of
                 its financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
                 organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate
                 division of responsibility and by communications programs
                 aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
                 throughout the organization.
                        USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal
                 accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance
                 that assets are safeguarded and that financial records are
                 reliable. Appropriate management monitors the system for
                 compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure
                 its effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto.
                 In addition, as part of their audit of the financial
                 statements, USX's independent accountants, who are elected by
                 the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
                 controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon
                 in determining the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to
                 be applied.
                        The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in
                 the area of financial reporting and internal accounting
                 control through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed
                 solely of nonmanagement directors, regularly meets (jointly
                 and separately) with the independent accountants, management
                 and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each
                 of its responsibilities relative to internal accounting
                 controls and the consolidated and group financial statements.

                 Report of Independent Accountants

                 To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

                 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
                 appearing on pages S-4 through S-20 and as listed in Item
                 14.A.2 on page 61 of this report present fairly, in all
                 material respects, the financial position of the U. S. Steel
                 Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its
                 operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
                 the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
                 generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
                 statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our
                 responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
                 statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
                 these statements in accordance with generally accepted
                 auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
                 audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
                 financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
                 audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
                 the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
                 assessing the accounting principles used and significant
                 estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
                 financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
                 provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
                        As discussed in Note 26, page S-19, the U. S. Steel
                 Group is involved in certain contingencies, the outcome of
                 which cannot presently be determined.
                        As discussed in Note 2, page S-7, in 1993 USX adopted a
                 new accounting standard for postemployment benefits. As
                 discussed in Note 11, page S-13, and Note 12, page S-14, in
                 1992 USX adopted new accounting standards for postretirement
                 benefits other than pensions and for income taxes,
                 respectively.
                        The U. S. Steel Group is a business unit of USX
                 Corporation (as described in Note 1, page S-7); accordingly,
                 the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group should be
                 read in connection with the consolidated financial statements
                 of USX Corporation and Subsidiary Companies.

                Notes to Financial Statements

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

                USX Corporation (USX) has three classes of common stock: USX --
                U. S. Steel Group Common Stock (Steel Stock), USX -- Marathon
                Group Common Stock (Marathon Stock) and USX -- Delhi Group
                Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which are intended to reflect the
                performance of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and
                the Delhi Group, respectively.
                    The financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group include
                the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
                for all businesses of USX other than the businesses, assets and
                liabilities included in the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group,
                and a portion of the corporate assets and liabilities and
                related transactions which are not separately identified with
                ongoing operating units of USX. The U. S. Steel Group, which
                consists primarily of steel operations, includes one of the
                largest domestic integrated steel producers and is primarily
                engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of steel
                mill products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel Group
                also includes the management of mineral resources, domestic
                coal mining, and engineering and consulting services and
                technology licensing. Other businesses that are part of the
                U. S. Steel Group include real estate development and 
                management, fencing products, leasing and financing activities,
                and a majority interest in a titanium metal products company. 
                The U. S. Steel Group financial statements are prepared using 
                the amounts included in the USX consolidated financial 
                statements.
                    Although the financial statements of the U. S. Steel Group,
                the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group separately report the
                assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and
                stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such group, such
                attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
                responsibility for such liabilities.  Holders of Steel Stock,
                Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock are holders of common stock of
                USX and continue to be subject to all the risks associated with
                an investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
                Financial impacts arising from any of the U. S. Steel Group,
                the Marathon Group or the Delhi Group which affect the overall
                cost of USX's capital could affect the results of operations
                and financial condition of all groups. In addition, net losses
                of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
                class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
                repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain series
                of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
                available for payment of dividends on all classes of common
                stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information
                should be read in connection with the U. S. Steel Group
                financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION - These financial
                statements include the accounts of the U. S. Steel Group. The
                U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group
                financial statements, taken together, comprise all of the
                accounts included in the USX consolidated financial statements.
                    Investments in other entities in which the U. S. Steel
                Group has significant influence in management and control are
                accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are
                carried in the investment account at the U. S. Steel Group's
                share of net assets plus advances. The proportionate share of
                income from equity investments is included in other income.
                    Investments in marketable equity securities are carried at
                lower of cost or market and investments in other companies are
                carried at cost, with income recognized when dividends are
                received.

                NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - The following accounting standard
                was adopted by USX during 1993:

                    Postemployment benefits - Effective January 1, 1993, USX
                    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
                    112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits"
                    (SFAS No. 112). SFAS No. 112 requires employers to
                    recognize the obligation to provide postemployment benefits
                    on an accrual basis if certain conditions are met.  The 
                    U. S. Steel Group is affected primarily by disability-
                    related claims covering indemnity and medical payments. The
                    obligation for these claims is measured using actuarial
                    techniques and assumptions including appropriate discount
                    rates. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                    principle determined as of January 1, 1993, reduced net
                    income $69 million, net of $40 million income tax effect.
                    The effect of the change in accounting principle reduced
                    1993 operating income by $21 million.

<PAGE>   142
                    USX has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
                Loan" (SFAS No. 114). SFAS No. 114 requires impairment of loans
                based on either the sum of discounted cash flows or the fair
                value of underlying collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No.
                114 in the first quarter of 1995.  Based on preliminary
                estimates, USX expects the unfavorable effect of adopting SFAS
                No. 114 for the U. S. Steel Group will be less than $2 million.

                CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents includes
                cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt instruments
                with maturities generally of three months or less.

                INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of cost or
                market. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the
                last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

                HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- Commodity swaps are used to hedge
                exposure to price fluctuations relevant to the purchase of
                natural gas. Such transactions are accounted for as part of the
                commodity being hedged. Forward contracts are used to hedge
                currency risks, and the accounting is based on the requirements
                of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52.

                PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation is generally
                computed using a modified straight-line method based upon
                estimated lives of assets and production levels. In 1992, the
                U. S. Steel Group revised the modification factors used in the
                depreciation of steel producing assets accounted for by the
                modified straight-line method to reflect that raw steel
                production capability is entirely continuous cast. The revised
                modification factors range from a minimum of 85% at a
                production level below 81% of capability, to a maximum of 105%
                for a 100% production level. No modification is made at the 95%
                production level, considered the normal long-range level.
                    Depletion of mineral properties is based on rates which are
                expected to amortize cost over the estimated tonnage of
                minerals to be removed.
                    When an entire plant, major facility or facilities
                depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise
                disposed of, any gain or loss is reflected in income. Proceeds
                from disposal of other facilities depreciated on a group basis
                are credited to the depreciation reserve with no immediate
                effect on income.

                INSURANCE -- The U. S. Steel Group is insured for catastrophic
                casualty and certain property and business interruption
                exposures, as well as those risks required to be insured by law
                or contract. Costs resulting from noninsured losses are charged
                against income upon occurrence.

                RECLASSIFICATIONS -- Certain reclassifications of prior years'
                data have been made to conform to 1993 classifications.


3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

                FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX manages most
                financial activities on a centralized, consolidated basis. Such
                financial activities include the investment of surplus cash;
                the issuance, repayment and repurchase of short-term and
                long-term debt; the issuance, repurchase and redemption of
                preferred stock; and the issuance and repurchase of common
                stock. Transactions related primarily to invested cash,
                short-term and long-term debt (including convertible debt),
                related net interest and other financial costs, and preferred
                stock and related dividends are attributed to the U. S. Steel
                Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group based upon the
                cash flows of each group for the periods presented and the
                initial capital structure of each group. Most financing
                transactions are attributed to and reflected in the financial
                statements of all three groups. See Note 6, page S-9, for the
                U. S.  Steel Group's portion of USX's financial activities
                attributed to all three groups. However, certain transactions
                such as leases, production payment financings, financial
                activities of consolidated entities which are less than wholly
                owned by USX and transactions related to securities convertible
                solely into any one class of common stock are or will be
                specifically attributed to and reflected in their entirety in
                the financial statements of the group to which they relate.

                CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate general
                and administrative costs are allocated to the U. S. Steel
                Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group based upon
                utilization or other methods management believes to be
                reasonable and which consider certain measures of business
                activities, such as employment, investments and sales.  The
                costs allocated to the U. S. Steel Group were $33 million in
                both 1993 and 1992, and $45 million in 1991, and primarily
                consist of employment costs including pension effects,
                professional services, facilities and other related costs
                associated with corporate activities.

                COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- All financial statement impacts of
                purchases and issuances of Steel Stock after the change of USX
                common stock into Marathon Stock and the distribution of Steel
                Stock on May 6, 1991, are reflected in their entirety in the 
                U. S. Steel Group financial statements. Financial statement
                impacts of treasury stock transactions occurring before May 7,
                1991, have been attributed to the two groups in relationship to
                their respective common equity. The initial dividend on the
                Steel





                                      S-8
<PAGE>   143
                Stock was paid on September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX
                prior to September 10, 1991, were attributed to the U. S.
                Steel Group and the Marathon Group based upon the relationship
                of the initial dividends on the Steel Stock and Marathon Stock.

                INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group are
                included in the consolidated United States federal income tax
                return filed by USX. Accordingly, the provision for federal
                income taxes and the related payments or refunds of tax are
                determined on a consolidated basis. The consolidated provision
                and the related tax payments or refunds have been reflected in
                the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi Group
                financial statements in accordance with USX's tax allocation
                policy. In general, such policy provides that the consolidated
                tax provision and related tax payments or refunds are allocated
                among the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group and the Delhi
                Group, for group financial statement purposes, based
                principally upon the financial income, taxable income, credits,
                preferences and other amounts directly related to the
                respective groups.
                    For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax benefits
                resulting from attributes (principally net operating losses),
                which cannot be utilized by one of the three groups on a
                separate return basis but which can be utilized on a
                consolidated basis in that year or in a carryback year, are
                allocated to the group that generated the attributes.  However,
                if such tax benefits cannot be utilized on a consolidated basis
                in that year or in a carryback year, the prior years'
                allocation of such consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a
                subsequent year to the extent necessary to allocate the tax
                benefits to the group that would have realized the tax benefits
                on a separate return basis.
                    The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or refundable
                are not necessarily comparable to those that would have
                resulted if the groups had filed separate tax returns; however,
                such allocation should not result in any of the three groups
                paying more income taxes over time than it would if it filed
                separate tax returns, and in certain situations, could result
                in any of the three groups paying less.

4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

                The 1993 restructuring action involving the planned closure of
                a Pennsylvania coal mine resulted in a $42 million charge to
                operating income, primarily related to the writedown of
                property, plant and equipment, contract termination, and mine
                closure cost. A $10 million restructuring charge for the
                completion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to steel
                operations reduced operating income in 1992. The 1991
                restructuring actions resulted in a $402 million charge to
                operating income, primarily related to write-downs of property,
                plant and equipment and employee costs related to the permanent
                closing of certain steel facilities.

5. B&LE LITIGATION CHARGES

                Pretax income (loss) in 1993 included a $506 million charge
                related to the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore
                Antitrust Litigation against a former USX subsidiary, the
                Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad (B&LE) (Note 26, page S-19).
                Charges of $342 million were included in operating costs and
                $164 million included in interest and other financial costs.
                The effect on 1993 net income (loss) was $325 million
                unfavorable ($5.04 per share of Steel Stock).  At December 31,
                1993, accounts payable included $376 million for this
                litigation.

6. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ATTRIBUTED TO ALL THREE GROUPS

                As described in Note 3, page S-8, the U. S. Steel Group's
                portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all groups

                 (a) Gains resulted primarily from the sale of the Cumberland
                     coal mine, an investment in an insurance company and the
                     realization of deferred gain resulting from collection of
                     a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of Transtar,
                     Inc. (Transtar). The collection also resulted in interest
                     income of $37 million.
                 (b) Reflected the $29 million favorable minority interest
                     effect related to a loss of RMI Titanium Company (a
                     51%-owned company), of which $19 million resulted from
                     restructuring charges.

                     Group.
                 (d) Excluded financial income and costs of finance operations,
                     which are included in operating income.

10. PENSIONS

                 The U. S. Steel Group has noncontributory defined benefit
                 plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits under
                 these plans are based upon years of service and final average
                 pensionable earnings, or a minimum benefit based upon years of
                 service, whichever is greater. In addition, contributory
                 pension benefits, which cover participating salaried
                 employees, are based upon years of service and career
                 earnings. The funding policy for defined benefit plans
                 provides that payments to the pension trusts shall be equal to
                 the minimum funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional
                 amounts as may be approved from time to time. Certain of these
                 plans provide benefits to USX corporate employees, and the
                 related costs or credits for such employees are allocated to
                 all three groups (Note 3, page S-8).
                     The U. S. Steel Group also participates in multiemployer
                 plans, most of which are defined benefit plans associated with
                 coal operations.

                 PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost for major
                 plans was determined assuming an expected long-term rate of
                 return on plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and
                 1991. The total pension credit is primarily included in
                 selling, general and administrative expenses.

                 FUNDS' STATUS -- The assumed discount rate used to measure the
                 benefit obligations of major plans was 6.5% and 7% at December
                 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, respectively. The assumed
                 rate of future increases in compensation levels was 3% in both
                 years. Plans with accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) in
                 excess of plan assets were not material in 1992.

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

                 The U. S. Steel Group has defined benefit retiree health and
                 life insurance plans covering most employees upon their
                 retirement. Health benefits are provided, for the most part,
                 through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major medical
                 benefit provisions subject to various cost sharing features.
                 Life insurance benefits are provided to nonunion retiree
                 beneficiaries primarily based on employees' annual base salary
                 at retirement. For union retirees, benefits are provided for
                 the most part based on fixed amounts negotiated in labor
                 contracts with the appropriate unions. Except for certain life
                 insurance benefits paid from reserves held by insurance
                 carriers, benefits have not been prefunded. In 1994, the U. S.
                 Steel Group agreed to establish a Voluntary Employee
                 Beneficiary Association (VEBA) Trust to prefund health care
                 and life insurance benefits for retirees, who are covered
                 under the USWA union agreement. Minimum contributions, in the
                 form of USX Corporation stock or cash, are expected to be $25
                 million in 1994 and $10 million per year thereafter.
                     In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                 Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
                 Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS No. 106), which requires
                 accrual accounting for all postretirement benefits other than
                 pensions. USX elected to recognize immediately the transition
                 obligation determined as of January 1, 1992, which represents
                 the excess accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
                 (APBO) for current and future retirees over the fair value of
                 plan assets and recorded postretirement benefit cost accruals.
                 The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
                 for the U. S. Steel Group reduced net income $1,159 million,
                 consisting of the transition obligation of $1,837 million, net
                 of $678 million income tax effect.

                 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST -- Postretirement benefit cost for
                 defined benefit plans for 1993 and 1992 was determined
                 assuming a discount rate of 7% and 8%, respectively, and an
                 expected return on plan assets of 10% for each year presented

</TABLE>

                 (a) In 1993, a new multi-employer benefit plan created by the
                     Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 replaced
                     the previous plan provided under the collective bargaining
                     agreement with the United Mine Workers of America. The 
                     U. S. Steel Group is required to make payments to the plan
                     based on assigned beneficiaries receiving benefits, and
                     such payments are expected to increase to approximately
                     $15 million to $25 million in 1994 and subsequent years.
                     The present value of this unrecognized obligation is
                     broadly estimated to be $220 million, including the
                     effects of future medical inflation, and this amount 
                     could increase if additional beneficiaries are assigned.

                      Prior to 1992, the cost of providing health care benefits
                 to retired employees was recognized as an expense primarily as
                 claims were paid, and the cost of life insurance benefits for
                 retirees was generally accrued during their working years.
                 These costs totaled $144 million for 1991.

                 funded status and the amounts reported in the U. S. Steel

                     The assumed discount rate used to measure the APBO was
                 6.5% and 7% at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
                 respectively. The assumed rate of future increases in
                 compensation levels was 3% for both years. The weighted
                 average health care cost trend rate in 1994 is approximately
                 8%, gradually declining to an ultimate rate in 1997 of
                 approximately 6%. A one percentage point increase in the
                 assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year
                 would have increased the aggregate of the service and interest
                 cost components of the 1993 net periodic postretirement
                 benefit cost by $28 million and would have increased the APBO
                 as of December 31, 1993, by $326 million.

                 Settlements -- Other income disclosed in Note 9, page S-11,

                 sale of the Cumberland coal mine.

12. INCOME TAXES

                 Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
                 attributed to the U.S. Steel Group are determined in 
                 accordance with the USX group tax allocation policy 
                 (Note 3, page S-9).
                     In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                 Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
                 109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
                 accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred
                 income tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect
                 the future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
                 between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
                 liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                 principle determined as of January 1, 1992, reduced net income
                 $176 million.

                 (a)   Computed in accordance with Accounting Principles Board

                       in 1991 was primarily the net result of the generation
                       of federal tax loss carryforwards and timing differences
                       related to restructuring charges and pension accruals.

                       In 1993, the cumulative effect of the change in
                 accounting principle for postemployment benefits included a
                 deferred tax benefit of $40 million (Note 2, page S-7). In
                 1992, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                 principle for other postretirement benefits included a
                 deferred tax benefit of $678 million (Note 11, page S-13).

                 (b) Includes the benefit of federal tax loss carryforwards
                     associated with a majority owned subsidiary which is not
                     included in USX's consolidated federal tax return of $26
                     million and $21 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
                     respectively, for which a full valuation allowance has
                     been provided at both dates.
                 (c) Valuation allowances have been established for certain
                     federal and state income tax assets. The valuation
                     allowances increased $31 million primarily for certain tax
                     credits and tax loss carryforwards which USX may not fully
                     utilize.

                     The consolidated tax returns of USX for the years 1988
                 through 1991 are under various stages of audit and
                 administrative review by the IRS. USX believes it has made
                 adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may
                 become payable for years not yet settled.

19. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

                 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - The U. S. Steel Group has entered into
                 an agreement to sell certain accounts receivable subject to
                 limited recourse. Payments are collected from the sold
                 accounts receivable; the collections are reinvested in new
                 accounts receivable for the buyers; and a yield based on
                 defined short-term market rates is transferred to the buyers.
                 Collections on sold accounts receivable will be forwarded to
                 the buyers at the end of the agreement in 1994, in the event
                 of earlier contract termination or if a sufficient quantity of
                 eligible accounts receivable is not available to reinvest in
                 for the buyers. The balance of sold accounts receivable
                 averaged $333 million, $310 million and $350 million for the
                 years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At December 31, 1993,
                 the balance of sold accounts receivable that had not been
                 collected was $340 million. Buyers have collection rights to
                 recover payments from an amount of outstanding receivables
                 equal to 120% of the outstanding receivables purchased on a
                 nonrecourse basis; such overcollateralization cannot exceed
                 $70 million. The U. S. Steel Group does not generally require
                 collateral for accounts receivable, but significantly reduces
                 credit risk through credit extension and collection policies,
                 which include analyzing the financial condition of potential
                 customers, establishing credit limits, monitoring payments and
                 aggressively pursuing delinquent accounts. In the event of a
                 change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the 
                 U. S. Steel Group may be required to forward payments collected
                 on sold accounts receivable to the buyers.

                 LOANS RECEIVABLE -- Prior to 1993, USX Credit, a division of
                 USX, sold certain of its loans receivable subject to limited
                 recourse. USX Credit continues to collect payments from the
                 loans and transfer to the buyers principal collected plus
                 yield based on defined short-term market rates. In 1993, 1992
                 and 1991, USX Credit net sales (repurchases) of loans
                 receivable totaled $(50) million, $(24) million and $85
                 million, respectively. At December 31, 1993, the balance of
                 sold loans receivable subject to recourse was $205 million.
                 USX Credit is not actively seeking new loans at this time. USX
                 Credit is subject to market risk through fluctuations in
                 short-term market rates on sold loans which pay fixed interest
                 rates. USX Credit significantly reduces credit risk through a
                 credit policy, which requires that loans be secured by the
                 real property or equipment financed, often with additional
                 security such as letters of credit, personal guarantees and
                 committed long-term financing takeouts. Also, USX Credit
                 diversifies its portfolio as to types and terms of loans,
                 borrowers, loan sizes, sources of business and types and
                 locations of collateral. As of December 31, 1993, and December
                 31, 1992, USX Credit had outstanding loan commitments of $29
                 million and $32 million, respectively. In the event of a
                 change in control of USX, as defined in the agreement, the 
                 U. S. Steel Group may be required to provide cash collateral in
                 the amount of the uncollected loans receivable to assure
                 compliance with the limited recourse provisions

                     Estimated credit losses under the limited recourse
                 provisions for both accounts receivable and loans receivable
                 are recognized when the receivables are sold consistent with
                 bad debt experience. Recognized liabilities for future
                 recourse obligations of sold receivables were $3 million and
                 $1 million at December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
                 respectively.

                 (a) For details of 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
                     Stock, which was sold in 1993 for net proceeds of $336
                     million and attributed entirely to the U. S. Steel Group,
                     see Note 19, page U-21 to the USX consolidated financial
                     statements.
                 (b) The initial dividend on the Steel Stock was paid on
                     September 10, 1991. Dividends paid by USX prior to that
                     date were attributed to the U. S. Steel Group and the
                     Marathon Group based upon the relationship of the initial
                     dividends on the Steel Stock and Marathon Stock.

21. DIVIDENDS

                 In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
                 dividends on the Steel Stock, Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock
                 are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
                 of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon Group or the Delhi
                 Group, as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
                 USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases
                 of any class of USX common stock or certain series of
                 Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally
                 available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
                 common stock. Subject to this limitation, the Board of
                 Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on the Steel
                 Stock based on the financial condition and results of
                 operations of the U. S. Steel Group, although it has no
                 obligation under Delaware Law to do so. In making its dividend
                 decisions with respect to Steel Stock, the Board of Directors
                 considers, among other things, the long-term earnings and cash
                 flow capabilities of the U. S. Steel Group as well as the
                 dividend policies of similar publicly traded steel companies.
                     Dividends on the Steel Stock are further limited to the
                 Available Steel Dividend Amount. At December 31, 1993, the
                 Available Steel Dividend Amount was at least $1.849 billion.
                 The Available Steel Dividend Amount will be increased or
                 decreased, as appropriate, to reflect U. S. Steel Group net
                 income, dividends, repurchases or issuances with respect to
                 the Steel Stock and preferred stock attributed to the U. S.
                 Steel Group and certain other items.

22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                 The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
                 Steel Stock, Marathon Stock and Delhi Stock reflects the USX
                 Board of Directors' intent that the separately reported
                 earnings and surplus of the U. S. Steel Group, the Marathon
                 Group and the Delhi Group, as determined consistent with the
                 USX Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
                 dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
                 available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes
                 of stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
                     For purposes of computing net income (loss) per share of
                 Steel Stock for periods prior to May 7, 1991, the numbers of
                 shares of Steel Stock are assumed to be one-fifth of the total
                 corresponding numbers of shares of USX common stock.
                     Primary net income (loss) per share is calculated by
                 adjusting net income (loss) for dividend requirements of
                 preferred stock and is based on the weighted average number of
                 common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents,
                 provided they are not antidilutive. Common stock equivalents
                 result from assumed exercise of stock options and surrender of
                 stock appreciation rights associated with stock options, where
                 applicable.
                     Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes
                 conversion of convertible securities for the applicable
                 periods outstanding and assumes exercise of stock options and
                 surrender of stock appreciation rights, provided, in each
                 case, the effect is not antidilutive.

23. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

                 Exchange adjustments resulting from foreign currency
                 transactions generally are recognized in income, whereas
                 adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
                 are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
                 For 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, the aggregate foreign
                 currency transaction losses included in determining net income
                 were $4 million, $2 million and $2 million. An analysis of
                 changes in cumulative foreign currency translation
                 adjustments follows:

24. STOCK PLANS AND STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

                 USX Stock Plans and Stockholder Rights Plan are discussed in
                 Note 20, page U-22, and Note 24, page U-24, respectively, to
                 the USX consolidated financial statements.

25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                 Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is
                 not necessarily representative of the amount that could be
                 realized or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider
                 the tax consequences of realization or settlement.  As
                 described in Note 3, page S-8, the U. S. Steel Group's
                 specifically attributed financial instruments and the U. S.
                 Steel Group's portion of USX's financial instruments
                 attributed to all groups are as follows:

                 (a) The difference between carrying value and fair value
                     principally represented the subordinated note related to
                     the earlier sale of a majority interest in Transtar, Inc.
                     (Transtar) which was carried at no value due to the highly
                     leveraged nature of the transaction. The note was paid in
                     full in 1993 resulting in other income of $70 million and
                     interest income of $37 million (Note 9, page S-11).

25. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

                     Fair value of financial instruments classified as current
                 assets or liabilities approximate carrying value due to the
                 short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of
                 long-term receivables and other investments was based on
                 discounted cash flows or other specific instrument analysis.
                 Fair value of long-term debt instruments was based on market
                 prices where available or current borrowing rates available
                 for financings with similar terms and maturities.
                     The U. S. Steel Group's unrecognized financial instruments
                 consist of receivables sold subject to limited recourse,
                 commitments to extend credit, financial guarantees, and
                 commodity swaps. It is not practicable to estimate the fair
                 value of these forms of financial instrument obligations. For
                 details relating to sales of receivables and commitments to
                 extend credit see Note 19, page S-16. For details relating to
                 financial guarantees see Note 26, page S-20. The contract
                 value of open natural gas commodity swaps, as of December 31,
                 1993 and December 31, 1992 totaled $51 million and $13
                 million, respectively. The swap arrangements extend for no
                 longer than one year.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

                 USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
                 threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
                 relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving a variety of
                 matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
                 environment. Certain of these matters are discussed below. The
                 ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually
                 or in the aggregate, be material to the U. S. Steel Group
                 financial statements. However, management believes that USX
                 will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it
                 is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
                 unfavorably to the U. S. Steel Group.

                 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --
                  B&LE litigation; MDL-587

                     On January 24, 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a
                 petition for Writ of Certiorari by the B&LE in the Lower 
                 Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation (MDL-587). 
                 As a result, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
                 Third Circuit affirming judgments of approximately $498
                 million, plus interest, relating to antitrust violations by 
                 the B&LE was permitted to stand. In addition, the Third Circuit
                 decision remanded the claims of two plaintiffs for retrial of
                 their damage awards. At trial these plaintiffs asserted claims
                 of approximately $8 million, but were awarded only nominal
                 damages by the jury. A new trial date has not been set. Any
                 damages awarded in a new trial may be more or less than 
                 $8 million and would be subject to trebling.
                    The B&LE was a wholly owned subsidiary of USX throughout the
                 period the conduct occurred. It is now a subsidiary of Transtar
                 in which USX has a 45% equity interest. These actions were
                 excluded liabilities in the sale of USX's transportation units
                 in 1988, and USX is obligated to reimburse Transtar for
                 judgments paid by the B&LE.
    
                    Following the Court of Appeals decision, USX, which had
                 previously accrued $90 million on a pretax basis for this
                 litigation, charged an additional amount of $619 million on a
                 pretax basis in the second quarter of 1993. In late 1993, USX
                 and LTV Steel Corp. ("LTV"), one of the plaintiffs in MDL-587,
                 agreed to settle all of LTV's claims in that action for $375
                 million. USX made a payment of $200 million on December 29,
                 1993, and is obligated to pay an additional $175 million not
                 later than February 28, 1994. Claims of three additional
                 plaintiffs were also settled in December 1993. 

                 These settlements resulted in a pretax credit of $127 million 
                 in the fourth quarter financial results of the U.S. Steel
                 Group. As a result of the denial of the Petition for Writ of 
                 Certiorari, judgments for the other MDL-587 plaintiffs 
                 (other than the two remanded for retrial), totaling 
                 approximately $210 million, including postjudgment interest, 
                 are due for payment in the first quarter of 1994.


                 B&LE litigation; Armco
                     In June 1990, following judgments entered on behalf of
                 steel company plaintiffs in MDL-587, Armco Steel filed federal
                 antitrust claims against the B&LE and other railroads in the
                 Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. B&LE
                 successfully challenged the actions for lack of jurisdiction
                 and venue, and the case was transferred to the Federal
                 District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Other
                 defendant railroads settled with Armco, leaving B&LE as the
                 only remaining defendant. On April 7, 1993, B&LE's motion to
                 dismiss the federal antitrust claims on grounds of statute of
                 limitations was granted. Subsequently, Armco refiled its
                 claims under the Ohio Valentine Act. B&LE's motions for
                 summary judgment on time bar issues and for change of venue
                 are pending, and not yet fully briefed. No discovery has been
                 taken on the merits of Armco's claims, but if Armco survives
                 the present and possibly further pretrial motions and the case
                 proceeds to trial on the merits, Armco's claimed damages are
                 likely to be substantial. Unlike MDL-587, it is USX's position
                 that the Armco case was not an excluded liability in the sale
                 of USX's transportation units to Transtar in 1988, and that
                 USX therefore is not obligated to reimburse Transtar for any
                 judgments rendered in the Armco case; however, this position
                 is being disputed by Transtar and The Blackstone Group, the   
                 ultimate owner of 52% of Transtar's outstanding shares.

26. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

                 Energy Buyers litigation
                     On December 21, 1992, an arbitrator issued an award for
                 approximately $117 million, plus interest under Ohio law,
                 against USX in Energy Buyers Service Corporation v. USX, a
                 case originally filed in the District Court of Harris County,
                 Texas. Such amount was fully accrued as of December 31, 1992.
                 On December 15, 1993, USX agreed to settle all claims in the
                 case for $95 million and deferred payments of up to $9
                 million.

                 Pickering litigation
                     On November 3, 1992, the United States District Court for
                 the District of Utah Central Division issued a Memorandum
                 Opinion and Order in Pickering v. USX relating to pension and
                 compensation claims by approximately 1,900 employees of USX's
                 former Geneva (Utah) Works. Although the court dismissed a
                 number of the claims by the plaintiffs, it found that USX had
                 violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by
                 interfering with the accrual of pension benefits of certain
                 employees and amending a benefit plan to reduce the accrual of
                 future benefits without proper notice to plan participants.
                 Further proceedings were held to determine damages and,
                 pending the court's determinations, USX may appeal.
                 Plaintiffs' counsel has been reported as estimating
                 plaintiffs' anticipated recovery to be in excess of $100
                 million. USX believes actual damages will be substantially
                 less than plaintiffs' estimates.

                 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
                     The U. S. Steel Group is subject to federal, state and
                 local laws and regulations relating to the environment.  These
                 laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into
                 the environment and require responsible parties to undertake
                 remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may
                 be imposed for noncompliance. The U. S. Steel Group provides
                 for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to
                 remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
                 reasonably determinable. Generally, the timing of these
                 accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
                 the commitment to a formal plan of action. Accrued liabilities
                 for remediation and mine reclamation totaled $151 million and
                 $142 million at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992,
                 respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the
                 ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be
                 incurred or the penalties that may be imposed.
                     For a number of years, the U. S. Steel Group has made
                 substantial capital expenditures to bring existing facilities
                 into compliance with various laws relating to the environment.
                 In 1993 and 1992, such capital expenditures totaled $53
                 million and $52 million, respectively. The U. S. Steel Group
                 anticipates making additional such expenditures in the future;
                 however, the exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are
                 uncertain because of the continuing evolution of specific
                 regulatory requirements.

                 GUARANTEES --
                     Guarantees by USX of the liabilities of affiliated
                 entities of the U. S. Steel Group totaled $209 million at
                 December 31, 1993, and $242 million at December 31, 1992. In
                 the event that any defaults of guaranteed liabilities occur,
                 USX has access to its interest in the assets of the affiliates
                 to reduce U. S. Steel Group losses resulting from these
                 guarantees. As of December 31, 1993, the largest guarantee for
                 a single affiliate was $96 million.

                 COMMITMENTS --
                     At December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992, contract
                 commitments for the U. S. Steel Group's capital expenditures
                 for property, plant and equipment totaled $105 million and $63
                 million, respectively.
                     USX has entered into a 15-year take-or-pay arrangement
                 which requires the U. S. Steel Group to accept pulverized coal
                 each month or pay a minimum monthly charge. In 1993, charges
                 for deliveries of pulverized coal which began in 1993 totaled
                 $14 million. In the future, the U. S. Steel Group will be
                 obligated to make minimum payments of approximately $16
                 million per year. If USX elects to terminate the contract
                 early, a maximum termination payment of $126 million, which
                 declines over the duration of the agreement, may be required.
                     The U. S. Steel Group is a party to a transportation
                 agreement with Transtar for Great Lakes shipments of raw
                 materials required by the U. S. Steel Group. The agreement
                 cannot be canceled until 1999 and requires the U. S.  Steel
                 Group to pay, at a minimum, Transtar's annual fixed costs
                 related to the agreement, including lease/charter costs,
                 depreciation of owned vessels, dry dock fees and other
                 administrative costs. Total transportation costs under the
                 agreement were $68 million in 1993 and $66 million in 1992,
                 including fixed costs of $21 million in each year. The fixed
                 costs are expected to continue at approximately the same level
                 over the duration of the agreement.

27. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

                 On February 2, 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
                 to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
                 reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
                 statements.

                THE U. S. STEEL GROUP
                Management's Discussion and Analysis

                     The U. S. Steel Group includes U.S. Steel, which is
                primarily engaged in the production and sale of a wide range of
                steel mill products, coke and taconite pellets. The U. S. Steel
                Group also includes the management of mineral resources,
                domestic coal mining, engineering and consulting services and
                technology licensing (together with U. S. Steel, the "Steel and
                Related Businesses"). Other businesses that are part of the 
                U.S. Steel Group include real estate development and management,
                fencing products, leasing and financing activities and a
                majority interest in a titanium metal products company.
                Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in
                conjunction with the U. S.  Steel Group's Financial Statements
                and Notes to Financial Statements.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

                     THE U. S. STEEL GROUP'S SALES increased by $693 million in
                1993 from 1992 following an increase of $55 million in 1992
                from 1991. The increase in 1993 primarily reflected an increase
                in steel shipment volumes of approximately 1.1 million tons,
                higher average steel prices and increased commercial shipments
                of taconite pellets and coke. The increase in 1992 relative to
                1991 was primarily due to significantly higher commercial
                shipments of coke, improvements in steel shipment volumes from
                ongoing operations and an improved shipment mix, partially
                offset by the absence of sales of structural products due to
                the closure of South (IL) Works early in 1992.

                     THE U. S. STEEL GROUP REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS of $149
                million in 1993 compared with an operating loss of $241 million
                in 1992 and an operating loss of $617 million in 1991. The 1993
                operating loss included a $342 million charge as a result of
                the adverse decision in the Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust
                Litigation against the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad ("B&LE
                litigation") (which also resulted in $164 million of interest
                costs) (see Note 5 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial
                Statements), and restructuring charges of $42 million related
                to the planned shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and
                preparation plant. The 1992 operating loss included a charge of
                $10 million for completion of the portion of the 1991
                restructuring plan related to steel facilities. Excluding these
                charges, operating results in 1993 improved by $466 million
                over 1992 primarily due to higher steel shipment volumes and
                prices, improved operating efficiencies and lower accruals for
                environmental and legal contingencies. In addition, 1993
                results benefitted from a $39 million favorable effect from the
                utilization of funds from previously established insurance
                reserves to pay for certain employee insurance benefits, lower
                provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and the absence of a
                1992 unfavorable effect of $28 million resulting from market
                valuation provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These
                were partially offset by higher hourly steel labor costs,
                unfavorable effects associated with pension and other employee
                benefits, lower results from coal operations and a $21 million
                increase in operating costs related to the adoption of
                Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 -
                Employers' Accounting for Post Employment Benefits ("SFAS No.
                112").

                     The operating loss in 1991 included $402 million of
                restructuring charges primarily related to the shutdown of
                certain steel facilities. Excluding the effect of this item and
                the 1992 special item previously discussed, operating results
                decreased by $16 million from 1991 to 1992. The decrease in
                1992 was primarily due to higher charges for legal
                contingencies, increased costs of $42 million related to the
                adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
                - Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
                Pensions ("SFAS No. 106"), higher depreciation charges,
                increased provisions for loan losses by USX Credit and a $28
                million unfavorable effect resulting from market valuation
                provisions for foreclosed real estate assets. These were
                partially offset by the favorable effects of savings from cost 
                reduction programs, higher utilization of raw steel and raw 
                material production capability and the absence of costs 
                incurred in 1991 related to the lack of an early labor 
                agreement with the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA").

                Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                     OTHER INCOME was $210 million in 1993 compared with $5
                million in 1992 and $9 million in 1991. The increase in 1993
                primarily resulted from higher gains from the disposal of
                assets, including the sale of the Cumberland coal mine, the
                realization of a $70 million deferred gain resulting from the
                collection of a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of
                Transtar, Inc. ("Transtar") (which also resulted in $37 million
                of interest income) and the sale of an investment in an
                insurance company. The decline in 1992 relative to 1991
                primarily resulted from the nonrecurrence of 1991's favorable
                minority interest effect related to RMI Titanium Company
                ("RMI"), partially offset by reduced losses from equity
                affiliates.

                     INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL INCOME was $59 million in
                1993. The 1993 amount included $37 million of interest income
                resulting from collection of the Transtar note. Excluding this
                item, interest and other financial income was $22 million in
                1993, compared with $18 million in 1992 and $20 million in
                1991.

                     INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS were $330 million in
                1993. The 1993 amount included $164 million of interest expense
                related to the adverse decision in the B&LE litigation.
                Excluding the effect of this item, interest and other financial
                costs were $166 million in 1993, compared to $176 million in
                1992 and $168 million in 1991. The changes over the three-year
                period primarily reflected differences in average debt levels.

                     THE CREDIT FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES in 1993 was $41
                million, compared with credits of $123 million in 1992 and $249
                million in 1991. The U. S. income tax provision for 1993
                included a $15 million favorable effect associated with an
                increase in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%,
                reflecting remeasurement of deferred federal income tax assets
                as of January 1, 1993. This benefit was offset by adjustments
                for prior years' Internal Revenue Service examinations.

                     THE U. S. STEEL GROUP GENERATED A LOSS BEFORE CUMULATIVE
                EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES of $169 million in
                1993, compared with a loss of $271 million in 1992 and a loss
                of $507 million in 1991.

                     THE UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING
                PRINCIPLES totaled $69 million in 1993 and $1,335 million in
                1992. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 112,
                determined as of January 1, 1993, decreased 1993 income of the
                U. S. Steel Group by $69 million, net of the income tax effect.
                The immediate recognition of the transition obligation
                resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 106, measured as of
                January 1, 1992, decreased the U. S. Steel Group's 1992 income
                by $1,159 million, net of the income tax effect. The cumulative
                effect of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109"),
                measured as of January 1, 1992, decreased 1992 net income by
                $176 million. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no material
                effect on the U. S. Steel Group's 1992 income tax expense.

                     THE U. S. STEEL GROUP RECORDED A NET LOSS of $238 million
                in 1993, compared with a net loss of $1,606 million in 1992 and
                a net loss of $507 million in 1991.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

                     CURRENT ASSETS at year-end 1993 increased $254 million
                from year-end 1992 primarily due to increases in receivables
                and deferred income tax benefits. The increase in receivables
                was primarily due to an increase in trade receivables as a
                result of higher steel shipment activity. The increase in
                deferred income tax benefits primarily reflected an increase in
                accruals related to the B&LE litigation. The U. S. Steel Group
                financial statements reflect current and deferred tax
                assets and liabilities that relate to tax attributes utilized
                and recognized on a consolidated basis and attributed in
                accordance with the USX Corporation ("USX") group tax
                allocation policy (see Note 3 to the U. S. Steel Group
                Financial Statements).

                     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (LESS DEPRECIATION)
                decreased $156 million from 1992. The decrease was primarily
                due to depreciation, the sale of the Cumberland coal mine and
                the writedown of Maple Creek coal mine assets in connection
                with the planned closure which, in total, exceeded capital
                expenditures.

                     PREPAID PENSION ASSETS increased $223 million from
                year-end 1992 mainly as a result of pension credits which
                primarily reflected the investment performance of defined
                benefit plan assets.

                     CURRENT LIABILITIES increased $358 million over year-end
                1992 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable,
                partially offset by a reduction in long-term debt due within
                one year. The increase in accounts payable in 1993 mainly
                reflected an increase in accruals related to the B&LE
                litigation and higher trade payables.

                     TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December 31,
                1993 was $1,551 million. The $723 million decrease from
                year-end 1992 primarily reflected cash generated from issuance
                of 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("6.50%
                Convertible Preferred") and USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock
                ("Steel Stock"), disposal of assets and operating activities,
                partially offset by capital expenditures, dividend payments and
                an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The amount of total
                long-term debt, as well as the amount shown as notes payable,
                principally represented the U. S. Steel Group's portion of USX
                debt attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of the debt
                is a direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.

                     EMPLOYEE BENEFITS liabilities increased $309 million
                compared with year-end 1992 mainly due to increases in workers'
                compensation liabilities (including the effects of the adoption
                of SFAS No. 112), retiree medical liabilities and pension
                liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in liabilities due
                to asset sale transactions.

                     DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES decreased $80
                million in 1993 mainly as a result of transfers of certain
                litigation accruals to current liabilities.

                     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $617 million at year-end 1993
                increased $370 million from the end of 1992 mainly reflecting
                the issuance of additional preferred and common equity,
                partially offset by the 1993 net loss and dividend payments.



Management's Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows

                     THE U. S. STEEL GROUP'S NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING
                ACTIVITIES in 1993 was $86 million compared with net cash used
                in operating activities of $89 million in 1992. The 1993 period
                was negatively affected by payments of $314 million related to
                partial settlement of the B&LE litigation and settlement of the
                Energy Buyers litigation.  Excluding these payments, net cash
                provided from operating activities improved by $489 million in
                1993. The increase primarily reflected improved operations and
                a $103 million favorable effect from the use of available funds
                from previously established (now depleted) insurance reserves
                to pay for certain active and retired employee insurance
                benefits.

                     The U. S. Steel Group's net cash used in operating
                activities in 1992 was $89 million compared to net cash
                generated of $9 million in 1991. The results primarily
                reflected unfavorable changes in working capital accounts
                resulting mainly from a lower settlement from the Marathon
                Group related to prior years' income taxes in accordance with
                USX's group tax allocation policy, partially offset by
                favorable effects due to changes in the amount of sold accounts
                receivable.

                     CAPITAL EXPENDITURES totaled $198 million in 1993 compared
                with $298 million in 1992 and $432 million in 1991. The
                year-to-year reductions over this period primarily reflected
                the completion of U. S. Steel's continuous cast modernization
                program, as the Gary (IN) Works caster was completed during
                1991 and the Mon Valley (PA) Works caster was completed in
                1992. In addition to spending for

                Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                the continuous caster at Mon Valley Works, significant projects
                in 1992 included modernization of the hot strip mill and the
                electrogalvanizing line at Gary Works. Contract commitments for
                capital expenditures at year-end 1993 were $105 million,
                compared with $63 million at year-end 1992. Capital
                expenditures in 1994 are expected to be approximately $260
                million and will include continued expenditures for projects
                begun in 1993 relative to environmental, hot-strip mill and
                pickle line improvements at Gary Works and initial expenditures
                for a blast furnace reline project at Mon Valley Works which is
                planned for completion in 1995. Capital expenditures in 1995
                and 1996 are currently expected to remain at about the same
                level as in 1994.

                     CASH FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS totaled $291 million in
                1993, compared with $39 million in 1992 and $26 million in
                1991. The 1993 amount primarily reflected the realization of
                proceeds from a subordinated note related to the 1988 sale of
                Transtar and the sales of the Cumberland coal mine and
                investments in an insurance company and a foreign manganese
                mining affiliate.

                     FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS decreased by $730 million in 1993,
                compared with an increase of $203 million in 1992 and an
                increase of $502 million in 1991. The decrease in 1993
                primarily reflected the use of proceeds from the issuance of
                common and preferred stock attributed to the U. S. Steel Group,
                asset sales and net cash flows from operating activities of the
                U. S. Steel Group. These obligations consist of the U. S. Steel
                Group's portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups as
                well as debt and financing agreements specifically attributed
                to the U. S. Steel Group.

                     PREFERRED STOCK ISSUED totaled $336 million in 1993. This
                amount was due to the sale of 6,900,000 shares of 6.50%
                Convertible Preferred ($50.00 liquidation preference per share)
                to the public for net proceeds of $336 million which were
                reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
                statements. The 6.50% Convertible Preferred is convertible at
                any time into shares of Steel Stock at a conversion price of
                $46.125 per share of Steel Stock.

                     STEEL STOCK ISSUED totaled $366 million in 1993. This
                amount was mainly due to the sale of 10,000,000 shares of Steel
                Stock to the public for net proceeds of $350 million, which
                were reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group
                financial statements. The increase in 1992 primarily reflected
                the sale of 8,050,000 shares of Steel Stock to the public for
                net proceeds of $198 million, which were reflected in their
                entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.

                     In February 1994, USX sold 5,000,000 shares of Steel Stock
                to the public for net proceeds of $201 million, which will be
                reflected in their entirety in the U. S. Steel Group financial
                statements.

                     DIVIDEND PAYMENTS increased in 1993 primarily as a result
                of higher dividends due to the sale of additional shares of
                Steel Stock and of the 6.50% Convertible Preferred mentioned
                above. Dividends attributed to the Steel Stock prior to
                September 10, 1991 were based upon the relationship of the
                initial dividends of the Steel Stock and the USX-Marathon Group
                Common Stock. The annualized rate of dividends per share for
                the Steel Stock based on the most recently declared quarterly
                dividend is $1.00.

                     In September 1993, Standard & Poor's Corp. ("S&P")
                lowered its ratings on USX's and Marathon Oil Company's
                ("Marathon") senior debt to below investment grade (from BBB-
                to BB+) and on USX's subordinated debt, preferred stock and
                commercial paper. S&P cited extremely aggressive financial
                leverage, burdensome retiree medical liabilities and litigation
                contingencies. In October 1993, Moody's Investors Services,
                Inc. ("Moody's") confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on
                USX's and Marathon's senior debt.  Moody's also confirmed its
                ratings on USX's subordinated debt and commercial paper, but
                lowered its ratings on USX's preferred stock from ba1 to ba2.
                Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on USX debt
                securities reflected confidence in the expected performance of
                USX during the intermediate term, while the downward revision
                of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a narrow fixed
                charge coverage going forward. The downgrades by S&P and the
                downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by Moody's could
                increase USX's cost of capital. Any related increase in
                interest costs would be reflected in the consolidated financial
                statements and the financial statements of each group.

                Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                     As a result of the settlement of LTV Steel Corp.'s ("LTV")
                portion of the B&LE litigation, USX is obligated to pay an
                additional $175 million to LTV in the first quarter of 1994. In
                addition, approximately $210 million in judgments for other
                plaintiffs in the B&LE litigation are due for payment in the
                first quarter of 1994. See Note 26 to the U. S. Steel Group
                Financial Statements.

                     USX anticipates that it will begin funding the U. S. Steel
                Group's pension plan for approximately $100 million per year
                commencing with the 1994 plan year. The funding for both the
                1994 and 1995 plan years will impact cash flows in 1995.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

                     The U. S. Steel Group has incurred and will continue to
                incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and
                remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and
                regulations. In recent years, these expenditures have been
                mainly for process changes in order to meet Clean Air Act
                obligations, although ongoing compliance costs have also been
                significant. To the extent these expenditures, as with all
                costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of the U. S.
                Steel Group's products and services, operating results will be
                adversely affected. The U. S. Steel Group believes that all of
                its domestic competitors are subject to similar environmental
                laws and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each
                competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including
                the age and location of their operating facilities and their
                production methods.

                     The U. S. Steel Group's environmental expenditures for
                1993 and 1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based
                on U. S. Department of Commerce ("USDC") survey guidelines.
                These guidelines are subject to differing interpretations which
                could affect the comparability of such data. Some environmental
                related expenditures, while benefitting the environment, also
                enhance operating efficiencies.

                     Total environmental expenditures for the U. S. Steel Group
                in 1993 were $240 million compared with $220 million in 1992.
                These amounts consisted of capital expenditures of $53 million
                in 1993 and $52 million in 1992 and estimated compliance
                expenditures (including operating and maintenance) of $187
                million in 1993 and $168 million in 1992. Compliance
                expenditures were broadly estimated based on USDC survey
                guidelines and represented 3% of the U. S. Steel Group's total
                operating costs in both 1993 and 1992.

                     USX has been notified that it is a potentially responsible
                party ("PRP") at 41 waste sites related to the U. S. Steel
                Group under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
                Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as of December 31,
                1993. In addition, there are 28 sites related to the U. S.
                Steel Group where USX has received information requests or
                other indications that USX may be a PRP under CERCLA but where
                sufficient information is not presently available to confirm
                the existence of liability or make any judgment as to the
                amount thereof. There are also 10 additional sites related to
                the U. S. Steel Group where state governmental agencies or
                private parties are seeking remediation under state
                environmental laws through discussions or litigation. At many
                of these sites, USX is one of a number of parties involved and
                the total cost of remediation, as well as USX's share thereof,
                is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and
                remedial studies.

                     Total environmental expenditures included remediation
                related expenditures estimated at $19 million in 1993 and $11
                million in 1992. Remediation spending was mainly related to
                dismantlement and restoration activities at former and present
                operating locations. The U. S. Steel Group accrues for
                environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to
                remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is
                reasonably determinable. As environmental remediation matters
                proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation
                obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously
                accrued may be required. See Note 26 to the U. S. Steel Group
                Financial Statements.

                     New or expanded requirements for environmental
                regulations, which could increase the U. S. Steel Group's
                environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX intends to
                comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment,
                but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable
                (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future
                legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict the
                ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs which
                may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed. However,
                based on presently available information, and existing laws and
                regulations as currently implemented, the U. S. Steel Group
                does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures
                will materially increase in 1994. The U. S. Steel Group's
                capital expenditures for environmental controls are expected to
                be approximately $70 million in 1994, including the expected
                completion of major air quality projects at Gary Works.
                Predictions beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which
                have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
                evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible
                imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability
                of new technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently
                identified projects, the U. S. Steel Group anticipates that
                environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $25
                million in 1995; however, actual expenditures may increase as
                additional projects are identified or additional requirements
                are imposed.

                     USX is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
                threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
                relating to the U. S. Steel Group involving a variety of
                matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
                environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 26 to the
                U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution
                of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                be material to the U. S. Steel Group financial statements.
                However, management believes that USX will remain a viable and
                competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
                contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the U.S. Steel
                Group. See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and
                Analysis of Cash Flows.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 -
                Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan ("SFAS No.
                114") requires impairment of loans based on either the sum of
                discounted cash flows or the fair value of underlying
                collateral. USX expects to adopt SFAS No. 114 in the first
                quarter of 1995. Based on preliminary estimates, USX believes
                the unfavorable effect on the U. S. Steel Group of adopting
                SFAS No. 114 will be less than $2 million.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS
 
                     The U. S. Steel Group reported an operating loss of $149
                million in 1993 compared with operating losses of $241 million
                in 1992 and $617 million in 1991. The operating loss for 1993
                included a $342 million charge as a result of the adverse
                decision in the B&LE litigation. The 1993, 1992, and 1991
                operating losses included restructuring charges of $42 million,
                $10 million, and $402 million, respectively, which are
                discussed below.

                *Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to 1993
                classifications.

                     Steel and Related Businesses recorded operating income of
                $123 million in 1993 compared with a loss of $140 million in
                1992 and a loss of $235 million in 1991. The improvement in
                1993 over 1992 was predominantly due to higher steel shipment
                volumes and prices, improved operating efficiencies and lower
                accruals for environmental and legal contingencies. In
                addition, 1993 results benefitted from a $39 million favorable
                effect from the utilization of funds from previously
                established insurance reserves to pay for certain employee
                insurance benefits. These positive factors were partially
                offset by higher hourly steel labor costs, unfavorable effects
                associated with pension and other employee benefits, lower
                results from coal operations and a $21 million increase in
                operating costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 112.

                     The improvement in 1992 compared with 1991 was primarily
                due to savings from cost reduction programs, higher utilization
                of raw steel and raw material capability and the absence of
                costs incurred in 1991 due to the lack of an early labor
                settlement with the USWA. These were partially offset by an
                increase in post retirement benefit costs in connection with
                the adoption of SFAS No. 106, higher depreciation charges and
                start-up costs for the Mon Valley Works continuous caster.

                     Average realized steel prices improved $8 per ton in 1993
                after virtually no change in 1992.

                     Steel shipments were just under 10 million tons in 1993, 
                an increase of 1.1 million tons over 1992. Shipments in 1992 
                were basically flat with the 1991 level. U. S. Steel Group 
                shipments comprised approximately 11% of the domestic steel 
                market in each of the three years. Exports accounted for 4% of
                U. S. Steel Group shipments in 1993, compared with 7% in 1992
                and 15% in 1991.

                     Raw steel production was 11.3 million tons in 1993,
                compared with 10.4 million tons in 1992 and 10.5 million tons
                in 1991. Raw steel produced was nearly 100% continuous cast in
                1993, versus 83% in 1992 and 67% in 1991. U. S. Steel
                completed its continuous cast modernization program in 1992
                with the start-up of the Mon Valley Works continuous caster in
                August 1992. Raw steel production averaged 96% of capability in
                1993 compared with 86% of capability in 1992 and 70% of
                capability in 1991.

                     Other Businesses recorded an operating loss of $29 million
                in 1993, compared with operating losses of $96 million in 1992
                and $30 million in 1991. The improvement in 1993 of $67 million
                and the decrease in 1992 of $66 million primarily reflected a
                $28 million charge in 1992 resulting from market valuation
                provisions for foreclosed real estate assets and higher
                provisions in 1992 for loan losses by USX Credit. Loan loss
                provisions were $11 million in 1993, $42 million in 1992 and
                $14 million in 1991. USX Credit is not actively making new loan
                commitments. Excluding loan loss provisions, the balance of the
                operating losses for Other Businesses during the three-year
                period was largely due to the effect of depressed titanium
                markets on RMI's results.

                     Other Administrative includes the portion of pension
                credits, postretirement benefit costs and certain other
                expenses principally attributable to former business units of
                the U. S. Steel Group as well as USX corporate general and
                administrative costs allocated to the U. S. Steel Group.
                Operating income from Other Administrative was $141 million in
                1993 compared to $5 million in 1992 and $50 million in 1991.
                The 1993 increase resulted mainly from the absence of a charge
                incurred in 1992 to cover the amount of the award in the Energy
                Buyers litigation, and a credit in 1993 due to settlement

                of all claims in the case (see Note 26 to the U. S. Steel
                Group Financial Statements). The decrease from 1991 to 1992
                primarily reflected the 1992 charge related to the Energy
                Buyers litigation, partially offset by a decrease in
                postretirement benefit costs charged to Other Administrative in
                connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 106.

                     The U. S. Steel Group's 1993 operating loss also included
                restructuring charges of $42 million related to the planned
                shutdown of the Maple Creek coal mine and preparation plant.
                The 1992 loss included a charge of $10 million for completion
                of the portion of the 1991 restructuring plan related to steel
                facilities. The 1991 loss included $402 million of
                restructuring charges primarily related to the closing of the
                iron and steel producing, slab and hot strip mill and pipe mill
                facilities at Fairless (PA) Works; all facilities at South
                Works; RMI's sodium and sponge production facilities; a
                previously idled plate mill in Baytown, Texas; and
                miscellaneous other facilities.

                     The U. S. Steel Group's 1993 operating income was reduced
                by a total of $21 million due to the adoption of SFAS No. 112.
                Operating income in 1992 compared to 1991 was reduced by a
                total of $42 million due to the adoption of SFAS No. 106.

                     The pension credits referred to in Other Administrative,
                combined with pension costs for ongoing operating units of the
                U. S. Steel Group, resulted in net pension credits (which are
                primarily noncash) of $202 million, $231 million and $196
                million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The decrease in
                1993 from 1992 was primarily due to a lower assumed long-term
                rate of return on plan assets. The increase in 1992 from 1991
                primarily reflected recognition of the 1991 growth in plan
                assets. In 1994, net pension credits are expected to decline by
                approximately $85 million primarily due to a further reduction
                in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets. See
                Note 10 to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements.

                     The domestic steel industry has been adversely affected by
                unfairly traded imports. Steel imports to the United States
                accounted for an estimated 19% of the domestic steel market
                in 1993, and for an estimated 22% in the fourth quarter. Steel
                imports to the United States accounted for an estimated 17% to
                18% of the domestic steel market in 1992 and 1991. On March 31,
                1992, Voluntary Restraint Agreements restricting the level of
                steel imports to the United States expired, and in June 1992,
                in conjunction with other domestic steel firms, USX filed a
                number of antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the 
                USDC and the International Trade Commission ("ITC") against 
                unfairly traded imported carbon flat rolled steel. Beginning 
                in late 1992, as a result of affirmative preliminary 
                determinations by both the ITC and the USDC in the vast 
                majority of cases, provisional duties were imposed on the 
                imported steel products under investigation. On June 22, 1993, 
                the USDC issued the final determinations of subsidization in 
                the countervailing duty cases and final margins for sales 
                at less than fair value in the antidumping cases.
                
                     On July 27, 1993, the ITC issued affirmative
                determinations of material injury to the domestic steel
                industry by reason of imports in cases representing an
                estimated 51% of dollar value and 42% of the volume of all
                flat-rolled carbon steel imports under investigation.
                Affirmative determinations were found in cases relating to 37%
                of such volume of cold-rolled steel, 92% of such volume of the
                higher value-added corrosion resistant steel and 97% of such
                volume of plate steel. Negative determinations were found in
                all cases related to hot-rolled steel, the largest import
                market.

                     In those cases where negative determinations were made by
                the ITC, provisional duties imposed on imports covered by the
                cases were removed and final remedial duties were not imposed.
                While USX is unable to predict the effect these negative
                determinations may have on the business or results of
                operations of the U. S. Steel Group, they may result in
                increasing levels of imported steel and may adversely affect
                some product prices. As discussed above, steel imports to the
                United States have increased in recent months.

<PAGE>   165
                Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                     Although the affirmative determinations are helpful in
                offsetting the harm to the U.S. steel industry caused by
                subsidized and dumped imports, USX believes that certain of the
                negative determinations were improper and, together with other
                steel firms, has appealed such determinations to the U.S. Court
                of International Trade and, in certain cases involving imports
                from Canada, to a bi-national panel in accordance with the
                Canadian Free Trade Agreement.  Several of the affirmative
                determinations similarly have been challenged in appeals filed
                by foreign steel producers.

                     USX will file additional antidumping and countervailing
                duty petitions if unfairly traded imports adversely impact, or
                threaten to adversely impact, the results of the U. S. Steel
                Group.

                     The U. S. Steel Group depreciates steel assets by
                modifying straight-line depreciation based on the level of
                production. Depreciation charges for 1993 were 100% of
                straight-line depreciation based on production levels for the
                year. Depreciation charges for 1992 and 1991 approximated 91%
                and 89% of the amounts that would have been reported if
                production levels had not been considered. In 1992, the U. S.
                Steel Group revised the modification factors used in the
                depreciation of steel assets to reflect that raw steel
                production capability is entirely continuous cast (see Note 2
                to the U. S. Steel Group Financial Statements).


OUTLOOK FOR 1994

                     Based on strong recent order levels and assuming a
                continuing recovery of the U. S. economy, the U. S. Steel 
                Group anticipates that steel demand will remain strong in
                1994. The U. S. Steel Group believes that domestic industry
                shipments will reach 89 to 90 million tons in 1994 as compared
                to approximately 88 million tons in 1993.  Price increases on
                sheet products have been announced effective January 2 and July
                3, 1994. Price increases on certain other products have also
                been announced. Although early indications suggest that the
                January price increase is holding, full realization of the 
                price increases will be dependent upon steel demand and the 
                level of imports. As previously discussed, steel imports to 
                the United States have increased in recent months.

                     U. S. Steel entered into a new five and one-half year
                contract with the USWA, effective February 1, 1994, covering
                approximately 15,000 employees. The agreement will result in
                higher labor and benefit costs for the U. S. Steel Group each
                year throughout the term of the agreement. The agreement
                includes a signing bonus of $1,000 per USWA represented
                employee that will be paid in the first quarter of 1994, $500
                of which represents the final bonus payable under the previous
                contract. The agreement also provides for the establishment of
                a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust to prefund
                health care and life insurance benefits for retirees covered
                under the agreement. Minimum contributions, in the form of USX
                stock or cash, are expected to be $25 million in 1994 and 
                $10 million per year thereafter. The funding of the trust 
                will have no direct effect on income of the U. S. Steel
                Group. Management believes that this agreement is competitive
                with labor agreements reached by U. S. Steel's major domestic
                integrated competitors and thus does not believe that U. S.
                Steel's competitive position with regard to such other
                competitors will be materially affected by its ratification.

                     Severe cold and extreme winter weather conditions
                disrupted steel and raw materials operations and caused forced
                utility curtailments at Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and
                Fairless Works in January 1994. These events will have some
                negative effects on operations in the first quarter of 1994.

                     Net pension credits for the U. S. Steel Group in 1994 are
                expected to decline by approximately $85 million primarily due
                to a lower assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Explanatory Note Regarding Financial Information


Although the financial statements of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and
the U. S. Steel Group separately report the assets, liabilities (including
contingent liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed to each such
group, such attribution does not affect legal title to such assets and
responsibility for such liabilities. Holders of USX-Delhi Group Common Stock,
USX-Marathon Group Common Stock and USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock are
holders of common stock of USX and continue to be subject to all the risks
associated with an investment in USX and all of its businesses and liabilities.
Financial impacts arising from any of the Delhi Group, the Marathonl Group or
the U. S. Steel Group which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could
affect the results of operations and financial condition of all groups. In
addition, net losses of any group, as well as dividends or distributions on any
class of USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases of any
class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the
funds of USX legally available for payment of dividends on all classes of USX
common stock. Accordingly, the USX consolidated financial information should be
read in connection with the Delhi Group financial information.

Management's Report

The accompanying financial statements of the Delhi Group are the responsibility
of and have been prepared by USX Corporation (USX) in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. They necessarily include some amounts that are
based on best judgments and estimates. The Delhi Group financial information
displayed in other sections of this report is consistent with that in these
financial statements.
         USX seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial
records by careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements
that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by communications
programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood
throughout the organization.
         USX has a comprehensive formalized system of internal accounting
controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
and that financial records are reliable. Appropriate management monitors the
system for compliance, and the internal auditors independently measure its
effectiveness and recommend possible improvements thereto. In addition, as part
of their audit of the financial statements, USX's independent accountants, who
are elected by the stockholders, review and test the internal accounting
controls selectively to establish a basis of reliance thereon in determining
the nature, extent and timing of audit tests to be applied.
         The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of
financial reporting and internal accounting control through its Audit
Committee. This Committee, composed solely of nonmanagement directors,
regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent accountants,
management and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of its
responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls and the consolidated
and group financial statements.

Report of Independent Accountants                                   

To the Stockholders of USX Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements appearing on pages D-4
through D-18 and as listed in Item 14.A.2 on page 61 of this report 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Delhi Group at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of USX's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.
     As discussed in Note 10, page D-12, in 1992 USX adopted a new accounting
standard for income taxes.  
     The Delhi Group is a business unit of USX Corporation (as described in 
Note 1, page D-7); accordingly, the financial statements of the Delhi Group 
should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of USX 
Corporation and Subsidiary Companies.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

                       On October 2, 1992, USX Corporation (USX) publicly sold
                       9,000,000 shares of a new class of common stock, USX --
                       Delhi Group Common Stock (Delhi Stock), which is
                       intended to reflect the performance of the Delhi Group.
                       As a result, USX has three classes of common stock, the
                       others being USX -- Marathon Group Common Stock
                       (Marathon Stock) and USX -- U. S. Steel Group Common
                       Stock (Steel Stock), which are intended to reflect the
                       performance of the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
                       Group, respectively. The Delhi Group includes the
                       businesses of the Delhi Gas Pipeline Corporation (DGP)
                       and certain other subsidiaries of USX. The Delhi Group
                       is engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing,
                       transporting and marketing of natural gas.
                          The financial data for the periods presented prior to
                       October 2, 1992, reflected the combined historical
                       financial position, results of operations and cash flows
                       for the businesses of the Delhi Group which were
                       included in the financial statements of the Marathon
                       Group. Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial
                       statements of the Delhi Group include the financial
                       position, results of operations and cash flows for the
                       businesses of the Delhi Group; the effects of the
                       capital structure of the Delhi Group determined by the
                       Board of Directors in accordance with the USX
                       Certificate of Incorporation; and a portion of the
                       corporate assets and liabilities and related
                       transactions which are not separately identified with
                       ongoing operating units of USX. Pro forma data is
                       reported for the years 1992 and 1991 to reflect the
                       results of operations as if the capital structure of the
                       Delhi Group were in effect beginning January 1, 1991
                       (Note 23, page D-18).  The Delhi Group financial
                       statements are prepared using the amounts included in
                       the USX consolidated financial statements.
                          The USX Board of Directors initially designated
                       14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock as the total number of
                       shares of Delhi Stock which it deemed to represent 100%
                       of the common stockholders' equity value of USX
                       attributable to the Delhi Group. The Delhi Fraction is
                       the percentage interest in the Delhi Group represented
                       by the shares of Delhi Stock that are outstanding at any
                       particular time and, based on 9,282,870 outstanding
                       shares at December 31, 1993, is approximately 66%. The
                       Marathon Group financial statements reflect a percentage
                       interest in the Delhi Group of approximately 34%
                       (Retained Interest) at December 31, 1993. The Retained
                       Interest is subject to reduction as shares of Delhi
                       stock attributed to the Retained Interest are sold. (See
                       Note 3, page D-9, for a description of common stock
                       transactions.)
                          During 1993, 1992 and 1991 sales to one customer who
                       accounted for 10 percent or more of the Delhi Group's
                       total revenues totaled $76.4 million, $55.4 million and
                       $59.2 million, respectively. In addition, sales to
                       several customers having a common parent aggregated
                       $66.3 million, $63.2 million and $53.7 million during
                       1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.
                          Although the financial statements of the Delhi Group,
                       the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group separately
                       report the assets, liabilities (including contingent
                       liabilities) and stockholders' equity of USX attributed
                       to each such group, such attribution does not affect
                       legal title to such assets and responsibility for such
                       liabilities. Holders of Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and
                       Steel Stock are holders of common stock of USX and
                       continue to be subject to all the risks associated with
                       an investment in USX  and all of its businesses and
                       liabilities. Financial impacts arising from any of the
                       Delhi Group, the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel Group
                       which affect the overall cost of USX's capital could
                       affect the results of operations and financial condition
                       of all groups. In addition, net losses of any group, as
                       well as dividends or distributions on any class of USX
                       common stock or series of Preferred Stock and
                       repurchases of any class of USX common stock or certain
                       series of Preferred Stock, will reduce the funds of USX
                       legally available for payment of dividends on all
                       classes of USX common stock. Accordingly, the USX
                       consolidated financial information should be read in
                       connection with the Delhi Group financial information.

2. SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

                       PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN CONSOLIDATION -- These financial
                       statements include the accounts of the businesses
                       comprising the Delhi Group. Beginning October 2, 1992,
                       the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
                       Group financial statements, taken together, comprise all
                       of the accounts included in the USX consolidated
                       financial statements.
                          Investments in jointly owned gas processing plants 
                       are accounted for on a pro rata basis.                





                                      D-7
<PAGE>   173
                          Investments in other entities in which the Delhi
                       Group has significant influence in management and
                       control are accounted for using the equity method of
                       accounting and are carried in the investment account at
                       the Delhi Group's share of net assets plus advances. The
                       proportionate share of income from equity investments is
                       included in other income.
                          Investments in marketable equity securities are 
                       carried at lower of cost or market.
                                                  
                       CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents
                       includes cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid
                       debt instruments with maturities generally of three
                       months or less.

                       INVENTORIES -- Inventories are carried at lower of
                       average cost or market.

                       HEDGING TRANSACTIONS -- The Delhi Group enters into
                       futures contracts to hedge exposure to price
                       fluctuations relevant to the purchase or sale of natural
                       gas. Such transactions are accounted for as part of the
                       commodity being hedged.

                       PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Depreciation is
                       generally computed on a straight-line method based upon
                       estimated lives of assets.
                          When an entire pipeline system, plant, major facility
                       or facilities depreciated on an individual basis are
                       sold or otherwise disposed of, any gain or loss is
                       reflected in income. Proceeds from disposal of other
                       facilities depreciated on a group basis are credited to
                       the depreciation reserve with no immediate effect on
                       income.

                       INSURANCE -- The Delhi Group is insured for catastrophic
                       casualty and certain property exposures, as well as
                       those risks required to be insured by law or contract.
                       Costs resulting from noninsured losses are charged
                       against income upon occurrence.

3. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

                       Beginning October 2, 1992, the following corporate
                       activities were reflected in the Delhi Group financial
                       statements.

                       FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES -- As a matter of policy, USX
                       manages most financial activities on a centralized,
                       consolidated basis. Such financial activities include
                       the investment of surplus cash; the issuance, repayment
                       and repurchase of short-term and long-term debt; the
                       issuance, repurchase and redemption of preferred stock;
                       and the issuance and repurchase of common stock. The
                       initial capital structure of the Delhi Group determined
                       by the Board of Directors pursuant to the USX
                       Certificate of Incorporation as of June 30, 1992,
                       reflects the Delhi Group's portion of USX's financial
                       activities attributed to each of the three groups.
                       Subsequent to June 30, 1992, transactions related
                       primarily to invested cash, short-term and long-term
                       debt (including convertible debt), related net interest
                       and other financial costs, and preferred stock and
                       related dividends are attributed to the Delhi Group, as
                       well as to the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group,
                       based upon the cash flows of each group for the periods
                       presented. Most financing transactions are attributed to
                       and reflected in the financial statements of all three
                       groups. See Note 4, page D-9, for the Delhi Group's
                       portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
                       three groups. However, certain transactions such as
                       leases, production payment financings, financial
                       activities of consolidated entities which are less than
                       wholly owned by USX and transactions related to
                       securities convertible solely into any one class of
                       common stock are or will be specifically attributed to
                       and reflected in their entirety in the financial
                       statements of the group to which they relate.

                       CORPORATE GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS -- Corporate
                       general and administrative costs are allocated to the
                       Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
                       Group based upon utilization or other methods management
                       believes to be reasonable and which consider certain
                       measures of business activities, such as employment,
                       investments and sales. Such costs were also reflected in
                       the historical financial data of the businesses of the
                       Delhi Group. The costs allocated to the Delhi Group were
                       $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $2.4 million in 1993,
                       1992 and 1991, respectively, and primarily consist of
                       employment costs including pension effects,
                       professional services, facilities and other related
                       costs associated with corporate activities.

                       COMMON STOCK TRANSACTIONS -- The proceeds from issuances
                       of Delhi Stock representing shares attributable to the
                       Retained Interest will be reflected in the financial
                       statements of the Marathon Group (Note 1, page D-7).
                       All proceeds from issuances of additional shares of
                       Delhi Stock not deemed to represent the Retained
                       Interest will be reflected in their entirety in the
                       financial statements of the Delhi Group. When a dividend
                       or other distribution is paid or distributed in respect
                       to the outstanding Delhi Stock, or any amount paid to
                       repurchase shares of Delhi Stock generally, the Marathon
                       Group financial statements are credited, and the Delhi
                       Group financial statements are charged, with the
                       aggregate transaction amount times the quotient of the
                       Retained Interest divided by the Delhi Fraction.

                       INCOME TAXES -- All members of the USX affiliated group
                       are included in the consolidated United States federal
                       income tax return filed by USX. Accordingly, the
                       provision for federal income taxes and the related
                       payments or refunds of tax are determined on a
                       consolidated basis. The consolidated provision and the
                       related tax payments or refunds will be reflected in the
                       Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel
                       Group financial statements in accordance with USX's tax
                       allocation policy. In general, such policy provides that
                       the consolidated tax provision and related tax payments
                       or refunds are allocated among the Delhi Group, the
                       Marathon Group and the U. S. Steel Group, for financial
                       statement purposes, based principally upon the financial
                       income, taxable income, credits, preferences and other
                       amounts directly related to the respective groups.
                          For tax provision and settlement purposes, tax
                       benefits resulting from attributes (principally net
                       operating losses), which cannot be utilized by one of
                       the three groups on a separate return basis but which
                       can be utilized on a consolidated basis in that year or
                       in a carryback year, are allocated to the group that
                       generated the attributes. However, if such tax benefits
                       cannot be utilized on a consolidated basis in that year
                       or in a carryback year, the prior years' allocation of
                       such consolidated tax effects is adjusted in a
                       subsequent year to the extent necessary to allocate the
                       tax benefits to the group that would have realized the
                       tax benefits on a separate return basis.
                          The allocated group amounts of taxes payable or
                       refundable are not necessarily comparable to those that
                       would have resulted if the groups had filed separate
                       returns; however, such allocation should not result in
                       any of the three groups paying more taxes over time than
                       it would if it filed separate tax returns and, in
                       certain situations, could result in any of the three
                       groups paying less.

4. FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ATTRIBUTED TO ALL THREE GROUPS

                       As described in Note 3, page D-8, the Delhi Group's
                       portion of USX's financial activities attributed to all
                       groups based on their respective cash flows is as
                       follows:

                16, page D-14, for sales of Delhi Group receivables to the
                Marathon Group.

                PAYABLE TO THE U. S. STEEL GROUP -- These amounts represent
                payables to the U. S. Steel Group for income taxes determined
                in accordance with the tax allocation policy described in Note
                3, page D-9. Tax settlements between the groups are generally

9. PENSIONS
                The Delhi Group has a noncontributory defined benefit plans
                covering all employees over 21 years of age who have one or
                more years of continuous service. Benefits are based primarily
                on years of service and compensation during the later years of
                employment. The funding policy for the plan provides that
                payments to the pension trust shall be equal to the minimum
                funding requirements of ERISA plus such additional amounts as
                may be approved from time to time. The plan also provides
                benefits to certain employees of the Marathon Group which are
                not part of the Delhi Group.

                PENSION COST (CREDIT) -- The defined benefit cost was
                determined assuming an expected long-term rate of return on
                plan assets of 10% for 1993 and 11% for 1992 and 1991.

                PENSION CURTAILMENTS -- In addition to the periodic pension
                credit, a curtailment gain of $1.2 million resulted in 1991
                from the reduction in plan participants due to terminations or
                transfers to affiliated plans of employees which were not part
                of the Delhi Group.

10. INCOME TAXES

                Income tax provisions and related assets and liabilities 
                attributed to the Delhi Group are determined in accordance 
                with the USX group tax allocation policy (Note 3, page D-9).
                     In 1992, USX adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
                109), which requires an asset and liability approach in
                accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income
                tax assets and liabilities are established to reflect the
                future tax consequences of carryforwards and differences
                between the tax bases and financial bases of assets and
                liabilities. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
                principle determined as of January 1, 1992, increased net
                income $17.9 million.

                     The Delhi Group leases a wide variety of facilities and
                equipment under operating leases, including building space,
                office equipment and production equipment. Contingent rental
                includes payments for the lease of a pipeline system owned by
                an affiliate; payments to the lessor are based on the volume of
                gas transported through the pipeline system less certain
                operating expenses. Most long-term leases include renewal
                options and, in certain leases, purchase options.

                     The Delhi Group leases the Shackelford gas gathering
                system and an associated processing plant to a third party for
                $.1 million per year. The leases continue until June 30, 1998,
                and, if not terminated by either party, continue on a
                year-to-year basis thereafter. The leased facilities had a net
                book value of $4.1 million at December 31, 1993, which will be
                fully depreciated by the end of the lease term.

16. SALES OF RECEIVABLES

                Certain of the Delhi Group accounts receivables are sold in
                combination with the Marathon Group receivables under a limited
                recourse agreement. Payments are collected from the sold
                accounts receivable; the collections are reinvested in new
                accounts receivable for the buyers; and a yield, based on
                short-term market rates, is transferred to the buyers.
                Collections on sold accounts receivable will be forwarded to
                the buyers at the end of the agreement in 1995, in the event of
                earlier contract termination or if the Delhi Group does not
                have a sufficient quantity of eligible accounts receivable to
                reinvest in for the buyers. The balance of sold accounts
                receivable averaged $69.1 million, $56.9 million and $55.4
                million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. At
                December 31, 1993, the balance of the Delhi Group's sold
                accounts receivable that had not been collected was $73.6
                million. A substantial portion of the Delhi Group's sales are
                to local distribution companies and electric utilities. This
                could impact the Delhi Group's overall exposure to credit risk
                inasmuch as these customers could be affected by similar
                economic or other conditions. The Delhi Group does not
                generally require collateral for accounts receivable, but
                significantly reduces credit risk through credit extension and
                collection policies, which include analyzing the financial
                condition of potential customers, establishing credit limits,
                monitoring payments and aggressively pursuing delinquent
                accounts.  In the event of a change in control of USX, as
                defined in the agreement, the Delhi Group may be required to
                forward payments collected on sold Delhi Group accounts
                receivable to the buyers.

                (a)  Transactions with USX included cash management, intergroup
                     sales and purchases (Note 8, page D-11), settlement of
                     federal income taxes with USX (Note 3, page D-9) and
                     allocation of corporate general and administrative costs
                     (Note 3, page D-8). Cash management reflected net
                     distributions to USX of $65.5 million and $141.9 million
                     in 1992, and 1991, respectively.

                (b)  Pursuant to the USX Certificate of Incorporation and the
                     capital structure of the Delhi Group determined by the
                     Board of Directors, the USX equity investment in the Delhi
                     Group was eliminated on October 2, 1992, in conjunction
                     with the attribution of the Delhi Group's portion of USX's
                     financial activities attributed to all groups (Note 3,
                     page D-8) and the USX common stockholders' equity value,
                     attributed to the 14,000,000 shares of Delhi Stock deemed
                     to represent 100% of the initial common stockholders'
                     equity in the Delhi Group.

18. DIVIDENDS

                In accordance with the USX Certificate of Incorporation,
                dividends on the Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and Steel Stock
                are limited to the legally available funds of USX. Net losses
                of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group or the U. S. Steel
                Group, as well as dividends or distributions on any class of
                USX common stock or series of Preferred Stock and repurchases
                of any class of USX common stock or certain series of Preferred
                Stock, will reduce the funds of USX legally available for
                payment of dividends on all classes of USX common stock.
                Subject to this limitation, the Board of Directors intends to
                declare and pay dividends on the Delhi Stock based on the
                financial condition and results of operations of the Delhi
                Group, although it has no obligation under Delaware Law to do
                so. In making its dividend decisions with respect to Delhi
                Stock, the Board of Directors considers among other things, the
                long-term earnings and cash flow capabilities of the Delhi
                Group as well as the dividend policies of similar publicly
                traded companies.


                     Dividends on the Delhi Stock are further limited to the
                Available Delhi Dividend Amount.  At December 31, 1993, the
                Available Delhi Dividend Amount was at least $125.2 million.
                The Available Delhi Dividend Amount will be increased or
                decreased, as appropriate, to reflect Delhi Net Income,
                dividends, repurchases or issuances with respect to the Delhi
                Stock and preferred stock attributed to the Delhi Group and
                certain other items.

19. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

                The method of calculating net income (loss) per share for the
                Delhi Stock, Marathon Stock and Steel Stock reflects the USX
                Board of Director's intent that the separately reported
                earnings and surplus of the Delhi Group, the Marathon Group and
                the U. S. Steel Group, as determined consistent with the USX
                Certificate of Incorporation, are available for payment of
                dividends to the respective classes of stock, although legally
                available funds and liquidation preferences of these classes of
                stock do not necessarily correspond with these amounts.
                     Net income per share applicable to outstanding Delhi Stock
                is presented for periods subsequent to the October 2, 1992,
                initial issuance of Delhi Stock. (See Note 23, page D-18, for
                pro forma income per common share.)
                     Primary net income per share is calculated by adjusting
                net income for dividend requirements of preferred stock and
                income applicable to the Retained Interest and is based on the
                weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
                common stock equivalents, provided they are not antidilutive.
                Common stock equivalents result from assumed exercise of stock
                options and surrender of stock appreciation rights associated
                with stock options, where applicable.
                     Fully diluted net income (loss) per share assumes exercise
                of stock options and surrender of stock appreciation rights,
                provided, in each case, the effect is not antidilutive.

20. STOCK PLANS AND STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 

                USX Stock Plans and Stockholder Rights Plan are discussed in
                Note 20, page U-22, and Note 24, page U-24, respectively, to
                the USX consolidated financial statements.

21. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

                Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not
                necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized
                or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax
                consequences of realization or settlement.  As described in
                Note 3, page D-8, the Delhi Group's specifically attributed
                financial instruments and the Delhi Group's portion of USX's
                financial instruments attributed to all groups are as follows:

                short-term maturity of the instruments. Fair value of long-term
                receivables and other investments was based on discounted cash
                flows or other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of
                long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where
                available or current borrowing rates available for financings
                with similar terms and maturities.
                     The Delhi Group's unrecognized financial instruments
                consist of accounts receivables sold subject to limited
                recourse. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of
                this form of financial instrument obligation. For details
                relating to sales of receivables see Note 16, page D-14.

22. CONTINGENCIES

                USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or
                threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
                relating to the Delhi Group involving a variety of matters,
                including laws and regulations relating to the environment.
                Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate
                resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the
                aggregate, be material to the Delhi Group financial statements.
                However, management believes that USX will remain a viable and
                competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
                contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Delhi Group.

                SWEPCO litigation --
                     On January 26, 1994, a settlement agreement was executed
                between Delhi and Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO),
                resolving litigation which began in 1991 related to a 15-year
                natural gas purchase contract (original contract) which was due
                to expire in April 1995. The settlement agreement provides that
                SWEPCO pay Delhi the price under the original contract through
                January 1994. This included the release of $2.9 million to
                Delhi which was previously deposited by SWEPCO to the custody
                of the court in 1993. Concurrent with execution of the
                settlement agreement, Delhi executed a new four-year agreement
                with SWEPCO enabling Delhi to supply increased volumes of gas
                to two SWEPCO power plants in East Texas at market sensitive
                prices and premiums commensurate with the level of service
                provided. The agreement provides for swing service and does not
                require any minimum gas purchase volumes.

                ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS --
                     The Delhi Group is subject to federal, state and local
                laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws
                generally provide for control of pollutants released into the
                environment and require responsible parties to undertake
                remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be
                imposed for noncompliance. Expenditures for remediation and
                penalties have not been material.
                     For a number of years, the Delhi Group has made capital
                expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance with
                various laws relating to the environment. In 1993 and 1992,
                such capital expenditures totaled approximately $4.5 million
                and $3.0 million, respectively. The Delhi Group anticipates
                making additional such expenditures in the future; however, the
                exact amounts and timing of such expenditures are uncertain
                because of the continuing evolution of specific regulatory
                requirements.

23. PRO FORMA INCOME PER COMMON SHARE (UNAUDITED)

Income per share data applicable to outstanding Delhi Stock is reported on a
pro forma basis for the years 1992 and 1991 to reflect the per share income as
if the capital structure of the Delhi Group was in effect beginning January 1,
1991. The capital structure of the Delhi Group as of June 30, 1992, was
determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the USX Certificate of
Incorporation. Historical income before the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle was adjusted for the attribution of certain corporate
activities (Note 3, page D-8). The pro forma data are not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have occurred if the capital structure of
the Delhi Group was in effect for the periods indicated.

                 THE DELHI GROUP
                 Management's Discussion and Analysis

                          The Delhi Group includes Delhi Gas Pipeline
                 Corporation ("DGP"), a wholly owned subsidiary of USX
                 Corporation ("USX"), and certain related companies which are
                 engaged in the purchasing, gathering, processing, transporting
                 and marketing of natural gas. Management's Discussion and
                 Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Delhi Group's
                 Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements. The
                 financial data presented for the periods prior to October 2,
                 1992, (with the exception of pro forma data) reflected the
                 combined historical financial position, results of operations
                 and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi Group.
                 Beginning October 2, 1992, the financial statements of the
                 Delhi Group include the financial position, results of
                 operations and cash flows for the businesses of the Delhi
                 Group and the effects of the capital structure of the Delhi
                 Group which includes a portion of the corporate assets and
                 liabilities and related transactions which are not separately
                 identified with the ongoing operations of USX.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF INCOME

                          The following table provides a summary of the Delhi 
                 Group's sales for each of the last three years:

                 Other                                                           .1              1.0              1.7
                                                                             ------           ------           ------
                 Total Sales                                                 $534.8           $457.8           $423.2
                 ....................................................................................................
</TABLE>

                          TOTAL SALES in 1993 increased by 17% from 1992,
                 mainly due to increased revenues from premium services and
                 higher average natural gas sales prices. Total sales revenues
                 in 1992 increased by 8% from 1991 primarily due to higher
                 average natural gas sales prices, increased systems throughput
                 volumes and increased gas processing revenues.

                          OPERATING INCOME for the Delhi Group was $35.6
                 million in 1993, $32.6 million in 1992 and $31.0 million in
                 1991. Operating income in 1993 included favorable effects of
                 $1.8 million for the reversal of a prior-period accrual
                 related to a natural gas contract settlement, $0.8 million
                 related to gas imbalance settlements and a net $0.6 million
                 for a refund of prior years' taxes other than income taxes.
                 Operating income in 1992 included favorable effects totaling
                 $1.5 million relating to the settlement of various lawsuits
                 and third-party disputes.  Excluding the effects of these
                 items, 1993 operating income improved by $1.3 million,
                 primarily as a result of higher gas sales margins and lower
                 operating and other expenses, partially offset by a 34%
                 decline in gas processing margins from the sale of natural gas
                 liquids ("NGLs"). Depreciation, depletion and amortization of
                 $36.3 million in 1993 declined from 1992 mainly due to certain
                 assets becoming fully depreciated during the prior year.

                          Operating income in 1991 included $8.0 million for
                 favorable settlements of certain contractual issues.
                 Excluding the effects of the settlements in 1992 and 1991,
                 operating income in 1992 improved by $8.1 million, primarily
                 due to increased NGLs volumes from gas processing, higher
                 natural gas systems throughput volumes and lower operating and
                 other expenses. These favorable items were partially offset by
                 lower unit margins for NGLs, reflecting lower NGLs prices and
                 higher feedstock costs. (See "Management's Discussion and
                 Analysis of Operations" below for a further discussion of
                 operating income.)

                 Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                          OTHER INCOME of $5.2 million in 1993 included the
                 favorable pretax effect of a $0.9 million accrual reversal
                 recognizing the expiration of certain obligations related to a
                 prior asset acquisition, and a pretax gain of $2.9 million
                 from disposal of assets. The disposal of assets included
                 pretax gains of $0.8 million on the sale of nonstrategic gas
                 gathering systems in Colorado and $1.6 million on the sale of
                 the Delhi Group's interest in a natural gas transmission
                 partnership. The 1993 U.S. income tax provision included a
                 $2.9 million unfavorable tax effect associated with the sale
                 of the transmission partnership interest, which resulted in a
                 $1.3 million net loss on the transaction. Other loss in 1991
                 reflected an $18.7 million impairment of the Delhi Group's
                 interest in the previously mentioned transmission partnership.

                          INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS increased by $5.9
                 million in 1993 following a $4.0 million increase in 1992.
                 Interest and other financial costs of $10.5 million in 1993
                 included $7.7 million representing the Delhi Group's portion
                 of USX's financial activities attributable to all three groups
                 and $2.5 million related to the sale of the Delhi Group's
                 accounts receivables. Interest and other financial costs in
                 1992 included $2.3 million related to the sale of the Delhi
                 Group's accounts receivables, which began in December 1991,
                 and interest expense of $2.1 million representing the Delhi
                 Group's portion of USX's financial activities attributable to
                 all three groups for the period October 2, 1992, through
                 December 31, 1992.

                          THE PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES is based on
                 tax rates and amounts which recognize management's best
                 estimate of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
                 In addition to the previously mentioned $2.9 million
                 unfavorable tax effect associated with the sale of the Delhi
                 Group's interest in a natural gas transmission partnership,
                 the income tax provision for 1993 included a $4.1 million
                 charge associated with an increase in the federal income tax
                 rate from 34% to 35%, reflecting remeasurement of deferred
                 federal income tax liabilities as of January 1, 1993.

                          CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
                 in 1992 reflected the $17.9 million favorable cumulative
                 noncash effect, measured as of January 1, 1992, of adopting
                 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109--Accounting
                 for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109"), which requires an asset and
                 liability approach for measuring deferred income taxes.

                          NET INCOME was $12.2 million in 1993, $36.5 million
                 in 1992 and $7.2 million in 1991. Excluding the cumulative
                 effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 109, net income decreased
                 by $6.4 million in 1993 following an increase of $11.4 million
                 in 1992 from 1991. Net income presented for 1991, and for the
                 portion of 1992 relating to the period prior to October 2,
                 1992, reflected the historical income for the businesses of
                 the Delhi Group. Net income for these periods does not reflect
                 interest costs and related income tax amounts of the Delhi
                 Group as it was capitalized in accordance with the USX
                 Certificate of Incorporation effective October 2, 1992.
                 However, pro forma income before the cumulative effect of the
                 change in accounting principle of $13.8 million in 1992 and
                 $1.0 million in 1991 are presented as if the capital structure
                 of the Delhi Group was in effect beginning January 1, 1991.
                 (See Note 23 to the Delhi Group Financial Statements.)



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

                          CURRENT ASSETS of $42.2 million at year-end 1993 were
                 $16.7 million higher than the year-end 1992 balance due
                 primarily to increases in receivables and in cash and cash
                 equivalents. The increase in receivables mainly reflected
                 increased natural gas sales in December 1993 as compared with
                 December 1992 and a delay in collection of amounts for gas
                 sold to Southwestern Electric Power Company ("SWEPCO"),
                 related to a natural gas contract dispute which was settled in
                 January 1994 (see Note 22 to the Delhi Group Financial
                 Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                 Operations below). These items were partially offset by a
                 decline in NGLs sales in December 1993 as compared with
                 December 1992 and the sale of additional receivables of $3.5
                 million.

                          CURRENT LIABILITIES were $102.4 million at year-end
                 1993, $7.3 million lower than at year-end 1992 due primarily
                 to lower accrued taxes reflecting higher estimated federal
                 income tax payments and a decline in the current portion of
                 USX's long-term debt attributed to the Delhi Group. These
                 items were partially offset by increased accounts payable
                 mainly resulting from higher gas purchase volumes and prices.

                          TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE at December
                 31, 1993 was $109.6 million. The $11.3 million increase from
                 year-end 1992 was primarily due to capital expenditures,
                 dividend payments and an increase in cash and cash equivalents
                 from year-end 1992, partially offset by cash provided from
                 operating activities and disposal of assets.  The amount of
                 total long-term debt, as well as the amount shown as notes
                 payable, represented the Delhi Group's portion of USX debt
                 attributed to all three groups. Virtually all of the debt is a
                 direct obligation of, or is guaranteed by, USX.

                          DEFERRED CREDITS AND OTHER LIABILITIES declined to
                 $9.5 million at year-end 1993, primarily reflecting the
                 amortization of income from reservation fees related to
                 certain natural gas contracts and the previously mentioned
                 reversal of an accrual related to a prior asset acquisition.

                          STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY of $205.5 million at year-end
                 1993 increased $9.4 million from year-end 1992 mainly
                 reflecting the net income recorded during 1993, partially
                 offset by dividends paid.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS

                          NET CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES totaled
                 $33.2 million in 1993, down $42.6 million from 1992 primarily
                 reflecting the payment of income taxes (including settlements
                 with other groups) totaling $22.7 million in 1993 (of which
                 $8.5 million related to prior year federal taxes) versus $12.3
                 million in 1992, an increase in interest paid, a decline in
                 cash realized from the sale of receivables and the previously
                 mentioned delay in collection of receivables relating to a
                 natural gas contract dispute with SWEPCO. Cash provided from
                 operating activities in 1992 declined $40.4 million from 1991
                 due primarily to changes in cash realized from sold accounts
                 receivables.

                          CAPITAL EXPENDITURES of $42.6 million in 1993
                 increased by 60% from 1992 following a 43% increase in 1992
                 from 1991. Expenditures were primarily for the expansion of
                 existing systems and the acquisition of pipeline systems
                 enabling the Delhi Group to connect additional new dedicated
                 natural gas reserves. Additions to the Delhi Group's dedicated
                 gas reserves totaled 382 billion cubic feet ("bcf"), 273 bcf
                 and 255 bcf in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Expenditures
                 in all three years included amounts for improvements and
                 upgrades to existing facilities. Expenditures in 1993 included
                 amounts for a multi-pipeline interconnection and compression
                 project in the Carthage area of East Texas, the acquisition
                 and connection of a 65-mile gas gathering system in West Texas
                 and the purchase, connection and upgrade of a 30 million cubic
                 feet per day cryogenic gas processing facility near existing
                 systems in South Texas.

                          Capital expenditures in 1994 are expected to exceed
                 1993 levels as the Delhi Group continues to pursue
                 opportunities to connect dedicated gas reserves by the
                 expansion or acquisition of gas gathering, processing and
                 transmission assets, including those made available as a
                 result of current industry conditions and regulatory
                 initiatives.


                          CASH GENERATED FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS in 1993 was
                 $4.2 million, an increase of $3.3 million from 1992 and $3.9
                 million from 1991. The increases primarily reflected proceeds
                 in 1993 from the sale of the Delhi Group's interest in a
                 natural gas transmission partnership and from the sale of
                 nonstrategic gas gathering systems in Colorado.

                 Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                          FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS increased $10.6 million in
                 1993, primarily reflecting the Delhi Group's net cash flows
                 from operating activities, investment activities and dividends
                 paid during the period. These obligations consist of the Delhi
                 Group's portion of USX debt attributed to all three groups.

                          TRANSACTIONS WITH USX THROUGH OCTOBER 2, 1992, which
                 impacted 1992 and 1991, reflected centrally managed cash
                 transactions prior to formation of the Delhi Group.

                          DIVIDEND PAYMENTS of $1.9 million in 1993 included
                 the payment of four quarterly dividends compared with one
                 dividend payment in 1992, reflecting the formation of the
                 Delhi Group on October 2, 1992. The annualized rate of
                 dividends per share for the USX-Delhi Group Common Stock,
                 based on the most recently declared quarterly dividend, is
                 $.20.

                          In September 1993, Standard and Poor's Corporation 
                 ("S&P")lowered its ratings on USX's and Marathon's senior debt 
                 to below investment grade (from BBB- to BB+) and on USX's 
                 subordinated debt, preferred stock and commercial paper. S&P
                 cited extremely aggressive financial leverage, burdensome
                 retiree medical liabilities and litigation contingencies. In
                 October 1993, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")
                 confirmed its Baa3 investment grade ratings on USX's and
                 Marathon's senior debt. Moody's also confirmed its ratings
                 on USX's subordinated debt and commercial paper, but
                 lowered its ratings on USX's preferred stock from ba1 to
                 ba2. Moody's noted that the rating confirmation on USX debt
                 securities reflected confidence in the expected performance
                 of USX during the intermediate term, while the downward
                 revision of the preferred stock ratings incorporated a
                 narrow fixed charge coverage going forward. The downgrades
                 by S&P and the downgrade of ratings on preferred stock by
                 Moody's could increase USX's cost of capital. Any related
                 increase in interest costs would be reflected in the
                 consolidated financial statements and the financial
                 statements of each group.
        
                          USX anticipates that the Delhi Group will resume cash
                 funding of its pension plan in amounts approximating $0.1
                 million for the 1993 plan year and $1 million for the 1994
                 plan year, with the funding for both plan years impacting cash
                 flows in 1994.



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LITIGATION AND
CONTINGENCIES

                          The Delhi Group has incurred and will continue to
                 incur capital and operating and maintenance expenditures as a
                 result of environmental laws and regulations. To the extent
                 these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
                 reflected in the prices of the Delhi Group's products and
                 services, operating results will be adversely affected. The
                 Delhi Group believes that substantially all of its competitors
                 are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.
                 However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary
                 depending on a number of factors, including the age and
                 location of their operating facilities and their production
                 processes.

                          The Delhi Group's environmental expenditures for 1993
                 and 1992 are discussed below and have been estimated based on
                 American Petroleum Institute ("API") survey guidelines. These
                 guidelines are subject to differing interpretations which
                 could affect the comparability of such data. Some
                 environmental related expenditures, while benefiting the
                 environment, also enhance operating efficiencies.

                          The Delhi Group's total environmental expenditures in
                 1993 were $9.8 million compared with $7.9 million in 1992.
                 These amounts consisted of capital expenditures of $4.5
                 million in 1993 and $3.0 million in 1992 and estimated
                 compliance expenditures (including operating and maintenance)
                 of $5.3 million in 1993 and $4.9 million in 1992. Compliance
                 expenditures were broadly estimated based on API survey
                 guidelines and represented 1% of the Delhi Group's total
                 operating costs in both 1993 and 1992. Remediation related
                 expenditures were not material.

<PAGE>   190
                 Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                          New or expanded requirements for environmental
                 regulations, which could increase the Delhi Group's
                 environmental costs, may arise in the future. USX intends to
                 comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment,
                 but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable
                 (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by
                 future legislation, it is not possible to accurately predict
                 the ultimate cost of compliance, including remediation costs
                 which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed.
                 However, based on presently available information, and
                 existing laws and regulations as currently implemented,
                 management does not anticipate that environmental compliance
                 expenditures will materially increase in 1994. The Delhi
                 Group's capital expenditures for environmental controls are
                 expected to be approximately $5 million in 1994. Predictions
                 beyond 1994 can only be broad-based estimates which have
                 varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing
                 evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible
                 imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability
                 of new technologies, among other matters. Based upon currently
                 identified projects, the Delhi Group anticipates that
                 environmental capital expenditures in 1995 will remain at
                 about the same levels experienced in 1994; however, actual
                 expenditures may increase as additional projects are
                 identified or additional requirements are imposed.

                          USX is the subject of, or a party to, a number of
                 pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and
                 commitments relating to the Delhi Group involving a variety of
                 matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
                 environment, certain of which are discussed in Note 22 to the
                 Delhi Group Financial Statements. The ultimate resolution of
                 these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate,
                 be material to the Delhi Group financial statements. However,
                 management believes that USX will remain a viable and
                 competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
                 contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to the Delhi
                 Group. (See USX Consolidated Management's Discussion and
                 Analysis of Cash Flows.)



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS

                          The Delhi Group's operating results are affected by
                 fluctuations in natural gas prices and demand levels in the
                 markets that it serves. Natural gas prices were volatile in
                 1993 causing disruption of the Delhi Group's short term
                 interruptible ("spot") market program and gas processing
                 business. In addition, NGLs prices, which tend to follow
                 fluctuations in crude oil prices, declined significantly in
                 the last half of 1993. The Delhi Group intends to remain
                 competitive in this market environment by maximizing gas sales
                 to higher margin customers and maximizing its total systems
                 throughput by supplementing higher margin sales with gas sales
                 to industrial end users, spot market sales and transportation
                 revenues.

                          The Delhi Group can also be affected by changes in
                 the regulatory environment governing its businesses and the
                 businesses of its competitors. In April 1992, the Federal
                 Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 636, ("the
                 Order") which makes significant changes to the structure of
                 the services provided by interstate natural gas pipelines. The
                 changes are intended to ensure that interstate pipeline
                 companies provide transportation service that is equal in
                 quality for all gas supplies, whether the customer purchases
                 the gas from the pipeline or from another supplier. The Delhi
                 Group is primarily an intrastate gas gatherer (as opposed to
                 an interstate pipeline company) and does not face significant
                 transition costs as a result of the Order. The Delhi Group
                 believes that the Order will provide opportunities to offer
                 its merchant gas services to existing customers of interstate
                 pipelines who are seeking an alternative gas supply source.
                 However, as the Order is implemented, any additional Delhi
                 Group gas sales resulting from the Order will be subject to
                 negotiation with the individual customers. The Delhi Group
                 cannot accurately determine the financial effect of such
                 opportunities on future operating results.

                          The Delhi Group's four largest customers accounted
                 for 45% and 39% of its total gross margin and 18% and 14% of
                 its total systems throughput in 1993 and 1992, respectively.
                 In the event that one or more of the Delhi Group's largest
                 customers reduce volumes taken under an existing contract or
                 chooses not to renew such contract, the Delhi Group would be
                 adversely affected to the extent it is unable to find
                 alternative customers to buy gas at the same level of
                 profitability.

                 Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                          On January 26, 1994, a settlement agreement was
                 executed between DGP and SWEPCO, (one of the Delhi Group's
                 four largest customers) resolving litigation which began in
                 1991 related to a 15-year natural gas purchase contract
                 ("original contract") which was due to expire in April 1995.
                 Sales under the original contract were at prices substantially
                 above spot prices and, as a result, this contract accounted
                 for more than 10% of Delhi's total gross margin in each of the
                 last three years. The settlement agreement provides that
                 SWEPCO will pay the Delhi Group the price under the original
                 contract through January 1994. Concurrent with the execution
                 of the settlement agreement, the Delhi Group executed a new
                 four-year agreement with SWEPCO enabling Delhi to supply
                 increased volumes of gas to two SWEPCO power plants in East
                 Texas at market sensitive prices and premiums commensurate
                 with the level of service provided. The agreement provides for
                 swing service and does not require any minimum gas purchase
                 volumes.  The Delhi Group's operating income and cash flow
                 will be adversely affected by the amount of premiums lost
                 under the original contract for the period February 1, 1994,
                 through April 1, 1995. Broad estimates of the potential
                 premium losses are $18 million and $4 million in 1994 and
                 1995, respectively. SWEPCO has purchased gas under the new
                 agreement.

                          Operating income of $35.6 million in 1993 increased
                 by $3.0 million, or 9%, from 1992 following a $1.6 million, or
                 5%, increase in 1992 from 1991. The following is a discussion
                 of the Delhi Group's gross margin by principal service for
                 each of the last three years and an analysis of the reasons
                 for changes in such margins between years.

                          The gas sales margin and gas sales throughput for
                 each of the last three years were:

                          Excluding the effects of the contractual issues,
                 described under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Income
                 above, gas sales margin increased by 8% in 1993 and 7% in 1992
                 from the respective prior years. The improvement in 1993
                 mainly reflected increased sales to higher margin customers.
                 Margins on spot sales were affected by fluctuations in natural
                 gas prices throughout most of 1993 although overall average
                 prices increased in 1993 from the prior year. The successful
                 dedicated natural gas reserve addition programs in 1993 and
                 1992 contributed to the increases in both sales and
                 transportation volumes for those years by making more natural
                 gas available. Natural gas sales unit margins in 1992
                 benefitted from a favorable change in premium sales mix.
                 Average natural gas sales prices trended downward over most of
                 1991 and 1992, but stabilized in mid-1992 and increased during
                 the last several months of 1992 contributing to improved 1992
                 gas sales unit margins from the prior year.  Gas sales margins
                 in 1994 will be affected by factors relating to the natural
                 gas contract settlement with SWEPCO described above.

                          The transportation margin and throughput for each of 
                 the last three years were:

                 Management's Discussion and Analysis CONTINUED


                          Transportation margins declined by 4% to $14.2
                 million in 1993, following a 6% increase in 1992 from 1991.
                 Average throughput volumes increased in 1993 and 1992 from the
                 respective prior year periods, while average transportation
                 rates trended downward over those periods. The rate decline in
                 1993 more than offset the favorable effect of the increase in
                 throughput volumes for that year. The changes in
                 transportation volumes and rates during the three-years
                 reflected a strategy of offering producers transportation rate
                 incentives in order to increase the Delhi Group's dedicated
                 natural gas reserve base and the supply of processable gas to
                 its plants. The aggregation of transportation and processing
                 services increased the Delhi Group's overall gross margin,
                 although the transportation rate was lower than the normal
                 rate charged for transportation as a separate service.

                          The gas processing margin, NGLs sales volume and 
                 NGLs sales price for each of the last three years were:

                          The 34% decline in gas processing margins in 1993
                 resulted from higher average feedstock costs stemming from
                 increased average natural gas prices, primarily in the first
                 nine months of 1993, and lower NGLs prices which trended
                 downward with crude oil prices in the last half of 1993. NGLs
                 volumes for 1993 increased by 8% from the prior year as the
                 Delhi Group continued to add dedicated natural gas reserves,
                 with the associated gas processing rights, to its systems.
                 However, fourth quarter 1993 NGLs volumes declined by 17% from
                 the third quarter of 1993 as the Delhi Group chose not to
                 fully process some gas due to the decline in NGLs prices. The
                 Delhi Group will continue to monitor the economics of removing
                 NGLs from the gas stream for processing on an ongoing basis to
                 determine the appropriate level of each gas plant's operation.
                 The Delhi Group anticipates that margins for gas processing
                 will continue to be depressed in the first quarter of 1994.

                          The gas processing margin declined by 4% in 1992 from
                 1991 reflecting lower average NGLs sales prices and higher
                 feedstock costs. These factors were partially offset by a 22%
                 increase in NGLs sales volumes due in part to the previously
                 mentioned increase in systems throughput, which resulted in
                 increased availability of gas for processing.

                          Operating expenses of $28.0 million in 1993 declined
                 by $1.1 million from 1992 due mainly to cost control
                 procedures. Operating expenses of $29.1 million in 1992
                 declined by $1.9 million from 1991 primarily due to cost
                 control procedures implemented during the year and reduced
                 maintenance and repair costs.
