                                    PART  I


ITEM 1.      BUSINESS

Williams-Sonoma, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the Company), is a
national specialty retailer of fine quality cooking and serving equipment, home
furnishings and home and garden accessories, which it markets through 214 retail
stores and five mail order catalogs. The Company believes that it is one of the
country's largest specialty retailers of such equipment, furnishings and
accessories.  Retail sales accounted for approximately 58% of the Company's net
sales during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1995 (Fiscal 1994), while mail
order sales accounted for the balance.

The Company offers high quality, home-centered merchandise through five
concepts, each of which is focused on a different area of the home:
Williams-Sonoma offers culinary and serving equipment; Pottery Barn features
items in casual home furnishings, flatware and table accessories; Hold
Everything offers innovative household storage products; Gardener's Eden
features home gardening equipment and accessories; and Chambers offers high
quality bed and bath products.  Together, these concepts help customers satisfy
their home-centered needs from the kitchen and garden to the bedroom and bath. 

The Company was founded in 1956 in Sonoma, California, by Charles E. Williams,
currently Vice Chairman and a director of the Company.  Williams-Sonoma was one
of the first retailers of fine quality cookware in the United States.  Two years
later, the Sonoma store was moved to San Francisco.  In 1972, the Company began
to offer its Williams-Sonoma kitchen products through mail order catalogs.  The
Company expanded into areas of the home-centered business beyond kitchen
products by acquiring: Gardener's Eden, a mail order merchandiser of home
gardening equipment and accessories and housewares, in 1982; Pottery Barn, a
retailer of home furnishings, accessories and housewares, in 1986; and
California Closet Company, Inc., a direct marketer and installer of customized
closet systems, in 1990.  The Company also internally developed  Hold
Everything, a retail and mail order merchandiser of innovative household storage
products, and Chambers, a mail order merchandiser of high-quality bed and bath
products.  In August 1994 the Company sold California Closet Company, Inc.,
which accounted for 2% of sales for the fiscal year ended January 30, 1994
(Fiscal 1993).


MERCHANDISING CONCEPTS

The Company has five merchandising concepts: Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold
Everything, Gardener's Eden, and Chambers.  The Company believes that these
specialty concepts together can fulfill a customer's home-centered needs, from
the kitchen and garden to the bedroom and bath.

RETAIL STORES

Three of the Company's five merchandising concepts are marketed through retail
stores - Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and Hold Everything.  Williams-Sonoma
stores offer a wide selection of culinary and serving equipment, including
cookware, cookbooks, cutlery, informal dinnerware, glassware and table linen. In
addition, these stores carry a variety of quality foods, including a line of
Williams-Sonoma food products, such as gourmet coffees and pasta sauces.
Pottery Barn stores feature a large assortment of items in casual home
furnishings, flatware and table accessories from around the world that are
designed to be combined to create a dynamic look in the home.  The Hold
Everything concept was developed by the Company to offer innovative solutions to
household storage needs by providing efficient organization solutions for every
room in the house.

As of January 29, 1995 the Company operated 214 retail stores, located in 26
states and the District of Columbia.  This represents 120 Williams-Sonoma, 57
Pottery Barn, 35 Hold Everything, and 2 outlet stores.  During Fiscal 1994 the
Company opened 11 new large format stores and expanded eight existing store
sites to the larger format.  The 15 larger format Williams-Sonoma stores are, on
average, 31% larger than the average Williams-Sonoma store.  The 4 large format
Pottery Barn stores are, on average, 100% larger than the average Pottery Barn
store.  The Company plans 50 new or expanded large-format stores in Fiscal 1995
- -- 33 Williams-Sonoma and 17 Pottery Barn. The Company closed 2 Williams-Sonoma
stores, 2 Hold Everything stores and 2 Pottery Barn stores during Fiscal 1994.

MAIL ORDER OPERATIONS

The Company's mail order business began in 1972 when it introduced its flagship
catalog,  "A Catalog for Cooks," which markets the Williams-Sonoma concept.
Since then, it has expanded its mail order business to include the four other
concepts - Pottery Barn, Hold Everything, Gardener's Eden and Chambers.  The
mail order business complements the retail business by building customer
awareness of a concept and acting as an effective advertising vehicle.  In
addition, the Company believes that the mail order catalogs act as a cost
efficient means of testing market acceptance of new products.

The Company sends its catalogs to addresses from its proprietary customer list,
as well as to names from lists which the Company receives in exchange or rents
from other mail order merchandisers, magazines and other companies.  In
accordance with prevailing industry practice, the Company rents its list to
other merchandisers.  The Company's customer list is continually updated to
include new prospects and eliminate non-responders.

SUPPLIERS

The Company purchases its merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic
manufacturers and importers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of
purchases during Fiscal 1994.  Approximately 38% of the Company's merchandise is
foreign-sourced.  The primary sources for imported merchandise are located in
Europe and Asia.  The Company relies on long-standing arrangements with many of
its buying agents.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

The Company's management information systems (MIS) are designed to provide its
management and other personnel with information necessary to control and manage
its business.  The Company is planning to expand and upgrade its automatic call
directing phone switch in mail order operations which routes customer calls. A
significant investment in store systems is planned for 1995, with implementation
of enhanced merchandising receiving, electronic mail, time and attendance, and
electronic forms modules.  Management believes that there will be a reduction in
the administrative duties of its store employees, thereby allowing more time for
even better customer service.


COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

The specialty retail business is highly competitive.  The Company's specialty
retail stores and mail order catalogs compete with other retail stores,
including specialty stores and department stores and other mail order catalogs.
Certain of the Company's competitors have greater financial, distribution and
marketing resources than the Company.  The recent substantial sales growth in
the mail order catalog industry has encouraged the entry of many new
competitors and an increase in competition from established companies.  The
Company competes on the basis of the quality of its merchandise, service
to its customers and its proprietary customer list.

The Company's business is subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand.
Historically, a significant portion of the Company's sales and net income have
been realized during the period from October through December, and levels of net
sales and net income have generally been significantly lower during the period
from  February through July.  The Company believes this is the general pattern
associated with the mail order and retail industries.  In anticipation of its
peak season, the Company hires a substantial number of additional employees in
its retail stores and mail order processing and distribution areas, and incurs
significant fixed catalog production and mailing costs.  (See Quarterly
Financial Information on page 24 of the 1994 Annual Report which is incorporated
herein by reference).


EMPLOYEES

At January 29, 1995, the Company employed approximately 6,900 persons,
approximately 2,100 of whom were full-time employees.  During the 1994 peak
season, in accordance with its normal hiring practices, the Company hired
approximately 3,000 temporary employees in its stores and in its mail order
processing and distribution areas.



                                       5

ITEM  2.     PROPERTIES

The Company's corporate offices are located in three facilities in San
Francisco, California, totaling 96,000 square feet under leases expiring in 1996
and 1997.  In December 1993 the Company purchased a headquarters building with
plans to consolidate the headquarters staff in the spring of 1995.  In the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 1993 the Company recorded a $3,000,000 reserve for the
estimated cost of sub-leasing the leased space before the expiration of the
leases.  Sales growth experienced in the current year and planned growth in
Fiscal 1995 require the Company to retain some of the leased space it planned to
vacate.  Therefore, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994 the Company reversed
$2,000,000 of the lease reserve established in Fiscal 1993.

On April 1, 1994 the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for a
$7,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.25%.  The Company then fixed the mortgage
interest rate at 7.8% by entering into an interest rate swap agreement with the
bank.  The mortgage is secured by the new corporate headquarters building.
Interest and principal payments are due quarterly through March 2001.

In July 1984, the Company began distributing its merchandise through a
centralized leased facility of approximately 243,000 square feet located in
Memphis, Tennessee.  In October 1986 an additional 190,000 square feet of
distribution center was constructed.  The lessor is a partnership consisting of
two directors and/or officers of the Company.  The construction of the entire
facility was financed by the partnership through the aggregate issuance of
$2,900,000 of industrial development bonds.  The lease, which was amended in
October 1986 to include the additional 190,000 square feet of space, had an
initial non-cancelable term of ten years expiring on June 30, 1994 with two
optional five-year renewals by the Company.  In December 1993, the Company
exercised the two five-year renewal options and is now obligated to lease the
space until June 30, 2004.  In addition, the Company is obligated to renew the
lease annually so long as the bonds which financed the project are outstanding.
Effective July 1, 1994, the fixed basic monthly rent will increase from $46,500
to $51,500.  In connection with the December 1993 transaction, both the
partnership and the Company provided to an unaffiliated bank an indemnity
against certain environmental liabilities.

In August 1990, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an additional
307,000 square feet of distribution space adjacent to its existing Memphis
facility.  The lessor is a partnership that includes three directors and/or
officers of the Company.  The construction was financed by the partnership
through the sale of $10,550,000 of industrial development bonds.  The lease has
an initial, non-cancelable term of ten years, with four five-year renewals at
the option of the Company, and mandatory annual renewals so long as the bonds
are outstanding.  In September 1994 this lease was amended to include an
approximately 306,000 square-foot expansion.  The expansion is currently under
construction and is expected to be completed in July 1995.  (See Note F of Notes
to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Company's net selling area totaled approximately 538,000 square feet of
leased space at January 29, 1995 for 214 stores.  All of the existing stores are
leased by the Company with original lease terms ranging from eight to nineteen
years, expiring between 1995 and 2009, except for one store with a 49-year lease
term extending through 2040.  Most leases for the Company's stores provide for
contingent rent based upon sales.  (See Note E of Notes to the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements).

ITEM  3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There are no material pending legal proceedings against the Company.  The
Company is, however, involved in routine litigation arising in the ordinary
course of its business, and, while the results of the proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the final outcome of such
matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM  4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the 1994 fiscal year.

    Net sales for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) for the
fiscal year ended January 29, 1995 (Fiscal 1994) increased 28.9% compared to net
sales for the fiscal year ended January 30,1994 (Fiscal 1993). Net sales for
Fiscal 1993 increased 18.9% over net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31,
1993

(Fiscal 1992). In August 1994 the Company sold California Closet Company, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary which markets custom home closet systems, primarily
through a network of franchise stores. The Company does not expect the sale of
this business to significantly impact future net sales.

    Catalog sales in Fiscal 1994 and 1993 increased 55% and 24%, respectively,
over those of the previous years. The Pottery Barn catalog was the fastest
growing segment of the catalog business during these years and accounted for 42%
of the catalog sales growth in Fiscal 1994 and 69% in Fiscal 1993. Most of this
growth was the result of altering the merchandise content of the Pottery Barn
catalog in Fiscal 1992. The Williams-Sonoma catalog was the next fastest growing
segment of the catalog business and accounted for 32% of the catalog sales
growth in Fiscal 1994 and 10% in Fiscal 1993. The Company attributes much of the
Fiscal 1994 improvement to the new, larger format of the Williams-Sonoma
catalog.

    The number of catalogs mailed in Fiscal 1994 and 1993 increased 27% and 6%,
respectively, over the previous fiscal years. However, as a result of recent
increases in postal rates and higher paper costs, the Company expects to mail
fewer catalogs during the fiscal year ending January 28, 1996 (Fiscal 1995) than
in Fiscal 1994.

</TABLE>

    Retail sales in Fiscal 1994 increased 17.9% over retail sales in Fiscal
1993. Comparable store sales increased 16.5% during the same period. Retail
sales grew 16.6% in Fiscal 1993 while comparable store sales grew 13.8%. Pottery
Barn, with 27% of the store locations in 1994, accounted for 39% and 38% of the
retail sales growth in Fiscal 1994 and 1993, respectively.

    In Fiscal 1994 the Company opened 19 (11 new and 8 expanded) large-format
stores - 15 Williams-Sonoma and 4 Pottery Barn. The large-format
Williams-Sonoma stores are, on average, 31% larger than the average
Williams-Sonoma store, and the large-format Pottery Barn stores are, on average,
100% larger than the average Pottery Barn store. The larger-format stores enable
the Company to more clearly display merchandise.  The Company plans 50 new or
expanded large-format stores in Fiscal 1995 - 33 Williams-Sonoma and 17 Pottery
Barn.

    For the purpose of determining comparable store sales, comparable stores are
defined as those whose gross square feet did not change by more than 20% in the
previous twelve months and which have been open for at least twelve months, and
are compared monthly for purposes of this analysis. Under this definition, sales
from existing stores recently converted to the larger, more productive format
are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Thus, the Company's
current plans to convert many of its existing stores to the larger format may
temporarily depress comparable store sales growth in Fiscal 1995.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy

    The cost of goods sold and occupancy expense (expressed as a percentage of
sales) has steadily declined from 64.0% in Fiscal 1992 to 62.3% in Fiscal 1993
and 59.9% in Fiscal 1994. Seventy percent of the improvement in the expense rate
in Fiscal 1994 and 1993 is due to the fact that sales increased at double the
rate occupancy costs increased. This disparity is the combined effect of the
growth in catalog sales (which have no occupancy expense) outpacing the growth
in retail sales and double digit comparable store sales growth (which improved
store productivity). The cost of goods sold also improved in Fiscal 1994 and
1993 due to the higher growth rate of catalog sales, which have a higher gross
margin, over retail sales.



                                       25
<PAGE>   27

Selling, General and Administrative

    Selling, general and administrative expense (expressed as a percentage of
sales) increased .9 percentage points in Fiscal 1994 to 33.5% due to higher
advertising and net shipping expense rates offset by a .5 percentage point
decline in the employment expense rate. Selling, general and administrative
expense expressed as a percentage of sales declined 2.0 percentage points in
Fiscal 1993 to 32.6% from 34.6% in Fiscal 1992. Employment expenses during this
period declined 1.1 percentage points and advertising expense declined .9
percentage points.

    The Company currently leases space in three separate buildings in San
Francisco, California, for its corporate offices. In December 1993 the Company
purchased a headquarters building with plans to consolidate the headquarters
staff in the building. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 the Company
established a $3,000,000 reserve for the estimated cost of vacating leased
office space prior to the expiration of the leases. Sales growth experienced in
the current year and planned growth in Fiscal 1995 require the Company to retain
some of the leased office space it planned to vacate. Therefore, in the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 1994 the company reversed $2,000,000 of the lease reserve
established in 1993. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1992 the Company
established a $1,117,000 store closing reserve related to certain non-performing
stores which were closed in Fiscal 1993 and 1994.

Interest Expense

    Average month-end short-term borrowings decreased 28% from $17,931,000 in
Fiscal 1993 to $12,977,000 in Fiscal 1994, primarily as a result of transferring
short-term borrowings to long-term debt. In December 1993, the Company purchased
a new headquarters building with working capital and then secured a seven-year,
$7 million, 7.8% mortgage on the building in April 1994. The Company's weighted
average interest rate on short-term borrowings increased to 6.3% in Fiscal 1994
from 6.0% in Fiscal 1993. Net interest expense increased $136,000 from the prior
year.

    Average month-end short-term borrowings declined 29% from $25,346,000 in
Fiscal 1992 to $17,931,000 in Fiscal 1993. The decline in borrowings was a
result of improved cash flows from operations and the fact that no new stores
were opened in Fiscal 1993. The Company's weighted average interest rate on
short-term borrowings was 6.0% in Fiscal 1992 and Fiscal 1993. Net interest
expense declined $410,000 from the prior year.

Income Taxes

    The Company's effective rate was 41.5% for Fiscal 1994 - a decrease of .7%
from Fiscal 1993. This is a result of lower aggregate state tax rates based on
the mix of retail sales and catalog sales in the various states where the
Company has sales or conducts business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    Cash and working capital at January 29, 1995, increased by $6,724,000 and
$9,101,000, respectively, over that at January 30, 1994. Although net income
increased significantly, net cash provided by operations in Fiscal 1994 was
$7,360,000 less than that in Fiscal 1993. The primary factors are changes in
inventories, prepaid catalog expenses and income taxes payable. Higher inventory
balances are a result of additional stores, larger-format stores and an overall
increase in the level of sales in Fiscal 1994. Sixty percent of the increase in
prepaid catalog expenses is due to the timing of payments to a paper vendor, and
the remainder is due to the increased size and quantity of the January 1995
catalogs mailed compared to the January 1994 catalogs. During Fiscal 1994 the
Company began to purchase paper directly from the manufacturer rather than
through the printer. This results in lower total paper costs but a higher
prepaid balance because the expenditure is made sooner. Total costs for the
January 1995 catalogs increased over the prior year due to a 28% increase in the
number of catalogs mailed and an 8% increase in the number of pages. The Company
paid approximately $10,000,000 more in income taxes in Fiscal 1994 than in
Fiscal 1993. Capital expenditures increased significantly in Fiscal 1994 because
the company opened 11 new stores, expanded 8 stores and increased its investment
in information systems. Cash flows from financing activities increased
$22,472,000 from Fiscal 1993 to Fiscal 1994. This is primarily due to the
$7,000,000



                                       26
<PAGE>   28

mortgage on the new headquarters building (see Note C to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements), an increase in cash overdrafts and lower bank debt at
the beginning of the year, resulting in lower repayments.
        
    Cash and working capital at January 30, 1994, increased by $7,848,000 and
$7,496,000, respectively, over that at January 31, 1993. Net cash provided by
operating activities increased from $5,129,000 to $27,467,000 due primarily to a
$9,422,000 increase in net earnings, a $5,247,000 increase in accrued expenses
and an $8,876,000 increase in taxes payable. Reduced capital expenditures were
responsible for the $1,001,000 decline in net cash used in investing activities.
Although the Company did not open any new stores in Fiscal 1993, a new
headquarters building was purchased. Lower bank borrowings and an increase in
repayments were principally responsible for the decline in net cash provided by
financing activities.

    The Company leases its stores, distribution center, management information
systems and operating equipment. The Company plans to open 35 new large-format
stores and expand an additional 15 stores. Store construction and expansion and
seasonal inventory requirements will be financed through cash flow from
operations, landlord construction allowances and bank debt. The Company has a
line-of-credit agreement with a bank that expires July 1, 1996. Fixed
obligations consist of debt (see Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) and operating leases (see Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). The Company plans to fund these fixed obligations with a
combination of cash flows from operations and bank debt.

Impact of Inflation

    The impact of inflation on results of operations has not been significant.

Seasonality

    The Company's business is subject to substantial seasonal variations in
demand. Historically, a significant portion of the Company's sales and net
income have been realized during the period from October through December, and
levels of net sales and net income have generally been significantly lower
during the period from February through July. The Company believes this is the
general pattern associated with the mail order and retail industries. In
anticipation of its peak season, the Company hires a substantial number of
additional employees in its retail stores and mail order processing and
distribution areas, and incurs significant fixed catalog production and mailing
costs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company and its subsidiaries are specialty retailers of fine quality cooking
and serving equipment and other selected household products, which are marketed
primarily through retail stores and mail-order catalogs. These consolidated
financial statements include Williams-Sonoma, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Significant inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

    Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with original maturities
    of 90 days or less.

    Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
    method) or market.

    Prepaid catalog expenses consist of the cost to produce, print and
distribute catalogs. Such costs are amortized over the expected sales life of
each catalog. Typically, over 90% of the cost of a catalog is amortized in the
first four months.

    Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from 3 to 39 years. Amortization of improvements to leased properties is
based upon the term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of
such assets, whichever is shorter.

    Investments and other assets include lease rights and interests acquired
from the Pottery Barn, which are being amortized over the life of the respective
leases which range from 5 to 14 years, non-current receivables, and long-term
deposits.

    Deferred lease incentives include construction allowances received from
landlords, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease
term. For leases which contain fixed escalations of the minimum annual lease
payment during the original term of the lease, the Company recognizes rental
expense on a straight-line basis and records the difference between rent expense
and the amount currently payable as deferred lease incentives.

    Effective February 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 109 in Fiscal 1993 did not have an impact on
the financial position of the Company. SFAS 109 requires the Company to compute
deferred income taxes on the difference between the financial statement and tax
basis of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

    Primary and fully diluted earnings per share were computed based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year plus common
stock equivalents consisting of shares subject to stock options. Earnings per
share, number of shares and stock options for all periods have been restated to
reflect a 3-for-2 stock split in February 1994 and September 1994.

    Certain items in the prior years' consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the Fiscal 1994 presentation.

The Company's credit agreement provides for an available credit facility which
permits line of credit borrowings at either the Bank's Reference Rate or the
Offshore Rate plus .875%. The amount available under the line of credit varies
during the business year from $45,000,000 to $65,000,000. At January 29, 1995,
there was $45,000,000 available under the revolving line of credit. This
facility expires July 1, 1996. At January 29, 1995, the Company had no
borrowings under the line of credit. Additionally, the credit agreement provides
for $25,000,000 for letters of credit, of which approximately $9,708,000 were
outstanding at January 29, 1995. The agreement contains certain restrictive loan
covenants, including current and debt-to-equity ratios, minimum tangible net
worth, minimum net income, restrictions on capital expenditures and a
prohibition on payment of cash dividends. The Company was in compliance with
these covenants at January 29, 1995.

    Interest expense was $1,509,000, $1,210,000 and $1,636,000 for Fiscal 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Interest paid was $1,505,000, $1,198,000 and $1,685,000 for Fiscal 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

    Accounts payable at January 29, 1995, and January 30, 1994, includes cash
overdrafts of $16,736,000 and $9,641,000, respectively, for checks issued and
not presented to the bank for payment.

    On April 1, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for a
$7,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 1.25%. The Company then fixed the mortgage
interest rate at 7.8% for the full term by entering into an interest rate swap
agreement with the bank. Interest and principal payments are due quarterly
through March 2001. The mortgage is secured by the new corporate headquarters
building purchased by the Company in December 1993.

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has
established a valuation allowance as of January 29, 1995 due to the uncertainty
of realizing future tax benefits from its capital loss carryforwards.

Note E
Leases

The Company leases store locations and its warehouses and certain equipment
under operating leases for original terms ranging from 3 to 25 years extending
through 2015, except for one store lease with a 49-year term extending through
2040. Most store leases require the payment of minimum rentals against
percentage rentals based on store sales. Certain leases contain renewal options
for periods of up to 20 years.

      In December 1993 the Company purchased a headquarters building with plans
to consolidate the headquarters staff in the building. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1993 the Company established a $3,000,000 reserve for the estimated cost
of vacating leased office space prior to the expiration of the leases. Sales
growth experienced in the current year and planned growth in Fiscal 1995 require
the Company to retain some of the leased office space it planned to sublease.
Therefore, in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 1994 the Company reversed $2,000,000
of the lease reserve established in 1993.

Related Party Lease Transactions

The Company's warehouse and distribution center is located in Memphis,
Tennessee, and leased from two partnerships whose partners include directors,
executive officers and/or significant shareholders of the Company. The
distribution center consists of two separate facilities -- one for mail order
operations and one for retail store operations.

Mail Order Operating Facility

In July 1983, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a
243,000-square-foot distribution center. The lessor is a partnership comprised
of W. Howard Lester, chairman, chief executive officer and significant
shareholder of the Company, and James A. McMahan, a director and significant
shareholder of the Company and member of the Compensation Committee. The
partnership financed the construction through the sale of $6,300,000 principal
amount of industrial development bonds due June 2008. The lease had an initial,
non-cancelable term of ten years expiring on June 30, 1994, with two optional
five-year renewals by the Company. In December 1985, the partnership financed
the construction of an additional 190,000 square feet of space through the sale
of $2,900,000 principal amount of industrial development bonds due 2010. The
Company's lease with the partnership was amended to include additional rent plus
interest on the new bonds for the same lease term as the original lease. In
December 1993, the Company exercised the two five-year renewal options and is
now obligated to lease the space until June 30, 2004. Effective July 1, 1994,
the fixed basic monthly rent is $51,500. Rental payments consist of the basic
monthly rent, plus interest on the bonds (a floating rate equal to 55% of the
prime rate of a designated bank), applicable taxes, insurance and maintenance
expenses. In connection with the December 1993 transaction, both the partnership
and the Company provided to an unaffiliated bank an indemnity against certain
environmental liabilities.

Retail Store Operating Facility

In August 1990, the Company entered into a separate agreement to lease a second
distribution center, consisting of approximately 307,000 square feet adjacent to
the existing distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. The lessor is a
partnership that includes Messrs. Lester, McMahan and Robert K. Earley, senior
vice president of distribution. The partnership financed the construction of the
distribution center through the sale of $10,500,000, 10.36% principal amount of
industrial development bonds due in August 2015.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

    In September 1994, this lease was amended to include an approximately
306,000-square-foot expansion of the facility. The expansion is currently under
construction and expected to be completed in July 1995. The lessor is financing
the construction of the expansion through a $500,000 capital contribution from
its partners and the sale of $12,500,000, 9.01% principal amount of industrial
development bonds due in August 2015. The amended lease has an initial,
non-cancelable term of 15 years beginning in August 1991 and ending in July
2006, with three optional five-year renewals. Rentals (including interest on the
bonds, sinking fund payments, and fees) for the primary term are payable at an
average rate of $623,895 per quarter plus applicable taxes, insurance and
maintenance expenses.

    Both facilities (including the 1994 expansion) are constructed to the
Company's specifications. After the option periods, the Company is obligated to
renew each lease annually so long as the bonds which financed the specific
projects remain outstanding. The facility leases qualify as operating leases for
accounting purposes. The Company believes that the facility leases are on terms
no less favorable than the Company could have obtained from third parties in
arm's-length transactions.

Stock Options 

The Company's 1993 Stock Option Plan (the 1993 Plan), which provides for grants
of incentive and non-qualified stock options up to an aggregate of 2,250,000
shares, was approved and adopted in 1993. The 1993 Plan replaces the 1976
non-qualified plan which was terminated and the 1983 Incentive Stock Option
Plan, which expired on March 27, 1993. Options granted under the 1976 and 1983
Plans remain in force until they are exercised or expire. All incentive stock
option grants made under the 1993 Plan have a maximum term of ten years, except
those issued to 10% shareholders which have a term of five years. The exercise
price of all incentive stock options shall be 100% of the fair market value of
the stock at the option grant date or 110% for a 10% shareholder. The exercise
price for non-qualified options shall not be less than 75% of the fair market
value of the stock at the option grant date.

    Total options exercisable in all plans were 500,605 and 484,713 as of
January 29, 1995, and January 30, 1994, respectively.

Employee Profit Sharing and Stock Incentive Plan

In Fiscal 1989, the Company established a defined contribution retirement plan,
which is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code 401(a) and 401(k), for
eligible employees. The amount of the annual profit sharing contribution is
determined by the Board of Directors subject to limitations based upon
resolutions adopted by the directors.

    The plan permits employees to make salary deferral contributions in
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) regulations. The fund
options were determined by the Administrative Committee and represent a money
market reserve fund, a balanced mutual fund portfolio and Williams-Sonoma, Inc.
stock. The Company matches a portion of the employee's contributions invested in
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. stock under a predetermined formula. The Company's
contributions under this plan vest on behalf of the employee over a five-year
period.

    The Company's contributions to the plan for Fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992 were
$770,000, $602,000 and $242,000, respectively.

Independent Auditors' Report

To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.: 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Williams-Sonoma,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 29, 1995, and January 30,
1994, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years ending January 29, 1995. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

       We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

       In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Williams-Sonoma, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 29, 1995, and January 30, 1994, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years ending
January 29, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

       As discussed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements,
effective February 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes to conform with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109.
