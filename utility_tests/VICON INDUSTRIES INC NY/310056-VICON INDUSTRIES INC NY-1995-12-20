The Company is in the process of securing  alternative  long term  financing  to
replace its existing  revolving  credit agreement which expired in October 1995.
The  Company's  financial  personnel  are very  limited and their  efforts  have
been focused  on  the  due  diligence  requirements  of  the  lenders.  
Consequently, sufficient time will not be available to complete the 10K by 
December 29, 1995.
