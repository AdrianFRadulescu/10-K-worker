                          PART I



ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

General

Vicon  Industries,  Inc. (the  "Company"),  incorporated in New York in October,
1967,  designs,  manufactures,  assembles  and  markets  a wide  range of closed
circuit   television   ("CCTV")   components  and  CCTV  systems  for  security,
surveillance, safety, process and control applications by end users. The Company
sells CCTV components and systems directly to distributors, dealers and original
equipment  manufacturers,  principally  within the security  industry.  The U.S.
security  industry is a  multi-billion  dollar  industry  which  includes  guard
services,  armored  carrier,  electronic  alarms and sensing  equipment,  safes,
locking devices and access systems, as well as CCTV. The nature of the Company's
business and the general security market it serves has not changed materially in
the past five years.

Users  of the  Company's  products  typically  utilize  them as a  visual  crime
deterrent, for visual documentation,  observing inaccessible or hazardous areas,
enhancing  safety,  obtaining cost savings (such as lower  insurance  premiums),
managing  control  systems,  and improving the efficiency and  effectiveness  of
personnel.  The  Company's  products are marketed  under its own brand names and
registered trademarks.  In fiscal 1995, no customer represented more than 10% of
consolidated revenues.

Products

The Company's  product line  consists of  approximately  600 products,  of which
about a third represent model variations. The Company's product line consists of
various  elements  of a video  surveillance  system,  including  video  cameras,
display units  (monitors),  cassette  recorders,  switching  equipment for video
distribution, digital video and signal processing units (which perform character
generation,  multi screen display, video insertion,  intrusion detection, source
identification  and alarm  processing),  motorized  zoom lenses,  remote  camera
positioning  devices,  manual and computer based system controls,  environmental
camera  enclosures  and  consoles  for system  assembly.  In 1995,  the  Company
introduced a new product  called  ProTech  which is a Windows  based command and
control  software  package.  ProTech allows personal  computers  (p.c.) users to
graphically program and operate from a P.C. all of the Company's digital control
and video  processing  systems.  The  Company  expects  to further  enhance  the
capabilities of ProTech.  The Company  maintains a large line of products due to
the many varied climatic and operational  environments  under which the products
are expected to perform.  In addition to selling from a standard  catalog  line,
for significant  orders,  the Company will produce to specification or modify an
existing product to meet a customer's requirements. The Company's products range
in price from $10 for a simple  camera  mounting  bracket to  approximately  one
hundred  thousand  dollars  (depending upon  configuration)  for a large digital
control and video switching system.

Marketing

The  Company's   products  are  sold   worldwide,   principally  to  independent
distributors,  dealers  and  integrators  of various  types of  security-related
systems.  Sales are made by in-house  customer  service  representatives,  field
sales engineers and by independent sales representatives in certain areas of the
United  States.  The sales effort is supported by several  in-house  application
engineers.

Although  the Company  does not sell  directly  to end users,  much of its sales
promotion  and  advertising  is  directed  at end user  markets.  The  Company's
products are  employed in video  system  installations  by: (1)  commercial  and
industrial users, such as office buildings,  manufacturing  plants,  warehouses,
apartment complexes,  shopping malls and retail stores; (2) federal,  state, and
local governments for national security purposes, municipal facilities, prisons,
and military installations;  (3) financial institutions, such as banks, clearing
houses,   brokerage  firms  and  depositories,   for  security   purposes;   (4)
transportation  departments  for  highway  traffic  control,  bridge  and tunnel
monitoring,  and  airport,  subway,  bus and  seaport  surveillance;  (5) gaming
casinos, where video security is often mandated by local statute; and (6) health
care facilities, such as hospitals, particularly psychiatric wards and intensive
care units.  The Company  estimates that  approximately  50 percent of its total
revenues are sales for commercial and industrial uses.

The  Company's  principal  sales  offices  are  located in  Melville,  New York;
Atlanta, Georgia and Segensworth, England.

International Sales

The Company sells  internationally by direct export to dealers and distributors,
and, in Europe through the Company's United Kingdom (U.K.) subsidiary. In fiscal
1995,  the  operating  profit and  identifiable  assets for the  Company's  U.K.
subsidiary  amounted to approximately  $573,000 and $5.2 million,  respectively.
For  more  information  regarding  foreign  operations,  see  Note 7 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. Direct export sales
and sales from the Company's U.K.  subsidiary  amounted to $17.5 million,  $16.7
million and $16.1 million or 40%, 35% and 35% of consolidated revenues in fiscal
years  1995,  1994,  and 1993,  respectively.  Export  sales are made  through a
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Vicon  Industries  Foreign Sales  Corporation,  a tax
advantaged  foreign sales corporation.  The Company's  principal foreign markets
are Europe and the Far East,  which  together  accounted  for  approximately  83
percent  of  international  sales in  fiscal  1995.  Additional  information  is
contained in the discussion of foreign currency activity included in Item 7.

Competition

The  Company  competes  in areas of  price,  service,  product  performance  and
availability with several large and small public and  privately-owned  companies
in the  manufacture and  distribution of CCTV systems and components  (excluding
cameras,  monitors and video cassette  recorders  "Video  Products")  within the
security  industry.  The  Company's  Video  Products  compete  with  many  large
companies  whose financial  resources and scope of operations are  substantially
greater  than  the  Company's.  The  Company  is  one of a few  domestic  market
suppliers that design,  assemble,  manufacture,  market and support an extensive
line of products  offering a comprehensive  system capability in a wide range of
applications. Many competitors, including manufacturers of cameras, monitors and
recorders,  typically  produce a  limited  product  line  since  components  and
accessories are low volume items.  The Company  believes a broad product line is
desirable since many customers prefer to obtain a complete video system from one
supplier with the assurance of product compatibility and reliability.  In recent
years,  price competition has intensified  limiting the amount of cost increases
the Company  can pass on to  customers  and in some  instances  requiring  price
reductions.

Research and Development

The  Company is  engaged  in ongoing  research  and  development  activities  in
connection  with new or  existing  products.  Changes  in CCTV  technology  have
incorporated the use of advanced  electronic  components and new materials which
add to product life and performance.  Twenty-one  professional  employees devote
full time to the  development of new products and to improving the qualities and
capabilities of existing products.  Further, the Company engages the services of
others to assist in the development of new products.  Expenditures  for research
and  development  amounted to  approximately  $1,900,000 in 1995,  $1,600,000 in
1994, and $1,600,000 in 1993 or approximately  4.2% of revenues in 1995, 3.4% of
revenues 1994, and 3.5% of revenues in 1993.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

The Company has not experienced shortages or significant difficulty in obtaining
its raw materials,  components or purchased finished products. Raw materials are
principally  aluminum,  steel and plastics,  while components are mainly motors,
video  lenses and  standard  electronic  parts.  In 1995,  the Company  procured
directly and  indirectly  approximately  19% of its product  purchases from Chun
Shin  Electronics,  Inc.,  its Korean  joint  venture  (see Item 13 for  further
discussion of the Korean joint  venture).  The Company is not dependent upon any
other single source for a significant amount of its raw materials, components or
purchased finished products.

Patents and Trademarks

The  Company  owns a limited  number of design and utility  patents  expiring at
various times and has several  patent  applications  pending with respect to the
design  and/or  mechanical  function  of its  products.  The Company has certain
trademarks  registered and several other trademark  applications pending both in
the United  States and in Europe.  The Company has no  licenses,  franchises  or
concessions  with  respect to any of its  products  or  business  dealings.  The
Company  does not deem its  patents  and  trademarks,  or the lack of  licenses,
franchises  and  concessions,  to be of  substantial  significance  or to have a
material effect on its business.





                           - 4 -


<PAGE>




Inventories

The  Company  maintains  an  inventory  of  finished   products   sufficient  to
accommodate   its   customers'   requirements,   since   most   sales   are   to
dealer/contractors  who  do  not  carry  large  stock  inventories.   Parts  and
components  inventories  are also  carried in  sufficient  quantities  to permit
prompt  delivery of certain  items.  The Company  would  rather  carry  adequate
inventory quantities than experience shortages which detract from the production
process and sales effort. The Company's business is not seasonal.

Backlog

The backlog of orders  believed to be firm as of September 30, 1995 and 1994 was
approximately  $2.7  million  and $3.0  million,  respectively.  All  orders are
cancelable  without  penalty at the option of the customer.  The Company prefers
that its  backlog of orders not exceed its  ability to fulfill  such orders on a
timely basis, since experience shows that long delivery schedules only encourage
the Company's customers to look elsewhere for product availability.

Employees

At September 30, 1995,  the Company  employed 175 full-time  employees,  of whom
five are officers, 50 administrative personnel, 65 employed in sales capacities,
25 in  engineering,  and 30 production  employees.  At September  30, 1994,  the
Company  employed 185 persons  categorized  in similar  proportions  to those of
1995.  There are no collective  bargaining  agreements with any of the Company's
employees and the Company considers its relations with its employees to be good.

ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES

In January  1988,  the  Company  sold and  subsequently  leased back its 108,000
square foot headquarters facility in Melville,  New York, which accommodates the
Company's sales, distribution,  administration,  product development and limited
assembly and manufacturing  operations.  Currently, the Company subleases 28,000
sq. ft. of its facility  under an agreement  which expires on February 28, 1997.
In November  1994,  the Company  entered into a sublease  agreement  dated as of
January 1, 1993, which gives a company affiliated with its landlord the right to
occupy  approximately  25,000 sq. ft. of its primary operating facility with two
months notice in exchange for specified rent payments  through the expiration of
the primary lease in 1998. In connection with such  agreement,  the landlord and
the  subtenant  were each  granted  an option to ask the  Company  to vacate the
entire  premises with six months  notice and the landlord  agreed to release the
Company  from all future  obligations  under its lease in  exchange  for a lease
termination payment by the Company. (See Notes 3 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  included elsewhere herein for further  information).  The
Company  believes  that this  facility  is  adequate  to  support  its near term
operating plans. The Company also operates, under lease, a regional sales office
in Atlanta,  Georgia. In addition,  the Company owns a 14,000 square foot sales,
service and warehouse  facility in southern  England which services the U.K. and
European Community markets.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal Year 1995 Compared with 1994

Net sales for 1995 were $43.8 million,  a decrease of 8.1%,  compared with $47.7
million in 1994. The sales decline was the result of lower  domestic  shipments,
while foreign sales increased $.8 million to $17.5 million.  Domestic sales were
affected by several factors such as direct end user selling by competition; lack
of  competitiveness  of certain  products  whose cost is denominated in yen; and
shortened  product life cycles which made certain of the  Company's  key control
systems  less  competitive.  The backlog of orders was $2.7 million at September
30, 1995 compared with $3.0 million at September 30, 1994.

Gross  profit  margins were 21.8% of net sales in 1995,  compared  with 22.5% in
1994.  The margin  decline was due  principally  to the impact of lower sales in
relation to a substantially fixed overhead structure.  In addition, the value of
the dollar declined  significantly against the Japanese yen for most of the year
which lowered margins of those products sourced in Japan.

Operating  expenses in 1995 totaled $9.8 million  compared  with $9.9 million in
1994. Operating expenses,  as a percent of sales, amounted to 22.4% and 20.7% in
1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The increase in expenses as a percent of sales is
due in part to higher bad debt expense,  severance  pay,  bank and  professional
fees.

During  1994,  the  Company  incurred an  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gain of
$45,000.   This  gain  resulted  from  the  Company's  revaluation  of  its  yen
denominated  mortgage  obligation into U.S.  dollars as the value of the British
pound sterling gained against the Japanese yen during the year.

Interest expense increased $230,000 as a result of higher interest rates.

The net loss of $1.3 million compared with a profit of $45,000 was the result of
lower sales and gross margins and higher interest expenses as discussed above.

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal Year 1994 Compared with 1993

Net sales for 1994 were $47.7 million,  an increase of 3.9%, compared with $45.9
million in 1993. The sales growth  resulted  primarily  from increased  sales in
Europe.  The backlog of orders was $3.0 million at September  30, 1994  compared
with $4.1  million at September  30,  1993.  This decline is the result of lower
domestic and export sales bookings in 1994.

Gross  profit  margins were 22.5% of net sales in 1994,  compared  with 20.2% in
1993.  In 1993,  the  Company's  cost of  products  sourced  in Japan  increased
significantly  as a result of a severe  decline in the value of the U.S.  dollar
compared  with the  Japanese  yen.  Also,  a decline in the value of the British
pound versus the U.S.  dollar further  reduced  margins on U.S.  sourced product
sales in Europe.  In 1994,  the value of the dollar  continued to weaken against
the  Japanese yen but to a lesser  extent than in 1993.  The Company was able to
substantially offset the effects of this further decline by securing U.S. dollar
based purchase agreements to cover most of the year's yen based product purchase
commitments.  During  1994,  the  Company  began  shifting  product  sourcing to
suppliers  transacting  in more stable and favorable  currencies.  Further,  the
value of the  British  pound  increased  against  the U.S.  dollar in 1994 which
increased margins on U.S. sourced product sales in Europe.  The Company was also
able to reduce its  indirect  manufacturing  expenses  in 1994 while  increasing
product production, thus increasing product margins. Finally, prior year margins
were  adversely  impacted  by the  recognition  of a $450,000  provision  to the
estimated realizable value of certain discontinued product parts and components.
Such  provision  accounted  for  approximately  1% of the 1994 increase in gross
profit margins.

Operating  expenses in 1994 totaled $9.9 million  compared with $10.3 million in
1993. Operating expenses,  as a percent of sales, amounted to 20.7% and 22.5% in
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The decline in expenses was principally the result
of an ongoing cost control program.

During 1994, the Company incurred an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $45,000
compared  with a loss of $262,000 in 1993.  This gain or loss  results  from the
Company's  revaluation  of its yen  denominated  mortgage  obligation  into U.S.
dollars.  The  decrease  in the loss was due to the  relative  stability  of the
British pound sterling against the Japanese yen during the year.

Interest  expense  increased by $224,000 in 1994 as a result of higher  interest
rates and higher borrowing levels.

Pretax  income  improved  approximately  $1.9  million as a result of  increased
sales, higher gross margins and lower operating expenses as discussed above.

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

September 30, 1995 Compared with 1994

Total shareholders' equity was approximately $8.6 million at September 30, 1995,
despite a net loss of $1.3 million in fiscal 1995.  Working capital  declined by
approximately  $2.6 million to $10.7 million at September 30, 1995.  The decline
was principally due to the operating loss and accelerated paydown of $.9 million
of long term bank debt.

Accounts  receivable  decreased  approximately  $1.4  million to $8.4 million at
September  30, 1995.  The decrease was the result of lower fourth  quarter sales
and improved  receivable  turnover.  Inventories  declined $1.4 million to $12.1
million  at  September  30,  1995.  Finished  products  at  the  Company's  U.K.
subsidiary  decreased $.8 million  while raw material and component  inventories
accounted for the remaining inventory decline as the Company moved production to
its off-shore plant and domestic contract  manufacturers.  Accounts payable to a
related party, Chugai Boyeki Co., Ltd., increased  approximately $1.2 million to
$6.9 million at September 30, 1995 in support of the Company's repayment of bank
debt.

The Company has a revolving line of credit of 700,000 pounds  sterling  (approx.
$1.1 million) in the U.K. to support local cash  requirements.  At September 30,
1995,  borrowings under this agreement were  approximately  $907,000,  which was
used for general working capital purposes.

In December 1994, the Company  extended its bank revolving  credit  agreement to
October 1995.  Borrowings under such agreements  amounted to approximately  $2.8
million and $4.5 million,  respectively,  at September 30, 1995 and 1994,  which
was used principally for U.S. working capital  purposes.  At September 30, 1995,
the  Company  was in default of certain  covenants  under the  agreement  and on
December 28, 1995 repaid the entire loan with the proceeds of a new bank loan.

The new two year loan  agreement  provides for maximum  borrowings of $3,250,000
through  June 30, 1996 and  $4,000,000  thereafter,  subject to an  availability
formula based on accounts  receivable and  inventories.  Concurrent with the new
loan agreement,  the Company amended its $2,000,000 secured promissory note with
Chugai Boyeki Co., Ltd., a related party, to defer all scheduled installments to
July  1998.  The  Company  believes  that the new loan  agreement  and its other
sources  of  credit  provide  adequate  funding  to  meet  its  near  term  cash
requirements.

Foreign Currency Activity

The  Company's  foreign  exchange   exposure  is  principally   limited  to  the
relationship  of the U.S.  dollar  to the  Japanese  yen and the  British  pound
sterling.

Japan sourced products  denominated in Japanese yen accounted for  approximately
19 percent of product  purchases in fiscal 1995.  In recent years the dollar has
weakened  dramatically in relation to the yen,  resulting in increased costs for
such products.  When market  conditions  permit,  cost increases due to currency
fluctuations  are passed on to customers  through price  increases.  The Company
also attempts to reduce the impact of an  unfavorable  exchange  rate  condition
through cost  reductions  from its suppliers,  lowering  production cost through
product redesign, and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more
stable and favorable currencies.  During the period from the second half of 1993
through July 1994, the Company was granted  dollar based pricing  through Chugai
Boyeki  Co.,  Ltd.,  its  Japanese  supplier.  Subsequent  to this  period,  the
Company's  purchases  have been  denominated  in  Japanese  yen.  However,  this
supplier,  at  the  Company's  direction,  has  entered  into  foreign  exchange
contracts on behalf of the Company to hedge the currency  risk on these  product
purchases.

Sales to the  Company's  U.K.  subsidiary,  which  approximated  $4.3 million in
fiscal 1995, are made in pounds sterling and include  products  sourced from the
Far East.  In the years when the pound has  weakened  significantly  against the
U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, the cost of U.S. and Japanese sourced product sold
by  the  Company's  U.K.  subsidiary  has  increased.   When  market  conditions
permitted,  such cost  increases  were passed on to the customer  through  price
increases.   The  Company   attempts  to  minimize  its  currency   exposure  on
intercompany  sales through the purchase of forward exchange  contracts to cover
unpaid receivables.

The Company  intends to increase  prices and seek lower prices from suppliers to
mitigate exchange rate exposures,  however,  there can be no assurance that such
steps will be effective in limiting foreign currency exposure.

Inflation

The impact of  inflation on the Company has lessened in recent years as the rate
of inflation  declined.  However,  inflation  continues to increase costs to the
Company.  As operating expenses and production costs increase,  the Company,  to
the  extent  permitted  by  competition,   recovers  these  increased  costs  by
increasing prices to its customers.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

The  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board of  Directors  consists  of  Messrs.
Neumann,  Robertson and Wallace,  none of whom are or ever have been officers of
the Company, except Mr. Wallace who retired in 1990 as Executive Vice President.
See the  section  entitled  "Certain  Relationships  and  Related  Transactions"
included  elsewhere  herein,  for a discussion  of certain  other  relationships
maintained by Mr. Neumann and Mr. Robertson with the Company.



            BOARD COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT


The Compensation  Committee's  compensation policies applicable to the Company's
executive  officers for the last completed fiscal year were to pay a competitive
market price for the services of such officers,  taking into account the overall
performance  and  financial  capabilities  of  the  Company  and  the  officer's
individual level of performance.

Mr. Darby makes  recommendations  to the  Compensation  Committee as to the base
salary and  incentive  compensation  of all  executive  officers  other than Mr.
Darby.  The Committee  reviews these  recommendations  with Mr. Darby, and after
such review, determines compensation. In the case of Mr. Darby, the Compensation
Committee makes its  determination  after direct  negotiation with such officer.
For each executive  officer,  the  Committee's  determinations  are based on the
committee's  conclusions  concerning  each officer's  performance and comparable
compensation  levels in the CCTV Industry and the Long Island area for similarly
situated  officers at other  companies.  The overall level of performance of the
Company is taken into account but is not specifically related to the base salary
of these  executive  officers.  Also,  the Company has  established an incentive
compensation plan for all of its executive officers,  which provides a specified
bonus  to  each  officer  upon  the  Company's  achievement  of  certain  annual
profitability targets.

The  Compensation  Committee  grants  options to  executive  officers to connect
compensation to the  performance of the Company.  Options are exercisable in the
future at the fair market value at the time of grant, so that an officer granted
an option is rewarded by the increase in the price of the Company's  stock.  The
Committee  grants  options based on  significant  contributions  of an executive
officer to the performance of the Company.

In addition,  in determining  the salary  compensation  of Mr. Darby as CEO, the
Committee  considered  the  responsibility  assumed  by him in  formulating  and
implementing a management and operating restructuring plan.

Other Matters - Form S-8 Undertaking

For the purposes of complying  with the  amendments to the rules  governing Form
S-8 (effective  July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned
registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated
by reference into registrant's  Registration Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 33-7892
(filed  June 30,  1986),  33-34349  (filed  April 1, 1990) and  33-90038  (filed
February 24, 1995):

Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of  1933  and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the  event  that a  claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant  in the  successful  defense of any action,  suit or  proceeding)  is
asserted by such director,  officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being  registered,  the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,  submit to a court
of appropriate  jurisdiction the question whether such  indemnification by it is
against  public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP




               Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Vicon Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Vicon Industries,  Inc.
and  subsidiaries  as listed in Part IV, item 14(a)(1).  In connection  with our
audits  of the  consolidated  financial  statements,  we also have  audited  the
financial  statement  schedule  as  listed  in Part  IV,  item  14(a)(2).  These
consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  statement  schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  financial  statement
schedule based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Vicon Industries,
Inc. and  subsidiaries  at September 30, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  September 30, 1995,  in conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.  Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein.

VICON INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Fiscal Years ended September 30, 1995, 1994, and 1993


NOTE 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of Vicon Industries,
Inc. (the Company) and its wholly owned  subsidiaries,  Vicon Industries Foreign
Sales Corp., a Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Vicon Industries (U.K.), Ltd.
after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues are  recognized  when  products are sold and title is passed to a third
party, generally at the time of shipment.

Inventories

Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (on a moving  average  basis  which
approximates a first-in, first-out method) or market. When it is determined that
a product or product  line will be sold below  carrying  cost,  affected on hand
inventories are written down to their estimated net realizable values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and include expenditures for
replacements or major improvements. Depreciation, which includes amortization of
assets under capital leases,  is computed by the  straight-line  method over the
estimated  useful lives of the related assets for financial  reporting  purposes
and on an accelerated  basis for income tax purposes.  Machinery,  equipment and
vehicles  are being  depreciated  over periods  ranging from 2 to 10 years.  The
Company's  building is being depreciated over a period of 40 years and leasehold
improvements  are amortized over the lesser of their  estimated  useful lives or
the remaining lease term.


Research and Development

Product research and development costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred,
and amounted to  approximately  $1,900,000,  $1,600,000 and $1,600,000 in fiscal
1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share are computed  based on the weighted  average number of shares
outstanding  and  equivalent  shares from  dilutive  stock  options,  if any, of
2,763,000 in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign  currency  translation  is performed  utilizing  the current rate method
under which assets and  liabilities  are  translated at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date,  while revenues,  costs,  and expenses are translated at the
average  exchange  rate for the  reporting  period.  The  resulting  translation
adjustment  of  $(125,056)  and  $(62,595)  at  September  30,  1995  and  1994,
respectively,  is recorded as a component of shareholders' equity.  Intercompany
balances not deemed  long-term in nature at the balance sheet date resulted in a
translation  gain of  $46,893,  $46,216,  and $43,527 in 1995,  1994,  and 1993,
respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales.

Income Taxes

In fiscal 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 109,  "Accounting  for Income Taxes",  which requires  recognition of
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax  consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method,  deferred tax  liabilities  and assets are determined  based on the
difference  between  the  financial  statement  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities  using  enacted  tax  rates in  effect  for the  year in  which  the
differences are expected to be recovered or settled (see Note 5).

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been  reclassified  to conform with current year
presentation.

NOTE 2.  Investment in Affiliate

The  Company's  50 percent  ownership  in Chun Shin  Electronics,  Inc., a joint
venture  company  which  assembles  certain  Vicon  products in South Korea,  is
accounted for using the equity  method which  reflects the cost of the Company's
investment adjusted for the Company's proportionate share of earnings or losses.
Such earnings or losses have been  insignificant  during each of the three years
ended  September  30,  1995.   Assets  and  sales  of  the  joint  venture  were
approximately $2.6 million and $6.6 million,  respectively,  for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 1995. The significant portion of joint venture product sales
were to related parties including approximately $19,000 directly to the Company;
approximately $5.1 million  indirectly to the Company through I.I.I.  Companies,
Inc., a related party; and  approximately  $1.2 million to Chun Shin Industries,
Inc., also a related party (see Note 11).

NOTE 3.  Deferred Gain on Sale and Leaseback

In fiscal  1988,  under a sale and  leaseback  agreement,  the Company  sold its
principal operating facility in Melville, New York for approximately $11 million
and leased it back under a ten-year lease agreement. The transaction resulted in
a net gain of  $3,321,000  which was  deferred and is being  amortized  over the
ten-year lease period.

NOTE 4.  Short-Term Borrowings

Borrowings under the Company's  revolving credit agreement  represent short term
borrowings by the Company's U.K.  subsidiary.  Maximum  borrowings  during 1995,
1994 and 1993 amounted to approximately  $1,083,000,  $1,123,000,  and $494,000,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  interest rate on  borrowings  during these
years was 8 1/2% in 1995, 7 1/4% in 1994, and 8 1/4% in 1993.

At  September  30,  1995 and 1994,  Accounts  Payable - related  party  included
approximately $4.5 million and $4.3 million,  respectively, of extended accounts
payable balances due Chugai Boyeki Company,  Ltd. The extended  accounts payable
balance at September 30, 1995 includes  approximately  $4.0 million of purchases
denominated in Japanese yen which bear interest at the related party's  internal
lending  rate  (4.25%  at  September  30,  1995).  The  remaining  balances  are
denominated  in U.S.  dollars and bear interest at their U.S.  bank's prime rate
(8.75% at September 30,1995).

In October 1993,  the Company  issued a $2,000,000  secured  promissory  note to
Chugai Boyeki Co., Ltd., a related  party.  The note is  subordinated  to senior
bank debt with regard to liens and interest under certain conditions. Subsequent
to year end, the Company amended the note to defer all scheduled installments to
July 1998.  Accordingly,  such amounts have been  classified as long-term in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

At September  30, 1995,  the Company was a party to a secured  Revolving  Credit
Agreement  with two banks which  provided for  aggregate  maximum  borrowings of
$2,800,000  subject to an  availability  formula  based on accounts  receivable.
Borrowings under the Credit  Agreement were due in October,  1995, with interest
at 3% above the banks' prime rate (11.75% at September 30,  1995),  and required
no compensating  balances.  At September 30, 1995, the Company was in default of
certain  financial  covenants  under  this  agreement.  Such debt was  repaid on
December  28,  1995  with the  proceeds  received  under a new two  year  credit
agreement with another bank which provides for maximum  borrowings of $3,250,000
through  June 30, 1996 and  $4,000,000  thereafter,  subject to an  availability
formula based on accounts  receivable and inventory  balances.  Borrowings under
the  agreement  bear  interest  at the bank's  prime  rate plus 1.25%  (9.75% at
December 27, 1995).

The bank debt contains restrictive covenants which, among other things,  require
the  Company to maintain  certain  levels of net worth,  earnings  and ratios of
interest  coverage and debt to net worth.  Borrowings under these agreements are
secured by substantially all assets of the Company.

Long-term  debt  maturing in each of the four years  subsequent to September 30,
1995  approximates  $221,000 in 1996,  $220,000 in 1997,  $4,973,000 in 1998 and
$145,000 in 1999, respectively.

In  November  1986,  the Board of  Directors  declared a  dividend  of one Stock
Purchase  Right for each share of common stock  outstanding on December 1, 1986.
In  addition,   385,715  Rights  were   distributed   with  certain  new  shares
subsequently  issued by the Company.  The Rights  entitle the holder to purchase
for  $15  one  share  of  common  stock  subject  to  adjustment  under  certain
conditions.  The Rights are  redeemable by the Company  until the  occurrence of
certain events at $.05 per Right.

NOTE 9.  Industry Segment and Major Customer

The Company operates in one industry and is engaged in the design,  manufacture,
assembly,  and  marketing of  closed-circuit  television  (CCTV)  equipment  and
systems for the CCTV segment of the security  products  industry.  The Company's
products  include all components of a video  surveillance  system such as remote
positioning devices,  cameras,  monitors,  video switchers,  housings,  mounting
accessories,  recording devices,  manual and motorized lenses,  controls,  video
signal  equipment,  and consoles for system  assembly.  No customer  represented
sales in excess of ten percent of consolidated  revenues during any of the three
fiscal years presented.

NOTE 10.  Commitments

In  January  1988,  the  Company  entered  into a sale and  leaseback  agreement
involving its  principal  operating  facility  (see Note 3). The ten-year  lease
provides for rent of $1,128,000 in the first year, increasing 4 percent annually
through 1998.

In November 1994, the Company entered into a sublease  agreement,  dated January
1, 1993,  with an affiliated  company of the landlord which provides for minimum
sublease payments to the Company of $120,000 in calendar year 1993;  $180,000 in
1994;  $240,000  in 1995 and  $300,000  per year from  January  1, 1996  through
January 19, 1998,  in exchange for the right to occupy a total of  approximately
25,000 sq. ft. of office and warehouse space in the Company's  primary operating
facility.  At the same time,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  with its
landlord and  subtenant  whereby the Company has agreed to vacate its  principal
operating  facility  at  anytime  after  January  1995,  at  the  landlord's  or
subtenant's  option, and the landlord has agreed to release the Company from its
future lease obligations in consideration of a lease termination  payment by the
Company to the landlord of  $1,000,000.  Such option,  if exercised,  would also
require the  landlord to provide  the  Company  with at least six months  notice
prior to the required vacate date. The lease termination payment will be reduced
by $27,778  for each month  after  January  31,  1995 that the  Company  remains
obligated under the primary lease. Should the landlord or subtenant exercise its
option,  the potential  charge to earnings will consist of relocation  costs and
the write-off of abandoned leasehold improvements. The lease termination payment
will be  substantially  offset  by the  then  remaining  carrying  value  of the
deferred sale and leaseback gain.

Additionally,  the Company occupies certain other facilities, or is contingently
liable,  under long-term  operating leases which expire at various dates through
1998. The leases, which cover periods from one to four years,  generally provide
for renewal options at specified rental amounts.  The aggregate  operating lease
commitment  (net of sublease  rental) at September 30, 1995 was $2,406,000  with
minimum  rentals  for  the  fiscal  years  shown  as  follows:   1996--$900,000;
1997--$1,121,000; 1998--$385,000.

The  Company is a party to  employment  agreements  with four  executives  which
provide  for,  among other  things,  the payment of  compensation  if there is a
change in control (as defined in the agreements). The contingent liability under
these  change in control  provisions  at  September  30, 1995 was  approximately
$1,485,000.  The total  compensation  payable under these agreements  aggregated
$1,675,000  at  September  30,  1995.  The  Company  is also a party to  insured
deferred  compensation  agreements  with two  retired  officers.  The  aggregate
remaining compensation payments of approximately  $1,114,000 as of September 30,
1995 are subject to the individuals adherence to certain non-compete convenants,
and are payable over a ten year period commencing upon retirement.

Sales to the  Company's  U.K.  subsidiary  are  denominated  in  British  pounds
sterling.  The  Company  attempts  to minimize  its  currency  exposure on these
intercompany  sales through the purchase of forward exchange  contracts to cover
unpaid  receivables.  These  contracts  generally  involve  the  exchange of one
currency for another at a future date and specified  exchange rate. At September
30, 1995, the Company had approximately $872,000 of outstanding forward exchange
contracts to sell British  pounds.  Such  contracts  expire at varying dates and
exchange rates through December 27, 1995.

The Company's  purchases of Japanese sourced products through Chugai Boyeki Co.,
Ltd., a related party,  are  denominated in Japanese yen. At September 30, 1995,
Chugai had purchased,  on the Company's  behalf,  forward exchange  contracts to
purchase  approximately  380 million  Japanese yen to hedge the currency risk on
accounts payables  denominated in Japanese yen. Such contracts expire at varying
dates and exchange rates through June 1996.

NOTE 11:  Related Party Transactions

As of September 30, 1995 and 1994, Chugai Boyeki Company,  Ltd. ("Chugai") owned
548,715  shares of the  Company's  common stock (19.9% of the total  outstanding
shares).  The  Company,  which has been  conducting  business  with  Chugai  for
approximately 16 years, imports certain finished products and components through
Chugai and also sells its products to Chugai who resells the products in certain
Asian and European markets.  The Company purchased  approximately  $11.6, $14.1,
and $14.6 million of products and  components  from Chugai in fiscal years 1995,
1994, and 1993, respectively,  and the Company sold $3.4, $3.5, and $4.5 million
of product to Chugai for  distribution  in fiscal  years 1995,  1994,  and 1993,
respectively.  At September 30, 1995 and 1994, the Company owed $6.9 million and
$5.8  million,  respectively,  to Chugai and Chugai owed  $92,000 and  $157,000,
respectively,  to the Company resulting from purchases of products.  The amounts
owed to Chugai  are  secured by a  subordinated  lien on  substantially  all the
Company's assets. During fiscal 1989, Chugai made a mortgage loan to the Company
in the amount of  $1,026,000  to  partially  finance the  construction  of a new
sales/distribution facility in the U.K. In October 1993, the Company borrowed $2
million from Chugai under a promissory note agreement.  See Note 6 for a further
discussion of this transaction.

As of  September  30, 1995,  Mr. Chu S. Chun  controlled  168,957  shares of the
Company's  common stock (6.1% of the total  outstanding  shares).  Mr. Chun owns
Chun Shin Industries,  Inc., the Company's 50% Korean joint venture partner, and
Chun Shin Electronics. (CSE) which purchases product from the joint venture (see
Note 2). During 1994, the Company entered into a supplier  agreement with I.I.I.
Companies,  Inc. (I.I.I.),  a U.S. based company controlled by Mr. Chun, whereby
I.I.I.  arranges the  importation  and provides  short term financing on all the
Company's product purchases from Chun Shin Electronics, Inc. During fiscal years
1995 and 1994, the Company purchased approximately $5.1 million and $3.1 million
of  products  from  I.I.I.  under this  agreement.  Further,  the  Company  sold
approximately  $900,000 and $1.1 million of its products to I.I.I. during fiscal
years 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  At September 30, 1995 and 1994, I.I.I. owed
the Company approximately $422,000 and $289,000, respectively.

The Company has not declared or paid cash  dividends on its common stock for any
of the foregoing  periods.  Additionally,  certain loan agreements  restrict the
payment of any cash dividends in future periods.

Because of changes in the number of common shares  outstanding  and market price
fluctuations  affecting outstanding stock options, the sum of quarterly earnings
per share may not equal the earnings per share for the full year.

facility  under which the  Borrower  may request  Loans from time to time on any
Business  Day during the  Commitment  Period in an  aggregate  principal  amount
which, together with the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Loans to
the  Borrower  and the  aggregate  face  amount of all  Letters  of Credit  then
outstanding, would not exceed at any time outstanding the Commitment. The amount
available for Loans at any time shall be  determined in accordance  with Section
2.02 hereof.

               (b)    Letter of Credit Facility.  A letter of credit
facility in accordance with the terms of Article 2A hereof.

        Section 2.02.  Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions  hereof,  the
Bank agrees to make Loans to the Borrower  from its Lending  Office from time to
time during the Commitment  Period as provided in this Agreement in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding, together with the then outstanding
aggregate  principal  amount of all  Letters  of  Credit,  not to exceed (i) the
Commitment,  or (ii) if less,  the  Formula  Amount.  The  Borrower  may use the
Commitment during the Commitment Period by borrowing, repaying Loans in whole or

amount  of the  Loans  at any  one  time  outstanding  together  with  the  then
outstanding  aggregate  principal  amount of all  Letters of  Credit,  shall not
exceed the amount  permitted  under the first sentence of this Section 2.02. The
Loans shall mature on the Commitment  Expiration  Date and bear interest for the
period from the  respective  Borrowing  Dates  thereof to the date of payment in
full  thereof  on  the  unpaid  principal  amount  thereof  from  time  to  time
outstanding at the applicable interest rates per annum determined and payable as
specified in Section 2.04 hereof.

        Section 2.03.  Procedure for Borrowings.  (a) Each Loan shall be made on
the request made by the Borrower to the Bank. Each such request shall be, should
the Bank request,  confirmed  immediately in writing, by delivery of a Notice of
Revolving Loan Borrowing,  in the form of Exhibit B hereto,  specifying  therein
(i) the  requested  Borrowing  Date and (ii) the  aggregate  amount of the Loans
therein  requested to be made.  Upon receipt of the request for  borrowing,  the
Bank shall make the proceeds of the requested  Loan available to the Borrower by
crediting  the account of the  Borrower on the books of its Lending  Office with
the  requested  amount.  The Bank shall  render to the  Borrower  monthly a loan
account  statement.  Each statement shall be considered correct and binding upon
Borrower,  except to the extent that the Bank receives,  within thirty (30) days
after the  mailing  of such  statement,  written  notice  from  Borrower  of any
specific exceptions by Borrower to that statement.

        (b)   The obligations of the Borrower to pay the principal
of and interest on all Loans shall be evidenced by the Note duly

                                              15

<PAGE>



executed and  delivered by the Borrower  substantially  in the form of Exhibit C
hereto.  At the time of each Loan,  and upon each  payment of  principal of each
Loan,  the Bank  shall,  and is hereby  authorized  to,  make a notation  on the
schedule annexed to and constituting a part of the Note of the Borrower to which
such Loan is being made,  and any such notation  shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes absent manifest error;  provided,  however, that failure by the
Bank to make any such notation shall not affect the  obligations of the Borrower
under the Note or this Agreement.

        Section 2.04.  Interest.

        (a) Rate of  Interest.  Each Loan  shall  bear  interest  on the  unpaid
principal  amount  thereof  from the date such Loan is extended to the  Borrower
until  such  principal  amount  is paid in full  at a rate or  rates  per  annum
determined in accordance  with this Section 2.04.  Each Loan shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (A) the Base Rate in effect from time to
time, plus (B) the Applicable Margin,  payable monthly,  in arrears, on the last
Business  Day of each such  month,  commencing  with the first of such  dates to
occur after the date of such Base Rate Loan and on the date the principal amount
of such Loan shall be paid or prepaid,  to the extent of the interest accrued on
the principal  amount of such Base Rate Loan so paid or prepaid.  From and after
the occurrence of any Event of Default under Section 10.01(a) hereof, and for so
long as such Event of Default shall  continue,  the unpaid  principal  amount of
each Loan and any other  amount then due and payable but not yet paid  hereunder
shall bear  interest  at a rate per annum  equal to the rate per annum in effect
from time to time with  respect to the Loan,  plus two  percent  (2%) per annum,
payable on demand.

        (b)  Calculation of Interest.  Interest shall be calculated on the daily
outstanding  amount of the Loans on the basis of a 360-day  year for the  actual
number of days  elapsed.  Any  change in the  interest  rate on the Loans  shall
become  effective  as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
in the Base Rate  becomes  effective.  The Bank shall,  as soon as  practicable,
notify the Borrower of the effective  date and the amount of each such change in
the Base  Rate;  provided,  however,  that any  failure  by the Bank to give the
Borrower any such notice shall not affect the  application of such change in the
Base Rate.  Each  determination  of an interest rate by the Bank pursuant to any
provision of this  Agreement  shall be, absent  manifest  error,  presumed to be
correct.

        Section 2.05 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank and to
reimburse and hold the Bank harmless from any loss,  liability,  cost or expense
(including, without limitation,  reasonable in-house and outside attorney's fees
and expenses incurred in connection with any action or proceeding between the

                                              16

Borrower  and the Bank or between  the Bank and any third  party or  otherwise),
that the Bank may  sustain  or incur  as a  consequence  of (a)  default  by the
Borrower in the payment of principal  of, or interest on, any Loan,  (b) default

prepayment  after notice thereof has been given in accordance  with Section 2.06
or 2.07 hereof;  including,  but not limited to, all losses,  costs and expenses
incurred by reason of  liquidation  or  reemployment  of deposits or other funds
acquired  by the  Bank  in  connection  with  such  matters  (including  loss of
anticipated  profits caused by such liquidation or redeployment of such deposits
or funds); provided; however; that the Borrower shall not have any obligation to
the Bank under this  Section  2.05 for any losses,  costs or  expenses  directly
caused by or resulting solely form the willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Bank.  The Bank shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate as to the amount
of such loss, liability,  cost or expense, which certificate shall be conclusive
in absence of manifest  error.  This covenant shall survive payment of the Loans
and termination of this Agreement.

        Section  2.06.  Mandatory  Prepayments  of  Loans.  If at any  time  the
aggregate unpaid  principal  amount of the Loans  outstanding plus the aggregate
face  amount of any  Letters  of Credit  outstanding  exceeds  the lessor of the
Commitment or the Formula  Amount,  the Borrower  shall  immediately  repay such
Loans,  without premium or penalty, in a principal amount at least equal to such
excess,  together  with  accrued  interest on the amount  prepaid to the date of
repayment.  Prepayments  of Loans may be reborrowed as Loans in accordance  with
the terms  hereof.  If at any time  following the repayment in full of the Loans
pursuant  to this  paragraph  2.06 the  aggregate  face amount of any Letters of
Credit  outstanding  exceeds the Formula Amount,  the Borrower shall immediately
pay to the Bank a principal  amount equal to such excess as cash  collateral for
such Letters of Credit.

        Section 2.07.  Optional Prepayments of the Loans.

        (a) The Borrower may voluntarily prepay any Loan in whole at any time or
in part from time to time, without premium or penalty.

prepayment of Loans, together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the
date of such prepayment, to

outstanding exceeds the amount of the Commitment as then reduced,  (ii) any such
termination of the Commitment  shall be accompanied by prepayment in full of all
Loans then  outstanding;  together with accrued  interest thereon to the date of
such prepayment and any unpaid commitment fee then accrued under Section 2.11(b)

the date of execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  and equal to one-half of

be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal,  interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable rate during such
extension;  provided,  however,  that no such  payments  shall extend beyond the
Commitment  Expiration  Date. The Borrower hereby  authorizes the Bank to charge

and including  principal and interest payable under the Note when it becomes due
and payable under the terms hereof or thereof.

        Section 2.10. Use of Loan Proceeds.  The Borrower shall use the proceeds
of the Loans to (i) refinance the Existing  Loans;  (ii) to fund the  continuing

prepayment  provisions  of this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that  upon the
occurrence  of an Event of  Default  the Bank  may  require  by a notice  to the
Borrower  immediate  payment to the Bank of the amount of the LOC  Reimbursement
Obligation  which  would then exist if all  outstanding  Letters of Credit  were

Borrower is in default under the provisions of this sentence of Section 2.02A at
the default rate stated in Section  2.04(a)(ii).  The  Borrower's  obligation to
reimburse the Bank in accordance  with the terms hereof for all payments made by
the Bank under each Letter of Credit and to pay interest on the unpaid amount of

corporation,  duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. The Borrower is duly qualified to
do  business  as  a  foreign  corporation  and  is  in  good  standing  in  each
jurisdiction (other than the state of its incorporation) in which the conduct of
its business or the  ownership or  operation of its  properties  or assets makes
such qualification necessary and in which the

                                              26

<PAGE>



failure  to be so  qualified  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its
management,  business,  assets, properties,  operations,  prospects or condition
(financial  or  other)  or on  the  ability  of  the  Borrower  to  perform  its
obligations  under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents to which it is
a party.  The Borrower has full power and  authority to own its  properties  and
assets and carry on its business as now conducted.

        Section 4.02. Power and Authorization.  (a) The Borrower has full power,
right and legal authority to execute,  deliver and perform its obligations under
this Agreement,  the Note and such of the other Related Documents to which it is
a party.  The Borrower has taken all corporate action necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of, and the  performance  of its  respective  obligations
under  such  documents  and  to  make  Borrowings  under  this  Agreement.  This
Agreement,  the Note and such of the other  Related  Documents  to which it is a
party,   constitute  legal,  valid  and  binding  obligations  of  the  Borrower
enforceable  against it in accordance with their respective terms subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium or
similar  laws  affecting  the rights of creditors  generally.  No consent of any
person, and no consent, license,  approval or authorization,  or registration or
declaration  with,  any  governmental  authority,  bureau  or  agency,  which is
material to the ability of the  Borrower to perform its  obligations  under this
Agreement,  the Note or any of the Related  Documents to which it is a party, is
required  in  connection  with the  execution,  delivery or  performance  by the
Borrower of this Agreement,  the Note or the other Related Documents to which it
is a party, or the making of borrowings by the Borrower under this Agreement.

        Section 4.03. No Legal Bar. The execution,  delivery and  performance by
the Borrower of this Agreement, the Note and such of the other Related Documents
to which it is a party, and the making of borrowings  hereunder by the Borrower,
do not and will not (i) violate or  contravene  any  provisions  of any existing
law, statute,  rule, regulation or ordinance or of the Articles of Incorporation
or By-Laws of the  Borrower,  (ii) violate or  contravene  any  provision of any
order or decree of any court, governmental authority,  bureau or agency to which
the Borrower or any of its properties or assets is subject,  or of any mortgage,
indenture,  security  agreement,  contract,  undertaking  or other  agreement or
instrument to which the Borrower is a party or which purports to be binding upon
it or any of its properties or assets,  the violation or  contravention of which
would  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  management,  business,  assets,
properties,  operations,  prospects  or  condition  (financial  or other) of the
Borrower or (iii) result in the creation or  imposition  of any Lien,  charge or
encumbrance  on, or security  interest in, any of the properties of the Borrower
(other than as created pursuant to the Related Documents) pursuant to the

                                              27

individual  claim in excess of $50,000 or claims in the  aggregate  in excess of
$100,000, nor, to the best knowledge, upon due inquiry, of the Borrower is there
a valid basis for the initiation of any such litigation or proceeding.

transactions  contemplated hereby, the Borrower is solvent. For purposes of this
Section  4.05,  the  term  "solvent"  shall  mean  that,  at the  time  of  said

clear of any known defects except such defects as do not substantially interfere
with the continued use thereof in the conduct of normal operations, and are able
to serve the function for which they are  currently  being used,  except in each
case where the failure of such asset to meet such requirements would not have or
is not reasonably  likely to have a material  adverse effect on the  management,
business,  properties,  assets,  operations or condition (financial or other) of
the Borrower.

        Section  4.07.  The  Collateral.  The chief place of business  and chief

and clear of any lien, security interest charge

                                              28

valid,  perfected,  continuing and enforceable  security interest in and Lien on
the  Collateral  and such  security  interest  and Lien ranks prior to any other
security  interest  in or Lien  upon  the  Collateral,  except  as set  forth on

as otherwise permitted hereunder.

hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

        (b) The Bank may exercise in respect of the  Collateral,  in addition to
other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise  available to it, all
the rights and remedies of a secured party under  applicable law and also may do
any or all of the following:

                       (i) In  the  name  of the  Bank  or in  the  name  of the
        Borrower or otherwise,  demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or
        property at any time payable or  receivable on account of or in exchange
        for, or make any compromise or settlement  deemed desirable with respect
        to, any of the Collateral,  but the Bank shall be under no obligation so
        to do, and the Bank may extend the time of payment,  arrange for payment
        in installments,  or otherwise  modify the terms of, or release,  any of
        the  Collateral   without  thereby  incurring   responsibility   to,  or
        discharging or otherwise affecting any liability of, the Borrower.

                      (ii) Enter upon the premises,  or wherever the  Collateral
        may be, and take possession thereof, and maintain such possession on the
        Borrower's  premises,  or demand and receive  such  possession  from any
        person who has possession  thereof, or remove the Collateral or any part
        thereof,  to such other places as the Bank may desire,  without any obli
        gation to pay the Borrower for any use and occupancy of such premises.

                      (iii) Without notice except as specified below and with or
        without taking the possession  thereof,  sell, lease,  assign,  grant an
        option or options to purchase or otherwise  dispose of the Collateral or
        any part  thereof in one or more parcels at public or private  sale,  at
        any  location  chosen by the Bank,  for  cash,  on credit or for  future
        delivery,  and at such price or prices and upon such other  terms as the
        Bank may deem commercially reasonable.  The Borrower agrees that, to the
        extent  notice of sale  shall be  required  by law,  at least five days'
        notice to the  Borrower  of the time and place of any public sale or the
        time  after  which  any  private  sale  is to be made  shall  constitute
        reasonable notification, but notice given in any other reasonable manner
        or  at  any  other   reasonable   time   shall   constitute   reasonable
        notification.  The  Bank  shall  not be  obligated  to make  any sale of
        Collateral  regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Bank may
        adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by  announcement at
        the time and place fixed  therefor,  and such sale may,  without further
        notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  The
        Borrower  agrees  that the Bank shall  have no  obligation  to  preserve
        rights in the

                                              53

<PAGE>



        Collateral  against  prior parties or to marshal any Col lateral for the
        benefit  of any  Person.  The Bank is hereby  granted a license or other
        right  to  use,  without  charge,   the  Borrower's   labels,   patents,
        copyrights,  rights  of use of any name,  trade  secrets,  trade  names,
        trademarks and advertising  matter, or any property of a similar nature,
        as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing advertising for the sale
        of, and the selling of any Collateral,  and the Borrower's  rights under
        all licenses and franchise agreements shall inure to the Bank's benefit.

                        (iv) The Bank may, in  addition  to any other  rights it
        may have under this  Agreement or  otherwise,  appoint by  instrument in
        writing a receiver  or receiver  and  manager  (both of which are herein
        called  a  "Receiver")  of all  or any  part  of the  Collateral  or may
        institute  proceedings  in any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the
        appointment  of such a Receiver.  Any such  Receiver is hereby given and
        shall  have the same  powers  and  rights  as the  Bank has  under  this
        Agreement,  at law or in equity. In exercising any such powers, any such
        Receiver  shall  act as and for all  purposes  shall be deemed to be the
        agent of the Borrower and the Bank shall not be responsible  for any act
        or default of any such  Receiver  absent the gross  negligence or wilful
        misconduct of the Bank or the Receiver. The Bank may appoint one or more
        Receivers  hereunder  and may remove any such  Receiver or Receivers and
        appoint  another or other in his or their  stead from time to time.  Any
        Receiver so  appointed  may be an officer or  employee of the Bank.  The
        Borrower  agrees  that any  Receiver  appointed  by the Bank need not be
        appointed by, nor is his appointment  required to be ratified by nor his
        actions in any way supervised by, a court.

                       (v)  Apply,  without  notice,  any  cash  or  cash  items
        constituting  Collateral in the possession of the Bank  (constructive or
        otherwise) to payment of any of the obligations.

                      (vi) The Bank may carry on or concur  in the  carrying  on
        of, all or any part of the business or under takings of the Borrower and
        may, to the exclusion of all others, including the Borrower, enter upon,
        occupy  and  use  all  or any of the  premises,  buildings,  plants  and
        undertakings  of or occupied or used by the  Borrower and may use all or
        any of the  Collateral  of the  Borrower  for such time as the Bank sees
        fit,  free of charge,  to carry on the business of the Borrower  and, if
        applicable,  to manufacture or complete the manufacture of any Inventory
        and to pack and ship any Inventory.  The Bank shall not be liable to the
        Borrower for any negligence in so doing or in respect of any

                                              54

<PAGE>



        rent, charges, depreciation or damages incurred in
        connection with such actions.

        The Borrower  waives,  to the extent  permitted by  applicable  law, all
        rights of the  Borrower  to prior  notice  and  hearing  under any other
        applicable statute or constitution.

               (c) All cash proceeds received by the Bank in respect of any sale
of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral
may,  in the  discretion  of the Bank,  be held by the Bank as  Collateral  for,
and/or  then or at any time  thereafter  applied in whole or in part by the Bank
against  all or any part of the  Obligations  in such  order  as the Bank  shall
elect.  Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by the Bank and remaining
after payment in full of all the Obligations  shall be paid over to the Borrower
or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

and expenses (A) to pay or discharge taxes,  liens,  security interests or other
encumbrances  levied,  placed or threatened  against the  Collateral and (B) for
title and lien searches,  filing and recording fees and taxes, duplication costs

to the  relevant  taxation  authority  or other  authority  in  accordance  with
applicable law.

the execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  any of the Related  Documents or
any of the other instruments,  documents or agreements executed and/or delivered
in  connection  herewith or  therewith,  or any  payment  made  hereunder  or in
connection herewith (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Other Taxes").

               (d) The Borrower shall  indemnify the Bank for the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes (including,  without limitation,  any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed by any  jurisdiction  on  amounts  payable  by the  Borrower  under this
Section  11.04)  paid  by the  Bank  and  any  liability  (including  penalties,
interest,  and expenses) arising  therefrom or with respect thereto,  whether or
not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.

               (e) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement of
the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained

satisfaction of all other Obligations of the Borrower.

        Section  11.05.  Further  Assurances.  (a) At any time and from  time to
time,  upon the request of the Bank,  the Borrower  shall  execute,  deliver and

reasonably  request in order to effect  fully the intent  and  purposes  of this
Agreement and the Related Documents,  and any other agreements,  instruments and
documents  delivered  pursuant  hereto or in  connection  with the making of the
Loans,  in  proper  form for  recording  and  otherwise  in form  and  substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Bank and its counsel.

               (b) The Borrower  agrees that from time to time,  at its expense,
it shall promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and
take all further action, that may be necessary or appropriate,  or that the Bank
may  request,  in order to create,  evidence,  perfect or preserve  any security
interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or by any Related Document or
to enable the Bank to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies  hereunder or
under any Related Document with respect to any Collateral.

        Section  11.06.  Amendment  and Waiver.  No  amendment  or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any of the Related  Documents,  or any consent to
any departure by the Borrower therefrom,  shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing  and  signed by the Bank,  and then such  waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for
which  given.  Neither  any  failure  nor any  delay  on the part of the Bank in
exercising any right,  power or privilege  hereunder or under any of the Related
Documents shall

                                              58

preclude  any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other

shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in the same,
similar or other circumstances.

        Section 11.07.  Marshalling,  Recourse to Security:  Payments Set Aside.
The Bank shall not be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the
Borrower  or any  other  party or  against  or in  payment  of any or all of the
Obligations of the Borrower to the Bank hereunder or under the Related Documents
or  otherwise.  Recourse to security  shall not be required at any time.  To the
extent that the  Borrower  makes a payment or payments to the Bank,  or the Bank
enforces its security  interests  or  exercises  its rights of setoff,  and such
payment or payments or the  proceeds of such  enforcement  or setoff or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law,  common law or equitable  cause,
then to the extent of such recovery,  the obligation or part thereof  originally
intended to be satisfied,  and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be
revised and  continued  in full force and effect as if such payment had not been
made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.

        Section 11.08.  Dominion Over Cash;  Setoff.  (A) The Bank shall, at all
times,  have sole  dominion and control  over all bank  accounts of the Borrower
established  pursuant to the Lock-Box  Agreement  pursuant to the terms thereof.
The Borrower  shall take all action  requested  from time to time by the Bank as
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Section (A).

               (B) In  addition  to any rights and  remedies  of the Bank now or
hereafter  provided by law, the Bank shall have the right,  without prior notice
to the Borrower,  any such notice being ex pressly waived by the Borrower to the
extent   permitted  by  applicable   law,  on  the  occurrence  and  during  the
continuation  of any  Event  of  Default  to  set  off  and  apply  against  any
Obligation, whether matured or unmatured, of the Borrower, any amount owing from
the Bank to the  Borrower,  at or at any time  after the hap  pening of any such
Event of Default,  and such right of setoff may be exercised by the Bank against
the  Borrower  or  against  any  trustee  in  bankruptcy,  debtor-in-possession,
assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attach
ment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of setoff shall not have
been exercised by the Bank before the making, fil ing or issuance, or service on
the Bank of, or of notice of, any such event or proceeding.

        Section 11.09.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and

                                              59

<PAGE>



the Bank, and  thereafter  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower and the Bank and their  respective  successors  and assigns;  provided,
however,  that the  Borrower  shall  not have the  right to  assign  its  rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Bank.

        Section  11.10.  Applicable  Law.  This  Agreement  and the  rights  and
obligations  of the parties  hereunder  shall be governed by, and  construed and

without regard to its choice of law provisions.

        Section 11.11. Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury Trial. All judicial  proceedings  brought against the Borrower with respect
to this Agreement or any Related Document may be brought in any state or federal
court of competent  jurisdiction  in the State of New York and, by its execution
and  delivery  of this  Agreement,  the  Borrower  accepts,  for  itself  and in
connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally,  the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Borrower  irrevocably  consents to the
service  of process of any of the  aforementioned  courts in any such  action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies  thereof by  registered  or certified  mail,
postage prepaid,  to its notice address specified in Section 11.01 hereof,  such
service  to become  effective  five (5) days after such  mailing.  The  Borrower
irrevocably waives (a) trial by jury in any action or proceeding with respect to
this  Agreement  or any  Related  Document,  and (b) any  objection  (including,
without limitation, any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds
of forum non  conveniens)  which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of
any such action or  proceeding  with  respect to this  Agreement  or any Related
Document in any jurisdiction set forth above.

        Section 11.12. Performance of Obligations. The Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that the Bank may, but shall have no  obligation  to, make any payment or
perform any act  required of the  Borrower  under this  Agreement or any Related
Document  or take  any  other  action  which  the Bank in its  discretion  deems
necessary or desirable to protect or preserve the Collateral, including, without
liquidation,  any action to pay or discharge taxes, Liens, security interests or
other encumbrances levied or placed on or threaten any Collateral.

        Section 11.13. Assignment,  Participations. The Bank may, at any time or
times, assign (by novation), participate or syndicate its interests in the Loans
and/or Letters of Credit without  restriction.  The Borrower agrees to cooperate
with the Bank to effect  assignments  and/or  participations  made with  respect
hereto.

unenforceability  or   non-authorization   without  invalidating  the  remaining
provisions hereof or affecting the validity,  enforceability or legality of such

pledge, and the Pledgor has agreed to grant,  assign and pledge, to the Pledgee,
a continuing first priority  security  interest in and to all its rights,  title
and interests in the Pledged  Collateral (as hereinafter  defined) to secure all
of the obligations of the Pledgor to the Pledgee under the Credit Agreement, the
Note and the other Related Documents;

        NOW,  THEREFORE,   the  Pledgor,   intending  to  be  bound  hereby,  in
consideration of the premises hereof,  in order to induce the Pledgee to provide
the Loans under and in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and for
other good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged,  hereby agrees with, and for the benefit of, the Pledgee as
follows:

        SECTION 1. Pledge. The Pledgor hereby pledges and assigns to the Pledgee
and grants to the Pledgee a continuing first and prior security  interest in all

        SECTION 2.  Security for  Obligations.  This  Agreement  secures (a) the
indefeasible payment of all liabilities, obligations and indebtedness of any and
every  kind and nature  heretofore,  now or  hereafter  owing,  arising,  due or
payable from the Pledgor to the Pledgee  pursuant to the Credit  Agreement,  the
Note and all other  Related  Documents to which the Pledgor is a party,  however
evidenced,   created,  incurred,  acquired  or  owing,  whether  for  principal,
interest,  fees,  indemnification,  expenses or  otherwise,  whether  primary or
secondary,  direct or  indirect,  joint or  several,  contingent  or  fixed,  or
otherwise,  including,  without limitation,  obligations of performance,  now or

collectively  referred  to as the  "Obligations").  The  Pledgor and the Pledgee

                      (A) income,  dividends and  distributions  paid or payable
               other  than in cash in  respect  of,  and  instruments  and other

               of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Collateral;

                      (B)  income,  dividends  and other  distributions  paid or
               payable  in  cash  in  respect  of  any  Pledged   Collateral  in
               connection with a partial or total  liquidation or dissolution or
               in connection  with a reduction of contributed  capital,  capital
               surplus or paid-in-surplus; and

                      (C) cash paid, payable or otherwise distributed in respect
               of principal  of, or in  redemption  of, or in exchange  for, any
               Pledged Collateral,

        shall  be  forthwith  delivered  to the  Pledgee  to  hold  as,  Pledged
        Collateral and shall,  if received by the Pledgor,  be received in trust
        for the benefit of the Pledgee, be segregated from the other property or
        funds of the  Pledgor,  and be  forthwith  delivered  to the  Pledgee as
        Pledged  Collateral in the same form as so received  (with all necessary
        endorsements).

               (iii) The  Pledgee  shall  execute  and  deliver  (or cause to be
        executed  and  delivered)  to the  Pledgor  all such  proxies  and other
        instruments  as the  Pledgor may  reasonably  request for the purpose of
        enabling the Pledgor to exercise the voting and other rights which it is
        entitled  to  exercise  pursuant  to clause (i) above and to receive the
        income, dividends or interest payments which it is authorized to receive
        and retain pursuant to clause (ii) above.

        (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Acceleration Default:

               (i) All rights of the  Pledgor to  exercise  the voting and other
        consensual  rights  which it would  otherwise  be  entitled  to exercise
        pursuant to Section 6(a)(i) hereof and to receive the income,  dividends
        and  interest  payments  which they would  otherwise  be  authorized  to
        receive and retain

                                              68

<PAGE>



        pursuant to Section  6(a)(ii)  hereof shall  cease,  and all such rights
        shall  thereupon  become vested in the Pledgee who shall  thereupon have
        the sole right to exercise such voting and other  consensual  rights and
        to receive and hold as Pledged  Collateral  such income,  dividends  and
        interest payments.

               (ii) All  income,  dividends  and  interest  payments  which  are
        received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of clause (i) of this

        shall be  segregated  from  other  funds  of the  Pledgor  and  shall be
        forthwith  paid over to the  Pledgee as Pledged  Collateral  in the same
        form as so received (with all necessary endorsements).

        SECTION 7. Transfers and Other Liens; Additional Interests.  The Pledgor
hereby agrees that it will not (i) sell or otherwise  transfer or dispose of, or
grant any interest in or option with respect to, any of the Pledged  Collateral,

or encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Pledged Collateral, except for
the security interests under this Agreement and if allowed pursuant to the terms
of the Credit Agreement.

        SECTION 8. Litigation  Respecting the Pledged  Collateral.  In the event
any action, suit or other proceeding at law, in equity, in arbitration or before
any other authority  involving or affecting the Pledged Collateral becomes known
to or is  contemplated  by the  Pledgor,  the  Pledgor  shall  give the  Pledgee
immediate notice thereof and if the Pledgor is contemplating  such action,  suit
or other  proceeding,  the  Pledgor  shall be  required  to receive  the written
consent  of the  Pledgee  prior to  commencing  any such  action,  suit or other
proceeding, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

        SECTION 9. Pledgee  Appointed  Attorney-in-Fact.  (a) The Pledgor hereby
appoints the Pledgee (and any officer or agent of the Pledgee with full power of
substitution  and  revocation)  the Pledgor's true and lawful  attorney-in-fact,
coupled  with an  interest,  with full  authority  in the place and stead of the
Pledgor  and in the name of the Pledgor or  otherwise,  from time to time in the
Pledgee's discretion to (i) if an Acceleration  Default is continuing,  take any
action and to execute any  instrument  which the Pledgee may deem  necessary  or
advisable to  accomplish  the  purposes of this  Agreement,  including,  without
limitation,  (I) to receive, endorse and collect all instruments made payable to
the Pledgor  representing any income,  dividend or other distribution in respect
of the  Pledged  Collateral  or any part or  proceeds  thereof  and to give full
discharge for the same; and (II) to transfer the Pledged Collateral, in whole or
in part, to the name of the Pledgee or such other Person or Persons as the

                                              69

<PAGE>



Pledgee may  designate;  take  possession of and endorse any one or more checks,
drafts,  bills of  exchange,  money  orders or any other  documents  received on
account of the Pledged  Collateral;  collect,  sue for and give acquittances for
moneys  due  on  account  of the  foregoing;  withdraw  any  claims,  suits,  or
proceedings pertaining to or arising out of the foregoing; take any other action
contemplated  by this  Agreement;  and  sign,  execute,  acknowledge,  swear to,
verify, deliver, file, record and publish any one or more of the foregoing,  and
(ii) at any time  execute  and  record  or file on  behalf  of the  Pledgor  any
evidence  of  a  security  interest  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  any
refilings, continuations or extensions thereof.

               (b) The powers of  attorney  which  shall be granted pur suant to
Section 9(a) hereof and all  authority  thereby  conferred  shall be granted and
conferred  solely to protect the Pledgee's  interests in the Pledged  Collateral
and shall not impose any duty upon the attorney-in-fact to exercise such powers.
Such powers of attorney shall be irrevocable  prior to the indefeasible  payment
and  performance in full of the  Obligations  and shall not be terminated  prior
thereto or affected by any act of the Pledgor or by operation of law, including,
but not  limited to,  dissolution,  death,  disability  or  incompetency  of any
Person,  the termination of any trust, or the occurrence of any other event, and
if the  Pledgor  should  become  bankrupt,  insolvent,  or come under the direct
regulation of similar laws which affect the rights of creditors generally or any
other event should occur before the indefeasible payment and performance in full
of the  Obligations and  termination of the Credit  Agreement,  the Note and the
other Related  Documents,  such  attorney-in-fact  shall  nevertheless  be fully
authorized  to act  under  such  powers  of  attorney  as if such  event had not
occurred and regardless of notice thereof.

        SECTION 10.  Pledgee May  Perform.  If the Pledgor  fails to perform any
agreement contained herein, the Pledgee may itself perform, or cause performance
of, such  agreement,  and the  expenses of the  Pledgee  incurred in  connection
therewith shall be payable by the Pledgor under Section 13 hereof.

        SECTION  11.  Reasonable  Care.  The  Pledgee  shall be  deemed  to have
exercised  reasonable  care  in the  custody  and  preservation  of the  Pledged
Collateral in its  possession  if the Pledged Col lateral is accorded  treatment
substantially equal to that which the Pledgee accords its own property, it being
understood that the Pledgee shall not have any  responsibility for (i) ascertain
ing or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, ex changes, maturities,
tenders or other matters relative to any Pledged Collateral,  whether or not the
Pledgee has or is deemed to have  knowledge of such matters,  or (ii) taking any
necessary  steps to preserve  rights  against any  parties  with  respect to any
Pledged Collateral.

        SECTION 12.  Remedies Upon Acceleration Default.

               (a)  If any Acceleration Default shall have occurred
and be continuing:

                      (i) The Pledgee may notify the obligors or other  parties,
        if any,  interested in any items of Pledged Col lateral of the interests
        of the  Pledgee  therein  and of any  action  proposed  to be taken with
        respect  thereto,  and inform  any of those  parties  that all  payments
        otherwise  payable to the Pledgor with respect  thereto shall be made by
        the Pledgee until all amounts due under the Credit  Agreement,  the Note
        and the other Related Documents have been indefeasibly paid in full;

                      (ii) The  Pledgee  may  exercise in respect of the Pledged
        Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein
        or  otherwise  available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured
        party on  default  under the  Uniform  Commercial  Code (the  "Code") in
        effect in the State of New York at that time,  and the Pledgee may also,
        without notice except as specified below, sell the Pledged Collateral or
        any part  thereof in one or more parcels at public or private  sale,  at
        any  exchange,  broker's  board or at any of the  Pledgee's  offices  or
        elsewhere,  for cash,  on credit or for future  delivery,  and upon such
        other terms as the Pledgee may deem commercially reasonable. The Pledgor
        hereby  agrees that,  to the extent  notice of sale shall be required by
        law, at least five days'  notice to the Pledgor of the time and place of
        any public sale or the time after  which any private  sale is to be made
        shall  constitute  reasonable  notification.  The  Pledgee  shall not be
        obligated to make any sale of Pledged Collateral regardless of notice of
        sale having  been  given.  The Pledgee may adjourn any public or private
        sale  from  time to time by  announcement  at the time and  place  fixed
        therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time
        and place to which it was so adjourned;

                      (iii) Any cash held by the  Pledgee as Pledged  Collateral
        and all cash proceeds received by the Pledgee in respect of any sale of,
        collection  from,  or  other  realization  upon  all or any  part of the
        Pledged Collateral may, in the discretion of the Pledgee, be held by the
        Pledgee as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied
        (after payment of any amounts payable to the Pledgee pursuant to Section
        13 hereof) in whole or in part by the Pledgee  against,  all or any part
        of the Obligations in such order as the Pledgee shall elect. Any surplus
        of such cash or cash proceeds  held by the Pledgee and  remaining  after
        the  indefeasible  payment in full of all the Obligations  shall be paid
        over to the Pledgor or to

                                              71

<PAGE>



        whomsoever may lawfully entitled to receive such surplus;
        and

                      (iv) The  Pledgee may  otherwise  use or deal from time to
        time with the Pledged  Collateral,  in whole or in part, in all respects
        as if the Pledgee were the outright owner thereof.

               (b) Except as set forth in Section 12(a)(iii) hereof, the Pledgee
shall have the sole right to determine the order in which  Obligations  shall be
deemed  discharged  by the  application  of the Pledged  Collateral or any other
property or money held hereunder or any amount realized thereon. Any requirement
of  reasonable  notice  imposed by law shall be deemed met if such  notice is in
writing and is mailed, teletransmitted or hand delivered to the Pledgor at least
five days prior to the sale,  disposition  or other  event  giving  rise to such
notice requirement.

               (c) The Pledgee shall collect the cash proceeds received from any
sale or  other  disposition  or from any  other  source  contemplated  by and in
accordance  with  Subsection  (a)  above and shall  apply the full  proceeds  in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

               (d)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  none of the provi sions of
this  Section 12 shall confer on the Pledgee any rights or  privileges  that are
not permissible under applicable law.

               (e) In connection  with the  provisions  of this Agree ment,  the
Pledgor from time to time shall  promptly  execute and  deliver,  or cause to be
executed and  delivered,  to the Pledgee such documents and  instruments,  shall
join in such  notices and shall take,  or cause to be taken,  such other  lawful
actions  as the  Pledgee  shall  deem  necessary  or  desirable  to enable it to
exercise any of the rights with respect to the Pledged  Collateral granted to it
pursuant to this Agreement.

        SECTION 13. Expenses.  The Pledgor will, upon demand, pay to the Pledgee
the amount of all expenses,  including the  reasonable  fees and expenses of its
counsel and of any experts and agents, which the Pledgee may incur in connection
with (i) the perfection,  custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection
from,  or  other  realization  upon,  any of the  Pledged  Collateral,  (ii) the
exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of the Pledgee hereunder, (iii) the
failure by the Pledgor to perform or observe any of the  provisions  hereof,  or
(v) any actual or attempted sale, assignment of rights or interests, or exchange
of, or any  enforcement,  collection,  compromise or settlement  respecting  the
Pledged  Collateral or any other property or money held hereunder,  or any other
action taken by the Pledgee hereunder whether directly or as attorney-in-fact

                                              72

<PAGE>



pursuant to the power of attorney herein conferred,  and all such expenses shall
be deemed a part of the  Obligations  for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Pledgee may apply the  Pledged  Collateral  or any other  property or money held
hereunder  to  payment of or  reimbursement  of itself  for such  expenses.  The
Pledgor  shall pay all such expenses on demand,  together with interest  thereon
from the date the expense is paid or incurred by the Pledgee at an interest rate
equal to that under the Note (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a 360-day year).

        SECTION 14. Waivers and  Amendments,  Etc. The rights and remedies given
hereby are in addition to all others  however  arising,  but it is not  intended
that any  right  or  remedy  be exer  cised in any  jurisdiction  in which  such
exercise would be pro hibited by law. No action,  failure to act or knowledge of
the Pledgee shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any power, right or remedy
hereunder,  nor shall any  single or  partial  exer cise  thereof  preclude  any
further exercise  thereof or the exer cise of any other power,  right or remedy.
Any waiver or consent respecting any covenant, representation, warranty or other
term or provision of this  Agreement  shall be effective  only in the  specified
instance and for the  specific  purpose for which given and shall not be deemed,
regardless of frequency given, to be a further or continuing  waiver or consent.
The failure or delay of the Pledgee at any time or times to require  performance
of, or to exercise  its rights with respect to, any  representation,  war ranty,
covenant or other term or provision of this  Agreement in no manner shall affect
its rights at a later time to enforce any such provision. No notice to or demand
on a party in any case shall  entitle such party to any other or further  notice
or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. Any right or power of the
Pledgee  hereunder  respecting the Pledged  Collateral and any other property or
money held  hereunder may at the option of the Pledgee be exercised as to all or
any part of the same and the term the "Pledged Collateral" wherever used herein,
unless the  context  clearly  requires  otherwise,  shall be deemed to mean (and
shall be read as) the "Pledged  Collateral  and any other property or money held
hereunder or any part thereof".  This  Agreement  shall not be amended nor shall
any right  hereunder be deemed  waived except by a written  agreement  expressly
setting  forth the  amendment or waiver and signed by the party  against whom or
which such amendment or waiver is sought to be charged.

        SECTION 15.  Notices. Any notice or other communication to

performance of the Obligations, (ii) be binding upon the Pledgor, its successors

and at its  expense,  of such of the Pledged  Collateral  as shall not have been
sold or otherwise applied pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

        SECTION  17.  Severability.  In the  event  that any  provision  of this
Agreement   shall  be  determined  to  be   superseded,   invalid  or  otherwise
unenforceable  pursuant to applicable law, such  determination  shall not affect

deleted.

                      (D) TO ACCEPT  ANY NEW  SECURITIES  OR OTHER  PROPERTY  TO

            IN FULL WITH INTEREST AND EXPENSES OF COLLECTION.

                      6.    THE SUBORDINATED LENDER AGREES THAT THE

DATED DECEMBER 27, 1995 EXECUTED BY CHUGAI BOYEKI COMPANY LIMITED,
CHUGAI BOYEKI (AMERICA) CORP. AND VICON INDUSTRIES, INC. IN FAVOR OF
IBJ SCHRODER BANK & TRUST COMPANY.

                      7.    NO ACTION WHICH THE BANK, OR THE BORROWER WITH
OR WITHOUT  THE  CONSENT OF THE BANK,  MAY TAKE,  OR REFRAIN  FROM  TAKING  WITH
RESPECT TO THE SENIOR  INDEBTEDNESS,  OR ANY NOTE OR AGREEMENT  REPRESENTING THE
SAME, OR ANY  COLLATERAL  THEREFOR,  OR ANY  AGREEMENT OR AGREEMENTS  (INCLUDING
GUARANTIES) IN CONNECTION THEREWITH,  SHALL AFFECT THIS SUBORDINATION  AGREEMENT
OR  THE  OBLIGATIONS  OF  THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER  HEREUNDER;  PROVIDED,  THAT
OBLIGATIONS  CONSISTING  OF  PRINCIPAL  OF THE  BORROWER  TO THE BANK  SHALL NOT

                      8.    IN THE EVENT THAT THE BANK SHALL TRANSFER
SENIOR   INDEBTEDNESS   TO  WHICH  THE   SUBORDINATED   INDEBTEDNESS  IS  HEREBY
SUBORDINATED THE TRANSFEREE THEREOF AND SUCCESSIVE  TRANSFEREES THEREAFTER SHALL
HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS  HEREUNDER AS THE BANK, IT BEING INTENDED THAT THE BENEFITS
OF  THIS  SUBORDINATION  AGREEMENT  SHALL  ATTACH  TO  AND  FOLLOW  SAID  SENIOR
INDEBTEDNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF
CHANGES IN THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF.

                      9.    TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SUBORDINATED LENDER HAS
A SECURITY  INTEREST IN ANY PROPERTY IN WHICH THE BANK HAS A SECURITY  INTEREST,
THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER AGREES THAT ITS INTEREST IN SUCH PROPERTY SHALL BE, IN
ALL  RESPECTS,  SUBORDINATED  TO  THE  FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY LAW TO THE
SECURITY  INTEREST OF THE BANK AND THAT,  UNTIL ALL SENIOR  INDEBTEDNESS  OF THE
BORROWER  TO THE BANK ARE PAID IN FULL,  IT SHALL NOT TAKE ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE
ITS SECURITY INTEREST IN SUCH PROPERTY OR TO REALIZE VALUE ON SUCH PROPERTY.  IN
FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING,  WHERE BOTH THE BANK AND THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER
HOLD A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE SAME COLLATERAL, THEN REGARDLESS OF THE ORDER OF
FILING FINANCING  STATEMENTS UNDER THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, OR THE TAKING OF
POSSESSION OF COLLATERAL AND REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, THE LIENS
OF THE BANK  SHALL BE  PRIOR  LIENS,  SENIOR  TO THE  LIENS OF THE  SUBORDINATED
LENDER. IN THE EVENT OF THE DECLARATION OF A DEFAULT BY THE BANK AND AN EXERCISE
OF THEIR  REMEDIES,  THE BANK SHALL NOT HAVE ANY  RESPONSIBILITY,  FIDUCIARY  OR
OTHERWISE,  TO  THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDERS  TO  REALIZE  MAXIMUM  VALUE  ON  THE
COLLATERAL.

                      10.    IN ADDITION TO THE SUBORDINATED NOTE, THE
SUBORDINATED LENDER AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES WHOSE SIGNATURES APPEAR BELOW,
HAVE, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE EXTEND CREDIT,  HAVE OUTSTANDING TRADE PAYABLES,  AND
PROVIDED OTHER FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS (AS NOW OR HEREAFTER INCURRED,  AMENDED,
INCREASED, EXTENDED, SUPPLEMENTED OR MODIFIED, "ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS") TO THE
BORROWER  AND HAVE TAKEN  SECURITY  INTERESTS  IN SOME OR ALL OF THE  BORROWER'S
ASSETS.  WITH RESPECT TO THE LIENS  SECURING SUCH  ADDITIONAL  INDEBTEDNESS  THE
SUBORDINATED LENDER AND SUCH AFFILIATES AGREE,  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY AGREEMENT OR
ARRANGEMENT  WHICH THEY MAY NOW HAVE WITH THE BORROWER,  OR ANY RULE OF LAW, AND
NOTWITHSTANDING THE TIME, ORDER OR METHOD OF ATTACHMENT,  PERFECTION,  FILING OR
RECORDING,  TO SUBORDINATE TO THE PRIOR LIEN OF THE BANK ANY LIEN, RIGHT, TITLE,
INTEREST AND CLAIMS WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREINAFTER  HAVE TO ANY OF THE ASSETS
OF THE BORROWER,  WHETHER NOW OR HEREAFTER  OWNED BY THE BORROWER,  THE CASH AND
NON-CASH PROCEEDS THEREOF AND ANY RETURNED OR REPOSSESSED GOODS RELATING THERETO
(HEREIN COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE "COLLATERAL"). THE SUBORDINATED LENDER AGREES TO
TAKE SUCH  ACTIONS  AS  REQUESTED  BY THE BANK TO CAUSE THE BANK TO HAVE A FIRST
LIEN ON ALL THE ASSETS OF THE BORROWER. EACH OF THE SUBORDINATED LENDER AND SUCH
AFFILIATES  AGREES THAT, SO LONG AS THE BORROWER MAY BE INDEBTED OR OBLIGATED TO
IT IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER,  INCLUDING ANY OBLIGATIONS OR INDEBTEDNESS  ARISING
FROM THE SALE OF ANY GOODS TO THE  BORROWER,  IT WILL NOT  EXERCISE  ANY RIGHTS,
ASSERT ANY CLAIM OR INTEREST, OR TAKE ANY ACTION OR



<PAGE>



INSTITUTE ANY PROCEEDING  WITH RESPECT TO THE  COLLATERAL  WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN
NOTICE TO AND THE  CONSENT  OF THE  BANK.  EXCEPT AS  PROVIDED  HEREIN,  NOTHING
CONTAINED  IN THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL  PROHIBIT THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER AND ITS
AFFILIATES  FROM  COLLECTING AND RETAINING  VOLUNTARY  PAYMENTS  (PRIOR TO THEIR
EXERCISE OF ANY REMEDIES OR  NOTIFICATION  TO THE BORROWER OF THEIR INTENTION TO
EXERCISE SUCH REMEDIES) OF THE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO THEM OR ANY PAYMENT OR
DISTRIBUTION IN ANY BANKRUPTCY,  INSOLVENCY,  RECEIVERSHIP OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING
WITH  RESPECT TO THE  BORROWER OR ITS ASSETS.  SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT IN FULL OF
THE  INDEBTEDNESS  DUE TO THE BANK, THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER AND ITS AFFILIATES
SHALL BE SUBROGATED TO THE BANK'S RIGHTS TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS OR DISTRIBUTIONS OF
ASSETS OF THE BORROWER  APPLICABLE TO THE INDEBTEDNESS DUE TO THE BANK UNTIL THE
INDEBTEDNESS  DUE TO THE BANK SHALL BE PAID IN FULL,  AND,  FOR THE  PURPOSES OF
SUCH  SUBROGATION,  (A) NO  PAYMENTS OR  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO THE BANK OF ANY CASH,
PROPERTIES  OR SECURITIES TO WHICH THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER AND ITS  AFFILIATES
WOULD BE ENTITLED  EXCEPT FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND NO PAYMENT BY THE  SUBORDINATED
LENDER AND ITS  AFFILIATES TO THE BANK OF ANY AMOUNT  PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL  AS  BETWEEN  THE  BORROWER,  ITS  CREDITORS  OTHER  THAN THE BANK AND THE
SUBORDINATED  LENDER  AND ITS  AFFILIATES,  BE  DEEMED  TO BE A  PAYMENT  BY THE
BORROWER TO OR ON ACCOUNT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS DUE TO THE BANK AND (B) NO PAYMENT
OR DISTRIBUTION TO THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES  PURSUANT TO THIS
SUBROGATION  PROVISION WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE BANK SHALL BE
DEEMED  TO BE A PAYMENT  BY THE  BORROWER  TO THE  SUBORDINATED  LENDER  AND ITS
AFFILIATES OR ON ACCOUNT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS DUE TO THE SUBORDINATED  LENDER AND
ITS  AFFILIATES.  THIS SECTION 10 SUPERSEDES  ALL PRIOR  AGREEMENTS  BETWEEN THE
SUBORDINATED LENDER AND ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEM WITH THE BANK WITH RESPECT
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.

                      11.    NO AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, TERMINATION, OR
WAIVER OF ANY  PROVISION  OF THIS  SUBORDINATION  AGREEMENT,  NOR CONSENT TO ANY
DEPARTURE BY THE BORROWER  FROM ANY PROVISION OF THIS  SUBORDINATION  AGREEMENT,
SHALL IN ANY EVENT BE  EFFECTIVE  UNLESS THE SAME SHALL BE IN WRITING AND SIGNED
BY THE BANK,  AND THEN  SUCH  WAIVER  SHALL BE  EFFECTIVE  ONLY IN THE  SPECIFIC
INSTANCE AND FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE FOR WHICH GIVEN.

                      12.    NO FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE BANK TO
EXERCISE,  NO DELAY IN EXERCISING ANY RIGHT, POWER, OR REMEDY HEREUNDER,  OR ANY
SINGLE OR PARTIAL EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHT SHALL OPERATE AS A WAIVER THEREOF.

                      13.    THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

THIS NOTE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT
DATED DECEMBER 27, 1995 EXECUTED BY CHUGAI BOYEKI COMPANY
LIMITED, CHUGAI BOYEKI (AMERICA) CORP. AND VICON INDUSTRIES, INC.
IN FAVOR OF IBJ SCHRODER BANK & TRUST COMPANY


                            SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE

$2,000,000                                                  Melville, New York
                                                         As of October 5, 1993



            FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  VICON INDUSTRIES,  INC., a New York corporation
(the "Maker")  promises to pay to the order of CHUGAI BOYEKI COMPANY LIMITED,  a
Japanese corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the "Payee"), on
July 1, 1998 at its office located at 2-15-13 Tsukishima,  Chuoku, Tokyo, Japan,
or such  other  place as the Payee may  specify,  in lawful  money of the United
States of America and in immediately available funds the principal amount of TWO
MILLION U.S. DOLLARS  ($2,000,000) or, if less than such principal  amount,  the
aggregate unpaid principal balance then outstanding of the Note;  without setoff
or counterclaim  and free and clear of, and without  deduction for or on account
of, any present or future stamp or other taxes,  withholdings,  restrictions  or
conditions of any nature.

            The Maker  further  promises  to pay  interest  in like money on the
unpaid principal  balance of this Note from time to time outstanding  until paid
in full at a rate  (computed  on the  basis of a 360 day year  for  actual  days
elapsed) equal to one percent (1%) in excess of the rate of interest  adopted by
Sanwa  Bank from time to time as its "prime  rate" for loans in U.S.  Dollars to
U.S.  borrowers,  which rate is not  intended  to be the lowest rate of interest
charged by Sanwa Bank.  Interest shall be payable  quarterly on the first day of
each calendar quarter  commencing the first of such days to occur after the date
hereof,  upon  prepayment  hereof  (to the  extent  accrued  on the amount to be
prepaid) and upon payment in full of the unpaid  principal  balance hereof.  The
records of the holder  shall  constitute  prima facie  evidence of amounts  paid

            (i) The Payee shall have determined,  in its sole  discretion,  that
      one or more conditions exist or events have occurred which may result in a
      material adverse change in the business, properties or financial condition
      of the Borrower;

then,  in any such  event,  the Payee  may,  by notice of  default to the Maker,
declare the principal amount then  outstanding  hereunder (with accrued interest
thereon) to be  immediately  due and payable;  provided,  however,  that no such
notice shall be required upon the  occurrence of any Event of Default  described
in paragraph (e) hereof and upon the  occurrence of such an Event of Default the
then outstanding  principal amount  hereunder shall  automatically  and, without
notice, become immediately due and payable.

            After the stated or any accelerated  maturity hereof,  the aggregate
unpaid  principal  balance  of this Note shall  bear  interest  at a rate of two
percent  (2%)  per  annum in  excess  of the rate in  effect  at such  maturity;
provided, however, that no such post-maturity rate so payable hereunder shall be
in excess of the maximum permitted under any applicable law.

            The Maker may prepay the full  principal  amount of this Note or any
portion hereof at any time upon three business days' prior notice to the Payee.

            The  obligations  of the  Maker  under  this Note are  secured  by a
Security Agreement of even date herewith between the Maker and the Payee (as the
same may be  amended  from  time to time,  the  "Security  Agreement")  to which
Security Agreement  reference is hereby made for a description of the nature and
extent of the  security  provided  therein  and the  rights in  respect  of such
security of any holder of this Note.

            The  rights  of  the  Payee   under  this  Note  are  subject  to  a
Subordination Agreement (the "Subordination Agreement") dated as of December 27,
1995 among the Maker,  the Payee, and IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company to which
Subordination Agreement reference is hereby made for a description of the nature
and extent of the subordination of the rights of any holder of this Note.

            Except as expressly provided herein,  notice,  demand,  presentment,
protest, notice of protest,  dishonor, notice of dishonor or notice of any other
kind are hereby  expressly  waived by the Maker.  The Maker  further  waives its
right to interpose any setoff or  counterclaim  of any nature or description in,
or to plead any statute of limitations as a defense to, any action  commenced by
the Payee to enforce its rights hereunder.

            No failure by the Payee or any assignee thereof to exercise,  and no
delay in exercising,  any right,  remedy or power  hereunder  shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single

#20127399.1
                                     -4-

<PAGE>


or partial exercise by the Payee or such assignee of any right,  remedy or power
hereunder  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy.

            The  Maker  agrees  (i) to pay on demand  all legal and other  fees,
costs and expenses of the Payee  incurred in connection  with the  collection of
this Note, the Security  Agreement and any other instruments and documents to be
delivered  hereunder and  thereunder,  (ii) to pay on demand all legal and other
fees,  costs  and  expenses  of  the  Payee  incurred  in  connection  with  the
enforcement of this Note, the Security  Agreement and any other  instruments and
documents to be delivered hereunder and thereunder,  and (iii) to pay, indemnify
and  hold  the  Payee  harmless  from  and  against  any  and  all  liabilities,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses  or  disbursements  of any kind or  nature  whatsoever  (including  any
reasonable  expense  incurred  by  the  Payee  in  employing  legal  counsel  in
connection  therewith)  which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
the Payee in any way  relating  to or  arising  out of, or any  action  taken or
omitted by the Payee under  (including,  but not limited to, the  administration
and/or  enforcement  thereof),  this Note,  the Security  Agreement or any other
instrument or document to be delivered hereunder or thereunder.  The obligations
of the Maker pursuant to this paragraph shall survive the repayment by the Maker
of all or a portion of the principal  amount of this Note and the payment by the
Maker of accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            The  Maker may not  assign or  otherwise  transfer  its  obligations
hereunder.  The Payee may assign,  grant participations in or otherwise transfer
all or any portion of its rights hereunder,  and any such assignee,  participant
or transferee  shall have all of the rights of the Payee hereunder to the extent
of the interest conveyed.

            This Note shall be construed in accordance  with and governed by the
laws of the State of New York.

if during the term of this Agreement (a) Darby dies or (b) Darby becomes so
disabled for a period of six months that he is substantially unable to perform
his duties under this Agreement for such period.  Such a termination shall not
release the Company from any liability to Darby for compensation  earned, or for
termination or severance payment elected,  prior to such termination;  nor shall
it be deemed a termination of employment for Gross Misconduct.
           9. Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating
to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in the
City of New York in accordance with the rules of the American  Arbitration  then

stock options previously  granted,  this Agreement contains the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior  agreements by the parties relating
to the term of Darby's employment by the Company,  however, it does not restrict
or limit such other  benefits as the Board of Directors may determine to provide
or make available to Darby.
          B. This agreement may not be waived,  changed,  modified or discharged
orally,  but only by  agreement  in writing,  signed by the party  against  whom
enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, or discharge is sought.
           C.  This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by the  laws  of  New  York
applicable to contracts  between New York  residents and made and to be entirely
performed in New York.

$150,000.  plus benefits as  previously  outlined in the minutes of the Board of
Directors.  This agreement will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors at the end of one year, and can be extended for an additional
year at that time.
     Should a change of control of the Company occur, you may elect to terminate
your employment and receive a lump sum severance payment. Such severance payment
shall mean the amount that is equal to two times your annual  salary  reduced by
the salary amounts paid to you from the date of this agreement.
     A "Change of Control"  shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as (i)
any other  entity or  "person"  (as defined in sections 13 (d) and 14 (d) of the
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934)  shall  become  directly  or  indirectly  a
beneficial  owner (as defined in Rule 13D-3 under such Act) of securities of the
Company representing 20% or more (or in the case of Chugai Boyeki Co., Ltd., and
its  affiliates,  35% more) of the  outstanding  shares of capital  stock of the
Company  or (ii) a majority  of the  members  of the Board of  Directors  of the
Company or any successor by merger or  assignment of assets or otherwise,  shall
be persons other

agreement or (iii) the Company executes a "Company Sale Agreement".
     "Company Sale Agreement" means an agreement to which the Company is a party

                                                         EXHIBIT 10.6
                   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         AGREEMENT,  dated as of June 1, 1995,  between PETER HORN  (hereinafter
called "Horn") and VICON INDUSTRIES,  INC., a New York  corporation,  having its
principal place of business at 525 Broad Hollow Road,  Melville,  New York 11747
(hereinafter called the "Company").
         WHEREAS, Horn has previously been employed by the Company, and WHEREAS,
         the Company and Horn mutually desire to assure the
continuation of Horn's services to the Company,
         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants herein set forth, the parties covenant and agree as follows:
         1.   Employment.  The Company shall employ Horn as its Vice
President of Quality Assurance and Compliance throughout the term of this
Agreement, and Horn hereby accepts such employment.
         2.   Term.  The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the date
of this Agreement and end on September 30, 1997.
         3.   Compensation.
              A. The Company shall pay Horn a base salary of $100,000 per annum,
subject to periodic  adjustment  as  determined  by the President of the Company
with Board of  Directors  approval,  but in any event shall not be less than the
base  salary  so  indicated.  Beginning  October  1,  1996  to the  end of  this
agreement,  the base salary shall be adjusted upward by an amount at least equal
to the Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers factor for the previous twelve
months.
              B.  Horn's base salary shall be payable monthly or bi-weekly.
              C.  Horn shall also be entitled to participate in any
pension, profit sharing, life insurance,  medical, dental, hospital,  disability
or other  benefit plans as may from time to time be available to officers of the
Company, subject to the general eligibility requirements of such plans.
         4.  Covenant  not to Compete.  Horn agrees that during the term of this
Agreement  and for a period  thereafter  equal to the  length  of  severance  as
calculated  in  paragraph  5A, he shall not  directly or  indirectly  within the
United  States or Europe  engage  in, or enter the  employment  of or render any
services to any other entity  engaged in, any business of a similar nature to or
in


<PAGE>



competition with the Company's business of designing, manufacturing, and selling
security  equipment  and  protection  devices  anywhere in the United States and
Europe.  Horn further  acknowledges  that the services to be rendered under this
Agreement by him are special,  unique, and of extraordinary character and that a
material  breach  by him of this  section  will  cause  the  Company  to  suffer
irreparable  damage; and Horn agrees that in addition to any other remedy,  this
section shall be enforceable by negative or affirmative preliminary or permanent
injunction in any Court of competent jurisdiction. Horn acknowledges that he may
only be released  from this  covenant if the Company  materially  breech's  this
agreement or provides to Horn a written release of this provision.
         5.   Severance Payment on Certain Terminations.
         A.   If either this Agreement expires, or the Company terminates
Horn's   employment   under  this   Agreement  for  reasons  other  than  "Gross
Misconduct",  then Horn, at his option, may elect to receive severance payments,
without  reduction  for any  offset or  mitigation,  in an  amount  equal to (a)
one-twelfth Horn's annual base
salary  at the time of such  termination  multiplied  by (b) the  number of full
years of Horn's employment by the Company up to a maximum of 24 years.
         B.  "Gross  Misconduct"  shall  mean  (a)  a  wilful,  substantial  and
unjustifiable  refusal to perform substantially the duties and services required
of his  position;  (b) fraud,  misappropriation  or  embezzlement  involving the
Company or its assets; or (c) conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude.
         Horn's option to elect to receive  severance  payments may be exercised
only by written  notice  delivered to the Company  within 90 days  following the
date on which Horn's  receives  actual notice of  termination  or this Agreement
expires, as the case may be.
         In the  event  of an  election  under  this  section,  payment  of such
severance shall be in lieu of any other  obligation of the Company for severance
payment or other post-termination compensation under this Agreement if any.
         The severance  amount shall be paid in equal monthly payments over a 12
month period.

     6.  Termination Payment on Change of Control.
         A.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement,  if a "Change of Control" occurs without the prior written consent of
the  Board of  Directors,  Horn,  at his  option,  may  elect to  terminate  his
obligations under this Agreement and to receive a termination  payment,  without
reduction  for any offset or  mitigation,  in an amount equal to three times his
average  annual base salary for five years  preceding the Change of Control,  in
either lump sum or extended payments over three years as Horn shall elect.
         B. A "Change of  Control"  shall be deemed to have  occurred if (i) any
other entity shall directly or indirectly acquire  beneficial  ownership of 20%,
or any  further  amount in excess of 20%, of the  outstanding  shares of capital
stock of the Company or (ii) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Company or any  successor by merger or assignment of assets or otherwise,
shall be persons other than Directors on the date of this Agreement.
         C. Horn's option to elect to terminate his obligations and to receive a
termination  payment and to elect to receive a lump sum or extended payments may
be exercised  only by written  notice  delivered  to the Company  within 90 days
following the date on which Horn receives actual notice of Change of Control.
     7. Death or Disability.  The Company may terminate this Agreement if during
the term of this  Agreement  (a) Horn dies or (b) Horn becomes so disabled for a
period of six months that he is substantially unable to perform his duties under
this Agreement for such period.
     8.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating
to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in the
City of New York in accordance with the rules
of the  American  Arbitration  then in  effect,  and  judgement  upon the  award
rendered be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
     9.  Miscellaneous.
         A.   Except for stock options previously granted, this Agreement
contains the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior
                           - 3 -


<PAGE>



agreements by the parties  relating to payments by the Company upon  involuntary
employment  termination with or without cause,  however, it does not restrict or
limit such other  benefits as the  President or Board of Directors may determine
to provide or make available to Horn.
         B. This  agreement may not be waived,  changed,  modified or discharged
orally,  but only by  agreement  in writing,  signed by the party  against  whom
enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, or discharge is sought.
         C. This Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of New York applicable
to contracts between New York residents and made and to be entirely performed in
New York.
         D.   If any part of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect.
         E.   This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the Company, its successor, and assigns.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement.

                BETWEEN VICON INDUSTRIES, INC., AS SUBLESSOR,
                AND NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER, INC., AS SUBLESSEE


            SUBLEASE,  made  as of  September  1,  1995,  by and  between  Vicon
Industries, Inc. ("Sublessor"), a New York corporation with offices at 525 Broad
Hollow  Road,  Melville,  New  York  11747,  and New  York  Blood  Center,  Inc.
("Sublessee"),  a New York  not-for-profit  corporation with offices at 310 East
67th Street, New York, New York 10021.


                                 WITNESSETH:


            WHEREAS,  Sublessor is the tenant under an agreement of lease, dated
January  19,  1988,   between  Allan  V.  Rose  and  Suffolk  County  Industrial
Development Agency, as landlord, the landlord's interest in which is now held by
Allan V. Rose (hereinafter referred to as "Landlord"),  and Sublessor as tenant,
for the land and building  known as 525 Broad Hollow  Road,  Melville,  New York
11747  (collectively  the "Premises") and amendments  dated as of July 18, 1990,
July 18, 1990 (letter agreement) and January 1, 1993 (the "Overlease"); and

            WHEREAS, Sublessor desires to sublease a portion of the Premises to
Sublessee; and

          WHEREAS,  Sublessee desires to sublease a portion of the Premises from
     Sublessor;

            NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:

            1.    Demise of Subleased Premises; Term; etc.

            Sublessor  hereby sublets to Sublessee and Sublessee  subleases from
Sublessor  that  portion  of  the  Premises  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
"Subleased  Premises")  consisting of approximately  28,239.4 square feet in the
building (the "Building") known as 525 Broad Hollow Road, Melville, New York, as
shown on the  diagrams  annexed  hereto as Exhibit A, for a term of 1 year and 6
months, which term shall commence on September 1, 1995 (the "Commencement Date")
and terminate on February 28, 1997 (subject to  Sublessee's  one-time  option to
extend set forth in Par.  10). In  addition,  to the extent that  Sublessee  has
previously  installed  or is  permitted  to install  HVAC or other  equipment or
facilities that service the Subleased  Premises,  but are located outside of the
Subleased  Premises,  Sublessee  shall also , during the term of this  Sublease,
have the right to maintain such  equipment or facilities  and shall have a right
of access over and through the Premises outside of the Subleased Premises

                                      1

<PAGE>



to the extent reasonably  required for the maintenance,  servicing and repair of
such equipment or facilities.

            Sublessee shall, upon Sublessor's  request,  give Sublessor a letter
acknowledging that Sublessee has accepted possession of the Subleased Premises.

            2.    Cafeteria.

                  (a) So long as Sublessee  is not in default  under this Lease,
      it may utilize the cafeteria maintained by Sublessor at the Premises, as a
      lunch area for Sublessee's  employees employed at the Subleased  Premises,
      in common with the employees of the Sublessor and of any other  subtenant,
      subject to such  reasonable  restrictions  as  Sublessor  may  impose.  If
      Sublessor  shall  discontinue  maintenance of a cafeteria at the Premises,
      all  rights  and   obligations  of  Sublessor  and  Sublessee  under  this
      subparagraph shall terminate as of the date of such discontinuance.

                  (b)  Sublessee has  constructed  a corridor  (the  "Corridor")
      within the Building,  connecting the Subleased  Premises to the cafeteria,
      in the  location  shown on Exhibit B annexed  hereto.  The Corridor is not
      included in the  Subleased  Premises  and may be used both by  Sublessee's
      employees  and  by   Sublessor's   employees  and  invitees,   subject  to
      Sublessor's  right  to  inspect  and  show  as  provided  herein  (through
      incorporation  of the  Overlease).  Sublessee  shall  be  responsible  for
      maintaining  the Corridor in good repair and  condition  and in compliance
      with all laws, orders, and regulations of all governmental bodies.

            3.    Rent; Rent-Concession; etc.

                  (a)  Sublessee  shall  pay  to  Sublessor  the  base  rent  as
      hereinafter provided. Commencing September 1, 1995 and ending February 28,
      1997 the annual base rent for the Subleased  Premises shall be $416,531.15
      per annum  ($34,710.93  per month),  subject to adjustment as  hereinafter
      provided.  Such base rent was computed by  multiplying  the Leasable  Area
      (hereinafter defined) by $14.75 per square foot. The "Leasable Area" means
      the gross square  footage of the  Subleased  Premises  measured to a point
      halfway  through each of the perimeter  walls of the  Subleased  Premises.
      Sublessee  may, on or before  September 1, 1995, at  Sublessee's  expense,
      review  Sublessor's   measurements  of  the  Subleased  Premises  and,  if
      Sublessor's  determination  that the Leasable Area is 28,239.4 square feet
      is wrong,  the base rent  shall be  appropriately  adjusted.  In the event
      Sublessee  fails to object to  Sublessor's  measurements  by  September 1,
      1995, Sublessor's measurements shall be deemed binding.

                  (b) Such base rent shall be paid in equal monthly installments
      on the first day of each  month  during the term of this  Lease,  in legal
      tender of the United  States at the office of Sublessor  at the  Premises,
      without any setoff, abatement, or

      deduction whatsoever (except as set forth in Paragraphs 16 and 17 hereof);
      provided that the  foregoing  shall not be deemed a waiver by Sublessee of
      any claim against Sublessor based on Sublessor's  breach of this Sublease,
      which  claim(s) may be asserted by  Sublessee  in any  separate  action or
      proceeding.  Sublessee  shall  pay the  first  month's  base rent upon the
      Commencement Date of this Sublease.

                  (c)   [Intentionally omitted]

                  (d) If Sublessee shall fail to pay (by delivery to and receipt
      by Sublessor of a good check for the requisite  amount) all or any part of
      any  installment  of rent or additional  rent for more than ten days after
      the same shall have become due and payable hereunder,  Sublessee shall pay
      as additional  rent hereunder to Sublessor (1) a one-time late charge with
      respect to such default  equal to four cents for each dollar of the amount
      of such  rent and  additional  rent  which  shall  not have  been  paid to
      Sublessor  within such ten days and (ii) in the event such  default  shall
      continue  for a period in excess of one month,  then,  in addition to such
      late charge,  interest on such overdue amount at the prime rate, currently
      denominated  as the "base rate",  of Citibank,  N.A. in New York, New York
      from  that  date one  month  after  the due date  thereof  until  the date
      Sublessor is paid in full. If Sublessee pays any rent or other charge with
      a check that is, for any reason,  refused for payment by the bank on which
      it is drawn,  Sublessee shall pay Sublessor a $50 service charge. The late
      charge,  interest, and service charge described above shall be payable (A)
      within  10  days  after  demand  and  (B)  without  prejudice  to  any  of
      Sublessor's  rights  and  remedies  hereunder,  at law or in  equity,  for
      nonpayment  of rent or other  sums,  but shall be in  addition to any such
      rights and  remedies.  No failure by  Sublessor  to insist upon the strict
      performance by Sublessee of  Sublessee's  obligations to pay late charges,
      interest,  and  service  charges as provided  in this  subparagraph  shall
      constitute a waiver by Sublessor of its right to enforce the provisions of
      this  subparagraph  in any such  instance  or in any  instance  thereafter
      occurring.

                  (e) Any costs or expenses  incurred by  Sublessor  to cure any
      default  by  Sublessee  under this  Lease  which was not cured  within the
      applicable cure period (except that in an emergency Sublessor shall not be
      required  to wait  for  the  expiration  of the  cure  period),  excluding
      attorneys'  fees,  shall be paid by Sublessee to Sublessor  within 10 days
      after Sublessor makes demand therefor and shall be treated in all respects
      as rent. Any default by Sublessee in the payment of such damages, costs or
      expenses  shall be  treated  as a  default  in the  payment  of rent,  and
      Sublessor shall have the same remedies with respect thereto as it has with
      respect to any default in payment of rent.

                  (f)  Sublessee's  obligations  to make  payments of additional
      rent  allocable  to the term of this  Sublease  which are billed after the
      expiration of the term of this  Sublease,  shall survive the expiration or
      sooner termination of this Sublease.

            4.    Real Estate Tax and Utility Cost Escalations.

                  (a) For the  purposes of this  Sublease  the  following  terms
      shall have the following meanings:

                        (i) "Real Estate Taxes" shall mean all "Impositions" (as
            defined in section 4.1(A) of the Overlease).

                        (ii) "Tax Year" shall mean each  12-month  fiscal period
            commencing  December 1 and ending  November 30, any portion of which
            occurs during the term of this Sublease.

                            (iii)  "Base  Tax  Year"  shall  mean  the Tax  Year
            commencing December 1, 1994 and expiring November 30, 1995.

                        (iv)  "Subsequent  Year" shall mean (A) with  respect to
            Real Estate Taxes, each Tax Year (or any portion thereof) commencing
            within the term of this Lease which shall be  subsequent to the Base
            Tax  Year;  and  (B)  with  respect  to  Utility  Cost  (hereinafter
            defined),  the 1995 calendar year and each subsequent  calendar year
            which commences during the term of this Sublease.

                        (v)   "Sublessee's   Proportionate   Share"  shall  mean
            26.148%,  the  percentage  obtained by dividing the Leasable Area by
            108,000 (the Leasable Area of the  Building).  Sublessee  may, on or
            before  September  1, 1995,  at  Sublessee's  expense,  review  such
            measurements  and give Sublessor  notice of any discrepancy  between
            Sublessor's and Sublessee's measurements.

                        (vi) "Utility Cost" shall mean  Sublessor's cost for all
            fuel  (including,  but not limited to, oil, gas,  steam and coal but
            excluding electricity) delivered to the Building.

                            (vii) "Base  Utility  Cost"  shall mean  Sublessor's
            Utility Cost for the 1995 calendar year.

                  (b) If in any  Subsequent  Year,  Real  Estate  Taxes  payable
      during  such  Subsequent  Year shall be  greater  than Real  Estate  Taxes
      payable during the Base Tax Year for any reason whatsoever  (including but
      not limited to increases in the tax rates and/or the assessed valuation of
      the  Building,   and   increases  in  assessed   valuation  by  reason  of
      improvements  made to the  Premises  or any  part  thereof),  foreseen  or
      unforeseen,  then  Sublessee  shall pay Sublessor as  additional  rent, an
      amount (hereinafter called "Sublessee's Tax Payment") equal to Sublessee's
      Proportionate  Share of such increase.  Such additional rent shall be paid
      by Sublessee  notwithstanding  the fact that  Sublessee may be exempt,  in
      whole or in part, from the

007326/13000/180.6
                                      4

<PAGE>



      payment  of any Real  Estate  Taxes by  reason of  Sublessee's  diplomatic
      charitable,  or  otherwise  tax  exempt  status,  or for any other  reason
      whatsoever.  Sublessor  shall furnish  Sublessee with a statement  setting
      forth the amount of Real Estate Taxes and  Sublessee's Tax Payment payable
      for such Subsequent  Year, and Sublessee shall pay Sublessee's Tax Payment
      in one  lump  sum  within  fifteen  (15)  days of the  furnishing  of such
      statement,  but shall not in any event be required to pay  Sublessee's Tax
      Payment more than five (5) days before the commencement of the Tax Year.

                  (c) If the Utility Cost payable for any  Subsequent  Year (any
      part or all of  which  falls  within  the  term of  this  Sublease)  shall
      represent an increase above the Base Utility Cost,  then  Sublessee  shall
      pay  Sublessor as additional  rent for such  Subsequent  Year  Sublessee's
      Proportionate  Share of such increase in one lump sum within 15 days after
      Sublessor furnishes to Sublessee a statement of the amount due.

                  (d) (i) Any statement  sent to Sublessee  with respect to Real
      Estate Taxes shall be binding upon  Sublessee  unless,  within thirty (30)
      days after such statement is sent,  Sublessee  shall send a written notice
      to Sublessor  objecting to such  statement and  specifying the respects in
      which such  statement is claimed to be incorrect.  Any  statement  sent to
      Sublessee  with respect to Utility  Cost shall be binding  upon  Sublessee
      unless,  within 30 days  after such  statement  is sent,  Sublessee  shall
      request copies of the fuel bills  supporting the Utility Cost  computation
      (to the extent not previously  furnished) and unless, within 30 days after
      delivery of copies of such bills,  Sublessee  shall send written notice to
      Sublessor objecting to such statement and specifying the respects in which
      such statement is claimed to be incorrect.  Pending the  determination  of
      any such dispute  Sublessee  shall pay all  additional  rent shown on such
      statement,  and such payment and acceptance shall be without  prejudice to
      Sublessee's position.

                        (ii) Real Estate Tax and Utility Cost escalations  shall
            be  appropriately  prorated  for any partial  Subsequent  Year.  Any
            additional  rent due under this  Paragraph 4 shall be collectible by
            Sublessor in the same manner as the base rent,  and Sublessor  shall
            have all rights with  respect  thereto as it has with respect to the
            base rent.

                            (iii)   If,   after   Sublessee   shall   have  paid
            Sublessee's Proportionate Share of any increase in Real Estate Taxes
            with  respect to any  Subsequent  Year,  Sublessor  shall  receive a
            refund of any portion of the Real Estate  Taxes paid with respect to
            such  Subsequent Year as a result of a reduction in such Real Estate
            Taxes by final  determination  of legal  proceedings,  settlement or
            otherwise,  Sublessor shall  promptly,  after receiving such refund,
            pay Sublessee its Proportionate Share of such refund after deducting
            from  such  refund  the  expenses  (including  but  not  limited  to
            attorneys'  fees,  expert's  fees  and  disbursements)  incurred  by
            Sublessor in

                                      5

            connection with any application or proceeding to reduce the assessed
            valuation of the Premises for such Subsequent Year.

                  (e)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing or any other  provision of
      this Sublease, Sublessor specifically waives its right to collect the Real
      Estate Tax  escalation  for the tax year  commencing  December 1, 1994 and
      ending  November 30, 1995 and to collect the Utility Cost  escalation  for
      the 1995 calendar year. The parties confirm that Sublessee's  Proportional
      Share is 26.148%.

            5.    [Intentionally Omitted]

            6.    Use of Subleased Premises/Parking.

                  (a) Sublessee shall use and occupy the Subleased  Premises for
      (i) office use and (ii)  incidental  to such  office  use,  for storage of
      supplies (but not for storage of blood or blood  products or medical waste
      except  as   hereinafter   specifically   provided)   and  for   telephone
      solicitations and (iii) to collect blood from donors provided that no more
      than 13.5% of the Leasable  Area shall be used for blood  collection;  and
      for no other purpose.  Without limiting the foregoing,  except as provided
      below,  Sublessee agrees that it shall not use the Subleased Premises as a
      laboratory to process  blood or blood  products or to store blood or blood
      products or medical waste  (hereinafter  defined) or for any  pornographic
      purposes or any sort of commercial sex establishment.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Par. 6(a) or any other
      provision of this Sublease,  Sublessee shall have the right to use an area
      of 3,964 square feet, as identified on Exhibit A (the "Option Area"), for:
      (i) the purposes described in subpar. (a) above and (ii) in addition, as a
      laboratory to process  blood or blood  products or to store blood or blood
      products and, further,  as a "stat" lab for emergency testing of blood, it
      being  agreed that the uses listed in this clause (ii) may not be operated
      in any portion of the Subleased Premises outside of the Option Area.

                  (c) Sublessor  shall assign 155 parking  spaces in the parking
      lot around the Building for  Sublessee's  use, and Sublessee shall clearly
      mark such spaces for its use. Sublessee's employees and invitees shall not
      use other parking spaces on the Premises.  In the event that the volume of
      traffic  through  the  parking  lot on the  Premises  or  the  streets  or
      intersections  bordering  the  Premises  is  increased  (or  claimed to be
      increased by any government authority) by reason of Sublessee's use of the
      Subleased Premises (for example, if the volume of the traffic increases by
      reason of  Sublessee's  donor  collection  activities)  and if the Town of
      Huntington  or any  other  federal,  state,  municipal,  county,  or local
      government,  department,  commission, board or agency, makes any objection
      or issues any direction with respect to such condition, then Sublessee, at
      its own cost and expense,  shall comply with any such  direction and shall
      be responsible for removing any such objection and shall be

                                      6

<PAGE>



      responsible  for any costs or penalties  that are imposed on the Building,
      the  Premises,  Landlord,  Sublessor  or  Sublessee  with  respect to such
      matters, which payment(s) shall be deemed additional rent hereunder.

            7.    Services Provided By Sublessor.

                  (a) As long as  Sublessee  is not in default,  Sublessor  will
      provide (i) heat to the Subleased  Premises when and as required by law on
      business days,from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.
      (collectively, "Business Hours"); (ii) parking lot snow removal; and (iii)
      water as required up to the amount  that would be required  for  executive
      lavatory  purposes  but,  if  Sublessee  uses  or  consumes  water  beyond
      executive lavatory use, Sublessor may install a water meter at Sublessee's
      expense which Sublessee shall thereafter  maintain at Sublessee's  expense
      in good working  order and repair for the purpose of measuring  such water
      consumption  and Sublessee  shall pay for water  consumed as shown on said
      meter  as  additional  rent as and  when  bills  are  rendered;  and  (iv)
      groundskeeping.  Sublessor may interrupt  such services when  necessary by
      reason  of  accident  or  for  repairs,   alterations,   replacements   or
      improvements  necessary or desirable  in  Sublessor's  judgment so long as
      reasonably  required  therefor or by reason of strike or labor troubles or
      any cause whatsoever beyond Sublessor's sole control.

                  (b)  Sublessor  shall  service  the HVAC  system  serving  the
      Subleased  Premises on a routine  basis by starting  the  equipment in the
      spring, providing regular service and maintenance inspections,  installing
      filters as needed, and shutting down the system for the winter.  Sublessor
      shall make  routine,  minor repairs to the system as part of such service.
      Sublessee,  however,  shall be responsible  for making all other necessary
      repairs and replacements.

                  (c) (i) Sublessee  shall obtain electric  service,  at its own
      cost and expense, directly from the utility servicing the Building.

                        (ii)  [Intentionally Omitted]

                            (iii)  Sublessee's  use of  electric  current in the
            Subleased  Premises shall not at any time exceed the capacity of any
            of the electrical  conductors and equipment in or otherwise  serving
            the Subleased Premises. In order to ensure that such capacity is not
            exceeded and to avert  possible  adverse  effect upon the Building's
            electric  service,  Sublessee  shall not without  Sublessor's  prior
            written consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld,
            in  each  instance,  connect  any  additional  electrical  fixtures,
            appliances or equipment  (other than lamps,  typewriters,  and other
            electrical equipment with electric consumption equivalent to that of
            standard office  machines) to the Building's  electric  distribution
            system or make any alteration or addition to the  electrical  system
            of the Subleased Premises. Should

            Sublessor  grant such consent and if additional  risers or equipment
            shall  be  required  therefor,   same  shall  be  installed  by  the
            Sublessor,  and  the  cost  thereof  shall  be  paid  by  Sublessee.
            Sublessor  shall  not be  liable  in any  way to  Sublessee  for any
            failure  or  defect  in  supply or  character  of  electric  current
            furnished to the Subleased  Premises  (other than such as may result
            from  Sublessor's  gross  negligence  or  wrongful  act or  wrongful
            omission), including but not limited to any failure or defect in the
            supply or character of electric  service  furnished to the Subleased
            Premises  by  reason  of any  requirement,  act or  omission  of the
            utility serving the Building.

                        (iv)  [Intentionally Omitted]

            8.    Subordination to Overlease, etc.

                  (a) Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, this Sublease is
      expressly  subject and subordinate to the covenants,  terms and conditions
      of the Overlease and the rights of the landlord thereunder and to the lien
      of any mortgages which may now or hereafter  encumber or otherwise  affect
      the real estate of which the  Subleased  Premises  form a part.  Sublessee
      hereby  acknowledges  and represents that it has read the Overlease and is
      familiar with all of the provisions thereof. A copy of the Overlease, with
      certain provisions deleted, is annexed hereto as Exhibit C.

                  (b) Except as set forth in  subparagraph  (d) below and except
      to the  extent  that such  terms are  inconsistent  with the terms of this
      Sublease,  Sublessee  shall be bound by and comply  with all of the terms,
      covenants and  conditions to be observed and performed by the tenant under
      the Overlease, as they relate to the Subleased Premises and to the term of
      this Sublease,  and Sublessee shall not do or permit to be done any act or
      thing,  or  create  or  permit  to be  created  any  condition,  which may
      constitute a breach,  default or violation of any of the terms,  covenants
      or conditions of the Overlease,  or which may render  Sublessor liable for
      any charge or expense thereunder.

                  (c)  Sublessor  shall have the same rights and  remedies  with
      respect to this Sublease and Sublessee as the Landlord has with respect to
      the Overlease and the tenant thereunder as though such rights and remedies
      set forth in the  Overlease  in favor of  Landlord  were set forth in this
      Sublease in favor of Sublessor,  including  without limiting the foregoing
      all of the rights and remedies  provided in the Overlease for  non-payment
      of rent and the  right to cure  defaults  of  Sublessee.  Except as herein
      provided,  all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Overlease are
      incorporated  herein with the same force and effect as if herein set forth
      in full and the rights and  obligations  contained  in the  Overlease  are
      hereby  imposed  on  the  respective  parties  hereto.  References  in the
      Overlease to "Landlord" or "Sublessor",  to "Tenant",  to "Lease",  and to
      "premises"  or  "demised  premises"  are  deemed  to refer  to  Sublessor,
      Sublessee,  this Sublease and the Subleased  Premises,  respectively;  any

      Base Rent or Fixed Net Rent in the Overlease  shall be deemed to be to the
      rent payable  hereunder,  and  references  to the  expiration  date of the
      Overlease  shall be deemed made to the  expiration  date of this Sublease;
      and  where the  sense of the text  requires  it,  references  to  specific
      paragraphs  and  terms  in the  Overlease  shall  be  deemed  made  to the
      corresponding   paragraph  and  terms  hereunder.   Without  limiting  the
      foregoing, Article 16 (Default Provisions) of the Overlease, including the
      cure periods set forth  therein,  shall become a part of this  Sublease as
      provided above, with the following  modifications:  (i) Section 16.1(d) is
      modified to delete the words "for five days after written  notice  thereof
      from Landlord" and to substitute therefor the following language: "for ten
      days  after the due date  thereof";  and (ii) all  references  in the last
      paragraph  of Section  16.1 to "three (3) days"  shall be changed to "five
      (5) days"  unless such  extension  of time would cause  Sublessor to be in
      breach of the Overlease.

                  (d) The  following  Articles  and  sections  contained  in the
      Overlease  shall not be deemed  incorporated  in this Sublease  (except as
      herein  specifically  provided):  1;  2;  4  (except  to the  extent  such
      Impositions   are  payable  by  Sublessee  as  part  of  Real  Estate  Tax
      escalation);  5; the first  sentence  of 6.1;  6.2;  6.4;  7; 8; the first
      sentence of 11.1; 11.2; 11.3;  12.1(b),  (d) and (e) (except to the extent
      payable as part of escalations and additional rent hereunder);  the second
      sentence of 12.3;  13; 14; 19.3; 20 (except to the extent noted in Par. 21
      of this Sublease); 22; 23; 24; 28; 32; 37 and 40; Amendment dated July 18,
      1990;  Amendment  dated July 18, 1990 (letter  agreement);  and  Amendment
      dated as of January  1, 1993.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
      contained in Article 10 of the Overlease,  Sublessee shall not be required
      to discharge any lien,  encumbrance or charge against the Premises created
      by or imposed on account of Sublessor or Overlandlord.

            9.    Sublessor's Rights, etc.

            Except with respect to those  obligations of Sublessor  specifically
set forth in this  Sublease,  Sublessor  does not  undertake  any  obligation to
perform the terms,  covenants and  conditions  contained in the Overlease on the
Landlord's part to be performed thereunder.

            10.   One Time Renewal Option.

            If  Sublessee  is not then in  default  beyond  any notice and grace
period provided for in this Sublease, Sublessee may renew this Sublease upon all
of the terms,  covenants and conditions set forth herein for an additional  term
of 11 months commencing March 1, 1997 and ending on January 30, 1998, by written
notice of such renewal delivered to Sublessor no later than October 31, 1996. In
the event this  Sublease is timely  renewed as provided in this  Paragraph,  the
base rent payable during the first year of the renewal term shall be $416,531.15
per annum  ($34,710.93  per month).  During such extended term Sublessee  shall,
among other things, continue to pay Real Estate/Tax and Utility Cost escalations
utilizing the same Base Tax Year and Base Utility Cost set forth in Paragraph 4.

Paragraph 10 shall be deemed void and of no further force or effect if Sublessee
or  Sublessor  exercises  any right to cancel  this  Sublease,  including  under
Paragraphs  16, 17 and 30.  Time is of the essence  with  respect to the date by
which Sublessee is to give Sublessor notice hereunder.

            11.   [Intentionally Omitted]

            12.   Broker.

            Sublessee  represents  and warrants to Sublessor  that it has had no
dealings  or  communications  with any broker or agent in  connection  with this
Sublease.  Sublessee dealt with Cooperman  Associates in connection with a prior
sublease between the parties for a portion of the Subleased Premises.  Sublessee
agrees to indemnify  and hold  Sublessor  harmless  from and against any and all
costs,  expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and disbursements) and
liabilities for any  compensation,  commissions or charges claimed by any broker
or agent with whom  Sublessee  has dealt  with  respect  to this  Sublease.  The
foregoing  indemnity  does not  extend to  Cooperman  Associates,  except to the
extent Cooperman Associates may make a claim based on dealings or communications
Sublessee  has had with  Cooperman  Associates  with  respect to this  Sublease.
Sublessor  agrees to indemnify and hold Sublessee  harmless from and against any
and all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
and liabilities for any compensation,  commissions or charges claimed by (a) any
broker or agent with whom Sublessor,  but not Sublessee,  has dealt with respect
to this Sublease,  and (b) Cooperman  Associates (except to the extent Cooperman
Associates  may make a claim based on dealings or  communications  Sublessee has
had with Cooperman Associates with respect to this Sublease).

            13.   [Intentionally Omitted]

            14.   Indemnification.

            Sublessee  hereby  agrees to indemnify and hold  Sublessor  harmless
from  and  against  any  and  all  losses,  liabilities,  damages  and  expenses
(including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and  disbursements)  for which Sublessor
shall not be reimbursed by insurance, which Sublessor may suffer or incur (i) in
connection  with  Sublessee's  breach of this Sublease  and/or failure to comply
with the applicable  terms and conditions of the Overlease,  or (ii) arising out
of damage or injury to persons or property in the  Subleased  Premises or on the
driveway constructed by Sublessee pursuant to Par. 25(b) during the term of this
Sublease,  unless injury or damage is caused by the negligence of Sublessor, its
agents,  servants,  employees or invitees.  Sublessor hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold  Sublessee  harmless from and against any and all losses,  liabilities,
damages and expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and disbursements)
for which  Sublessee  shall not be reimbursed by insurance,  which Sublessee may
suffer or incur (i) in connection  with  Sublessor's  breach of this Sublease or
(ii)  arising  out of damage or injury to persons or property  occurring  on the
Premises,  but outside of the Subleased  Premises or such  driveway  unless such
injury or

                                      10

<PAGE>



damage is caused by the negligence of Sublessee, its agents, servants, employees
or invitees.  The provisions of this Paragraph and  Sublessee's  and Sublessor's
obligations  hereunder shall survive the expiration or other termination of this
Sublease.

            15.   Insurance.

            During the term of this Sublease,  Sublessee  shall maintain in full
force and effect the comprehensive  public liability  insurance  required by the
Overlease,  except  that such  policy  shall be in a  combined  single  limit of
$2,000,000.  Sublessor and Landlord shall be named as additional insured on such
policy,  in  addition  to those  persons  and  entities  required to be named as
insured and  additional  insured under the  Overlease.  Such policy shall not be
cancelable with respect to Sublessor or Landlord,  except upon at least ten days
prior written  notice to Sublessor  and the Landlord  under the  Overlease.  Two
duplicate  originals  or  certificates  of such  policies  shall be delivered to
Sublessor,  together  with proof of payment of the  premiums  thereon,  upon the
commencement date of this Sublease and, thereafter,  at least thirty days before
each expiration thereof, two duplicate originals or certificates of the renewals
or  replacements  of such  policies  shall be  delivered to  Sublessor.  Nothing
contained  in  this  paragraph   shall  be  deemed  to  limit  in  any  way  the
indemnification provisions of Paragraph 14.

            16.   Casualty.

                  (a) If the Subleased  Premises  shall be partially  damaged by
      fire or other  insured  casualty,  the damages shall be repaired by and at
      the  expense of  Sublessor  and the base rent shall be abated from the day
      following  the  casualty  until the date such  repairs  are  substantially
      completed  according  to the  part of the  Subleased  Premises  which  are
      untenantable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sublessor may terminate this
      Sublease upon notice to Sublessee  given within ninety (90) days following
      the date of such  casualty  and upon the date  specified  in such  notice,
      which date shall be not less than one hundred  twenty  (120) days nor more
      than one hundred  fifty (150) days  following  the giving of such  notice,
      this Sublease shall terminate and Sublessee shall vacate and surrender the
      Subleased Premises to Sublessor.

                  (b) If this Sublease shall not be terminated as provided above
      in subparagraph  (a),  Sublessor shall proceed with the restoration of the
      Subleased  Premises,  provided that  Sublessor's  restoration  obligations
      shall be subject to  building  and zoning  laws then in effect.  Sublessor
      shall make such repairs with reasonable expedition,  subject to delays due
      to  adjustment  of insurance  claims,  availability  of  materials,  labor
      troubles and other causes beyond Sublessor's reasonable control. Sublessee
      shall  cooperate  with  Sublessor's   restoration  by  removing  from  the
      Subleased Premises, as promptly as reasonably possible, all of Sublessee's
      salvageable  and  movable  equipment,  furniture  and other  property.  If
      Sublessor shall restore the Subleased Premises, Sublessee shall diligently
      repair,  restore and  redecorate  the  Subleased  Premises and re-open for
      business from the Subleased Premises, promptly

                                      11

      following notice of restoration, in a manner and to the condition existing
      prior to the  occurrence  of such  casualty,  except  to the  extent  that
      Sublessor is obligated to make such repairs as provided above.

                  (c) In the  event  of a  casualty  not  caused  by  Sublessee,
      Sublessee's  agents,   employees,   servants,   invitees  or  contractors,
      Sublessee may, if Sublessor fails to substantially complete restoration of
      the Subleased  Premise  within 5 months of the date of the casualty,  give
      Sublessor  30 days'  notice of intent to  terminate  and,  if  substantial
      restoration  of the Subleased  Premises has not been effected  within such
      30- day period, then this Sublease shall terminate effective 30 days after
      such notice of termination is given to Sublessor.

            17.   Condemnation.

            If  "materially  all" (as such term is  defined in Article 14 of the
Overlease) of the Premises or if any portion of the Subleased Premises such that
Sublessee  shall no longer be able to  operate  its  business  at the  Subleased
Premises  shall be acquired  or  condemned  by eminent  domain for any public or
quasi-public  use or purpose,  then and in such event, the term of this Sublease
shall cease and terminate from the date of title vesting in such proceeding.  If
a portion of the  Subleased  Premises is so acquired or condemned  and Sublessee
shall  notify  Sublessor  within 30 days of having  learned  of such  event that
Sublessee is able to continue to operate its business in the  remaining  portion
of the Subleased Premises, then, this Sublease shall continue as to such portion
and the base rent shall be proportionately  abated.  Sublessee shall be entitled
to any portion of an award made to Sublessee for the value of Sublessee's  trade
fixtures and moving expenses  provided such award does not diminish  Sublessor's
or Overlandlord's  award. As between  Sublessor and Sublessee,  all compensation
awarded for the taking of the Building,  the Premises, the fee and the leasehold
shall belong to and be the property of the Sublessor, and Sublessee shall not be
entitled to any damages for the  unexpired  portion of the term of this Sublease
or injury to its subleasehold interest.

            18.   Notice, etc.

            Any notice,  demand, consent or other communication which, under the
terms of this  Sublease,  must or may be given  or made by the  parties  hereto,
shall be in writing to be  effective  and shall be given or made by mailing  the
same by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the
party for whom  intended  at its  address as set forth on the first page of this
Sublease.  Either party may designate such new or other  addresses to which such
communications  thereafter shall be given, made or mailed by notice given to the
other party in the manner prescribed  herein.  Any such  communication  shall be
deemed given or served,  as the case may be, on the date of the posting thereof.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Sublessor may deliver any bill to Sublessee by
leaving such bill at the Subleased  Premises and such bill shall be deemed given
on the date of delivery.

            19.   Attornment With Respect to Overlease.

            Sublessee  recognizes and acknowledges that the Sublessor  hereunder
is the tenant under the  Overlease.  The Sublessee  covenants and agrees that if
the  leasehold  estate of the  Sublessor  (as  tenant  under the  Overlease)  is
terminated  or  surrendered  for  any  reason  whatsoever   including,   without
limitation  pursuant  to Article 30, it will  attorn to the  Landlord  under the
Overlease,  upon the request of the Landlord,  or any successor thereto,  as the
case may be, and will recognize such landlord or such successor, as the case may
be, as the  Sublessee's  landlord under this Sublease.  The Sublessee  agrees to
execute and  deliver at any time and from time to time,  upon the request of the
Sublessor or of the landlord  under the Overlease or any successor  thereto,  as
the case may be,  any  instrument  which  may be  necessary  or  appropriate  to
evidence such  attornment.  If the  leasehold  estate of the Sublessor as tenant
under the Overlease is terminated or  surrendered,  the Sublessee  covenants and
agrees upon request of the landlord under the Overlease or any successor thereto
to enter into a lease with such  landlord  under the  Overlease or any successor
thereto on the same terms and conditions as this Sublease, except as hereinafter
set forth. The Sublessee  further waives the provision of any statute or rule of
law now or hereafter  in effect which may give or purport to give the  Sublessee
any right of election to terminate  this Sublease or to surrender  possession of
the  Subleased  Premises in the event of the  termination  or  surrender  of the
Overlease  and  agrees  that  this  Sublease  shall not be  affected  in any way
whatsoever  thereby.  If the Overlease  terminates  for any reason and Sublessee
becomes the direct  tenant of the landlord  under the  Overlease,  such landlord
shall not be (i) liable for any previous act or omission of Sublessor under this
Sublease,  (ii) subject to any credit,  offset, claim,  counterclaim,  demand or
defense which Sublessee may have against Sublessor,  (iii) bound by any previous
modification  of this  Sublease that was not consented to by Landlord or that is
inconsistent  with this  Sublease or the Consent to  Sublease,  among  Landlord,
Sublessor and Sublessee,  dated as of the date hereof (the "Consent"), or by any
previous prepayment of more than one month's rent, (iv) bound by any covenant of
Sublessor to undertake or complete any construction of the Subleased Premises or
any portion  thereof,  (v) required to account for any  security  deposit of the
Sublessee  other than any  security  deposit  actually  delivered to Landlord by
Sublessor,  (vi) bound by any  obligation  to make any payment to  Sublessee  or
grant any credits,  except for services,  repairs,  maintenance  and restoration
provided for under this Sublease to be performed  after the date of  Sublessee's
attornment to Landlord,  (vii)  responsible  for any monies owing by Landlord to
the credit of  Sublessor,  (viii)  required to remove any person  occupying  the
Subleased  Premises or any part thereof,  (ix) required to afford  Sublessee any
cafeteria rights or access rights through the corridor as defined in Paragraph 2
of this Sublease (and such Paragraph  shall be deemed deleted and Landlord shall
have the right to eliminate such  Cafeteria and  corridor),  and (x) required to
provide any parking for  Sublessee's  use,  except for  providing the spaces set
forth in the Consent. Further, if the Overlease is terminated for any reason and
this Sublease  becomes a direct lease  pursuant to the terms of this Sublease or
the  Consent,  this  Sublease  shall be  deemed  modified  from the date of such
termination  as provided  in the  Consent,  which  modifications  shall  include
Landlord's right to terminate the direct lease upon 120 days notice.

            20.   Quiet Enjoyment.

            Sublessor  covenants and agrees with  Sublessee  that upon Sublessee
paying the rent and additional  rent and observing and performing all the terms,
covenants  and  conditions  on  Sublessee's  part to be observed and  performed,
giving regard to any cure periods provided  herein,  Sublessee may peaceably and
quietly enjoy the premises hereby demised, subject,  nevertheless, to the terms,
and conditions of this Sublease.

            21.   Assignment and Subletting.

                  (a) Sublessee  shall not assign this Sublease or sublet all or
      any part of the Subleased Premises or grant any concessions or licenses in
      respect  thereof  or in any  way  encumber  Sublessee's  interest  in this
      Sublease  or  the  Subleased  Premises  without  the  written  consent  of
      Sublessor and Landlord, subject to the provisions of this Par. 21.

                  (b)   Sublessor   covenants   and  agrees  that  it  will  not
      unreasonably  withhold  its  consent  to  Sublessee's  assignment  of this
      Sublease or  subletting  of all or part of the  Subleased  Premises to any
      other person,  firm, or  corporation,  provided such assignee or subtenant
      shall use and  occupy  the  Subleased  Premises  for  offices  and not for
      storage of blood or blood products or medical wastes,  or to collect blood
      from donors, or as a laboratory to process blood or blood products or as a
      "stat" lab for emergency testing of blood.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      if such assignment or sublet is proposed to be made to an affiliate of New
      York  Blood  Center,  Inc,  (an  affiliate  being  any  person  or  entity
      controlling,  controlled  by or under  common  control with New York Blood
      Center,  Inc.), such assignee or subtenant may use the Subleased  Premises
      for the uses  described  in Paragraph 6 of this  Sublease.  At the time of
      such  assignment  and/or  sublet,  this Sublease must be in full force and
      effect  without  any  breach  or  default  thereunder  on the  part of the
      Sublessee which is not cured in the applicable time period.  A copy of the
      assignment and the original assumption agreement or sublease (both in form
      and content satisfactory to Sublessor), fully executed and acknowledged by
      the assignee and/or  sublessee shall be delivered to Sublessor  within ten
      (10) days from the date of execution of such  assignment  or sublease.  In
      the event of an  assignment or sublet,  Sublessee  shall remain liable for
      the  performance  of all of the terms,  covenants  and  conditions of this
      Sublease, including the payment of base rent and additional rent. Any such
      sublet or assignment  shall be subject to consent of Landlord,  subject to
      the provisions of the Consent.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Sublease to the
      contrary and notwithstanding any consent by Sublessor to any assignment or
      sublease of the  Subleased  Premises,  no assignee or subtenant who enters
      into such an assignment or sublease, shall further assign this Sublease or
      further  sublet  all or part  of the  Subleased  Premises  or  assign  any
      subsublease of the Subleased Premises

      without the prior  written  consent of Sublessor in each such case,  which
      consent Sublessor in its sole discretion may withhold.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
      Paragraph  21, or  elsewhere  in this  Sublease,  in the  event  Sublessee
      requests  Sublessor's  consent  to a  sublease  of all  of  the  Subleased
      Premises or to an assignment of the Sublease as set forth in  subparagraph
      (b),  then  Sublessor  shall  have the right to cancel and  terminate  the
      Sublease, as of a date chosen by Sublessor, no earlier than two (2) months
      and  no  later  than  four  (4)  months  after  the  date  of  Sublessee's
      notification to Sublessor of Sublessee's request to sublease or assign. If
      Sublessor  exercises  its option to  terminate  this  Sublease,  then this
      Sublease  shall cease and  terminate on the date set forth by Sublessor in
      its notice  without any further  liability  on the part of either party to
      the other,  except for  accrued  obligations  to the date of  termination.
      Sublessor's  right to cancel  shall  not  apply to a request  to sublet or
      assign to an affiliate of  Sublessee,  provided  that the  permitted  uses
      under the Sublease shall remain the same.

                  (e) In the event of an  assignment  of this Sublease or sublet
      of more than 30% of the Subleased Premises consented to by Sublessor,  75%
      of any Net  Profit  for each  calendar  year  shall be paid  quarterly  to
      Sublessor.  "Net  Profit" for any  calendar  year shall mean the amount by
      which "Gross  Receipts"  actually paid to Sublessee in connection with any
      and all  sublettings or assignments  exceed "Gross  Expenses" of Sublessee
      with  respect to the portion of the  Subleased  Premises so sublet (or the
      entire  Subleased  Premises if the Sublease is assigned) for such calendar
      year, such  apportionment to be made on the basis of the percentage of the
      actual  net  usable  square  footage  of the  Subleased  Premises.  "Gross
      Receipts" of  Sublessee  shall mean all rentals and any other sums paid to
      Sublessee  including,  without  limitation  of  the  foregoing,  rent  and
      additional rent, sums paid to acquire the Sublease or subsublease, fixture
      fees,  electricity charges,  "key money", and any other consideration paid
      by any  subtenant  or assignee to Sublessee  during the  calendar  year in
      question.  "Gross  Expenses"  of Sublessee  with respect to the  Subleased
      Premises for any calendar year shall mean all rent,  additional  rent, and
      other sums payable by  Sublessee to Sublessor  under the Sublease for such
      calendar  year and  shall  not  include  any  other  expenditures  paid or
      incurred by  Sublessee  except  customary  brokerage  fees and  reasonable
      attorneys'  fees  actually  paid by  Sublessee  in  connection  with  such
      subletting or assignment.

                        Within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter of
      each calendar year of the Sublease, Sublessee shall deliver to Sublessor a

      material  default of this  Sublease  and  Sublessor  shall be  entitled to
      terminate  this  Sublease  in  addition  to  exercising  any other  remedy
      available to it in law or in equity. For the period of two (2) years after
      any statement  required by this Paragraph 21 has been sent by Sublessee to
      Sublessor,  Sublessor  shall have the  opportunity to examine the books of
      Sublessee in order to determine the accuracy of such statements).

                  (f) A form of transfer or  conveyance  that would be deemed an
      assignment or sublease  under the Overlease  shall be deemed an assignment
      or sublet  hereunder  and subject to the terms  hereof.  In addition,  any
      transfer,  by  operation  of law or  otherwise,  of  Sublessee's  (or  any
      subtenant's  or  assignee's)  interest in this  Sublease or the  Subleased
      Premises  (in  whole  or in  part)  or of a 50%  or  greater  interest  in
      Sublessee  (whether stock,  partnership  interest,  or otherwise) shall be
      deemed an  assignment  of this  Sublease  and  subject  to the  provisions
      hereof. It is understood and agreed that if Sublessee is a corporation,  a
      transfer by the corporation or any shareholders)  thereof of a majority of
      the issued or outstanding capital stock of Sublessee, however accomplished
      (including a transfer accomplished by the corporation's issuance of shares
      in an amount greater than 50% of the outstanding shares), and whether in a
      single  transaction  or in a series of related or unrelated  transactions,
      shall be deemed  an  assignment  of this  Sublease  requiring  Sublessor's
      consent.

            22.   [Intentionally Omitted]

            23.   Additional Covenants Required by Overlease.

                  (a) Sublessee  shall remove  reasonably  promptly after notice
      all liens which might affect the landlord under the Overlease's fee estate
      in the  Premises  or any  portion  thereof  as a  result  of any  changes,
      alterations, new construction, renovation, demolition or remodeling of the
      Building or any portion thereof made, or claimed to have been made, at the
      request of Sublessee.

                  (b) The landlord under the Overlease  shall be permitted entry

      Overlease.

          The  foregoing  Subpar.  (c)  shall not be  deemed  to  eliminate  any
     obligation  of Sublessee to Sublessor  under this  Sublease  (including  by
     reason of the  incorporation  of the terms of the  Overlease) to remove any
     mechanics liens.

            24.   Signs.

            Sublessee may continue to maintain the existing sign on the exterior
of the  Building by the entrance to the  Subleased  Premises and may install one
additional sign on the monument located in front of the Building and one sign on
the  west  wall of the  Building  (in the  southwest  corner).  Sublessor  shall
cooperate with Sublessee and, if necessary,  join in any  application for a sign
permit,  at Sublessee's  expense.  Such signs shall only contain the name of the
Sublessee  (and/or any permitted  assignees or  sub-sublessee).  Sublessee shall
obtain all permits,  certificates and licenses  required for the installation of
each sign installed by Sublessee; shall comply with all present and future laws,
orders and  regulations  of all state,  federal,  municipal,  county,  and local
governments, departments, commissions and boards and any direction of any public
officer  pursuant to law with respect to such  sign(s);  and shall pay all fees,
including  but not  limited to any annual  permit  fees,  required to be paid in
connection with such sign(s).

            25.   Alterations.

                  (a)  Sublessee  shall make no  changes in or to the  Subleased
      Premises  of  any  nature  without  the  prior  consent  of  Landlord  and
      Sublessor.  Sublessee  shall furnish  Sublessor and Landlord with detailed
      plans and specifications  covering all proposed changes.  Sublessor agrees
      not to  unreasonably  withhold  its  consent  to any such  changes  to the
      Subleased  Premises  which  are  non-structural  and  which do not  affect
      utility services or plumbing and electrical lines in or to the interior of
      the Subleased Premises; provided Sublessee complies with the provisions of
      Section  11.1(a)-(h) and 11.3 of Article 11 of the Overlease.  Sublessor's
      consent  shall be  granted or denied  within 5 working  days of receipt of
      such  plans  and  specifications.  Sublessee  shall  use  contractors  and
      mechanics  first approved by Sublessor,  and Sublessor shall grant or deny
      such approval within 3 working days after receipt of Sublessee's  request.
      If any  mechanic's  lien is filed  against the  Subleased  Premises or the
      Building for work claimed to have been done for or materials  furnished to
      Sublessee,  whether or not done pursuant to this Paragraph, the same shall
      be  discharged  by Sublessee  within ten days  thereafter  at  Sublessee's
      expense by filing the bond required by law or otherwise. All improvements,
      alterations  and  additions to the  Subleased  Premises and all  fixtures,
      panelling,  partitions, railings and like installations,  installed in the
      Subleased  Premises at any time,  either by  Sublessee  or by Sublessor on
      Sublessee's  behalf,  shall,  upon  installation,  become the  property of
      Sublessor  and shall  remain upon and be  surrendered  with the  Subleased
      Premises.  Nothing in this Paragraph  shall be construed to give Sublessor
      title to or to prevent  Sublessee's  removal of trade  fixtures,  moveable
      office  furniture  and  equipment,  but upon  removal of any such from the
      Subleased  Premises or upon removal of such other  installations as may be
      required by Sublessor,  Sublessee  shall  immediately  and at its expense,
      repair and restore the Subleased  Premises to the condition existing prior
      to  installation  and repair any damage to the  Subleased  Premises or the
      Building due to such  removal.  All  property  permitted or required to be
      removed by Sublessee

      at  the  end  of the  term  remaining  in  the  Subleased  Premises  after
      Sublessee's  removal shall be deemed abandoned and may, at the election of
      Sublessor,  either be retained as Sublessor's property or removed from the
      Subleased Premises by Sublessor, at Sublessee's expense.

                  (b) Sublessee has built, at Sublessee's sole cost and expense,
      a driveway from the property  owned by Sublessee  adjacent to the Premises
      (the  "Adjacent  Building")  to the  parking  lot on the  Premises  in the
      location  indicated on Exhibit D annexed  hereto.  Sublessee  shall remove
      such driveway and shall restore the Premises to their  original  condition
      existing  prior to the  construction  of such driveway upon the earlier to
      occur of the following:  (a) the  expiration or sooner  termination of the
      term of this Sublease (as such term may be extended or shortened  pursuant
      to the terms of this  Sublease),  or (b) the date  Sublessee  discontinues
      conducting its blood bank operations from the Adjacent Building. Sublessee
      shall be solely  responsible for and shall maintain and keep such driveway
      in good order and repair,  shall be responsible  for snow and ice removal,
      and shall comply with all present and future laws,  orders and regulations
      of  all  state,  federal,   municipal,   county,  and  local  governments,
      departments,  commissions  and  boards  and any  direction  of any  public
      officer  pursuant to law with respect to such driveway and shall discharge
      any violation,  order or duty upon  Sublessor,  Landlord or Sublessee with
      respect to the driveway.

            26.   [Intentionally Omitted]

            27.   Care of the Premises.

            Sublessor shall maintain and repair the exterior of, grounds and the
public  portions of the Building.  Sublessee  shall  throughout the term of this
Sublease take good care of the Subleased  Premises,  including the bathrooms and
lavatory  facilities  and the windows  and window  frames and the  fixtures  and
appurtenances  therein; and shall at Sublessee's sole cost and expenses promptly
make  all  repairs   thereto  and  to  the  Building,   whether   structural  or
non-structural in nature, caused by or resulting from the negligence or improper
conduct of Sublessee,  Sublessee's servants, employees,  invitees, or licensees.
Further,  Sublessee shall, at Sublessee's sole cost and expense, promptly comply
with all present and future laws, orders and regulations of all state,  federal,
municipal  and  local  governments,  departments,  commissions  and  boards  and
direction  of any public  officer  pursuant to law,  and all  orders,  rules and
regulations of the New York Board of Fire Underwriters or the Insurance Services
Office or any similar body which shall impose any order,  violation or duty upon
Sublessor, Landlord or Sublessee with respect to the Subleased Premises, or with
respect to the  Building if arising out of  Sublessee's  use or manner of use of
the  Building;  provided  that nothing  herein shall  require  Sublessee to make
structural  repairs or alterations  unless Sublessee has by its manner of use of
the Subleased  Premises or method of operation  therein  violated any such laws,
ordinances, orders, rules, regulations or requirements with respect thereto.

            28.   Environmental Hazards.

                  (a) Sublessee  shall not store,  use, sell, or bring onto, the
      Premises any Ultra Hazardous Material  (hereinafter  defined) in violation
      of  any  environmental  laws  or  regulations  imposed  by  any  competent
      Governmental   Authority.  As  used  herein,  the  term  "Ultra  Hazardous
      Material"  shall be as defined in 42 U.S.C.  9601 et seq., as amended from
      time to time,  and any hazardous  material or toxic waste the use, sale or
      storage of which may make  Sublessor,  Landlord,  or  Sublessee  liable to
      remove  same  from  the  Premises  in  accordance   with  any   applicable
      environmental  clean-up law. In the event any Ultra Hazardous  Material is
      used, sold or stored by Sublessee on the Premises,  Sublessee shall remove
      same and make the  Premises  clean of same  within  twenty (20) days after
      notice from  Sublessor or if such removal and clean-up  shall require more
      than twenty (20) days,  Sublessee  shall  commence such work within twenty
      (20) days and thereafter  expeditiously and without interruption  complete
      same.  Failure to remove  and/or clean up same within said twenty (20) day
      period (as same may be extended pursuant to the preceding  sentence) shall
      be deemed a default of this Sublease giving Sublessor the same remedies as
      for  nonpayment of Rent. In the event  Sublessee  fails to comply with the
      obligations  of this  Paragraph  28,  Sublessor  shall have the right,  in
      accordance with the provisions of this Sublease,  to remove same and clean
      up the Premises at Sublessee's cost and expense, and Sublessee shall, upon
      demand,  reimburse  Sublessor for such cost, together with interest at the
      Interest  Rate (as such term is defined in Section 2.7 of the  Overlease).
      Sublessee's  obligation to reimburse  Sublessor pursuant to this Paragraph
      28 shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Sublease.

                  (b)  A  provision   identical  with  the  provisions  of  this
      Paragraph  28 running for the benefit of Sublessor  and Landlord  shall be
      included in each subsublease by Sublessee, and the failure of Sublessee to
      include such a provision shall be deemed a default of this Sublease.

            29.   Miscellaneous.

                  (a) This Sublease may not be changed or terminated orally, but
      only by an agreement in writing signed by both parties hereto.

                  (b) This Sublease constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties  hereto with  respect to the subject  matter  hereof and all other
      representations and understandings have been merged herein.

                  (c) The covenants, conditions and terms of this Sublease shall
      bind and inure to the benefit of both parties hereto, their successors and
      permitted assigns.

                  (d) In case  of any  conflict  or  inconsistency  between  the
      provisions  of the Overlease and those of this  Sublease,  the  provisions
      hereof, as between Sublessor and Sublessee, shall control.

                  (e)  This  Sublease  shall be  governed  by and  construed  in
      accordance  with the laws of the State of New York.  If any  provision  of
      this Sublease or the application  thereof to any person or  circumstances,
      shall to any extent be invalid or  unenforceable,  such provision shall be
      adjusted rather than voided,  if possible,  in order to achieve the intent
      of the  parties  to the extent  possible;  and,  in any  event,  all other
      provisions of this Sublease shall be deemed valid and enforceable to their
      full extent.

                  (f)  Whenever  provision  is  made in  this  Sublease  for the
      consent or approval of the Sublessor, the Sublessor shall not capriciously
      or without  reasonable  cause refuse to grant such consent or approval and
      failure to  disapprove  within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written
      request for approval or consent shall be deemed an approval or consent, as
      the case may be. The foregoing  provision  shall not apply to requests for
      the   approval  of   Sublessor   with   respect  to  proposed   structural
      improvements, alterations, additions or repairs.

                  (g) Except as provided in the next sentence,  Sublessee  shall
      not permit any medical  waste to be stored or disposed of at the Subleased
      Premises.  Sublessee  may store  blood in the  Subleased  Premises in cold
      storage  units  occupying  no more than 1000 square feet within the Option
      Area,  provided Sublessee complies with all applicable  governmental laws,
      ordinances, rules and regulations.  Sublessee shall furnish all equipment,
      labor,  utilities and supplies required for the generation,  custody,  and
      disposal of medical  waste at the  Subleased  Premises,  including  boxes,
      labels and manifests and shall promptly remove from the Subleased Premises
      and the Premises all medical wastes  generated at the Subleased  Premises.
      Sublessee shall comply with all applicable  governmental laws, ordinances,
      rules,  regulations  and  orders of any  federal,  state,  county or local
      government,  governmental agency,  department,  board or authority imposed
      with respect to any medical waste generated at the Subleased Premises (the
      "Medical Waste  Regulations") and shall pay any fines,  penalties or other
      charges levied against Sublessee, Landlord, Sublessor, the Building or the
      Premises as a result of Sublessee's failure to handle,  remove,  transport
      or  dispose  of  medical  waste  in  compliance  with  the  Medical  Waste
      Regulations.   Sublessee  shall  initiate,   maintain  and  supervise  all
      appropriate  safety  precautions  and  programs  in  connection  with  the
      custody,  transport and proper disposal of medical wastes;  and shall take
      all  reasonable  precautions  to  prevent  damage,  injury  or loss to any
      persons  or  property  in  connection  with its  generation  of,  custody,
      transport and disposal of medical wastes.  The term "medical wastes" shall
      mean blood,  blood  products,  and any wastes or other substance which may
      cause an  infectious  disease or  reasonably  be  suspected  of  harboring
      pathogenic organisms,  including any wastes described as medical wastes by
      any appropriate federal, state, or local statutory or

      regulatory  authorities.  Sublessee  agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
      Sublessor and Landlord against and from all liabilities,  claims, damages,
      loss, costs and expenses,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees, arising
      out of any breach by Sublessee of its obligations  under this Subparagraph
      (g).

                  (h) In any action or proceeding for breach of this Sublease or
      for holdover or dispossess  proceedings,  the party which does not prevail
      shall pay the other party's reasonable attorneys' fees.

            Sublessor  shall  provide up to two persons  designated by Sublessee
with keys and security codes to Sublessor's  phone room so that Sublessee  shall
have telephone use after Sublessor's  normal business hours.  Sublessee shall be
responsible  for the  security of the  Building  when using the phone room after
normal business hours. Sublessee shall indemnify,  defend and hold Sublessor and
Landlord harmless from and against all claims,  loss, damages,  cost and expense
Sublessor may incur by reason of such  after-hours  access,  including,  but not
limited  to (a) any loss or  damage  to  property  and (b) any  injury  or death
occurring in or about the Building in connection  with such  after-hours  use of
the phone room.

            30.   Early Termination.

            Sublessee  has been advised that  Sublessor has granted the Landlord
and  Landlord's  affiliate  the right,  upon 180 days prior  notice,  to require
Sublessor to terminate  and/or vacate the Premises,  pursuant to a sublease with
AVR Mart,  Inc. and/or a consent and release  agreement,  dated as of January 1,
1993  (collectively and  individually,  the "Release  Agreement").  In the event
Sublessor  receives  such notice under the Release  Agreement and such notice to
Sublessor  requires by its terms that  Sublessor  give notice to Sublessee  that
Sublessee is required to vacate the Subleased  Premises,  than  Sublessor  shall
give such notice to Sublessee  (accompanied by a copy of the AVR Mart, Inc.'s or
Landlord's  notice to  Sublessor)  and,  upon receipt of such notice,  Sublessee
shall vacate the  Subleased  Premises,  leaving the Subleased  Premises  vacant,
broom clean, with all personal property and trade fixtures removed and otherwise
complying with its obligations under this Sublease (including but not limited to
Art.  25(b)) as of the end of the term of this Sublease or earlier  termination,
upon the earlier of: (a) that date 150 days after a copy of such notice is given
to  Sublessee,  or (b) the end of the term of this  Sublease  (or the end of the
renewal term,  if Sublessee  has exercised its renewal  option prior to the date
such notice is given to Sublessee).  The renewal option  contained in Article 10
of this Sublease shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect if this
Sublease is so terminated prior to exercise of the renewal option.  If Sublessee
fails to timely vacate the Subleased Premises as set forth above,  Sublessor may
be exposed to  substantial  damages,  including  but not limited to liability to
Landlord  for the payment of rent for the  balance of the term of the  Overlease
(as if the Overlease had not been terminated).  Accordingly, Sublessee agrees to
indemnify  and hold  Sublessor  harmless  from and  against  all  claims,  loss,
damages,  liability, and costs Sublessor may incur, including but not limited to
reasonable  attorneys' fees and consequential  damages, by reason of Sublessee's
failure to timely vacate. Such indemnity shall not apply and

                                      21

<PAGE>



Sublessee shall not be liable to Sublessor to the extent Sublessor's damages are
caused by its own  failure  to timely  vacate.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Sublessee acknowledges that Sublessor shall have the right to negotiate with the
Landlord  under the  Overlease  to shorten the 180 day period for  vacating  the
Premises.  Sublessee  agrees  that  if  Sublessor  and  Landlord  enter  into an
agreement to shorten such period,  the 150 day period provided in this Paragraph
shall be correspondingly shortened on a day for day basis, to the extent that it
is  applicable;  provided  that, in no event shall  Sublessee have less than 120
days after notice to vacate the Subleased Premises. Sublessor shall promptly and
continually  advise  Sublessee  of any  discussions  between  Sublessor  and the
Landlord  regarding  any such proposed  agreement,  provided that the failure of
Sublessor  to do so shall not  invalidate  any  notice  that  complies  with the
foregoing requirements. If Sublessor receives any consideration from Landlord in
connection with such a shortening of the period for vacating including,  without
limitation,   any  payment,  rebate  or  credit,   Sublessor  shall  share  such
consideration  with Sublessee based on Sublessee's  Proportionate  Share. If the
notice to  Sublessor  under  the  Release  Agreement  (described  in the  second
sentence of this  paragraph 30) is given and does not require  Sublessor to give
such notice to Sublessee,  then, upon termination of the Overlease, the Sublease
shall  become a direct  lease  pursuant  to Article 19 of the  Sublease  and the
Consent and subject to  Landlord's  right to  terminate  the lease upon 120 days
notice.

            31.   [Intentionally omitted]

            32.   The Americans With Disabilities Act.

            The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, together with the rules
and regulations promulgated  thereunder,  as such law, rules and regulations may
now or  hereafter  be amended or restated,  are  hereinafter  referred to as the
"ADA".  If the Subleased  Premises or any portion thereof are used by Sublessee,
its subtenants,  successors and/or assigns as a "place of public accommodation,"
as such term is defined in the ADA,  Sublessee shall (a) comply with all present
and future  requirements  of the ADA as they relate to the  Subleased  Premises,
whether or not such compliance requires structural or non-structural alterations
to be made;  and (b) reimburse  Sublessor  for all costs  Sublessor may incur to
bring the common  areas of the  Premises  into  compliance  with all present and
future  requirements  of the ADA; and (c) indemnify and hold harmless  Sublessor
from and against all claims,  actions,  costs,  damages,  penalties,  losses and
liabilities Sublessor may incur by reason of any action or proceeding instituted
against  Sublessor  and/or  Sublessee by reason of the use of all or part of the
Subleased Premises as a place of public accommodation. If, at the time any claim
or demand is made by Sublessor upon Sublessee under this Paragraph,  other space
in the  Building  is also  used as a place of  public  accommodation,  Sublessee
shall,  with respect to its liability under clause (b), be responsible  only for
its share of such costs.  Such share shall equal a fraction,  the  numerator  of
which is the leasable  area of the  Subleased  Premises and the  denominator  of
which is the sum of the  leasable  areas of the  Subleased  Premises  and of the
other space used as a place of public accommodation.  All changes,  alterations,
additions, improvements, and repairs made by Sublessee to the Subleased Premises
shall be performed in compliance with all applicable requirements of the ADA.

            33.   Counterparts.

            This Sublease may be executed in two or more  counterparts,  each of
