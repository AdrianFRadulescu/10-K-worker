ITEM 1.    BUSINESS


General

         Ventura  Entertainment  Group Ltd.  ("Ventura"  or the  "Company") is a
diversified broadcast,  marketing and corporate communications services company.
As of December 30, 1994, the Company acquired 80% of Soundview Media Investment,
Inc., ("Soundview"),  a development stage company established for the purpose of
acquiring broadcast properties. (See Business - Broadcast.) In November 1994 the
Company  acquired a 51%  interest in  Greenwich  Entertainment  Group,  Inc.,  a
development  stage company in the out-of-home  motion  simulation  entertainment
business.  The Company was incorporated  under the laws of the State of Delaware
on May 16, 1988.

         The Company is engaged in the business of marketing corporate services,
owning  broadcasting  properties  and  marketing  events.  The Company  provides
related   corporate   services   including   creating  and  managing   corporate
sponsorships,   specialty  video  productions,  corporate  promotions  including
product  placement,  facilities and production  design,  and the distribution of
television programs.

         The  Company's  principal  office  is  located  at  11466  San  Vicente
Boulevard,  Los  Angeles,  California  90049.  Its  telephone  number  is  (310)
820-0607.  In addition to the principal office,  the Company has primary offices
in New York City and Charlotte,  North Carolina.  The New York office is located
at 345 Park Avenue South,  New York, New York 10010, and its telephone number is
(212)  685-0666  . The  Charlotte  office  is  located  at 147 N.  Harbor  Road,
Davidson, North Carolina 28036, and its telephone number is (704) 896-0200.


Plan of Recapitalization and Change of Management

         On July 25,  1994,  the  shareholders  of  Ventura  approved  a Plan of
Recapitalization  ("Recapitalization")  whereby  Ventura's  common  shareholders
received  an  aggregate  of  700,000  Units . Each Unit  consisted  of three and
one-half shares of Common Stock; one Class C Warrant;  one Class D Warrant;  and
one right to receive five shares  (aggregate - 3,500,000 shares) of common stock
of the Producers  Entertainment Group Ltd.  ("Producers") owned by Ventura.  The
Recapitalization  also  included an effective  l-for-4  reverse  stock split and
therefore, all references to shares of Common Stock herein have been adjusted to
give effect to the l-for-4  reverse stock split.  Each Class C Warrant  entitles
the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $3.50 per
share until July 25, 1997.  Each Class D Warrant  entitles the holder thereof to
purchase  one share of Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share until July 25,
1997.


                                      -1-
<PAGE>


         As a  result  of the  Recapitalization,  the 100  shares  of  Series  A
Preferred  Stock that were issued by Ventura for EMC were converted into 966,666
shares  of  Common  Stock  and each of the 180  outstanding  shares  of Series B
Preferred Stock became convertible into 11,111 shares of Common Stock (aggregate
- - - - 1,999,980 shares) and were subsequently converted, including accrued interest,
into   2,291,977   shares  of  Common  Stock.   The  Company's   Certificate  of
Incorporation was also amended to authorize  5,000,000 shares of $.001 par value
preferred stock.

         In connection with the Recapitalization,  new officers and directors of
the Company were elected. See "Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers."


History

         Effective with the  Recapitalization  the Company  changed its business
focus to marketing,  corporate  communications  services, and broadcasting.  The
Company has  developed its business to date through the  acquisition  of several
small entities.

         Broadcast

         In December 1994 the Company  acquired 80% of Soundview,  a development
stage  company  with  purchase  agreements  for the pending  acquisition  of two
network affiliated television stations located in the southeast. The purchase of
the ABC  affiliate in  Montgomery,  Alabama was  finalized  April 11, 1995.  The
purchase  agreement  for the NBC  affiliate  in  Tallahassee,  Florida  has been
extended pending consumation of Soundview's financing package.

         Also,  in  November  1994 the  Company  signed a letter  of  intent  to
purchase American Communications and Television, Inc., owner of WTGS FOX Channel
28,  Hilton  Head/Savannah,  Georgia  from  Trivest  Financial  Services,  Inc.,
(Trivest). The final purchase agreement was signed March 10, 1995 subject to FCC
approval and the Company's ability to obtain financing.  Also, in March 1995 the
Company  signed a letter of intent to purchase  the FOX  affiliates  in Spokane,
Washington, Yakima, Washington and Medford, Oregon. These six stations will form
the base of the Company's broadcast division which the Company intends to expand
to twelve stations in the next two years, subject to finding stations which meet
its  business  and  acquisition  criteria  and the  Company's  ability to obtain
necessary financing.

         Marketing and Corporate Communications Services

         As of  August  1,  1994,  the  Company  acquired  Kaleidoscope  and its
subsidiaries,  Kaleidoscope Holdings, Inc. ("KHI"),  Kaleidoscope Entertainment,
Inc.  ("Entertainment"),  Lifestyle Marketing Group, Inc. ("LMG"),  and People &
Properties,   Inc.("P&P"),   (collectively   referred  to  as   "Kaleidoscope").
Kaleidoscope is in the business of event management; productions; promotions and
corporate  sponsorships;  and distribution of television programs.  Prior to the
acquisition  of  Kaleidoscope,  the  principal  business  of the  Company was to
provide  corporate  sponsorship  services to  companies,  including  promotions,
product  placements,  event marketing and speciality  video  production  through
Entertainment Marketing Corporation, ("EMC"), acquired in March 1993.

Earlier History

         In October 1992,  Ventura  entered into a non-binding  letter of intent
with Mr. Floyd W. Kephart who, at that time,  was the sole  shareholder  of EMC.
This non-binding letter of intent contemplated,  among other things, the private
placement of shares of Ventura's  preferred  stock,  the  acquisition of certain
television  advertising  time and the  acquisition  of EMC. The letter of intent
also contemplated that, upon the completion of these transactions, Ventura would
submit a Plan of  Recapitalization  to its shareholders which would, among other
things,  enable  Ventura's  shareholders to directly own Ventura's  common stock
interest  in two  partially  owned  publicly  traded  companies,  The  Producers
Entertainment  Group  (Producers)  and Harmony  Holdings,  Inc.  (Harmony).  The
contemplated  transactions were subject to further  discussions  between Ventura
and Mr.  Kephart and other  conditions  including  the  execution of  definitive
agreements,  receipt of legal and tax opinions and  compliance  with  regulatory
requirements.  These  discussions  resulted  in  certain  modifications  to  the
original terms of the  non-binding  letter of intent  including the retention of
the Harmony shares by Ventura.

         In 1993 and 1992  Ventura  sold 130  shares of its  Series B  Preferred
Stock ("Series B Stock") for $1,300,000 ($10,000 per share), acquired television
advertising  time and EMC. The television  advertising  time was acquired for 50
shares of Ventura's Series B Preferred Stock and a cash payment of $100,000.  As
of March 31,  1993,  EMC was  acquired in exchange  for 100 shares of  Ventura's
Series  A   Preferred   Stock   ("Series   A   Stock").   As  a  result  of  the
Recapitalization,  each share of Series B Stock became  convertible  into 11,111
shares of Common Stock (aggregate  1,999,980  shares) and the Series A Stock was
automatically  converted into 966,666 shares of Common Stock.  In March 1995 all
of the Series B Preferred Stock had been converted.


Business - Broadcasting

         The  Company's  overall  business  strategy  is to become a  vertically
integrated television company capable of developing and distributing  television
programming  based on sports and other sponsored events and capable of capturing
a larger  measure of revenue than  otherwise  would be attained.  The  Company's
current goal is to acquire up to twelve  network-affiliated  television stations
in the television  markets  ranking between 50 and 125 DMA in the United States,
the maximum currently permitted under law. Under appropriate circumstances,  the
Company may also consider  acquisitions of television stations not meeting these
criteria.  The Company's  management  continuously  evaluates various television
broadcasting  properties  for possible  acquisition  and  frequently  engages in
discussions  with  persons  having an  interest  in such  properties.  There are
existing  agreements with regard to the  acquisition of six television  stations
("Stations").

         As an integrated enterprise,  the Company will attempt (1) to capture a
larger portion of the revenue  currently  generated by the broadcast  television
industry  through its  relationship  with its  corporate  clients  utilizing its
managed  events  and  related  promotions;  (2) to  lessen  the  financial  risk
associated  with the operation of local  television  stations  through access to
lower cost programming  resulting from television  programs which it produces or
syndicates;   and  (3)  to  increase  its  flexibility,   both  financially  and
operationally, to take advantage of new potential revenue streams and



                                      -3-
<PAGE>



methods  of  operation  as they  become  available  in the  evolving  television
industry,  including but not limited to,  providing time for short and long form
infomercials.

         The Company hopes to create  additional  value for its  shareholders by
utilizing its corporate  relationships  and by adhering to the business strategy
described  above.  There  can be no  assurance,  however,  that any  significant
relationships will be effectively utilized,  and the Company's business strategy
is subject to review and change at any time.  If the  Company  does  acquire the
television  broadcasting  properties as outlined  above,  the Company will incur
substantial additional  indebtedness.  Moreover,  while several of the Company's
competitors in the  entertainment  industry  possess  operations  that are, to a
certain  extent,  integrated,  the Company  believes that the  integration  of a
marketing,  and a distribution  company coupled with broadcast  stations under a
single corporate structure represents, as yet, an unproven approach. The Company
believes that this approach may result in benefits and synergies to the combined
enterprise,  but there can be no assurance  that such benefits and synergies can
be realized by the Company.

         Television Broadcasting Industry Overview. The United States television
market,  the largest in the world,  is  primarily  served by three  distribution
channels:  (1) the National  Networks:  ABC,  CBS, NBC and Fox; (2)  independent
commercial television stations;  and (3) cable (including pay cable). The United
States television market is comprised of 1,518 stations:  559 commercial VHF-TV,
594 commercial UHF-TV,  123 educational  VHF-TV and 242 educational  UHF-TV. The
three major  networks,  ABC, CBS and NBC,  each of which has  approximately  200
affiliated   stations,   and  the  recently   formed  Fox  network,   which  has
approximately  140  affiliates,  dominate  the  commercial  markets.  The  major
networks  provide their  affiliates  with  approximately  22 hours of prime time
programming  per week, as well as with a substantial  amount of programming  for
other time periods,  including news and sports. Fox provides its affiliates with
approximately  15 hours of prime time  programming  per week,  is not  currently
providing news and provides only a very limited  amount of programming  for time
periods  other than  prime time  except  for NFL  football.  Network  affiliates
broadcast  the  networks'  programming  and national  commercials  in return for
payments by the network's.  This relationship  results in the network being able
to reach  virtually  all of the  significant  television  markets  in the United
States.  Cable  services are  generally  classified  as being either basic cable
(advertiser-supported) or pay-per-view.  The most successful cable networks each
can reach more than one-half of United States television households.

         Revenues of television stations are derived primarily from (i) national
spot  advertising,  which  consists of  advertising  time sold to  national  and
regional  advertisers  (47.5%);  (ii)  local  advertising,   which  consists  of
advertising time sold to local advertisers (45%); and (iii) network compensation
payments,  which are made by a network to an affiliated station in consideration
for its broadcasting of network  commercial  programs (7.5%).  Advertising rates
are related to the population and number of television  receivers located in the
area served by a station; the demographic characteristics of such population; as
well as the  audience's  aceptance  of a station's  programming  as reflected in
surveys by independent rating services. Many national spot and local advertising
contracts  are  short-term  and revenues  from such  contracts  are sensitive to
changes in prevailing economic conditions.




                                      -4-
<PAGE>



         In 1994,  television  advertising  revenues exceeded 33 billion dollars
for all television,  an increase over 1993. Television  advertising revenues for
1994  included  significant  political  or  advertising  revenues  that were not
generated in 1993. Industry analysts expect 1995 television advertising revenues
to be between 4% to 6% above 1994,  with most of the  increase  coming in fourth
quarter  1995  as  general  economic   conditions   improve  and  national  spot
advertising shows some signs of resurgence.

         A slowdown in the growth of television  industry  advertising  revenues
has been  prevalent  since 1986 and is due to several  factors.  These include a
general decline in viewing shares garnered by over-the-air  television  stations
due to increased competition from alternative viewing sources,  especially cable
television,  the general  economic  slowdown and a resulting excess of available
advertising  time in many  television  markets.  Revenues of network  affiliated
stations have been particularly  affected by the increased  programming  choices
provided  to viewers by cable  television  operators.  The  networks'  decreased
market share from 85% of prime time TV  households in 1980 to a projected 65% in
1995, has adversely impacted  advertising  revenues of affiliated  stations.  In
addition,  decreased  network  profits have caused the networks to  signifiantly
reduce the compensation fees they pay to affiliated stations.

         During the past several  years,  there has been growth in the number of
programming,  entertainment  and  video  distribution  systems,  such  as  cable
television,  satellite master antenna systems, multipoint distribution services,
syndicated and pay television, pay-per-view interactive video and video cassette
rentals.  Many of these alternative  program sources have expanded their channel
or  programming  capacity.   These  additional  program  services  compete  with
broadcast  television  stations for viewing shares since the customer is offered
more viewing alternatives.

         Several new technologies in their developmental  stages are expected to
provide competitive video program services, such as: distribution of programming
on demand by  telephone  companies;  "wireless  cable" and  direct  broadcasting
satellite systems,  including Ku-band high frequency  satellite  transmission to
smaller-sized receiving dishes; digital video compression, which may enable many
video  distribution media to substantially  increase channel capacity;  and high
definition television ("HDTV") capable of transmitting  television pictures with
higher resolution,  truer color and wider aspect ratios. At this time, it cannot
be  determined  what  impact  these  developing  technologies  will  have on the
television broadcast industry.

         The FCC regulates  television  stations under the Communications Act of
1934, as amended (the "Communications  Act") which,  together with FCC rules and
policies  thereunder,  govern the issuance,  renewal and assignment of licenses,
technical  operations  and,  to  a  limited  extent,  program,   employment  and
commercial  practices.  Television  broadcast  station licenses are issued for a
maximum term of five years and are renewable  upon  application  for  additional
five-year  terms.  Renewal  applications  are  granted  without  hearing  if the
licensee's  qualifications are not materially challenged either by a third party
or the FCC and if no competing applications for the same license are filed.

         Under FCC  policies,  a timely  filed  renewal  permits the licensee to
continue operating the station until such time as the application may be denied,
and such denial becomes final.




                                      -5-
<PAGE>


         On October 5, 1992,  Congress  enacted  the Cable  Television  Consumer
Protection  and  Competition  Act  of  1992  (the  "CPCA"),  which  proposed  to
substantially  increase  regulation of cable  television and requires the FCC to
conduct  rule-making  proceedings  which may have a significant  impact upon the
environment in which the Stations  compete.  Television  broadcasters  generally
have been  supportive of cable  regulation  to balance the current  economic and
competitive  advantages enjoyed by the cable industry.  The Company is unable to
predict at this time the ultimate impact of these developments on its television
broadcast operations.

         Other issues of significance to the television broadcast industry which
are expected to be considered by Congress or the FCC include:

o        Fin Syn rules - On April 1, 1993,  the FCC  substantially  relaxed  its
         financial  interest  and  network  syndication  rules,  which  had been
         established in 1970 to bar television  networks from having a financial
         interest in ownership or distribution of television programs. Effective
         June 5, 1993, all of the former  restrictions  were  eliminated  except
         with  respect to active  domestic  syndication  by existing  television
         networks.  The remaining  restriction  is scheduled to expire two years
         after the lifting of certain  court consent  decrees which  essentially
         replicate the FCC's 1970 rules, and from which the networks have sought
         relief. The relevant decrees were lifted on November 8, 1993,  however,
         the FCC has agreed to accept  arguments  for and  against the rules and
         suggested that the remaining rules could be eliminated  before they are
         scheduled to "sunset" in November  1995.  The ultimate  effect of these
         rules  and  developments  upon  the  Company's   operations  cannot  be
         predicted.

o        Multiple ownership,  duopoly and cable  cross-ownership rules - On June
         12, 1992, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to consider
         a relaxation of the national  ownership  rules which  currently limit a
         television  broadcaster  to the ownership of 12 television  stations or
         25% of national audience; the duopoly rules which prohibit a television
         broadcaster  from  owning two or more  television  stations in the same
         market; one-to-a-market rules which limit common ownership of radio and
         television  stations  in  the  same  market;  the  network-cable  cross
         ownership  restrictions  which currently prohibit common ownership of a
         broadcast  network  and cable  television  systems,  and the rule which
         prohibits  commonly owned "dual networks" which operate  simultaneously
         and serve substantially similar areas. Currently, the FCC may waive its
         one-to-a-market rule in certain well-served major metropolitan markets,
         or under  certain  circumstances,  if a proposed  sale is  necessary to
         avoid loss of a station's  broadcasting  service. The Company is unable
         to predict the  ultimate  outcome of possible  relaxation  of these FCC
         rules and the impact on its television broadcast operations.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>



o        HDTV - An FCC task force is currently  evaluating  several HDTV systems
         that  would  enhance  the  quality  of  television   transmission   and
         reception. The FCC has already determined that each existing television
         station will be allowed three years from the FCC's  adoption of an HDTV
         system and HDTV spectrum allocation plan to apply for an additional UHF
         channel for HDTV  broadcasting  and another three years to construct an
         HDTV  facility.  The FCC has  determined  that  HDTV  will be a digital
         system,   incompatible   with  current   television   transmitters  and
         receivers. Each licensed station will ultimately be required to forfeit
         its existing channel at the conclusion of a mandatory conversion period
         to HDTV  broadcasting,  which the FCC  expects to occur by 2008.  It is
         also possible that  technology may permit  enhanced  picture quality of
         current  systems.  The  Company  is unable to  predict at this time the
         impact of such possible  technical changes in its television  broadcast
         operations   or  the   financial   requirements   to  convert  to  HDTV
         broadcasting.

o        Political   advertising  -  In  response  to  ongoing  and   threatened
         litigation   on  behalf  of  certain   political   candidates   against
         broadcasters over alleged  violations of political  advertising  rules,
         the FCC took action in 1991 to clarify its political advertising rules.
         The requirement to charge political  candidates the lowest rate charged
         other advertisers for advertising spots was modified to permit numerous
         categories of fixed and  preemptible  time for purposes of  determining
         lowest unit price.  The FCC also has  asserted  exclusive  jurisdiction
         over political advertising complaints.

o        Copyright  reform - Certain  members  of  Congress  have  expressed  an
         interest in reviewing cable television's  compulsory copyright license,
         which currently  permits cable television  systems to carry the signals
         of  local   broadcasters  for  free  and  to  carry  broadcast  signals
         originating from other markets at a relatively  inexpensive  percent of
         their gross basic service revenues.  The Motion Picture  Association of
         America and some major league sports organizations advocate elimination
         of cable television's  compulsory copyright license and requiring cable
         television  systems to negotiate in the open marketplace with copyright
         holders for the right to broadcast their copyrighted programs including
         television stations' locally originated programming.  In addition, some
         proposals  advocate  that  local  television   broadcasters  should  be
         compensated for packaging and compiling the  programming  they telecast
         in which the  copyrights  are owned by others in addition to  receiving
         compensation   for   copyrights   they  hold  for   locally   originatd
         programming. The Company is unable to predict at this time the ultimate
         outcome  of  a  possible  modification  or  repeal  of  the  compulsory
         copyright   license  and  the  impact  on  its   television   broadcast
         operations.

o        Program  length  commercials  - The CPCA required the FCC to determine,
         regardless   of   prior   proceedings,   whether   stations   that  are
         predominantly  utilized for the transmission of sales  presentations or
         program  length  commercials  (commonly  known as "home  shopping") are
         serving  the  public  interest.  In  response,  the FCC found that such
         stations indeed serve the public  interest.  On October 7, 1993, on its
         own motion,  citing Congressional debates on the CPCA which reflected a
         more   general   concern  with  the  issue  of   commercialization   in
         broadcasting,   the  FCC  issued  a  Notice  of  Inquiry  to   consider
         reestablishing  limits  on  the  amount  of  commercial  matter  that a
         television  station can broadcast.  Among the options being  considered
         are  limitations  imposed on an hourly  basis which would  preclude the
         broadcasting of infomercials,  or limitations based upon longer periods
         of time that would permit at least some such broadcasts. The Company is
         unable to predict at this time the  ultimate  outcome of this  inquiry,
         however if enacted the Company believes it would have a negative impact
         upon its television broadcast operations.

o        Beer and wine  advertising - In 1984,  the United States  Supreme Court
         let stand a Mississippi ban upon broadcast and print alcoholic beverage
         advertising.  In 1985,  Congressional  hearings  were held on  proposed
         federal  restrictions on beer and wine advertising,  but resulted in no
         legislation.  In 1993, legislation was introduced in both the House and
         Senate to require five  rotating  messages on the danger of drinking to
         be included in all beer and wine  commercials.  Broadcasters  generally
         oppose such an approach,  which they believe would strongly  discourage
         alcoholic  beverage  advertising.  The  Company is unable to predict at
         this time the  ultimate  outcome of this  proposed  legislation  or its
         impact upon its television broadcast operations.

o        State  service taxes - In 1987,  Florida  imposed a 5% tax upon various
         types  of  service  income,  including  advertising.  In  the  face  of
         significant  threats to cancel business conducted within the State, the
         tax was repealed in 1988.  Several  states have explored the imposition
         of similar taxes in recent years,  but have ben discouraged  from doing
         so, in part  reacting to the Florida  experience.  It is possible  that
         such  taxes  could be  enacted  in  states in which  the  Company  owns
         Stations or conducts other  business.  The Company is unable to predict
         the impact of such taxes upon its operations.

o        The  Chairman of the FCC has proposed a plan which,  if adopted,  would
         required broadcasters to air more children's programming.  The proposed
         plan  would  allow  broadcasters  to pay other  stations  to produce or
         broadcast some of the shows as an option. Under a 1990 law broadcasters
         are required to air programs that educate and inform children but there
         are no requirements for a minimum amount of such  programming.  The FCC
         determines  at  license  renewal  time  whether a  station  has met its
         obligations.  The  Company  is unable to  predict  the  outcome of this
         proposed plan or its impact upon its television operations.

Business - Marketing and Corporate Communications Services

         The  Company is a provider of various  services  to major  corporations
whose media,  marketing and promotional  plans require  identification  with the
"feel good" industries of sports, education and entertainment.

         The services  provided by the Company are usually pursuant to exclusive
contracts  directly with a corporate  client.  The Company will normally receive
compensation  based upon a monthly  retainer;  reimbursement  of  expenses;  and
either a success fee or participating interest in the program, project, event or
promotion.  It is the goal of the  Company  to acquire  or own  programming  and
events  in  conjunction  with  corporations  which  are  committed  to long term
indentification   with   selected   sport   events,   educational   programs  or
entertainment markets.

         The corporate  communication  services  provided by the Company include
corporate  management and media  consulting;  event  sponsorship and management;
corporate  video  production  and   distribution;   facilities   design;   event
production;    corporate    presentations   including   trade   shows,   product
introductions, conferences, seminars and training programs; event promotions and
product placement in film and television.

         The Company is recognized as a leader in media consulting, sponsorships
and  promotions  relating to motor  sports,  golf,  and the Olympics (as well as
lighting and production design of corporate events).

         Currently the Company is providing services to General Motors,  General
Motors Credit Card, Proctor & Gamble, Coca Cola, Mobil, Citigo,  Ralston Purina,
Pennzoil,  AT&T,  Cigna,  Metropolitan  Life, JVC,  Hitachi,  Sony, Parke Davis,
General  Mills and Reckitt & Coleman.  The  Company is serving as the  exclusive
Olympic   marketing   consultant   for  the  1996   Olympics  for  Xerox,   York
International, Cox Communications, General Motors, and the Champion Products and
Coach Leatherware divisions of Sara Lee.

         The  Company  directly   competes  with  other  entities  that  provide
lifestyle and sports marketing;  advertising and media  consulting;  educational
programming and distribution; lighting and facility design; video production and
distribution;  event management and  sponsorship.  While some of its competitors
are larger and have  greater  resources,  management  believes  the  Company has
certain competitive advantages resulting from its recognized leadership position
in motor sports,  golf, the Olympics,  lighting and production design as well as
media  consulting.  In addition the Company does not know of any competitor that
can provide the scope of corporate  communication  services  represented  by the
Company.  Management  does not believe that any company  commands a  significant
portion of the $4.2 billion corporate sponsorship market.

         The Company has developed its current  business through the acquisition
of small privately owned service companies including EMC and Kaleidoscope. It is
the intent of management to build its business based on competitive growth.





                                      -9-

         Management  believes  it  can  improve  its  broadcast   operations  by
enhancing revenues and decreasing  individual station  programming costs through
the  corporate  communication  services  business.  It is  believed  this can be
accomplished through the utilization of event programming,  promotions and video
distribution opportunities available to the company as a result of its corporate
communication services activities.  The company intends to explore these avenues
of revenue  enhancement and cost or programming  reductions upon its acquisition
of each television station.


Media and Marketing

         During  1993  and  1994,  the  Company  acquired   certain   television
advertising  time from  Trivest in exchange  for 50 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock  and a  cash  payment  of  $100,000.  The  advertising  time  is  for  the
Savannah/Hilton  Head  television  station (WTGS) and expires in March 1997. The
Company has the right to either utilize this television  advertising time itself
or assign,  sell and/or  barter it to others.  The spots are for  various  times
throughout  the day and are  available  for each day of the week. As part of the
agreement to purchase WTGS,  Trivest will substitute its note for the balance of
unused time as of the closing date or provide  substitute time acceptable to the
Company.

         The Company may barter either media time, services and/or products of a
corporation  in  exchange  for its  agreement  to  provide  media and  marketing
services.  In 1994,  the Company,  together  with an  unaffiliated  third party,
entered  into  an  agreement  to  provide   certain  media  time  to  a  vehicle
manufacturer.  In connection with this agreement,  the manufacturer  transferred
certain vehicles to the Company which were  subsequently  sold for approximately
$2,484,000.  The manufacturer also agreed to pay approximately $2,000,000 to the
Company as the media time is used. The Company is committed to acquire the media
time based on a media plan to be  provided  by the  manufacturer.  To date,  the
manufacturer has not provided the Company with its media plan, accordingly,  the
Company has made no commitments to acquire any additional  media time beyond the
approximately  $70,000  expended.  The amended  agreement with the  unaffiliated
third  party  provides  for a cash  payment of  $400,000  and the  payment of an
additional  amount of up to $200,000  based on the payments to be received  from
the vehicle manufacturer.  In connection with this agreement, the Company issued
this third party a five year option to purchase 25,000 shares of Common Stock at
a price of $2.50 per  share.  The  $400,000  payment  has been  reflected  as an
expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


         Foreign Bank Financing

         In August 1994,  the Company  borrowed  $2,750,000  from a foreign bank
pursuant to a 8% convertible  debenture due January 2, 2001. The registration of
the  underlying  1,100,000  common  shares was  completed  in early 1995 and the
debentures  were  converted by the bank in March 1995.  The Company  transferred
284,000  shares of Harmony and issued 190,000 shares of Common Stock to the bank
as a result of the conversion and the penalty payment required by the agreement.

         Competition

         The Company  competes with numerous  other  companies in all aspects of
its  operations.  Many of these other companies are much larger than the Company
and have substantially greater resources than the Company.

         Employees

         The Company employs 93 persons on a full-time  basis.  The Company does
not anticipate any material  change in the number of its full-time  employees in
the near future.  None of the  Company's  employees are  represented  by a labor
union  and  the  Company  believes  that  it has  good  relationships  with  its
employees.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTY

         The  principal  office of the  Company is located at 11466 San  Vicente
Boulevard,  Los Angeles,  California and consists of approximately  7,000 square
feet.  The lease for these  premises  expires on July 13, 1997. The Company also
leases a 6,300 square foot office/warehouse in North Hollywood, California under
a lease  that  expires  on January  31,  1996,  a 5,800  square  foot  office in
Davidson,  North  Carolina  under a lease  that  expires  on May 31,  1995.  The
Company's  office located at 345 Park Avenue South,  New York, New York consists
of  approximately  22,000 square foot. The lease for these  premises  expires on
October 31, 2002.

         The Company believes that its current facilities are sufficient for its
needs for the foreseeable future.


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         An action  entitled  Steve  Zackary  v.  Arthur  Mogull,  et.  al.  was
commenced  in the Los Angeles  Superior  Court on February  25, 1994 against the
Company,  its wholly owned inactive  subsidiary Ventura Music Group Ltd. ("VMG")
and other individual and corporate defendants.  In his complaint,  the plaintiff
alleges,  among other  things,  breach of contract,  intentional  and  negligent
misrepresentation,  intentional and negligent  infliction of emotional  distress
and seeks unspecified  damages.  All of these claims arose from a series of what
the plaintiff  describes as employment or settlement  agreements between himself
and defendant  Arthur Mogull dated between  August 23, 1990 and August 22, 1991.
The Company  denies any  liability  and is  vigorously  contesting  this matter.
Management  believes  that the  ultimate  outcome of this matter will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

         In its normal  course of  business,  the Company is involved in various
claims and legal actions. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these
matters,  either  individually  or in the  aggregate,  will not have a  material
adverse effect on the Company.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

         On April 6, 1995,  the closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock
were $2-3/8 and  $2-7/16,  respectively.  On such date there were 138 holders of
record of the Common Stock.

         The Company has never  declared  or paid cash  dividends  on its Common
Stock.  The current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain  earnings,  if
any, to provide for the growth of the Company.  Consequently,  no cash dividends
are expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.

         In  view  of  the   effects   on  the   Company  as  a  result  of  the
Recapitalization,  including the  distribution  of the Producers  shares and the
conversion  of the  Series A Stock  into  966,666  shares of Common  Stock,  the
foregoing prices prior to the Recapitalization are not necessarily indicative of
the market prices of the Company's  Common Stock had the  Recapitalization  been
approved as of such dates.

(1)      During  the  year  ended   December  31,  1994,  the  Company  sold  or
         distributed  all the remaining  shares of Producers.  In addition,  the
         Company sold all but 284,000 shares of Harmony.  The remaining  Harmony
         shares  were  transferred  to the  lender as  required  to  fulfill  an
         obligation to the holders of the  convertible  debentures  converted in
         March 1995. In addition,  the Company discontinued all direct marketing
         and related production  activities during December 1994.  Consequently,
         all  revenues  and costs  associated  with such  activities,  including
         Harmony and Producers,  are reflected in the accompanying statements of
         operations as discontinued operations.

         30 to the calendar  year and has restated  prior periods on that basis.
         As a result of  accounting  for Harmony and  Producers as  discontinued
         operations,  a balance  sheet as of December 31, 1990 on that basis was
         not available. A balance sheet at June 30, 1991 is presented.

         date of each  acquisition:  EMC since  March 1993;  Kaleidoscope  since
         August 1, 1994; and Soundview since December 30, 1994.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

         The  Company  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  owning   broadcasting
properties,  marketing events,  obtaining corporate  sponsorships,  creating and
managing  corporate  promotions,  product  placements  and the  distribution  of
television   programs.   The  Company   conducts  its  operations   through  its
wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  EMC and  Kaleidoscope  and its 80% owned  subsidary
Soundview.  The Company  intends to recommend a change in the Company's  name to
its  shareholders at its annual  meeting.  Subsequent to the change of the name,
management  intends to conduct its  operations  through  five  divisions  and to
eliminate its operating subsidiaries.

         As of December 30, 1994 the Company  acquired  80% of  Soundview  Media
Investments  Inc. a  development  stage company  established  for the purpose of
acquiring broadcast properties.

         As of August 1, 1994 the Company acquired  Kaleidoscope and as of March
31, 1993, the Company acquired EMC, in transactions  accounted for as purchases.
Accordingly,  the  accounts of EMC and  Kaleidoscope  have been  included in the
Company's consolidated financial statements since such dates.

         During  the  year  ended   December  31,  1994,  the  Company  sold  or
distributed all the remaining shares of Producers. In addition, in December 1994
the Company sold all but 284,000 shares of Harmony. The remaining Harmony shares
were  required  to  fulfill an  obligation  to the  holders  of the  convertible
debentures  converted in March 1995. In addition,  the Company  discontinued all
other direct marketing and related  production  activities during December 1994.
Consequently, all revenues and costs associated with such activities,  including
Harmony  and  Producers,   are  reflected  in  the  accompanying  statements  of
operations as discontinued operations.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 1994 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1993

         Revenues  for the year  ended  December  31,  1994 were  $5,796,297  as
compared to  $1,570,721  for the year ended  December 31,  1993,  an increase of
$4,225,576.  The  acquisition of  Kaleidoscope as of August 1, 1994 accounts for
$3,730,863 of this increase.  Ventura  acquired EMC as of March 31, 1993 and its
results of operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements since that date.  Accordingly,  EMC's revenues have been included for
twelve  months in 1994 as compared to nine  months in 1993,  accounting  for the
balance of the increase in 1994 revenue.  During 1994, the Company  expanded its
business to include corporate promotion,  product placement and event marketing,
in addition to its corporate  sponsorship  activities.  The Company expects that
the continued  expansion of these  activities will result in increased levels of
revenues in future years.




                                      -16-
<PAGE>



         Operating   expenses  for  the  year  ended   December  31,  1994  were
$10,766,535 as compared to $4,275,442 for the year ended December 31, 1993 or an
increase of $6,491,093. Of this increase, $4,061,729 was due to the inclusion of
Kaleidoscope for five months in 1994. The balance of the increase related to the
inclusion  of EMC for a full year in 1994  versus  nine  months  in 1993,  costs
related  to  contracts  purchased  of  $1,341,294,   expenses  relating  to  the
Recapitalization  which was approved by the Company's  shareholders  on July 25,
1994, and expenses  relating to the  development  and expansion of the Company's
business.  These expenses  included  additional  personnel,  advertising  costs,
promotional expenses and related items.


         Other income (expense) consists of the following:

Interest  expense in 1994  primarily  relates to  borrowings by the Company from
Harmony, an officer and the Kaleidoscope notes payable for five months. The loss
on return of television  time represents the cash portion of the amount paid for
the  television  advertising  time that was  returned  to the  seller.  Minority
interests in  operations  of a subsidiary  relate to the  operating  expenses of
Greenwich   Entertainment   shared  by  the  49%  minority   shareholders  since
acquisition in November 1994.

During 1994, the Company  disposed of the balance of its interest in Harmony and
Producers  and  discontinued   all  direct  marketing  and  related   production
activities.   Consequently,   all  revenues  and  costs  associated  with  these
activities  are reflected as  discontinued  operations.  In 1994 this includes a
gain on sale of Harmony and Producers' shares of $848,195,  the Company's equity
in the net loss of Harmony and  Proucers of  $1,333,947,  and internal net costs
incurred in direct marketing and related production of $1,095,061.  For the year
ended December 31, 1993, the discontinued  operations included a gain on sale of
Harmony and Producers' shares of $1,187,913 and a gain on sale of tax loss carry
forwards  to  Harmony  of  $456,765,  offset by a share of  operating  losses of
$3,626,292,  a  write-off  of film  costs of  $1,425,125,  and other net  direct
marketing and related production expenses of $118,166.

Year Ended December 31, 1993 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1992

         Revenues  for the year  ended  December  31,  1993 were  $1,590,721  as
compared to $182,796 for the year ended  December  31,  1992.  Revenues for 1993
consisted of revenues of EMC that were earned since its  acquisition as of March
31,  1993.  Revenues of EMC consist of fees  earned  with  respect to  corporate
sponsorship management.  The Company did not receive any revenues from completed
projects  during 1993.  During 1992, the Company  received  $120,000 of revenues
from the  licensing of its  completed  projects and recorded  $90,000 in related
amortization expense. The balance of the revenue came from rental of the Studio.

         Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $4,393,603
as compared to $946,072 for the year ended  December  31,  1992,  an increase of
$3,447,531.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  matters  relating  to  the
Recapitalization and the inclusion of EMC from March 31, 1993.

         Other income (expense) consists of the following:

         Interest expense  primarily  relates to interest on the mortgage on the
Studio. Subsequent to December 31, 1992, the Studio was returned to the mortgage
holder in lieu of foreclosure.  During 1993, the Company and Producers agreed to
settle a lawsuit and to issue  securities with a value of $500,000 and $400,000,
respectively.

         The discontinued operations amount for the year ended December 31, 1992
includes,  a $370,934  gain on the sale of shares of Harmony and  Producers  and
$490,656  representing the Company's share of their income,  and $351,480 due to
the write-down of film costs.

         Due to the  uncertainty  regarding  amounts  to be  received  from  its
completed  projects  in  the  future,  the  Company  wrote  off  the  $1,425,125
unamortized  balance of film  costs as film  amortization  during  1993 which is
included in discontinued  operations.  Also during 1993, the Company and Harmony
agreed to exchange all amounts owed by the Company to Harmony in the approximate
amount of  $457,000  for the  additional  future tax  benefits to be received by
Harmony  as a result  of  Harmony's  inclusion  in the  Company's  1990 and 1991
consolidated federal income tax returns.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         As of December  31,  1994,  the Company had cash of  $3,439,459,  total
current assets of $6,090,605 and current  liabilities of $7,012,315 or a working
capital deficiency of $921,710. Included in current liabilities is $2,413,000 of
deferred  revenue which will be recognized upon the utilization of media time to
be acquired by the Company in connection  with a barter  advertising  agreement.
See "Item 1. Business - Barter Advertising."

         The Company's  operations  during 1994 and 1993 used cash of $6,500,000
which  has been  primarily  financed  by  proceeds  received  from  sales of its
securities   ($1,395,00),   sales  of   Producers   and  Harmony   common  stock
($4,555,000),  loans from a foreign bank and private  placement  of  convertible
debentures   ($3,690,000).   Such   proceeds,   net  of  repayments   aggregated
approximately $9,500,000. In connection with the Recapitalization, the shares of
Producers  that were owned by the  Company  were  distributed  to the  Company's
shareholders.  Of the  1,484,000  shares of Harmony  common  stock  owned by the
Company, 1,200,000 shares have been sold in December 1994 for $2,520,000.

         In August 1994,  the Company  borrowed  $2,750,000  from a foreign bank
pursuant to a note with principal due on January 2, 2001. The note was converted
into 1,100,000 shares of the Company's common stock in March 1995.
(See "Item 1. Business - Foreign Bank Borrowing.")

         The Company's barter agreement with a vehicle manufacturer obligates it
to  acquire  certain  media  time  to be used by  this  manufacturer.  Upon  its
utilization of this advertising time, the vehicle manufacturer has agreed to pay
the Company an additional  $2,000,000.  To the extent that these future payments
are less than the cost of the media time to be  acquired,  the  Company  will be
required to utilize its resources.

         Pursuant to employment  agreements,  certain of the executive  officers
and other key employees of the Company are entitled to minimum base compensation
aggregating  approximately $2,035,000 for the year ending December 31, 1995. The
Company's  leases and other  commitments  provide for minimum annual payments of
approximately $750,000.

         In  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  Kaleidoscope,  the  Company
guaranteed  an  aggregate  of  $750,000  of  Kaleidoscope's  debt  due to one of
Kaleidoscope's  former  shareholders.  The  Company  has also  agreed  to obtain
releases on behalf of this  shareholder  from  approximately  $1,251,000 of debt
guaranteed  by him.  The Company has not obtained  such  releases and the former
shareholder has issued notice to the Company regarding this failure. The Company
has not made any other arrangements for sources of external  financing,  such as
bank lines of credit. The Company has no commitments for capital expenditures.

         For the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company incurred an
aggregate  operating  loss of  approximately  $7,700,000  and interest  expenses
aggregating approximately $146,000. A substantial portion of this operating loss
was related to matters in connection  with the  Recapitalization.  Since October
1992, when the Company  entered into the  non-binding  letter of intent with Mr.
Kephart,  and March 31,  1993,  when the Company  acquired  EMC, the Company has
expended funds on the development of its present business.  The Company believes
that it could not fully exploit its current  business and enter into  additional
agreements until the Recapitalization was approved by the Company's shareholders
and the uncertainties  relating thereto were removed.  The  Recapitalization was
approved by the  Company's  shareholders  on July 25,  1994.  Subsequently,  the
Company, among other things,  completed a long-term borrowing of $2,750,000 from
a foreign bank which was converted to common equity in March 1995; completed the
placement of $1,100,000 in convertible debt; sold Harmony shares for $2,520,000;
and acquired Kaleidoscope and Soundview. In addition, the Company has definitive
plans to acquire six television stations,  and in a related transaction to these
acquisitions the Company has proposed debt financing of $25,000,000.  Management
believes  it will be  necessary  to raise  additional  equity  and/or  to obtain
additional  financing to complete the proposed  acquisitions  and  implement its
business plan.  Management believes that the actions being taken, when complete,
will enable the Company to substantially  increase its revenues and operate on a
positive cash flow basis.

         If the Company  does not operate on a positive  cash flow basis and its
present resources are not sufficient to absorb any cash losses, the Company will
need to obtain financing through the debt or equity markets. In order to fulfill
its overall plan and its financial obligations,  the Company is pursuing several
financing  alternatives.  However,  there can be no assurance that any financing
will occur. The independent auditors report indicates that they believe there is
sufficient  reason to have  substantial  doubt  about the  Company's  ability to
continue as a going  concern.  The Company  could also use the proceeds from the
exercise  of its  Class C  Warrants  and  Class D  Warrants  to  fund  any  cash
requirement.  However, there can be no assurance that any of these warrants will
be exercised. Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash
obligations for at least the next twelve months.

Inflation

Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

         As of July 1, 1993,  the Company  adopted the  provisions  of Financial
Accounting  Standards Board Statement No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes". The
adoption  of SFAS No.  109 did not have an  effect  on the  Company's  financial
statements.

ITEM 8.                    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

         The Company's financial statements have been included herein under Item
14 (a)(1).

ITEM 9.       CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
              ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
              DISCLOSURE

         On  October  25,  1994,  the  Company  with the  approval  of the Audit
Committee,  advised  Kellogg & Andelson that it was dismissing  such  accounting
firm, and was retaining the  accounting  firm of BDO Seidman as auditors for the
next fiscal period. The decision to retain BDO Seidman was based upon a need for
an  accounting  firm with a  national  presences  and was not  motivated  by any
disagreements  between  the  Company  and  Kellogg  &  Andelson  concerning  any
accounting matters.  During the entire period of their engagement (September 22,
1992,  to October 25,  1994),  there have been no  disagreements  with Kellogg &
Andelson  relative to accounting  principles or practices,  financial  statement
disclosure,  auditing  scope or  procedures,  which if not resolved to Kellogg &
Andelson's  satisfaction,  would have  resulted  in a  reference  to the subject
matters of the disagreement,  in connection with its report.  Kellogg & Andelson
reports on the  Company's  financial  statements  have not  contained an adverse
opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,  nor were the opinions qualified or modified
as to  uncertainty,  audit scope, or accounting  principles,  nor were there any
events of the type requiring  disclosure  under Item  304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K.

         On October 25,  1994,  the Company  informed  BDO Seidman that they had
been  appointed  as the  Company's  certifying  accounting  firm for the current
fiscal  year.  During the last two years,  the  Company  has not  consulted  BDO
Seidman concerning any matter.

         On July 27,  1992,  the  Company  terminated  Coopers & Lybrand  as its
independent  auditors because it did not believe that it had received sufficient
or timely advice from them. The Company reported that it had a disagreement with
Coopers  &  Lybrand  regarding  the  calculation  of the  amount of income to be
realized  on a  transaction.  The  decision to  terminate  Coopers & Lybrand was
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

         The  Company  was  subsequently  provided  with a copy of a letter from
Coopers & Lybrand  dated August 17, 1992 wherein  Coopers & Lybrand  agreed that
there was a disagreement regarding the calculation of the amount of income to be
realized and  disagreed  with the  Company's  statement  that it did not receive
sufficient or timely advice from them.

         Coopers & Lybrand has not advised the Company  that this  disagreement,
if not resolved to its  satisfaction,  would have caused them to make  reference
thereto in their report on the consolidated  financial statements of the Company
for the year ended June 30, 1992.  The audit report of Coopers & Lybrand for the
year ended June 30, 1991 did not contain any adverse  opinion or  disclaimer  of
opinion,  and was not qualified or modified as to  uncertainty,  audit scope, or
accounting procedures.



                                      -21-
<PAGE>

         The  disagreement  related to the computation of the amount of the gain
realized by the Company as a result of the initial public offering of securities
by Harmony which  occurred in November  1991.  Prior to filing its Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended December 31, 1991, the Company computed the amount of the gain
realized as approximately $1,767,000.

         Subsequent  to filing its  December  31,  1991 Form 10-Q,  the  Company
received a memorandum from Coopers & Lybrand which calculated the amount of gain
to be  realized  in a  different  manner  than the  Company's  computation.  The
calculation  provided by Coopers & Lybrand  resulted in the amount of gain to be
realized of approximately  $537,000.  The Company advised Coopers & Lybrand that
it did not agree with its computation of the gain to be realized.

         In  connection  with its  dismissal  of Coopers & Lybrand,  the Company
reported that it would review the  computation of the gain realized on Harmony's
initial public offering with its new independent auditors, when engaged.

         In connection with the filing of the Company's proxy material  relating
to The Plan of Recapitalization, this gain was recomputed to be $143,641.

         On September 25, 1992,  the Company  engaged  Kellogg & Andelson as its
independent  auditors.  In connection with the engagement of Kellogg & Andelson,
neither  the  Company  nor  anyone  acting on its  behalf,  consulted  Kellogg &
Andelson  as  to  the  application  of  accounting  principles  to  a  specified
transaction  either completed or proposed,  or the type of opinion that might be
rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

         In connection  with its  engagement of Kellogg & Andelson,  the Company
authorized Kellogg & Andelson to communicate directly with Coopers & Lybrand, if
they so desired,  with respect to this  disagreement.  The Company did not place
any  limitation on Coopers & Lybrand to respond fully if so requested by Kellogg
& Andelson.

         Bennett  Smith became a director on October 31, 1994.  Mr. Smith is the
President  and CEO of Soundview  Media  Investment,  Inc., a Ventura  subsidary.
Prior  to  Soundview,  Smith  was  President,  CEO and  co-owner  of New  Vision

television  stations.  Smith  previously  held the offices of Vice President and

         Don Dixon has been the President of Lifestyle  Marketing Group since he
founded it in  partnership  with  Saatchi & Saatchi PLC in 1985.  Mr.  Dixon has
extensive Olympic-related  promotional and marketing experience working with the
United States Olympic Committee,  the International  Olympic Committee,  and the

         Tony Andrea is the founder,  CEO and  President of People & Properties,
Inc., a sports marketing and television  packaging agency started in 1975. Prior
to that date he was  director of  advertising  and  promotion  for the  National

         The Delaware  Supreme Court has held that  directors' duty of care to a
corporation and its stockholders  requires the exercise of an informed  business
judgment.   Having  become  informed  of  a11  material  information  reasonably
available to them,  directors  must act with  requisite care in the discharge of
their duties. The Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation through
its  Certificate  of  Incorporation  to exonerate  its  directors  from personal
liability to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty of care as a director, with certain exceptions. The exceptions
include a breach of the  director's  duty of loyalty,  acts or omissions  not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law,
improper  declarations of dividends,  and transactions  from which the directors
derived an improper personal benefit. The Company's Certificate of Incorporation
exonerates its directors,  acting in such capacity,  from monetary  liability to
the extent  permitted by this statutory  provision.  The limitation of liability
provision  does  not  eliminate  a  stockholder's  right  to  seek  nonmonetary,
equitable  remedies  such as injunction or rescission to redress an action taken
by directors.  However,  as a practical  matter,  equitable  remedies may not be
available  in all  situations  and there may be  instances in which no effective
remedy is available.

         The Company  understands  that it is the position of the Securities and
Exchange  Commission that insofar as the foregoing  provisions may be invoked to
disclaim  liability for damages  arising under the  Securities  Act of 1933, the
provision  is against  public  policy as  expressed  in the Act and is therefore
unenforceable.

Stock Option Plan

         The  Company's  Stock Option Plan (the "Option  Plan")  provides that a
total of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Option Plan.

         Pursuant to the Option  Plan,  the Company may grant  "incentive  stock
options"  within the meaning of Section  422A of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of
1986, as amended  ("incentive  stock  options") as well as  non-incentive  stock
options to salaried  employees.  The Option Plan provides for  administration by
the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or by a  Committee  of the  Board of
Directors  which  selects  the  optionees,  authorizes  the grant of options and
determines the exercise price of the options.  Currently, the Board of Directors
administers  the Option Plan and Board members are eligible for grants under the
Option Plan. The exercise price of each incentive stock option granted under the
Option  Plan  must be at least  100% of the fair  market  value per share of the
Common Stock as  determined  by the Board of Directors on the date of the grant.
Each incentive  stock option may be exercisable  for a period,  as determined by
the Board of  Directors,  but not in excess of ten years from the date of grant.
The exercise price of all options  granted under the Option Plan to stockholders
possessing  more than 10% of the total  combined  voting power of all classes of
stock of the Company  must be not less than 110% of the fair market value of the
Common  Stock on the date of grant and such  options  may be  exercisable  for a
period not in excess of five years from the date of grant.

         Incentive   stock   options   granted   under  the   Option   Plan  are
non-transferable,  except upon  death,  by will or by  operation  of the laws of
descent and  distribution,  and may be exercised during the employee's  lifetime
only by the optionee.  There is no limit on the number of shares with respect to
which  options  may be  granted  under  the  Option  Plan  to any  participating
employee. However, under the terms of the Option Plan, the aggregate fair market
value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable
for the first time by an employee during any calendar year (under all such plans
of the Company and any parent and  subsidiary  corporations  of the Company) may
not exceed $100,000.


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

         Options  granted  under the Option Plan may be exercised  within twelve
months after the date of an  optionee's  termination  of employment by reason of
his death or  disability,  or within six months after the date of termination by
reason  of  retirement  or  voluntary  termination  approved  by  the  Board  of
Directors,  but only to the extent the option was otherwise  exercisable  at the
date of termination. In the event an optionee's employment is terminated for any
reason other than death or  disability,  or retirement or voluntary  termination
approved by the Board of  Directors,  such  optionee's  option  shall  terminate
thirty days after the date of such termination.

         The Option Plan expires on May 7, 2000,  unless  terminated  earlier by
the Board of Directors.  The Option Plan is subject to amendment by the Board of
Directors without stockholder approval, except that no amendment which increases

         In May 1994,  the Company  returned  $1,500,000  of the  $2,000,000  of
advertising  time to Trivest in  exchange  for 150 of the 200 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock issued by the Company to Trivest in the original  acquisition of
the advertising  time.  Trivest did not agree to return any part of the $100,000
cash payment.  Trivest did agree to waive all accrued but unpaid  dividends with
respect  to the 150  shares  of  Series  B Stock  that  were  returned.  Trivest
indirectly owns a majority interest in the television  station that will provide
the remaining  advertising  time. Mr. Coy Eklund,  who was elected a director of
Ventura  on July 25,  1994 and was a nominee  for  director  at the time of this
exchange,  is Chief Executive  Officer and Chairman of the Board of Trivest.  In
November 1994 the Company signed a letter of intent to purchase from Trivest all
the shares of American  Communications  and Television,  Inc., owner of WTGS FOX
Channel 28,  Hilton  Head/Savannah  Georgia,  the station  referred to above.  A
purchase  agreement was signed in March 1995 with the only contingency  relating
to FCC  approval.  Also in March 1995  Carleton  Burtt  became  Chief  Operating
Officer of the  Company.  Since 1991 he has served as  President  of Trivest and
will continue to hold that position.

         In February 1994, the Company entered into a $700,000 revolving line of
credit with Harmony  Holdings  which was  collateralized  by a receivable of the
Company's. In August 1994, the balance of $522,000 was paid in full.

         During  the year ended  December  31,  1993,  Mr.  Bibicoff  made loans
aggregating  $1,422,00  to the Company  pursuant to unsecured  promissory  notes
which bore interest at 10%. The balance due at December 31, 1993 of $315,000, as
well as the net  borrowings  in 1994 of $15,000  were repaid by August 1994 from
the net proceeds received from the Company's foreign bank loan.

         In  connection  with the  Recapitalization,  Ventura  acquired  all the
capital  stock of EMC from Floyd  Kephart in exchange for 100 shares of Series A
Stock. Upon the approval of the Plan of Recapitalization, the Series A Stock was
automatically converted into 966,666 shares of Common Stock.

         During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company  acquired  certain

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

                                                                     BDO SEIDMAN

Board of Directors,
Ventura Entertainment Group Ltd.

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ventura
Entertainment Group Ltd. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Ventura Entertainment Group Ltd. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and
1993, and consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in the Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 
company has negative working capital at December 31, 1994, negative cash
flows and operating losses from operations for the year ended December 31,
1994, and anticipates that negative cash flows from operations will
continue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

NOTE 1 -          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
                  ------------------------------------------

                  Organization and Business

                  Ventura   Entertainment   Group  Ltd.  (the   "Company")   was
                  incorporated  under  the  laws of the  State  of  Delaware  on
                  November 17, 1987.  The  Company's  operations  are  conducted
                  through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Entertainment Marketing
                  Corporation    of   America,    ("EMC")    and    Kaleidoscope
                  Entertainment,  Inc.,  Lifestyle  Marketing  Group,  Inc.  and
                  Peoples and Properties,  Inc., (collectively  "Kaleidoscope"),
                  as  well  as  its  80%  owned   subsidiary,   Soundview  Media
                  Investments,  Inc.  (Soundview).  Unless the context indicates
                  otherwise,  the term "Company" includes Ventura  Entertainment
                  Group Ltd. and all subsidiaries.  The Company is a diversified
                  broadcast,  marketing,  and corporate  communications services
                  company.  It is in the  process of  building a  communications
                  company  based on the  ownership of broadcast  properties  and
                  supported through the development,  acquisition,  and sales of
                  programming and related media services.

                  Plan of Recapitalization

                  On July 25, 1994, the  shareholders of the Company  approved a
                  Plan of  Recapitalization  ("Recapitalization).  In connection
                  with the  Recapitalization,  the Company's common shareholders
                  received an aggregate of 700,000 Units. Each Unit consisted of
                  three and one-half shares of the Company's  common stock;  one
                  Class C Warrant; one Class D Warrant; and one right to receive
                  five shares  (aggregate  3,500,000  shares) of common stock of
                  The Producers  Entertainment  Group ("Producers") owned by the
                  Company.  The  Recapitalization  also included an  approximate
                  l-for-4 reverse stock split. Each Class C Warrant entitles the
                  holder  thereof  to  purchase  one share of common  stock at a
                  price of $3.50 per share  until  July 25,  1997.  Each Class D
                  Warrant  entitles the holder  thereof to purchase one share of
                  common  stock at a price of $5.00  per  share  until  July 25,
                  1997.  The Class C and Class D Warrants are  redeemable at any
                  time  by the  Company  upon 30  days'  notice  to the  holders
                  thereof at a price of $.001 each.

                  As a result of the Recapitalization,  the 100 shares of Series
                  A Preferred Stock that were issued by the Company for EMC were
                  converted  into 966,666 shares of common stock and each of the
                  180  outstanding  share of  Series B  Preferred  Stock  became
                  convertible  into 11,111  shares of common stock  (aggregate -
                  1,999,980  shares).  Subsequent to July 25, 1994, all Series B
                  Preferred  shares  including  accrued  interest were converted
                  into   2,291,977   shares  of  common  stock.   The  Company's
                  Certificate  of  Incorporation  was also  amended to authorize
                  5,000,000  shares  of $.001  par value  preferred  stock.  The
                  Company also paid a financial advisor a $50,000 fee and issued
                  to this financial  advisor an aggregate of 160,000 warrants on
                  terms substantially the same as the Class C Warrants.

                  For financial  reporting  purposes,  the  Recapitalization  is
                  reflected  as  a  quasi-reorganization   and  the  accumulated
                  deficit  at the  date  of  the  recapitalization  was  charged
                  against paid-in capital.

                  Principles of Consolidation

                  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
                  accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant
                  intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
                  consolidation.   The  Company  changed  its  fiscal  year  for
                  reporting  purposes from one ending on June 30 to the claendar
                  year ending  December 31. All  Information in these  financial
                  statements are presented based on the December 31 year end.

                  The  acquisitions  described in Note 3 have all been accounted
                  for as purchases and  consequently  their operations have been
                  included from the respective date of each acquisition.

                  Discontinued Operations

                  During the year ended  December 31, 1994,  the Company sold or
                  distributed  all  the  remaining   shares  of  Producers.   In
                  addition,  the Company sold all but 284,000  shares of Harmony
                  Holdings Inc.  ("Harmony").  The remaining Harmony shares were
                  transferred  to a lender as required to fulfill an  obligation
                  to the  holders of the  convertible  debentures  converted  in
                  March 1995. In addition,  the Company  discontinued  all other
                  direct  marketing  and related  production  activities  during
                  December 1994. Consequently, all revenues and costs associated
                  with such  activities,  including  Harmony and Producers,  are
                  reflected in the  accompanying  statements  of  operations  as
                  discontinued operations. (See Note 11)

                  Licensing and Rights and Amortization

                  Amortization of acquired licensing and rights related to films
                  is  charged to  operations  on an  individual-film  basis in a
                  ratio that the current  year's  revenue bears to  management's
                  estimate of total revenues (current and future years) from all
                  sources.  When estimates of total revenues  indicate that such
                  revenues will be less than the carrying  amount of the related
                  licensing  and  rights,  the  applicable  loss  is  recognized
                  currently. In December 1994 the Company charged the balance of
                  $395,000 to expense as part of discontinued operations.

                  Deferred Financing Costs
                  Cost associated with financing  transactions  such as legal or
                  brokerage costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of
                  the particular  financing.  Unamortized costs relating to debt
                  obligations  that are extinguished by conversion to equity are
                  charged to  paid-in  capital  at the time of  conversion.  The
                  Convertible  Debentures  due 2001  contained a  pre-conversion
                  penalty that required the transfer of Harmony  shares in March
                  1995.  The  carryiung   value  of  these  Harmony  shares  was
                  classified  as dererred  financing  costs as of  December  31,
                  1994.

                  Barter Advertising
                  In 1994,  the Company,  together  with an  unaffiliated  third
                  party, entered into an agreement to provide certain media time
                  to a vehicle manufacturer.  In connection with this agreement,
                  the manufacturer  transferred  certain vehicles to the Company
                  which were subsequently sold for approximately $2,484,000. The
                  Company  is  committed  to  acquire  the media time based on a
                  media plan to be provided by the  manufacturer.  To date, this
                  manufacturer  has not provided the Company with its media plan
                  and, accordingly, except for approximately $70,000 expended on
                  media time the Company has made no  commitments to acquire any
                  additional  media time.  The  manufacturer  also agreed to pay
                  approximately  $2,000,000  to the Company as the media time is
                  used.  Included  in deferred  revenue at December  31, 1994 is
                  $2,413,000  of the  proceeds  received  from  the  sale of the
                  vehicles.  Such  revenues will be recognized as the media time
                  is acquired by the Company.  The Company's  amended  agreement
                  with the unaffiliated  third party provided for a cash payment
                  of  $400,000  and the payment of  additional  amounts of up to
                  $200,000 based on the payments to be received from the vehicle
                  manufacturer.  In connection with this agreement,  the Company
                  issued this third party a five year option to purchase  25,000
                  shares of the  Company's  common stock at a price of $2.50 per
                  share.  The  $400,000  payment has been  included in operating
                  expense in the  accompanying  December  31, 1994  consolidated
                  financial statements.

                  Income Taxes
                  Effective  July 1,  1993 the  Company  adopted  the  Financial
                  Accounting  Standards Board Statement of Financial  Accounting
                  Standards ("SFAS") No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes". SFAS
                  109 requires a company to recognize  deferred tax  liabilities
                  and assets for the expected future tax  consequences of events
                  that have been recognized in company's financial statements or
                  tax returns.  Under this method,  deferred tax liabilities and
                  assets are  determined  based on the  difference  between  the
                  financial  statement  carrying amounts and tax bases of assets
                  and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years
                  in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company
                  has not  recognized  the  benefit  of any net  operating  loss
                  carryforwards  as a result of adopting SFAS 109 and the effect
                  of the  aforementioned  implementation  has been determined by
                  management to be immaterial.

                  Sales of Stock by Harmony and Producers
                  At the time Harmony or Producers sold their stock to unrelated
                  parties  the  Company's  ownership  interest  in each  company
                  decreased.  The  difference  between the  Company's  ownership
                  interest in each company's equity as a result of such issuance
                  is recorded as an adjustment of additional paid-in capital.

                  Sales of Stock of Harmony and Producers

                  When the Company  sells  shares of Harmony or  Producers,  the
                  gain on these sales is measured by the difference  between the
                  net cash proceeds  received and the Company's  carrying amount
                  of the  shares  sold using the  equity  method of  accounting.
                  These gains are  included in  operations  at the time that the
                  shares  are  sold  and  reflected  as  part  of   discontinued
                  operations in the accompanying financial statements.

                  Cash and Cash Equivalents

                  Cash and cash  equivalents  include  money  market  funds  and
                  certificates  of  deposit  with a maturity  of  initial  three
                  months or less.

                  Equipment and Depreciation

                  Purchases  of  equipment  are  capitalized.   Maintenance  and
                  repairs are expensed.  Upon the disposition of equipment,  the
                  applicable cost and accumulated  depreciation are removed from
                  the   accounts  and  any  gains  or  losses  are  included  in
                  operations.  Depreciation  of  equipment  is  provided  on the
                  straight-line  method based on the  estimated  useful lives of
                  the related assets (generally 3 to 5 years).

                  Loss on Studio

                  The Company's  wholly owned  subsidiary,  Ventura Media Center
                  Ltd.  ("Center")  owned  a  film  and  television   production
                  facility  located in Orem,  Utah,  which was held for sale and
                  leased to others.  During the year ended  December  31,  1993,
                  Center agreed to return this  facility to the mortgage  holder
                  and accordingly,  the carrying amount and the related mortgage
                  were  written off in the year ended  December  31,  1993.  The
                  Company  is  not  directly  or  contingently  liable  for  the
                  mortgage on this facility or any other debts of Center.

                  Goodwill

                  The excess of the fair value of the consideration  given, over
                  the  fair  value  of the  net  assets  received  as part of an
                  acquisition accounted for as a purchase, is shown as goodwill.
                  When  shares  of the  Company's  Common  Stock are part of the
                  consideration,  such shares may be valued  based on a discount
                  from  the  quoted  market  value.  In  determining  whether  a
                  discount  is  appropriate,  management  considers  whether the
                  shares  are  currently  registered,  whether  the  Company  is
                  committed to future  registration,  and whether the shares are
                  to be held by an "insider"  with  restrictions  on  subsequent
                  sale.  In  the   Kaleidoscope   and  Soundview   acquisitions,
                  1,428,796 and 1,000,000  shares were issued  respectively  and
                  recorded at  approximately  50% of the quoted  market value at
                  date of issue. All such shares were  unregistered and are held
                  by  executives  of the  Company or  minority  shareholders  of
                  Soundview.
                  This goodwill is being amortized over twenty years.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 -          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED
                  ------------------------------------------------------

                  Reverse Stock Split

                  In connection  with the approval of the  Recapitalization,  an
                  approximate one-for-four reverse split of the Company's common
                  stock was  effective.  The effects of this reverse  split have
                  been retroactively reflected in the accompanying  consolidated
                  financial statements and notes.

                  (Loss) Per Share

                  (Loss) per share is based on the  weighted  average  number of
                  common  shares  outstanding  during the periods  after  giving
                  effect (in 1994 and 1993) to the dividend  requirement  of the
                  Series B Preferred Stock. Outstanding warrants and options are
                  not included in per share calculations  because the effects of
                  their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

NOTE 2 -          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
                  -------------------------------

                  The accompanying  consolidated  financial statements have been
                  prepared in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
                  principles, which contemplates the continuation of the Company
                  as a going  concern  including the  realization  of assets and
                  liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

                  As of December 31, 1994,  the Company had cash of  $3,439,459,
                  total current assets of $6,090,605 and current  liabilities of
                  $7,012,315  or  a  working  capital  deficiency  of  $921,710.
                  Included  in current  liabilities  is  $2,413,000  of deferred
                  revenue which will be recognized upon the utilization of media
                  time to be acquired by the Company in connection with a barter
                  advertising   agreement.   See  "Item  1.  Business  -  Barter
                  Advertising."

                  The  Company's  operations  during  1994 and 1993 used cash of
                  $6,500,000  which  has been  primarily  financed  by  proceeds
                  received from sales of its  securities  ($1,395,00),  sales of
                  Producers and Harmony common stock ($4,555,000),  loans from a
                  foreign bank and private  placement of convertible  debentures
                  ($3,690,000).  Such  proceeds,  net of  repayments  aggregated
                  approximately    $9,500,000.    In    connection    with   the
                  Recapitalization,  the shares of Producers  that were owned by
                  the Company were distributed to the Company's shareholders. Of
                  the  1,484,000  shares of Harmony  common  stock  owned by the
                  Company,  1,200,000 shares have been sold in December 1994 for
                  $2,520,000.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 2 -          LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - CONTINUED
                  -------------------------------------------

                  Management   believes  that  a  substantial   portion  of  the
                  Company's   operating   losses  was   related  to  matters  in
                  connection with the Recapitalization which was approved by the
                  Company's  shareholders on July 25, 1994. The Company has also
                  expended  substantial sums on the development and expansion of
                  its current  business.  Management  believes  that the Company
                  could not fully  exploit its current  business  and enter into
                  additional  agreement until the  Recapitalization was approved
                  by the Company's  shareholders and the uncertainties  relating
                  thereto  were  removed.   Subsequent  to  this  approval,  the
                  Company,  among other things,  completed a long-term borrowing
                  of  $2,750,000  from a foreign  bank  which was  converted  to
                  common  equity  in March  1995;  completed  the  placement  of
                  $1,100,000  in  convertible  debt;  sold  Harmony  shares  for
                  $2,520,000;   and  acquired  Kaleidoscope  and  Soundview.  In
                  addition,  the  Company  has  definitive  plans to acquire six
                  television  stations,  and in a related  transaction  to these
                  acquisitions   the   Company   has   proposed   financing   of
                  $25,000,000. Management believes it will be necessary to raise
                  additional  equity  and/or to obtain  additional  financing to
                  complete the proposed  acquisitions and implement its business
                  plan.  Management  believes that the actions being taken, when
                  complete,  will enable the Company to  substantially  increase
                  its revenues and operate on a positive cash flow basis.

                  If the Company does not operate on a positive  cash flow basis
                  and its present  resources  are not  sufficient  to absorb any
                  cash losses, the Company will need to obtain financing through
                  the debt or equity  markets.  In order to fulfill  its overall
                  plan and its  financial  obligations,  the Company is pursuing
                  several  financing  alternatives.  However,  there  can  be no
                  assurance  that any  financing  will occur.  The Company could
                  also  use  the  proceeds  from  the  exercise  of its  Class C
                  Warrants  and Class D Warrants  to fund any cash  requirement.
                  However,  there can be no assurance that any of these warrants
                  will be exercised.  Management  believes that the Company will
                  be able to meet its  cash  obligations  for at least  the next
                  twelve months.

NOTE 3 -          ACQUISITIONS
                  ------------

                  Broadcasting

                  As of December 30, 1994 the Company  acquired 80% of Soundview
                  in exchange for one million  Ventura common shares.  Soundview
                  had purchase  agreements  pending for the  acquisition  of two
                  network-affiliated   television  stations,  WHOA-TV,  the  ABC
                  affiliate in Montgomery,  Alabama for  $8,500,000  (subject to
                  potential future reductions) and WYWC-TV, the NBC affiliate in
                  Tallahassee,  Florida for $5,500,000. In addition, in November
                  1994,  the  Company  signed a letter  of  intent  to  purchase
                  WTGS-TV the Fox  affiliate in Savannah,  Georgia for 2,875,000
                  shares of common stock. The purchase  agreement on WTGS-TV was
                  signed on March  10,  1995  subject  to FCC  approval  and the
                  Company's ability to obtain financing.

                  The purchase of WHOA-TV  Montgomery was completed on April 11,
                  1995 and the closing of the  purchase  of WTWC-TV  Tallahassee
                  was extended pending final documentation and funding. In March
                  1995,  Soundview  signed a  letter  of  intent  to buy the Fox
                  affiliates  in Spokane,  Washington,  Yakima,  Washington  and
                  Medford,  Oregon for  $16,400,000  cash,  1,283,000  shares of
                  Ventura common stock and assumption of debt.

                  Kaleidoscope

                  As of August 1, 1994, the Company acquired  Kaleidoscope which
                  is  in  the   business  of  event   management;   productions;
                  promotions  and  corporate  sponsorships;  and  producing  and
                  distributing  television programs.  In exchange for all of the
                  stock of Kaleidoscope,  the Company issued 1,428,796 shares of
                  common stock.

                  In  connection  with the  transaction,  Kaleidoscope  issued a
                  $500,000 note to a prior shareholder in addition to a LMG note
                  of  $250,000  to  the  same   shareholder.   The  Company  has
                  guaranteed  both of these  notes and has  pledged the stock of
                  Kaleidoscope  as  collateral.  The  Company has also agreed to
                  secure, by May 1, 1995, releases on behalf of this shareholder
                  from his guarantee of $935,000 bank loans,  $221,000 letter of
                  credit and a $106,000 bank loan made to an unrelated party. If
                  the Company does not secure such releases, the shareholder has
                  the  right to  reacquire  the  shares of P&P and LMG that were
                  sold to Kaleidoscope and $1,371,416 of advances made to P&P.

                  If the Company had acquired Kaleidoscope as of January 1, 1993
                  the  Statement of Operations  would have been as follows:  (in

                  As of March 31, 1993, the Company acquired EMC in exchange for
                  100 shares of Series A  Preferred  Stock  which were valued at
                  their  aggregate par value of $500. The assets and liabilities

NOTE 4 -          TELEVISION ADVERTISING TIME
                  ---------------------------

                  In  March  1993,  the  Company  acquired  certain   television
                  advertising  time in  exchange  for 200 shares of its Series B
                  Preferred  Stock and a cash payment of $100,000  (see Note 9).
                  This television  advertising time was valued at $2,000,000 and
                  consisted of commercial spots on certain  television  stations
                  that  could  be used in 30  second,  60  second  or 90  second
                  segments  through  December 1997. The Company has the right to
                  assign, sell and/or barter this television advertising time to
                  others.  During the year ended  December 31, 1994, the Company
                  returned  $1,500,000 of the $2,000,000 of advertising  time in
                  exchange for 150 of the 200 shares of Series B Preferred Stock
                  originally issued by the Company.  The seller did not agree to
                  return any part of the $100,000 cash  payment.  The seller did
                  agree to waive all accrued but unpaid  dividends  with respect
                  to the 150  shares  of  Series B  Preferred  Stock  that  were
                  returned. The adjustment for the return reduced the television
                  advertising  time by $1,500,000.  The Series B Preferred Stock
                  and additional paid-in capital were reduced by an aggregate of
                  $1,425,000 and $75,000 was charged to operations.

NOTE 5 -          NOTES PAYABLE
                  -------------

                  The note  payable  to bank at  December  31,  1994  represents
                  amounts due a New York bank by two subsidiaries and guaranteed
                  by a prior shareholder of a Kaleidoscope. The weighted average
                  interest  rate was 9.45% in 1994.  The company is obligated to
                  secure the  release  of this  guarantee  by May 1,  1995,  the
                  current  due date of the notes.  The  balance of  $315,000  at
                  December 31, 1993  represents  amounts due an officer  bearing
                  interest at 10% which was repaid in August 1994.

NOTE 8 -          CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES DUE 2001
                  -------------------------------

                  The Convertible Debentures due 2001 related to borrowings from
                  a foreign  bank.  The entire amount was converted to 1,100,000

                  284,000  shares  of  Harmony  to the bank and  issued  190,000
                  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock  as a  result  of the
                  conversion and the penalty payment required by the agreement.


NOTE 9 -          SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
                  --------------------

                  In connection with the approval of the  Recapitalization  (see
                  Note  1),  the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  was
                  amended  to  authorize  5,000,000  shares  of $.001  par value
                  preferred stock. Prior to that time the Company's  Certificate
                  of  Incorporation  authorized 1,000 shares of preferred stock,
                  $5 par value per share.

                  The Company's  Certificate of  Incorporation  also  authorized
                  25,000,000 share of common stock, .001 par value per share. As
                  of  December  31,  1994  and 1993  there  were  7,708,303  and
                  2,278,750 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively.

                  During the year ended  December 31, 1993,  the Company  issued
                  100 shares of its Series A  Preferred  Stock in  exchange  for
                  EMC. The Series A Preferred Stock was entitled to one vote per
                  share and was not entitled to dividends.  Upon the approval of
                  the  Recapitalization  (See Note 1),  the  Series A  Preferred
                  Stock was converted into 966,666 shares of common stock.

NOTE 9 -          SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY - CONTINUED
                  --------------------------------

                  During the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company
                  sold 130 shares of its Series B Preferred  Stock at a price of
                  $10,000  per  share.  The  Company  also  issued 200 shares of
                  Series B Preferred  Stock (which were valued at $1,900,000) in
                  connection   with  its   acquisition  of  certain   television
                  advertising  time. In connection with the return of certain of
                  this  advertising  time (see Note 4), 150 of these shares were
                  returned to the Company and  canceled.  The Series B Preferred
                  Stock is  nonvoting.  Holders of the Series B Preferred  Stock
                  were entitled to cumulative  dividends of 8% or $800 per annum
                  commencing  on  June  15,  1993.  Upon  the  approval  of  the
                  Recapitalization   (see  Note  1),  each  share  of  Series  B
                  Preferred Stock became  convertible  into 11,111 shares of the
                  Company's  common  stock.  Subsequent  to July 24 but prior to
                  December  31,  1994,  120 shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock
                  (including  accrued  dividends)  were converted into 1,523,096
                  shares of common stock.  Subsequent to December 31, 1994,  the
                  remaining 60 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted
                  into 768,881 shares of common stock.

                  In  connection  with the  exchange  of benefits to be received
                  from the additional tax loss  carryforwards  received from the
                  Company, Harmony charged the portion previously represented by
                  the $325,000 nonrecourse obligation to its equity. The Company
                  has  reflected  its  portion of this  charge  ($124,000)  as a
                  reduction of additional paid-in capital in 1993.

                  During the year ended December 31, 1994,  Producers acquired a
                  Company in a transaction  which was accounted for as a pooling
                  of  interests.   Accordingly,   Producers  has   retroactively
                  restated its  financial  statements to include the accounts of
                  this  company.  The  Company's  proportionate  share  of  this
                  transaction  has been  recorded  by the Company as a charge to
                  accumulated  deficit.  The company  acquired by Producers  had
                  elected to be taxed as a  Subchapter S  corporation  under the
                  provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code and applicable  state
                  tax  regulations.  The  amount  of  losses  recorded  by  this
                  company's  shareholders  has been  recorded by  Producers as a
                  reduction of additional  paid-in  capital with a corresponding
                  decrease in Producers'  accumulated  deficit.  The Company has
                  recorded its  proportionate  share of this  adjustment  in the
                  same manner as Producers. This adjustment had no effect on net
                  shareholders' equity.

                  In  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  Kaleidoscope   and
                  Soundview  (see  Note  3  Acquisitions)   the  company  issued
                  1,428,796 and 1,000,000 shares respectively.

                  During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company  acquired
                  certain contracts.  As part of the purchase price, the Company
                  agreed  to  issue  201,465  shares  of its  common  stock.  In
                  addition in 1994 the Company issued 93,000 shares for services
                  valued  at  $195,195  and  45,445  shares in  settlement  of a
                  lawsuit recorded in 1993.

                  Pursuant to the  Company's  stock  option plan the Company may
                  issue  options to officers  and key  employees  to purchase an
                  aggregate of 1,550,000 shares of common stock. The Company may
                  also  issue  non-qualified  options.  During  the  year  ended
                  December 31, 1994,  the Company  issued  171,250 shares of its
                  common stock upon the  exercise of stock  options and received
                  proceeds of $327,500.

                  In addition,  during the year the Company issued 125,000 stock
                  options  to  non-executive  board  members  and  250,000  to a
                  director  as  part of a  noncompete  contract.  An  additional
                  25,000 options were issued in relation to the barter agreement
                  discussed  in Note 1. All  options  were at $2.50 a share  and
                  none were exercised.

                  In January 1995 the Board of  Directors  approved the issuance
                  of stock options for 550,000  shares to  management  personnel
                  and for 100,000 shares to a consultant,  all at $2.50 a share.
                  All  options  were issued at a price which was at or above the
                  market price at date of grant.

Accrued  expenses at December 31, 1994 include  $150,000 of accrued  termination
and costs related to direct marketing. There were no assets at December 31, 1994
related to the discontinued operations.

NOTE 12 -         INCOME TAXES
                  At December 31, 1994, the Company had unused federal and state
                  net operating  loss  carryforwards  which,  at a minimum,  are
                  estimated to be  approximately $7 million for federal purposes
                  and $3.5  million  for state  purposes,  expiring  in  various
                  amounts through 2009. However,  ultimate  realization of these
                  net  operating  loss   carryforwards  is  dependent  upon  the
                  Company's   future  taxable  income  and  may  be  limited  by
                  appropriate  regulations.  Consequently the recorded amount of
                  such loss carryover  benefits,  aggregating $2.7 million,  has
                  been fully reserved.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 13 -         RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
                  On December 14, 1994,  the Company  sold  1,200,000  shares of
                  Harmony  Holdings,  Inc. to Harvey Bibicoff,  a director,  for
                  $2,400,000 cash and a one-year note for $120,000.

                  During 1994 the Company  signed a letter of intent to purchase
                  WTGS FOX  Channel  28 in  Hilton  Head/Savannah  from  Trivest
                  Financial Services, Inc. for 2,875,000 shares of common stock.
                  On March 10, 1995, a definitive  agreement was signed  subject
                  to FCC approval.  Mr. Coy Eklund, a director,  is Chairman and
                  CEO of Trivest and Mr. Carleton  Burtt,  the Company's COO, is
                  President  of  Trivest.  In  addition,   Mr.  Frank  Woods,  a
                  director,  is  Chairman  of the Board of Media  One,  Inc.,  a
                  merchant   banking  firm  which  will  earn  a  fee  when  the
                  transaction is closed.

                  The Company's television  advertising time was acquired from a
                  company of which a director  of the  Company is an officer and
                  director.  In exchange for such  television  time, the Company
                  issued 200 shares of its Series B  Preferred  Stock which were
                  valued at  $1,900,000  and made a cash  payment  of  $100,000.
                  During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Company  returned
                  a portion of this television advertising time to the seller in
                  exchange  for 150  shares  of the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock
                  originally issued (see Note 7).

                  In connection with the Recapitalization,  Ventura acquired all
                  the capital  stock of EMC from Floyd  Kephart in exchange  for
                  100 shares of Series A Stock. Upon the approval of the Plan of
                  Recapitalization,   the   Series A  Stock  was   automatically
                  converted into 966,666 shares of Common Stock.

                  During the year ended December 31, 1994, the Comapny  acquired
                  certain contracts  relating to its product placement  business
                  from Mr. Gary Teel and two other employees of the Company.  In
                  exchange for these  contracts,  the Comapny paid  $360,000 and
                  issued 201,465 shares of Common Stock.

                  In  February  1994,  the  Company   entered  into  a  $700,000
                  revolving line of credit with Harmony which was collateralized
                  by a receivable of the company's.  All of the Company's  loans
                  from  Harmony were repaid in August 1994 from the net proceeds
                  of the Company's foreign bank loan.

                  During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company  borrowed

NOTE 14 -         COMMITMENTS

                  The Company has entered into agreements  (including agreements
                  entered into  subsequent to December 31,  1994),  which expire
                  through 2001 for the services of certain  officers and others.
                  These  agreements  are  multi-year  and provide for  aggregate
                  annual  compensation of approximately  $2,035,000.  Certain of
                  these agreements provide for payments in the event of death or
                  disability of these  individuals.  Certain of these agreements
                  also provide for  additional  compensation  based on operating
                  results  and  under  certain  circumstances  in the event of a
                  change  in  control  of the  Company.  During  the year  ended
                  December  31,  1994,  no  additional  compensation  was earned
                  pursuant to the terms of these agreements.

                  The Company leases various  facilities under operating leases.
                  Future minimum lease payments for the years ending December 31
                  are as follows: 1995-$736,300;  1996-$688,600;  1997-$587,300;
                  1998-$444,800 and 1999-$463,200.

                  1993 and $97,020 in 1992.

NOTE 15 -         SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUIT

                  During  1993,  the Company and  Producers  were  parties to an
                  action which claimed,  among other things,  certain violations
                  of  federal  securities  laws.  This  action  was  purportedly
                  brought as a class  action on behalf of  purchasers  of equity
                  securities of the Company and  Producers.  The Company  denied
                  any wrong  doing and the Company and  Producers  settled  this
                  lawsuit.  The Company issued to the plaintiff 45,455 shares of
                  its common stock and 412,371 stock purchase warrants having an
                  aggregate value of $500,000. Producers issued to the plaintiff
                  warrants  to purchase  its common  stock  having an  aggregate
                  value of $400,000.  The effects of this settlement  agreement,
                  consisting  of the  Company's  $500,000  settlement  plus  the
                  Company's  $176,000 share of the Producers'  settlement,  have
                  been reflected in the consolidated  financial  statements as a
                  charge  to  operations   and  a   corresponding   increase  to
                  additional  paid-in  capital  in the year ended  December  31,
                  1993.

                  In its normal  course of business,  the Comapny is involved in
                  various vlaims and legal actions. Management believes that the
                  ultimate outcome of these matters,  either  individually or in
                  the aggregate,  will not have a material adverse effect on the
                  Company.

                  financial   institutions   or  in  high   quality   short-term

                        INDEPENDENT CONSULTING AGREEMENT

         This  Agreement  entered  into as of October 15,  1994,  by and between
VENTURA  ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, LTD., a Delaware  corporation,  with its principal
place of business at 11466 San Vicente Boulevard, Los Angeles, California or any
successor ("Ventura"),  and DONALD B. LIFTON, whose address is 1198 Charrington,
Bloomfield  Hills,  Michigan 48301  ("Lifton").

In consideration of the mutual premises hereinafter set forth, the parties agree
as follows:

         1. Engagement. This Agreement calls for the performance of the services
of Lifton as an  Independent  Contractor.  Lifton  has not been  hired  with the
intent that he will render legal  services or advice and such legal  services or
advice  are not  within the scope of  Lifton's  duties.  During the term of this
agreement,  Lifton agrees to provide services to Ventura as Corporate  secretary
and business  consultant.  Lifton will not be  considered an employee of Ventura
for any purpose.  Ventura will provide Lifton with necessary and suitable office
space, together with secretarial services, equipped with equipment necessary and
incidental  to the  effective  rendering  of  services  to Ventura  and to other
parties,  or, at Ventura's option, shall reimburse Lifton for all of such office
expenses.

         2. Services.  Lifton agrees to devote a portion of his time, attention,
skill,  energies, and creative efforts to the business of Ventura, not to exceed
an average of 80 hours per month.  The parties  agree Lifton may engage in other
activities for compensation during the term of this Agreement.

         3.  Lifton's   Discretion.   Lifton  agrees  to  furnish  Ventura  such
cooperation as is reasonably  requested by Ventura toward a good-faith effort to
complete  those  specific  projects  or tasks as the parties  mutually  agree to
undertake.  Ventura  recognizes,  Lifton assumes and retains full responsibility
and  discretion  concerning  his hours,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and
independent judgment in undertaking and completion of such projects.

         4. Compensation.

            (a) Ventura  agrees to pay Lifton  $6,250.00 on the 15th day of each
         month from October 1994 through December 1995. Ventura shall accrue for
         Lifton an  additional  $6,250.00  per month.  If, prior to December 31,
         1995, Ventura obtains  commitments for equity or debt totaling at least
         $10,000,000.00,   Ventura   shall  pay  all  such  accrued   additional
         compensation  to Lifton  upon  Ventura's  closing  on such  commitments
         totally at least  $10,000,000.00,  and shall  thereafter  pay to Lifton
         $12,500.00  per month during the  remaining  term  (including  extended
         term(s)  of  this   Agreement).   Lifton  shall  also  be  entitled  to
         participate  in any and all  benefits  from  time to time  afforded  to
         senior officers of Ventura,  except those benefits which may be offered
         only to employees,  such as pension  plans and other  similar  employee
         fringe benefit plan,  provided that benefits  afforded to Lifton may 

                                       1
<PAGE>


         be reduced at such time and in such manner as generally  applicable  to
         senior officers of Ventura.


            (b) In  addition  to the  foregoing,  and  subject  to the terms and
         conditions set forth herein,  Ventura grants to Lifton a  non-qualified
         option to  purchase up to 100,000  shares of  Ventura's  common  stock,
         $.001 per value  (the  "Shares"),  such  option  to be  exercisable  as
         follows and to be nontransferable  except as provided in subsection (v)
         below:

               (i)  Lifton  shall  have the option to  purchase  from  Ventura a
            maximum of 100,000  shares for a total  purchase  price equal to the
            Exercise  Price per Share,  payable as provided in  subsection  (iv)
            below.  Options covering 25,000 shares shall vest  immediately.  The
            remaining  75,000 options shall vest on the earliest to occur of the
            following events: (A) December 31, 1995; (B) an Acceleration  Event;
            (C) when Ventura closes or obtains  commitments by December 31, 1995
            for equity or debt of at least  $10,000,000.00  or (D) when  Ventura
            acquires at least 51% of the voting  common stock of Modern  Talking
            Pictures.  Lifton may  exercise  such  options from time to time but
            before  October 15, 1999 by delivering  written  notices of Lifton's
            exercise of the option to Ventura,  to the attention of the Chairman
            of the Board,  which  notices shall include the number of Shares for
            which Lifton is then exercising his option.

               (ii) An Acceleration  Event shall occur if at any time during the
            term of this Agreement  Ventura shall (aa) consolidate with or merge
            into  another  corporation  and Ventura or a  subsidiary  of Ventura
            shall not be the surviving corporation,  (bb) have a majority of its
            common stock,  $.001 par value, sold in a single transaction or in a
            series of  transactions,  the result of which is to consolidate  the
            ownership  of such  stock in a  single  person  or group of  persons
            acting in  concert,  (cc) have all of its  common  stock,  $.001 par
            value,   held  by  Unaffiliated   Shareholders   sold  in  a  single
            transaction or a series of  transactions,  the result of which is to
            consolidate  the ownership of such stock in a single person or group
            of persons acting in concert, (dd) convey all, or substantially all,
            of its  assets  to  another  corporation,  entity,  or  person,  the
            ownership of which is not  substantially  similar to that of Ventura
            prior to such  conveyance,  or (ee) if Floyd W. Kephart ceases to be
            the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.

               The term "Unaffiliated Shareholder," as used herein, shall mean a
            Shareholder  who is not an officer,  director or employee of Ventura
            or any  entity  the  beneficial  interests  of which are held by any
            director, officer or employee of Ventura.

               (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if Lifton dies or suffers a
            disability, as defined in subsection (vi) all unvested options shall
            vest.

               (iv)  Lifton's  written  notice of exercise of an option shall be
            accomplished  by  either a check for the total  purchase  price,  by
            Lifton's  written   instruction  to  deduct  from  the  Shares  then
            otherwise  purchased  the least  number of Shares  needed to meet or
            exceed  the  total  purchase   price  or  by  a  stock   certificate
            representing  Shares already in Lifton's  possession,  assuming such
            Shares  are  valued  at the  Per  Share  Trading  Price  hereinafter
            defined.  The Per Share Trading Price means the closing bid price on
            the last business day before the written notice of exercise is given
            as reported in

                                       2
<PAGE>


            the Wall Street Journal on NASDAQ or any other public stock exchange
            wherever Shares are currently listed.

               (v) Lifton may  transfer  any option  granted  under this Section
            2(c) to Lifton's  spouse or children,  or to a trust for the benefit
            of Lifton,  Lifton's  spouse  and/or  Lifton's  children;  provided,
            however,  that such transferee shall be able to exercise such option
            only if and when  Lifton  could have  exercised  such option and any
            Shares  acquired upon exercise of such  transferred  option shall be
            subject  to the same  limitations  or  restrictions  that would have
            applied had Lifton exercised such option.  The payment provisions of
            subsection (iv) shall also apply to such transfers.

               Subject to the foregoing, these options shall be non-transferable
            by Lifton, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than
            by will  or the  laws of  descent  and  distribution  and  shall  be
            exercisable  during the option holder's  lifetime only by the option
            holder, regardless of any community property interest therein of the
            spouse  of  the  option  holder,  or  such  spouse's  successors  in
            interest.  If the spouse of the option  holder shall have acquired a
            community  property  interest in such option,  the option holder, or
            the option  holder's  permitted  successors in interest may exercise
            the  option  on behalf of the  spouse of the  option  holder or such
            spouse's successors in interest.

               (vi) For purposes of this  Agreement,  Lifton shall be considered
            "disabled" if as a result of physical or mental injury or impairment
            Lifton cannot adequately perform the duties required under Section 2
            of this  Agreement  and if the Board of  Directors,  based  upon the
            independent  medical  advice of a  physician  selected by the Board,
            determines  that  such  inability  to  perform  can be  expected  to
            continue for at least one year.

               (vii) In the event of any  change in the  Shares  of  Ventura  by
            reason  of any  stock  dividend,  recapitalization,  reorganization,
            merger, consolidation,  split-up, combination or exchange of Shares,
            or of any  similar  change  affecting  Shares,  the number of Shares
            subject to the option  provided in Section  4(c) and their  purchase
            price per Share shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such
            change in such manner as the Board of Directors  may deem  equitable
            to prevent  dilution of at least 1% or an  enlargement of the rights
            granted to Lifton under Section 4(c).  Any  adjustment so made shall
            be final and binding upon Lifton.  This provision shall not apply to
            any dilution caused by this Agreement.

               In the event  the  Company  sells or  offers to sell  Shares at a
            price below the Exercise Price,  the Exercise Price shall be adapted
            downward to such offering or sales price as to all then  unexercised
            options.

               (viii)  Lifton  hereby  represents  and warrants that if and when
            Lifton  purchases  all or any portion of the Shares,  such  purchase
            will be for Lifton's own account and solely for  investment  and not
            with a view toward resale or other distribution. Lifton acknowledges
            and agrees that some or all of the Shares have not been and will not
            be  registered  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended (the
            "Act"),  or under the securities  laws of any state,  and may not be
            sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of (except, to the
            extent  permitted by  applicable  securities  laws,  to any trust in
            which Lifton is the grantor and sole beneficiary during his 

                                       3

<PAGE>


            lifetime  and/or to any direct  family  members  and/or to  Lifton's
            spouse) unless the Shares have been  registered and qualified  under
            the Act and any  applicable  state's  securities  law,  or unless an
            exemption from such registration or qualification is available.

               Lifton  further  acknowledges  that some or all of the Shares may
            constitute  "restricted  securities"  within the meaning of Rule 144
            promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Shares
            may not be sold,  assigned,  transferred  or  otherwise  disposed of
            except and unless all conditions set forth in Rule 144 are satisfied
            or unless an exemption from registration  under the Act is otherwise
            available.

               The  certificates  representing  some  or all of the  Shares  may
            contain the following legend:

               "The  shares   evidenced  by  this   certificate  have  not  been
               registered  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended  (the
               "Act"),  or  under  the laws of any  state,  any may not be sold,
               assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of unless such shares
               have  been   registered  or  qualified  under  the  Act  and  any
               applicable  state's  securities  law, or unless an exemption from
               such registration or qualification is available."

               After endorsement, the certificates representing the Shares shall
            be  delivered  to Lifton,  who  shall,  subject to the terms of this
            Agreement,  be entitled to exercise  all rights of ownership of such
            Shares.  Certificates representing Shares not bearing a legend shall
            be  delivered  to Lifton in exchange  for the  certificates  bearing
            legends as and when, from time to time,  Ventura receives an opinion
            of its counsel to the effect that such legends may be removed, which
            opinion  Ventura  agrees to seek in good  faith if so  requested  by
            Lifton.

               Lifton  represents and warrants to Ventura that he will cooperate
            fully  with  Ventura  in the  preparation  and filing of any and all
            documents  necessary  to be filed with the  Securities  and Exchange
            Commission pursuant to its rules.

               Ventura  represents  and  warrants  that it will file any and all
            documents  necessary  to be filed with the  Securities  and Exchange
            Commission pursuant to its rules.

               (ix) The  Exercise  Price per Share for each  option  shall equal
            $2.50.

            (c)  Ventura  shall  reimburse  Lifton  for  50% of  all  reasonable
         expenses  associated  with  Lifton's  current  New York City  residence
         accruing  after  the  effective  date of this  Agreement.  If and  when
         Ventura acquires control of Modern Talking Pictures,  Ventura agrees to
         reimburse  Lifton  for  100%  of all  reasonable  (in the  judgment  of
         Ventura)  expenses  associated  with  Lifton's  current  New York  City
         residence.

            (d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding,  in
         the  event  that  Ventura's  regularly  retained  firm  of  independent
         certified public  accountant  ("CPA's") shall determine (as hereinafter
         described)  that any payment or  distribution  by Ventura to or for the
         benefit of Lifton except that relating to options

                                       4
<PAGE>


         granted under Section 4(b) of this  Agreement  (whether paid of payable
         or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
         or  otherwise)  (a  "Payment")  would be  nondeductible  by Ventura for
         Federal  income tax  purposes  because of Section  280G of the Internal
         Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code"),  then the  aggregate
         present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit
         of Lifton  pursuant to this Agreement  (such payments or  distributions
         pursuant to this  Agreement are  hereinafter  referred to as "Agreement
         Payments") shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount.
         For purposes of this paragraph, the "Reduced Amount" shall be an amount
         expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate  present value
         of Agreement  Payments  without causing any Payment to be nondeductible
         by Ventura  because of said Section  280G of the Code.  With respect to
         any "excess Parachute Payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)
         of the Code,  subject to the tax (the "Excise  Tax") imposed by Section
         4999 of the Code,  Ventura  shall pay to  Lifton an  additional  amount
         equal to the Excise Tax payable by Lifton.

            Lifton  shall  elect  which and how much of the  Agreement  Payments
         shall be  eliminated  or reduced  (as long as after such  election  the
         aggregate  present value of the Agreement  Payments  equals the Reduced
         Amount) and shall notify Lifton promptly of such election. For purposes
         of this paragraph, present value shall be determined in accordance with
         Section  280G(d)(4) of the Code. All  determinations  made by the CPA's
         under this  paragraph  shall be  binding  upon the  Ventura  and Lifton
         (absent  fraud,   willful   misconduct  or   demonstrable   mistake  in
         calculation, but not in judgment) and shall be made within 60 days of a
         termination  of  employment  of  Lifton.  As  promptly  as  practicable
         following such determination and the elections hereunder, Ventura shall
         pay to or  distribute  to or for the benefit of Lifton such  amounts as
         are then due to Lifton under this  Agreement and shall  promptly pay to
         or  distribute  for the benefit of Lifton in the future such amounts as
         become due to Lifton under this Agreement.

            As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of
         the  Code  at  the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  CPA's
         hereunder,  it is  possible  that  Agreement  Payments  may be  made by
         Ventura  which  should  not  have  been  made  ("Overpayment")  or that
         additional  Agreement Payments which will have not been made by Ventura
         could have been made  ("Underpayment"),  in each case,  consistent with
         the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.  In the event that the
         CPA's based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal  Revenue
         Service  against  Ventura or Lifton which the CPA's  believe has a high
         probability of success,  determine  that an Overpayment  has been made,
         any such  Overpayment  shall be treated  for all  purposes as a loan to
         Lifton which Lifton shall repay to Ventura  together  with  interest at
         the applicable  Federal rate provided for in Section  7872(f)(2) of the
         Code; provided,  however,  that no amount shall be payable by Lifton to
         Ventura if and to the extent such  payment  would not reduce the amount
         which is subject to taxation  under  Section  4999 of the Code.  In the
         event that the CPA's, based upon controlling precedent,  determine that
         an Underpayment has occurred,  any such Underpayment  shall be promptly
         paid by Ventura to or for the benefit of Lifton  together with interest
         at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of
         the Code.

         5. Death, Disability, Termination of Relationship,  Acceleration Event.
Upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (a) Lifton's death or disability;

                                       5
<PAGE>

            (b) Lifton's ceasing to be a consultant for Ventura;

            (c) An Acceleration Event of Ventura coupled with the termination of
         this consulting arrangement.

         Lifton  shall be  entitled  to  continue  to receive  the  options  and
benefits  specified  in Section 4 at the level at the date of the first to occur
of the events  specified  in this  Section 5 for a period of 12 months after the
occurrence of such events.

         In the  event of  Lifton's  death  during  the term of this  Agreement,
Ventura shall continue to pay and provide to Lifton's spouse all health care and
insurance  benefits  provided  to  Lifton  for a period  of one  year  following
Lifton's death.

         Ventura  shall be entitled to purchase  life and  disability  insurance
policies  to fund the  obligations  set  forth  above.  Lifton  agrees  to fully
cooperate with Ventura in securing and maintaining such policies.

         6.  Taxes.   Lifton  agrees  to  furnish   Ventura  with  his  employer
Identification  Number of Social  Security  Number for  purposes  of filing Form
1099. Lifton agrees that he is responsible for, payment of any  self-employment,
income or other taxes arising from this Agreement.

         7.  Expenses.  Lifton  shall be  reimbursed  by  Ventura  for  Lifton's
reasonable  traveling,  entertainment and other incidental  expenses incurred on
business of Ventura  upon the  submission  by Lifton of such  vouchers and other
proof and when approved in accordance  with the practice now existing at Ventura
or in accordance with such practice as it may hereafter be changed and uniformly
applied  to  senior  officers  of  Ventura.  8.  Non-Disclosure  of  Third-Party
Information.  Lifton shall not disclose to Ventura nor use in the performance of
Lifton's  services  for Ventura  any  information  that  Lifton  knows to be the
confidential property of a third party.

         9.  Confidentiality.  During and after the term of  Lifton's  services,
Lifton  agrees to keep and  maintain  all details of the  business or affairs of
Ventura, including but not limited to all trade secrets,  confidential and shall
make no use of such except in the performance of Lifton's service for Ventura.

         10. Term and  Termination.  This  Agreement  shall commence on the date
hereof and shall continue until December 31, 1995.  Thereafter,  the term of the
Agreement shall be automatically extended for successive one year periods unless
a 90 day written  notice is given by Ventura or Lifton at least 90 days prior to
the  expiration of the term of this  agreement of his or its intention to cancel
the Agreement at the end of its initial or extended  terms  Notwithstanding  any
thing herein to the contrary,  Lifton may terminate  this  Agreement at any time
for any reason  whatsoever  without  further  obligation to Ventura,  except for
those obligations stated herein to survive  termination of this Agreement,  upon
90 days written notice of his intention to do so to Ventura.

         11.  Delivery of  Documents  After  Termination.  Upon  termination  of
Lifton's services by either party for any reason, Lifton hereby agrees to return
to Ventura any and all books,  records,  reports,  notes,  and  materials of any
nature or kind  whatsoever  furnished to Lifton,  or developed by Lifton,  which
relate directly or indirectly to the business of Ventura.

                                      6

         12. Independent  Contractor  Relationship.  Any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,  this Agreement does not constitute a
hiring by either  party nor does it  constitute  a contract of  employment.  The
parties'  intention  is that  Lifton  be an  independent  contractor  and not an
employee of Ventura,  and that Lifton  retain sole and absolute  discretion  and
judgment in the manner and means of carrying out his consulting activities. This
Agreement shall not be construed as a partnership and neither party hereto shall
be liable for any  obligations  incurred by the other party  except as expressly
provided herein.  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, Ventura shall not
withhold from Lifton's  compensation  any amounts for social security or federal
or state income taxes. Lifton recognizes that it is his legal  responsibility to
pay all applicable  federal and state income taxes (including  estimated taxes),
social security and all applicable federal and state self-employment taxes.

         13. Best Efforts.  Lifton agrees that he shall devote his best efforts,
energies  and  skills  to the  discharge  of  his  duties  and  responsibilities
hereunder.

         14.  Remedies.  The parties hereto shall have all remedies at law or in
equity to enforce the terms and  obligations  arising  hereunder,  including the
right to  injunctive  relief.  In the event of any legal  action to interpret or
enforce this Agreement,  the prevailing party, as determined by the court, shall
be entitled to recover  judgment form the  unsuccessful  party for its costs and
reasonable attorney fees, as determined by the court.

         15. Notices.  All notices,  requests,  demands and other communications
hereunder shall be delivered personally or sent by certified or registered mail,
postage paid, addressed to Ventura at:

         16. Binding Effect.  The terms,  covenants and provisions  hereof shall
extend  to and be  binding  upon  the  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  personal
representative, assigns and successors in interest.

         17.  Non-Waiver.  Waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

         18. Entire Agreement.  This instrument contains the entire agreement of
the parties.  It may be changed  only by an  agreement in writing  signed by the
party  against  which  the  enforcement  of any  waiver,  change,  modification,
extension or discharge is sought.

         19. Paragraph Headings. The paragraph headings of the Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or define the text thereof.

         20.  Severability.  In the event that any one or more of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity,  legality and 

                                       7

<PAGE>

enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way
be affected thereby.

         21.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California. The invalidity of any provision hereof shall not invalidate
any other provision hereof.  

         22. Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the breach  thereof,  including in particular any  controversy
relating to Section 4, shall be settled by  arbitration  in Los Angeles  County,
California  in  accordance  with the laws of the  State of  California  by three
arbitrators,  one of whom shall be appointed  by Ventura,  one by Lifton and the
third of whom shall be appointed by the first two  arbitrators.  The arbitration
shall be conducted in accordance  with the Commercial  Arbitration  Rules of the
American Arbitration  Association except as hereinabove provided.  Judgment upon
the award  rendered  by the  arbitrators  may be  entered  in any  court  having
jurisdiction  thereof.  In the event Lifton shall  retain legal  counsel  and/or
incur other costs and expenses in connection with enforcement of any of Lifton's
rights  under this  Agreement,  Lifton  shall not be  entitled  to recover  from
Ventura any attorneys fees, costs or expenses in connection with the enforcement
of such rights (including  enforcement of any arbitration award in court) unless
the arbitration award shall exceed by more than 10% of Ventura's final offer.

         Any notice  preliminary to or in  conjunction  with or incident to such
arbitration  proceeding  may be sent to Lifton or to the Board of the Company by
registered or certified  mail,  and personal  service is hereby  waived.  Lifton
shall not  institute  a civil  action  with  regard to any claim or  controversy

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement")
is made and entered into effective the 4th day of November, 1994, by and between
SOUNDVIEW MEDIA INVESTMENTS,  INC., a Florida corporation  ("Company"),  VENTURA
ENTERTAINMENT  GROUP, LTD., a Delaware  corporation ("VEG") and BENNETT S. SMITH
("Employee") for the following uses and purposes:

                                R E C I T A L S

         This employment agreement is executed simultaneously with the execution
of a Stock  Exchange  Agreement to which VEG, the  Company,  Employee,  Brian W.
Brady, Richard S. Incandela, Trustee for the Trust of Richard S.
Incandela, dated 9/15/91, and Lance Judd are parties.

         This Agreement is not,  however,  considered part of the  consideration
for the stock  exchange,  but rather,  is executed to protect and  safeguard the
goodwill of Soundview Media Investments, Inc.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration  of the mutual  covenants  contained
herein,  and  of  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,   the  receipt  and
sufficiency  of which are hereby  mutually  acknowledged,  and  intending  to be
legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

         1.  Employment  and Duties.  The  Company  hereby  employs  Employee as
President and Chief Executive Officer of SOUNDVIEW MEDIA INVESTMENTS,  INC., and
Employee hereby accepts such  employment.  Employee shall be responsible for the
general  management  of the affairs of the Company and shall report  directly to
the Company's  Board of Directors.  Employee agrees to devote his entire working
time and energy to the performance of his duties under this agreement.  Employee
agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, engage in the management of any
business, profession, or occupation that would interfere with the fulfillment of
his  responsibilities  to the Company.  It is specifically agreed and understood
that Employee shall be based in Gulf Breeze, Florida throughout the term of this
Agreement and any renewal and/or extension thereof.

         2. Term. The term of this employment  contract shall be for a period of
five (5) years ending October 31, 1999.

         3. Base Salary. As compensation for the satisfactory performance of the
services by Employee,  Company shall pay Employee $200,000 per annum, payable in
equal semi-monthly installments.  For so long as Employee is President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company,  such salary shall be reviewed by the Board of

                                      1

<PAGE>
Directors of the Company,  solely for the purpose of increasing said salary,  no
less frequently than annually.

         4. Incentive Compensation.  In addition to the base salary set forth in
Section 3 above,  Employee shall receive incentive  compensation,  if any, to be
determined by the Company's Board of Directors  annually  throughout the term of
this  Agreement and any renewal  and/or  extension  thereof.  It is  understood,
however,  that the Board of Directors may annually  determine  that no incentive
compensation shall be paid to Employee, in the event Employee's performance does
not  warrant  such  incentive  compensation  pursuant to the terms of a mutually
agreed upon  incentive  plan to be approved  annually by the Company's  Board of
Directors.

         5. Company Benefit Plans.  Employee shall be entitled to participate in
any 401k,  pension,  profit-sharing,  savings and other  retirement  plans,  and
medical, dental, hospitalization,  life and disability insurance plans currently
offered,  or which may be  instituted  by the  Company or VEG during the term of
this Agreement  ("Company  Plans") not otherwise  provided under this Agreement.
With respect to Employee's  participation in the aforementioned medical, dental,
hospitalization,  life and disability  insurance plans, the cost and all related
expenses thereto shall be borne by the Company or VEG.

         6. Leave/Vacation.  The Employee shall be entitled to four (4) weeks of
leave/vacation  each year without an adjustment in earnings.  All leave/vacation
shall be taken at a time that will not  unnecessarily  interrupt  or reduce  the
business  of the  Company.  Leave must be taken  during each year and may not be
accumulated.

         7. Reimbursement of Expenses.  The Company shall reimburse the Employee
for any expenses  reasonably  incurred  furthering  the business of the Company,
including  attendance at conventions  and meetings and travel and  entertainment
expenses.  The employee shall be paid a reasonable car allowance,  not to exceed
five hundred dollars ($500) per month.

         8.  Termination  for Cause.  Company  shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement  immediately for cause (as hereinafter  defined) and the Employee
shall not be entitled to receive any further  salary or employee  benefits under
this agreement, but shall be entitled to receive accrued but unpaid salary under
Paragraph  three (3) and accrued but unpaid  bonuses and  benefits  described in
Paragraphs four (4) and five (5).

         Any accrued but unpaid salary,  incentive  compensation or benefits due
the Employee after  termination of employment under this paragraph shall be paid
within thirty (30) days after the effective date of  termination.  The effective
date of termination  for all purposes of this Agreement shall be the date of the
written notice.

                                      2

<PAGE>

         "Cause" shall be defined as: (i) gross neglect or willful misconduct in
carrying  out  Employee's  duties under this  Agreement;  (ii)  conviction  of a
felony; (iii) breach of Employee's fiduciary duties to Company;  (iv) failure of
Employee to comply with any reasonable  request of the Board of Directors of the
Company after thirty (30) days written  notice and an opportunity to cure within
said 30-day  period;  or (v) the  inability of the Company to meet its financial
obligations of corporate overhead and debt service;  after notice and reasonable
opportunity to cure such financial obligations.

         A "breach of Employee's fiduciary duties to the Company" shall not have
occurred  without first obtaining an  adjudication  from a trial court that such
breach occurred and said adjudication is upheld on appeal.

         9. Termination Without Cause. Company shall have the right to terminate
this  Agreement at any time without cause upon thirty (30) days' written  notice
to Employee,  subject  however,  to the  following:  Employee  shall be paid any
incentive  compensation  due Employee at the date of termination,  within thirty
(30) days of such  termination,  and  Employee  shall  continue to receive  base
salary and benefits to which  Employee is entitled  under this Agreement for the
balance of the term of this Agreement.

         10. Termination by Employee. Employee may terminate this contract after
providing  the  Company  ninety  (90)  days'  written  notice.  In the  event of
termination  by the  Employee,  the Company  shall pay the  Employee  his salary
through  the  effective  date of such  termination  and he  shall  receive  such
incentive  compensation as described in Paragraph four (4).  Employee shall also
be entitled to receive any and all accrued  benefits  due under  Paragraph  five
(5).

         11.  Covenant  Not to Compete.  In the event  Employee  terminates  his
employment  with the  Company  pursuant  to the  terms of  Paragraph  10  above,
Employee  agrees that he will not become  affiliated in any capacity  (including
owner, officer,  director,  consultant or employee) for a period of one (1) year
from date of such termination with any television station within the "Prohibited
Territory." The "Prohibited  Territory" shall mean any television  markets as of
the date of such  termination  (a) in  which  the  Company  owns or  controls  a
television  station  and (b) in which the  Company  has  executed a binding  and
definitive agreement for the acquisition of a television station.

         12.  Reasonableness of Restrictions.  Employee acknowledges that he has
carefully read and considered the provisions of Paragraph 11 hereof, and, having
done so, agrees that the  restrictions set forth in such Paragraph 11 (including
but not limited to, the time period of restriction and the geographical areas of
restriction set forth in Paragraph 11 hereof) are fair and

                                      3

<PAGE>

reasonable  and are  reasonably  required for the protection of the interests of
the corporation, its officers, directors and employees.

         13. Death of the Employee.  This Agreement shall terminate in the event
of Employee's death.

         In the event Employee dies while still in the active  employment of the
Company,  the Company shall pay to the Employee's  beneficiary or beneficiaries,
within  thirty  (30) days after the date of death of the  Employee,  any and all
accrued  base  salary  and a pro  rata  portion  of the  incentive  compensation
determined  under Paragraph four (4),  calculated to the date of death.  Nothing
herein  shall be in lieu of, but shall be in addition  to, all pension or profit
sharing plan and insurance benefits accruing under any such programs  instituted
by the Company in which the Employee is a participant  as described in Paragraph
five (5).

         The Employee may  designate  one or more  beneficiaries  to receive the
payment of sums  hereunder  upon or following  his death by a writing filed with
the Company,  and may change any beneficiary or beneficiaries  from time to time
by  subsequent  writing  filed with the  Company.  If for any reason there is no
valid  designation  of a  beneficiary  in effect at the time of the death of the
Employee,  the Company  shall make any payment due  hereunder to the  Employee's
widow,  if she shall be living at the time such  payment  falls due;  and if she
shall  not be  then  living,  to or for the  benefit  of the  Employee's  lineal
descendants  living at the time such payment  falls due, per stirpes;  and if no
widow or lineal  descendants  be living at the time such payment falls due, then
such payment shall be made to the personal  representative  of the estate of the
Employee.

         14.  Disability of Employee.  Upon total disability of the Employee (as
defined herein), this Agreement shall terminate and the Company shall pay to the
Employee  or his  designated  beneficiary  any  accrued  but  unpaid  salary and
incentive compensation due under Paragraphs three (3) and four (4) and the value
of all  benefits  described  in  Paragraph  five  (5)  through  the date of such
termination, provided, however, it is specifically agreed that any such proceeds
from any benefits  described in Paragraph five (5) survive the termination date.
Such payment will be made to the Employee or his designated  beneficiary  within
thirty (30) days after the total disability of the Employee.

         "Total  disability"  of the  Employee  shall  be  defined  as  (i)  the
inability by Employee,  for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive
days or 180 days  during any 210 day period,  because of his  physical or mental
incapacity,  to substantially  perform his duties hereunder and if at the end of
that period, a physician,  selected by the Company and approved by the Employee,
certifies   that  it  appears  likely  that  the  Employee  will  be  unable  to
substantially  perform his duties for an  indefinite  additional  period of time
because of such physical or mental incapacity or

                                      4

<PAGE>

(ii) a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  shall  appoint  a   guardian  for the
Employee.

         15. VEG's Guaranty. VEG hereby agrees to unconditionally  guarantee any
and all obligations of the Company under this employment agreement.

         16. Notices.  All notices,  requests,  demands and other communications
required  or desired  to be given  hereunder  shall be in  writing  and shall be

                            STOCK EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
 
     THIS  STOCK  EXCHANGE  AGREEMENT is  entered  into  as of  the  9th  day of
November, 1994  by  and  among  VENTURA ENTERTAINMENT  GROUP  LTD.,  a  Delaware
corporation  ('VEG'), SOUNDVIEW  MEDIA INVESTMENTS, INC.,  a Florida corporation
('Soundview'), and the following persons (collectively known as the 'Founders'):
Richard S. Incandela  and Sharon Sue  Incandela, Co-trustees of  the RICHARD  S.
INCANDELA  TRUST dated 9/15/91  ('Trust'), BENNETT S.  SMITH ('Smith'), BRIAN W.
BRADY ('Brady'), and LANCE JUDD ('Judd') with respect to the following facts:
 
                                R E C I T A L S
 
     A. VEG desires to acquire from  Founders 80% of the issued and  outstanding
shares  of  common  stock  of  Soundview  in  exchange  for  ONE  MILLION SHARES
(1,000,000) of  common stock  of VEG,  which represents  13% of  the issued  and
outstanding shares of common stock of VEG.
 
     B. As a result of this exchange, the Founders shall continue to own, in the
aggregate,  20% of  Soundview while  also owning, in  the aggregate,  13% of the
common stock of VEG.
 
     C.  The  Board  of  Directors  of  Soundview  and  VEG  have  approved  the
acquisition  of  the  stock  of  VEG in  exchange  for  the  stock  of Soundview
('Acquisition').
 
     D. For federal  income tax purposes,  it is intended  that the  Acquisition
shall  qualify as a reorganization within the definition of Section 368(a)(1)(B)
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
 
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained  herein,
and  other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby mutually acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties
agree as follows:
 
     1. DEFINITIONS. As used in this  Agreement, the following terms shall  have
the following meanings:
 
        1.1  'FCC.'  The  term  'FCC'  shall  mean  the  Federal  Communications
Commission.
 
        1.2 'FCC's Initial Grant.' The first grant of the FCC consenting to  the
transfer of control of Soundview to VEG.
 
        1.3 'Closing Date.' The date on which this Agreement is executed and all
deliveries required under this Agreement are made.
 
<PAGE>
        1.4 'Final Closing Date.' The date upon which the FCC's Initial Grant is
received.
 
     2. STOCK EXCHANGED.
 
        2.1 Stock Exchanged.  Upon the  terms and conditions  set forth  herein,
Founders  agree to  exchange 80%  of their shares  of Common  Stock of Soundview
('Soundview Common Stock')  as of  the Closing  Date in  exchange for  1,000,000
shares  of Common Stock of VEG ('VEG Common Stock'). Founders and VEG shall each
transfer such shares of Common Stock of the other, free and clear of all  liens,
encumbrances,  claims and restrictions except restrictions imposed hereunder and
under federal and state securities laws.
 
        2.2 Piggyback Registration Rights With Respect to VEG Common Stock.  VEG
agrees to register the VEG Common Stock on the next registration statement filed
by  VEG under the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended on which such Common Stock
can be  registered.  No  later  than  30  days  prior  to  the  filing  of  such
registration  statement, VEG shall  provide the holders of  the VEG Common Stock
notice  of  VEG's  intention  to  file  such  registration  statement.  If  such
registration  statement is filed  as part of an  underwritten public offering of
securities of VEG and the underwriter  refuses to allow the registration of  the
VEG  Common Stock, VEG may postpone the  registration of such Common Stock until
it files its next registration statement that satisfies the conditions set forth
above. VEG shall  bear the  costs of registering  such Common  Stock except  any
discounts,  commissions  or fees  of  underwriters, selling  brokers  or similar
security industry professionals. Such discounts,  commissions and fees shall  be
borne by the sellers of the VEG Common Stock.
 
        2.3  Issuance of Additional Shares. The agreement that Founders will own
20% of the capital stock of Soundview is based on the assumption that Soundview,
or one of  its subsidiaries,  will have filed  an application  with the  Federal
Communications  Commission  for  the acquisition  of  four  television stations,
wherever situated,  on  or  before  the second  anniversary  from  the  date  of
termination  of the  Escrow Agreement  described in  Section 14  and acquired at
least four such stations within thirty six (36) months after the termination  of
the Escrow Agreement. A television station shall be deemed to have been acquired
during  such periods even  though such station is  subsequently sold during such
period; provided the  proceeds from  such sale  are deposited  into the  general
funds  of  Soundview,  or  one  of its  affiliates.  These  acquisitions  can be
structured as an asset purchase, stock purchase, or stock exchange. In the event
Soundview does not  acquire at least  four such television  stations within  the
time period described above, each Founder shall transfer the following number of
shares  of Soundview Common Stock to VEG for each station less than four that is
acquired:

     The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that WTWC-TV, WTGS-TV, and WHOA-TV

        2.4 Preferred Stock. The preferred shares of Soundview that are owned by
the  Trust and Smith shall remain outstanding after the Closing Date. VEG agrees
to cause Soundview to redeem  the Preferred Stock owned  by the Trust and  Smith

        2.5 Investment  Intent  of the  Founders.  Each Founder  represents  and
warrants the following:
 
           2.5.1  I have such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters as to be able to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in VEG.
 
           2.5.2 I am able now  to bear the economic  risks of an investment  in
VEG.
 
           2.5.3  I have  had the  opportunity to  ask questions  of and receive
answers from representatives of VEG concerning  the terms and conditions of  the
VEG  Common Stock and  to obtain any additional  information necessary to verify
the accuracy of the  information furnished to me  concerning VEG. In  evaluating
the  suitability of this investment, I  have not relied upon any representations
or other information whether  oral or written) other  than as contained in  this
Agreement.
 
           2.5.4  I am  acquiring the  VEG Common Stock  for my  own account for
investment purposes only and not as a nominee or agent for any other person  and
not  with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of any
part of the VEG Common Stock.
 
           2.5.5 I have been informed that the offer of the VEG Common Stock  is
being  made pursuant to the exemption  from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933 ('Act') afforded by Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D
promulgated thereunder, relating to transactions by an issuer not involving  any
public  offering, and that,  consequently, the materials  relating to said offer
have not been subject to the
                                      -3-

<PAGE>
review and comment of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
 
           2.5.6 I  understand  that  I  must bear  the  economic  risks  of  my
investment  for an indefinite period  because the VEG Common  Stock has not been
registered under the Act or any applicable state securities laws and, therefore,
the VEG Common Stock may not be  sold or otherwise transferred by me unless  the
VEG  Common Stock is registered or qualified  under the Act and applicable state
securities laws  or an  exemption  from such  registration or  qualification  is
available.
 
      2.6  Investment Intent of VEG. VEG represents and warrants the following:
 
           2.6.1 VEG has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters as to  be able  to evaluate  the merits and  risks of  an investment  in
Soundview.
 
           2.6.2  VEG is able  to bear the  economic risks of  its investment in
Soundview.
 
           2.6.3 VEG has  had the opportunity  to ask questions  of and  receive
answers from representatives of Soundview concerning the terms and conditions of
the Soundview Common Stock and to obtain any additional information necessary to
verify the accuracy of the information furnished to VEG concerning Soundview. In
evaluating  the  suitability of  this investment,  VEG has  not relied  upon any
representations or other  information (whether  oral or written)  other than  as
contained in this Agreement.
 
           2.6.4 VEG is acquiring the Soundview Common Stock for its own account
for  investment purposes only and not as a nominee or agent for any other person
and not with the view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution  of
any part of the Soundview Common Stock.
 
           2.6.5  VEG has been  informed that the offer  of the Soundview Common
Stock is being made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements
of the  Act  afforded by  Section  4(2)  thereof and  Regulation  D  promulgated
thereunder,  relating  to transactions  by an  issuer  not involving  any public
offering, and that, consequently, the materials relating to said offer have  not
been  subject  to the  review and  comment of  the staff  of the  Securities and
Exchange Commission or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
 
           2.6.6 VEG understands  that it must  bear the economic  risks of  its
investment  for an indefinite period because  the Soundview Common Stock has not
been registered  under the  Act or  any applicable  state securities  laws  and,
therefore,  the Common  Stock may  not be sold  or otherwise  transferred by VEG
unless   the    Soundview   Common    Stock   is    registered   or    qualified
                                       -4-

        2.7 Founders' Percentage  Interest in  VEG. VEG  represents to  Founders
that  the  VEG  stock  issued  to Founders  represents  13%  of  the  issued and
outstanding common stock  of VEG, including  the issuance of  the shares to  the
Founders.  VEG also agrees that if VEG  issues additional shares of common stock
for cash, Founders shall have the option to acquire shares from that  additional
offering  in an amount sufficient to provide a percentage ownership in VEG equal
to that  percentage  owned  at  Final  Closing,  subject  to  dilution  of  such
percentage  by:  (a)  existing  conversion rights  with  respect  to outstanding
preferred stock of VEG and the  exercise of outstanding options and warrants  of
VEG;  and  (b)  shares issued by VEG  subsequent to the  date  hereof to acquire
stock or assets  of other companies.  Within a Reasonable  time prior to  making
such  offer of additional shares, VEG will give Founders notice of its intent to
issue additional shares, and Founders shall  have five (5) days within which  to
commit  to purchase additional shares to  maintain their percentage interest. If
Founders do not exercise their option right at the time of the first offering of
VEG after the Final Closing Date,  they shall nevertheless continue to have  the
right  to acquire shares sufficient to maintain their percentage interest in any
such subsequent offering, but the percentage interest which they are entitled to
maintain shall be their  percentage interest diluted as  described above and  by
any prior stock offerings in which Founders did not participate.
 
     3.  EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENTS. The  following  people ('Executives')  shall be

Judd, or another  legal entity  in which a  Stockholder owns  a majority  equity
interest.  In addition, any Stockholder may  sell Soundview Shares to the public
in accordance with federal and all applicable state blue sky laws.
 
        12.3 Prohibition on Sale by Founders. The Founders shall not sell any of
their shares of  Common Stock of  Soundview until four  television stations  are
acquired as provided in Section 2.3 above.
 
        12.4 Right of First Refusal.
 
           12.4.1 Subject to Section 12.3, if any Stockholder ('Offeror') wishes
to Transfer (other than a Permitted Transfer pursuant to Section 12.2 above) any
or  all of its Soundview Shares ('Offered Shares') to a third party, the Offeror
shall first give  written notice  of such  intention to  the other  Stockholders
('Offeree'), setting forth the terms of such Transfer, including but not limited
to,  the consideration to be  received by the Offeror,  the name of the proposed
transferee, and the  proposed closing date,  which date shall  not be less  than
                                       -12-

<PAGE>
thirty (30) days from the date such written notice is sent to the Offeree ('Sale
Notice').  The Offerees shall have the first option to purchase all and only all
of the Offered Shares on the terms set forth in the Sale Notice. If the Offerees
wish to purchase all  the Offered Shares, the  Offerees shall, within seven  (7)
days  of receipt  of the  Sale Notice,  give the  Offeror written  notice of the
Offerees' election to purchase all the Offered Shares on the terms set forth  in
the  Sale Notice, except that the closing shall occur in accordance with Section
12.5 hereof. The  Offerees shall  decide among themselves  as to  the number  of
Offered  Shares  to  be  purchased  by each  Offeree.  In  the  absence  of such
agreement, each Offeree shall  purchase that number of  Offered Shares that  the
number  of Soundview Shares owned  by such Offeree bears  to the total number of
such Shares owned by all Offerees.
 
           12.4.2 If the  Offerees do  not give  the Offeror  written notice  of
their  election to purchase the Offered Shares  within such seven (7) day period
or if the Offerees do not satisfy all  the terms of the purchase of the  Offered
Shares  set forth in the Sale Notice within  fifteen (15) days of receipt of the
Sale Notice, the Offeror shall then be released from Offeror's duty to sell  the
Offered  Shares to the  Offerees and the  Offeror may then  Transfer the Offered
Shares to the proposed transferee on the terms set forth in the Sale Notice.  If
within ninety (90) days after the expiration of the Offerees' option to purchase
the  Offered Shares, the Offeror  fails to complete the  Transfer of the Offered
Shares to the proposed transferee on the terms set forth in the Sale Notice, the
Offeror shall, before any other attempt to Transfer the Offered Shares, give the
Offerees a new Sale Notice in accordance with the requirements stated above  and
the foregoing procedure for Transfer shall again be followed.
 
        12.5  Closing. The  closing of  any purchase  and sale  pursuant to this
Section 12 shall be held (i) within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of Sale
Notice and (ii) at  the offices of  Soundview or such other  place as is  agreed
upon  by  the  selling  and  purchasing parties.  At  the  Closing,  the selling
Stockholder shall assign to the purchasing  party the Offered Shares being  sold
free  and clear of all liens and encumbrances and the purchasing party shall pay
the purchase price for  the Offered Shares by  cashier's or certified check  or,
and  the parties shall execute all documents that may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate the sale and transfer of the Offered Shares.

<PAGE>
OPINION  OF COUNSEL REASONABLY  ACCEPTABLE TO THE  CORPORATION STATING THAT SUCH
SALE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM SUCH REGISTRATION AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
THEREUNDER. ANY SALE,  TRANSFER OR  HYPOTHECATION OF THE  SHARES REPRESENTED  BY
THIS  CERTIFICATE IS  RESTRICTED BY  THE PROVISION  OF SECTION  12 OF  THE STOCK
EXCHANGE AGREEMENT ('AGREEMENT') DATED NOVEMBER 9, 1994, A COPY OF WHICH MAY  BE
INSPECTED  AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE CORPORATION, AND ALL OF THE PROVISIONS
OF WHICH ARE  INCORPORATED HEREIN.  THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES,  AMONG OTHER  THINGS
THAT  IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,  THE OTHER HOLDERS OF  SHARES OF THE CORPORATION
HAVE RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROPOSED TRANSFER OF THE SHARES
REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.'
 
A copy of this Agreement shall be delivered to the Secretary of the  Corporation
and shall be shown by the Secretary to any person making inquiry about it.
 
     13. CLOSING.
 
        13.1 Time and Place. The closing hereunder shall take place on or before
November  8, 1994,  or on  such other  date as  may be  mutually agreed  upon in
writing between the parties.
 
        13.2 Conditions. In the event that  there is a failure of any  condition
set forth in Sections 11 or 12 hereof, the party for whose benefit the condition
exists  may  elect to  proceed with  the  Closing to  the extent  performance is
tendered and  seek indemnification  or  exercise any  other rights  or  remedies
accruing to such party.
 
     14. FCC APPROVAL.
 
        14.1 FCC Consent to Transfer of Control. Notwithstanding anything herein
to  the contrary, the terms and conditions  of this Agreement are subject to and
conditioned upon receipt of the FCC's Initial Grant.
 
        14.2 Application for Consent; Cooperation of the Parties. Soundview  and
VEG  shall within fifteen (15)  days of the execution  of this Agreement file an
application ('Application') seeking FCC  consent to the  transfer of control  of
Soundview   to  VEG.  The  parties  shall   promptly  and  diligently  file  and
expeditiously prosecute all necessary amendments, briefs, pleadings,  documents,
and  supporting data to that Application, and take all such actions and give all
such notices as may be required or requested by the FCC or as may be appropriate
in an effort to expedite the approval  by the FCC of the Application,  provided,
however,  that no party shall be required to (a) comply with a condition imposed
on it as the result of a  circumstance the existence of which does constitute  a
breach by such party of its representations, warranties, or covenants hereunder,
or   (b)   to  comply   with  any   condition  which   would  have   a  material
                                       -14-

<PAGE>
adverse effect upon  it; provided,  however, that a  condition requiring  either
party  to file periodic  reports with the FCC  concerning affirmative action and
equal employment opportunity  shall not  be deemed  to have  a material  adverse
effect  on either party. In the event of  the filing of any protest, petition to
deny, petition for reconsideration, or appeal of the FCC's consent and approval,
or other action seeking review or reconsideration of such consent and  approval,
the  parties mutually agree  that any such  filing or action  will be vigorously
opposed by each of them.
 
        14.3 Control. Prior to the Final Closing Date, VEG shall not directly or
indirectly  control, supervise, or direct, or  attempt to control, supervise, or
direct, the operations of Soundview or to vote the stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement.

        14.4   Escrow  Agreement.  The shares exchanged pursuant to the terms of
this  Agreement shall  be held  in escrow  pursuant to  the terms  of the Escrow
Agreement attached as Exhibit 14, which agreement provides that the shares shall
be distributed from escrow upon receipt of the FCC's Initial Grant.

        14.5  Conduct  Pending  FCC  Approval.  Soundview  covenants and agrees,
except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, from and  after
the execution and  delivery of this  Agreement and  until the Final Closing Date
or the termination of this Agreement, whichever shall first occur, to operate in
the  ordinary  course of its business and shall not take any actions outside the
ordinary course  of  its  business without  the  prior  written consent  of VEG.
Without  limiting  the generality of the foregoing, Soundview shall use its best
efforts (i) to preserve its existing licenses,  permits,  rights  and privileges
pertinent  to its  business;  (ii) to preserve intact its business organizations
and  keep  available  its present  employees,  and  preserve  its  goodwill  and
relationship  with  customers  and others with whom it deals, and to continue to
develop its business.  Soundview shall not, without the prior written consent of
VEG, (i)  sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of or mortgage, pledge or subject to
lien or to any other encumbrance (other than the lien of taxes  not yet payable)
any  of  its  assets,  tangible  or  intangible;  (ii)  acquire  any  assets  or
properties;  (iii)make  any  loans,  advances  or  capital  contributions  to or
investments  in  any person or entity; (iv) increase the compensation payable or
to become  payable  by Soundview  to any of its officers or employees except for
normal  periodic  increases in the  ordinary course of business that are made in
accordance with  established  compensation policies of Soundview; or (v) create,
incur  or assume any indebtedness  for  borrowed money.  This covenant does not,
however, provide  VEG with any additional rights of rescission or termination of
this Agreement or right to terminate the escrow.
 
        14.6 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. PRIOR  TO ENTERING INTO  THIS  TRANSACTION, THE
PARTIES  HAYE  BEEN CONCERNED  WITH THE FACT  THAT  SUBSTANTIAL  DAMAGES WILL BE
SUFFERED BY EACH PARTY IN THE EVENT
 
                                      -15-

<PAGE>
THE OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES SHALL BREACH THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO EXCHANGE THE  STOCK
UNDER  THIS AGREEMENT. IT IS REALIZED BY  THE PARTIES THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICABLE, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO ASCERTAIN WITH ANY DEGREE  OF
CERTAINTY  THE AMOUNT  OF DAMAGES WHICH  WOULD BE SUFFERED  BY THE NON-BREACHING
PARTY IN  THE EVENT  THE OTHER  PARTY  OR PARTIES  BREACH THEIR  OBLIGATIONS  TO
EXCHANGE THE STOCK HEREUNDER. THE PARTIES, HAVING MADE DILIGENT BUT UNSUCCESSFUL
ATTEMPTS  TO ASCERTAIN THE  ACTUAL COMPENSATORY DAMAGES  THE NON-BREACHING PARTY
WOULD SUFFER IN  SUCH EVENT HEREBY  AGREE THAT THE  REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF  SAID
DAMAGES  WOULD BE $150,000 IN THE EVENT VEG BREACHES ITS OBLIGATIONS TO EXCHANGE
THE STOCK HEREUNDER AND SOUNDVIEW SHALL,  BE ENTITLED TO SUCH SUM AS  LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES.
 
       14.7  Effect  of  Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated, it shall
become null and void and of no further force or  effect,  except with respect to
Section 14 and the liquidated damages clause set forth above.
 
     15. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
 
Each  party hereto  shall insure  that all  confidential information  which such
party or  any  of  its respective  officers,  directors,  employees,  attorneys,
agents,  investment bankers,  or accountants  may now  possess or  may hereafter
create or obtain  relating to  the financial condition,  results of  operations,
business,  properties,  assets, liabilities,  or future  prospects of  the other
party, any affiliate of  the other party,  or any customer  or supplier of  such
other  party or any  such affiliate shall  not be published,  disclosed, or made
accessible by any of them to any other  person or entity at any time or used  by
any  of them, in each case without the  prior written consent of the other party
or parties; provided, however, that the restrictions of this sentence shall  not
apply  (a) as  may otherwise  be required  by law,  (b) as  may be  necessary or
appropriate in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, or (c) to  the
extent  such information  shall have  otherwise become  publicly available. Each
party hereto shall, and shall cause all  of such other persons and entities  who
received  confidential data from it to deliver to the other party or parties all
tangible evidence of such confidential information to which the restrictions  of
the foregoing sentence apply at such time as this Agreement is terminated.

                            ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT


         THIS ASSET  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT (the  "Agreement")  is made and entered
into this ___ day of July,  1994, by and between  THOMAS M. DUDDY,  Receiver for
HOLT-ROBINSON TELEVISION, INC. ("HRTV"), a Florida corporation and HOLT-ROBINSON

purposes:

                                   RECITALS:

         The assets of HRTV and HRCC were placed into the custody and control of
Seller by order of the United States  District  Court,  District of Arizona (the

         Seller took  exclusive  control,  possession  and custody of all of the

and is operating the  broadcasting  businesses  of HRTV and HRCC.  Subsequent to
taking  possession  and control of the assets,  and pursuant to the Court Order,

THOMAS M. DUDDY is now the licensee of radio and television  broadcast  stations
WHHY-AM, WHHY-FM, AND WTWC-TV (collectively known as the "Stations");

         Seller  desires to sell to Buyer,  and Buyer  desires to purchase  from

herein,  and  of  other  good  and  valuable  consideration,   the  receipt  and

         4.2.3.  Restrictive  Documents.  The  execution  and  delivery  of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will not
give to others any interests or rights, or conflict or be inconsistent  with, or

constitute a default under the terms of any indenture,  mortgage, deed of trust,

<PAGE>


Schedule  4.2.6,  and no event has  occurred  which with the  passage of time or
giving of notice or both would constitute such a default by Seller,  HRTV and/or
HRCC,  result in the loss of  material  rights or result in the  creation of any
lien, charge or encumbrance  thereunder or pursuant  thereto.  True and complete
copies of all of the  contracts  listed on  Schedules  2.1.2 and 2.1.5 have been
delivered to Buyer.

         4.2.7. Authorizations.

         (a) All licenses, permits, authorizations,  franchises, certificates of

the  Authorizations  and the FCC  Authorizations,  used in the  operation of the
Stations as they are now being  operated are  detailed in Schedules  1.4 and 1.5

(other than pursuant to their express  expiration date) or the imposition of any
restriction or limitation upon the operation of the Stations as now conducted.




         (b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date,  Seller will not, with
actual knowledge,  engage in or permit any activity that would jeopardize any of

Assets,  the FCC  Authorizations,  the  Authorizations,  or the operation of the
Stations,  or that would prevent or impede the consummation of this Agreement by
Seller, nor does Seller know of, any basis for such litigation,  proceeding,  or
investigation,  and the execution and  performance  of this  Agreement by Seller
will not result in the  default by Seller in  respect  of any  judgment,  order,
writ,  injunction,  decree,  rule, or regulation of any court or  administrative
agency  which  could  have a material  adverse  effect on the  operation  of the
Stations or on the Assets.

claims,  encumbrances,  leases, title exceptions and rights of others, except as

examine the title to the Real  Property  and to give notice to Seller in writing
of any defects in or encumbrances upon the Real Property, which are unacceptable
to Buyer (the  aforesaid  defects and  encumbrances  hereinafter  called  "Title
Defects").  In the event Buyer  notifies  Seller of any Title Defects within the
aforesaid  10 day  period,  Seller  shall elect to either:  (A) provide  written
assurances  to Buyer of their  ability to cure such  Title  Defects on or before
Closing with such assurances  being given to Buyer within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt by Seller of notice of the Title  Defects  and Seller  shall then
satisfy and  eliminate the Title  Defects on or before  Closing;  in the event a

<PAGE>

all matters which may give rise to the right to indemnification  hereunder,  and
FC shall have the right to settle; provided,  however, that Soundview shall have

been in if the  representation  or  warranty  had been  true.  These  rights  of
Soundview are cumulative and without prejudice to any other remedies that it may
have against the Shareholders.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         AGREEMENT,  effective  as of the 15th  day of  October,  1994,  between
VENTURA  ENTERTAINMENT  GROUP,  LTD., a Delaware  corporation,  whose address is
11466 San Vicente  Boulevard,  Los Angeles,  California  90049 and any successor
("Employer") and DAVID H. WARD ("Employee"),  whose address is 78 Christmas Tree
Lane, Southport, Connecticut 06490.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS,  Employer  desires  to  employ  Employee,  upon the  terms and
subject to the conditions herein set forth;

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants and agreements  hereinafter  contained,  Employer and Employee  hereby
covenant and agree as follows:

         1. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT.  Employer  hereby employs  Employee and Employee
hereby  accepts   employment   from  Employer  upon  the  terms  and  conditions
hereinafter  set forth.  The term of this Agreement shall begin on the effective
date  hereof  and shall  continue  in force for a period of one (1) year  unless
terminated  in  accordance  with Section 7 hereof.  Thereafter,  the term of the
Agreement shall be automatically extended for successive one year periods unless
prior  written  notice of at least 90 days is given by one party to the other of
his or its  intention  to cancel the  Agreement at the end of its initial or, as
the case may be, extended term.

         2.       COMPENSATION AND FRINGE BENEFITS.

         (a) Employer shall pay Employee and Employee shall accept from Employer
as full  compensation  for all services  rendered by Employee to Employer in any
capacity  whatsoever an annual salary of One Hundred  Seventy-Five  Thousand and
00/100 Dollars  ($175,000.00),  payable in substantially  equal installments not
less frequently than monthly,  plus bonuses, if any. Such bonuses, if any, shall
be determined by the Employer's Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, from
time to time.

         (b) During the term of this Agreement,  Employee  shall,  except to the
extent not available due to Employee's noninsurability (at a reasonable cost) or
to nondiscrimination provisions under applicable law, be entitled



                                      -1-
<PAGE>


to  participate  in any and all  benefits  from time to time  afforded to senior
management  employees  of  Employer,  including,  by way of  example  and not of
limitation,  health,  accident,  hospitalization,  disability and life insurance
programs,  pension  plan  and  other  similar  employee  fringe  benefit  plans;
provided, however, that the benefits afforded to Employee may be reduced at such
time and in such manner as generally  applicable to senior management  employees
of Employer.

         (c) In  addition  to the  foregoing,  and  subject  to  the  terms  and
conditions set forth herein,  Employer grants to Employee a non-qualified option
to purchase up to 100,000  shares of Employer's  common  stock,  $.001 par value
(the  "Shares"),  such option to be exercisable  as follows and  nontransferable
except as provided in subsection (v) below:

                  (i)  Employee  shall  have the  option  to  purchase  from the
         Employer a maximum of 100,000  Shares for a total  purchase price equal
         to the Exercise Price per Share, payable as provided in subsection (iv)
         below.   Options   covering  50,000  Shares  shall  vest   immediately.
         Thereafter, options covering 5,000 Shares shall vest on the 15th day of
         each  month  commencing   December  15,  1994  and  continuing  through
         September  15, 1995.  Employee  may exercise  such options from time to
         time but before  October 15, 1999,  by  delivering  written  notices of
         Employee's exercise of the option to the Employer,  to the attention of
         the Chairman of the Board,  which  notices  shall include the number of
         Shares for which Employee is then exercising his option.

                  (ii) An  Acceleration  Event shall occur if at any time during
         the term of this Agreement the Employer shall (aa)  consolidate with or
         merge into another  corporation  and the  Employer or a  subsidiary  of
         Employer shall not be the surviving  corporation,  (bb) have a majority
         of  its  Shares,  sold  in a  single  transaction  or  in a  series  of
         transactions,  the result of which is to  consolidate  the ownership of
         such stock in a single  person or group of persons  acting in  concert,
         (cc) have a majority of its Shares,  held by Unaffiliated  Shareholders
         sold in a single transaction or a series of transactions, the result of
         which is to consolidate  the ownership of such stock in a single person
         or  group  of  persons   acting  in   concert,   (dd)  convey  all,  or
         substantially  all, of its assets to another  corporation,  entity,  or
         person, the ownership of which is not substantially  similar to that of
         the  Employer  prior to such  conveyance,  or (ee) if Floyd W.  Kephart
         ceases to be the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  If an Acceleration  Event occurs,  all unvested  options shall
         vest.

                  The term  "Unaffiliated  Shareholder,"  as used herein,  shall
         mean a  Shareholder  who is not an  officer,  director  or  employee of
         Employer or any entity the  beneficial  interests  of which are held by
         any director, officer or employee of Employer.

                  (iii)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if (aa) the  Employer
         terminates  the employment of Employee for Cause (as defined in Section
         7 hereof),  or (bb) the Employee  terminates his  employment  hereunder
         (except for a termination  by Employee for any of the reasons  provided
         in Section  2(h)(ii)  hereto),  the options  granted under Section 2(c)
         shall  immediately  become null and void,  except with  respect to that
         portion  of the  options  granted  hereunder  which have  already  been
         properly  exercised.  If  Employee  dies or  suffers a  disability,  as
         defined  in  subsection  (vi)  all  unvested  options  shall  vest.  If
         Employee's  employment  hereunder is terminated by Employer  other than
         for Cause,  then Employee shall continue to be entitled to exercise the
         options as provided in this paragraph 2(c).

                  (iv) During  Employee's  employment  by  Employer,  Employee's
         written notice of exercise of an option shall be accompanied by a check
         for the total  purchase  price If  Employee  is no longer  employed  by
         Employer,  Employee's  written notice of exercise of an option shall be
         accompanied  by  either  a  check  for the  total  purchase  price,  by
         Employee's written instruction to deduct from the Shares then otherwise
         purchased the least number of Shares needed to meet or exceed the total
         purchase price or by a stock certificate representing Shares already in
         Employee's possession, assuming such Shares are valued at the Per Share
         Trading Price  hereinafter  defined.  The Per Share Trading Price means
         the cling bid price on the last business day before the written  notice
         of exercise  is given as reported in the Wall Street  Journal on NASDAQ
         or any public stock exchange wherever Shares are currently listed.

                  (v) The Employee may  transfer any option  granted  under this
         Section 2(c) to  Employee's  spouse or children,  or to a trust for the
         benefit of Employee,  Employee's  spouse  and/or  Employee's  children;
         provided,  however, that such transferee shall be able to exercise such
         option only if an when Employee could have exercised such an option and
         any Shares acquired upon exercise of such  transferred  option shall be
         subject to the same limitations or



                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         restrictions  that would  have  applied  had  Employee  exercised  such
         option.  The payment  provisions of subsection (iv) shall also apply to
         such transfers.

                  Subject   to   the   foregoing,   these   options   shall   be
         non-transfer-able  by the Employee,  either voluntarily or by operation
         of law,  otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution
         and shall be exercisable  during the option  holder's  lifetime only by
         the  option  holder,  regardless  of any  community  property  interest
         therein of the spouse of the option holder, or such spouse's successors
         in interest.  If the spouse of the option  holder shall have acquired a
         community  property interest in such option,  the option holder, or the
         option  holder's  permitted  successors  in interest  may  exercise the
         option on behalf of the  spouse of the option  holder or such  spouse's
         successors in interest.

                  (vi)  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  Employee  shall  be
         considered  "disabled"  if as a result of physical or mental  injury or
         impairment Employee cannot adequately perform the duties required under
         Section 3 of this  Agreement and if the Board of Directors,  based upon
         the  independent  medical advice of a physician  selected by the Board,
         determines  that such  inability to perform can be expected to continue
         for at least one year.

                  (vii) If,  following an  Acceleration  Event,  Employer  shall
         terminate Employee's employment other than for Cause, or Employee shall
         terminate  his  employment  for any of the reasons  provided in Section
         2(h)(ii),  Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any
         payment or benefit  provided  for in this  Agreement  by seeking  other
         employment or otherwise.

         (d)  Employer  shall  have the  right  to  require  Employee  to pay to
Employer,  in addition to the full purchase price of Shares acquired by exercise
of any option, an amount  sufficient to satisfy any federal,  state or local tax
withholding  requirements  prior to the delivery of any Shares hereunder,  or to
retain an  appropriate  number of Shares  valued at the Par Share  Trading Price
necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation.


         (e) In the event of any change in the Shares of the  Employer by reason
of any stock dividend, recapitalization,  reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up,  combination or exchange of Shares, or of any similar change affecting
Shares,  the number of Shares subject to the option provided in Section 2(c) and
their purchase price per Share shall be


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

appropriately  adjusted  consistent with such change in such manner as the Board
of Directors may deem equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights
granted to Employee  under Section 2(c).  Any  adjustment so made shall be final
and binding upon Employee. This provision shall not apply to any dilution caused
by this Agreement.

         In the event  the  Company  sells or  offers to sell  Shares at a price
below the Exercise Price, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted  downward to such
offering or sales price as to all then unexercised options.

         (f) Employee  hereby  represents and warrants that if and when Employee
purchases all or any portion of the Shares, such purchase will be for Employee's
own account and solely for investment and not with a view toward resale or other
distribution.  Employee  acknowledges  and agrees that some of all of the Shares
have not been and will not be registered  under the  Securities  Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"),  or under the securities laws of any state,  and may not be
sold,  assigned,  transferred  or otherwise  disposed of (except,  to the extent
permitted by applicable  securities  laws, to any trust in which Employee is the
grantor and sole  beneficiary  during his lifetime  and/or to any direct  family
members and/or to Employee's  spouse) unless the Shares have been registered and
qualified under the Act and any applicable  state's securities law, or unless an
exemption from such registration or qualification is available.

         Employee  further  acknowledges  that  some  or all of the  Shares  may
constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Shares may not be sold, assigned,
transferred or otherwise  disposed of except and unless all conditions set forth
in Rule 144 are satisfied or unless an exemption from registration under the Act
is otherwise available.

         The certificates representing some or all of the Shares may contain the
following legend:

         "The shares  evidenced  by this  certificate  have not been  registered
         under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("the Act"),  or under the
         laws of any  state,  and  may not be  sold,  assigned,  transferred  or
         otherwise  disposed  of unless  such  shares  have been  registered  or
         qualified under the Act and any applicable  state's  securities law, or
         unless  an  exemption  from  such   registration  or  qualification  is
         available."

<PAGE>

         After  endorsement,  the certificates  representing the Shares shall be
delivered to Employee,  who shall,  subject to the terms of this  Agreement,  be
entitled  to  exercise  all rights of  ownership  of such  Shares.  Certificates
representing  Shares not  bearing a legend  shall be  delivered  to  Employee in
exchange for the  certificates  bearing  legends as and when, from time to time,
the Employer  receives an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legends
may be  removed,  which  opinion  Employer  agrees  to seek in good  faith if so
requested by Employee.

         (g) The Exercise Price per Share for each option shall equal $2.50.

         (h) Employee shall not be deemed to have terminated his employment with
Employer within the meaning of Section 2(c)(iii)(bb) in the following instances:

                  (i)  in  the  case  of  any  leave of absence  approved by the
                       Employer;

                  (ii) in case of resignation by Employee any time following any
         Acceleration  Event (A) there is in  Employee's  reasonable  judgment a
         significant change in the nature or scope of Employee's  authorities or
         duties  from those  obtaining  immediately  prior to such  Acceleration
         Event,  (B) based on a reasonable  determination  by Employee that as a
         result  of  an  Acceleration   Event  and  a  change  of  circumstances
         thereafter  significantly  affecting  his  position  he  is  unable  to
         exercise the  authorities,  powers,  function or duties attached to his
         position, (C) there is a reduction in the base compensation of Employee
         from his Compensation  immediately prior to such Acceleration Event; or
         (D) there is imposed upon Employee a requirement  that Employee perform
         his duties on more than an occasional basis (in the reasonable judgment
         of Employee) at places more than forty (40) miles distant from 345 Park
         Avenue South, New York, New York 10010 without his written consent.

         3. DUTIES. Employee shall serve Employer as its Chief Financial Officer
and shall report to the Chairman and to the Chief Executive Officer of Employer.
Employee shall perform for Employer such duties as may be reasonably assigned to
Employee  from time to time by the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of
Employer and are normally  attendant to the office of Chief  Financial  Officer.
Until  termination of this Agreement,  Employee shall devote  Employee's  entire
time,  energies and  attention  to the business and affairs of Employer,  except




                                      -6-
<PAGE>

during  usual  vacation  periods;  provided,  however,  Employee may devote such
reasonable  time and  attention  to the  management  of  Employee's  assets  and
investments as will not interfere with Employee's  duties  hereunder,  including
Employee's noncompetition obligations pursuant to Section 8 hereof. The Employee
shall be entitled to a private office at the Employer's New York City office and
a secretary and such other  accommodations as shall be suitable to the character
of the Employee's  position with the Employer for the  performance of his duties
hereunder.

         4. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES.  Employee shall be reimbursed by Employer
for Employee's reasonable traveling expenses, entertainment and other incidental
expenses  incurred on business of Employer  upon the  submission  by Employee of
such vouchers and other proof and when approved in accordance  with the practice
now existing at Employer or in accordance with such practice as it may hereafter
be changed and uniformly applied to officers of Employer.

         The  Company  shall  provide  either a top of the line  domestic  model
automobile  for  Employee's  use  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  standard
policies,  or, at Employer's option, a monthly automobile  allowance  sufficient
for Employee to lease a top of the line domestic model automobile, together with
reimbursement of automobile  expenses  provided the expenses do not exceed those
associated with a top of the line domestic model automobile.

         5.  VACATIONS.  Employee  shall be  entitled  to four (4) weeks or such
longer period as may be approved by the Board of Directors  from time to time of
vacation  during each year of this Agreement  during which vacation  periods the
compensation of Employee shall be paid in full.

         6. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.  Employee agrees that,  during the period
of Employee's employment hereunder or at any time thereafter,  Employee will not
divulge to any other  Person any details of the business or affairs of Employer,
including but not limited to information about costs, purchasing, profits, gross
margins, financial statements, markets or any customer or advertising lists; any
information,  knowledge or data of a technical nature, including but not limited
to methods, know-how, processes,  discoveries,  machines, inventions or research
projects;  any information,  knowledge or data relating to future  developments,
including  but not limited to research and  development  of future  marketing or
merchandising;  or any and all other  trade  secrets  of  Employer  which may be
imparted to Employee; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to information
regarding  the industry  which is generally  known to  executives  




                                      -7-
<PAGE>

of Employee's level in the industry or which is  already  in the  public  domain
or which hereafter becomes part of the public domain through no  action of fault
of Employee.

         Upon termination of the employment of Employee hereunder, Employee will
deliver  to  Employer  any  and all  drawings,  blueprints,  manuals,  sketches,
letters,  computer  printouts,  discs,  software,  and related items,  formulae,
memoranda,  documents,  lists, papers, notes, reports and similar materials, and
all  copies,  extracts  and  derivatives  thereof,  relating  in any  way to the
business of Employer and in any way  obtained by Employee,  and will deliver any
and all  other  property  of  Employer  possession  of or under the  control  of
Employee.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  at any time after the termination of
the  employment of Employee,  Employee shall be entitled to access to or to make
copies of any materials delivered to Employer pursuant to the preceding sentence
for the sole purpose of establishing his rights, duties, benefits or obligations
due to or from  Employer,  and Employee  warrants  that he will not utilize such
materials  to  compete  with  Employer  in  violation  of  paragraph  8 of  this
Agreement.

         7.        TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

         (a)  Employer  may  terminate  the  employment  of Employee at any time
whether  for  Cause  (as the term  "Cause"  is  defined  in this  Section  7) or
otherwise upon written notice of termination to Employee. If Employer terminates
the  employment of Employee for Cause,  Employer  shall not be obligated to make
any further payments to Employee,  whether via salary,  bonus,  stock options or
otherwise.

         Termination for Cause shall mean termination because:

                  (i) Employee  shall have  breached  any material  provision of
         this  Agreement  or,  after  receiving  written  notice of breach  from
         Employer,  again breached any other  provision of this Agreement or any
         other material  written rules,  regulations or policies of the Employer
         now existing or hereafter  arising which are  uniformly  applied to all
         employees  of Employer or which  rules,  regulations  and  policies are
         promulgated  for  general  application  to  officers  or  directors  of
         Employer;

                  (ii)  Employee  shall  have  been   repeatedly  or  habitually
         intoxicated  or under the  influence  of drugs while on the premises of
         Employer or while  performing  his duties  hereunder,  after  receiving



                                      -8-
<PAGE>


         written notice thereof from Employer,  and after Employer has provided,
         at its cost, reasonable rehabilitation services for Employee, such that
         Employer  determines  in  good  faith  that  Employee  is  impaired  in
         performing his duties required under this Agreement;

                  (iii)  Employee  shall have been  convicted  of a felony under
         state or federal law; or shall have committed a crime  involving  moral
         turpitude;

                  (iv) Employee shall have  embezzled any property  belonging to
         Employer such that he may be subject to criminal prosecution  therefore
         or Employee shall have intentionally and materially injured Employer or
         the property of Employer.

         (b) If  Employer  terminates  the  employment  of  Employee  during the
initial term of this Agreement other than for Cause, or if Employee  resigns for
a reason  specified  in Section  2(h)(ii),  Employer  shall  continue to pay and
provide  Employee  with the  benefits  provided in Section 2(a) and 2(b) of this
Agreement  as well as a  private  office  and  secretary  for 90 days  following
termination  of  employment.  If Employer  terminates the employment of Employee
after the initial term of this  Agreement  other than for Cause,  or if Employee
resigns for a reason specified in Section  2(h)(ii),  Employer shall continue to
pay and provide Employee the benefits  provided in Section 2(a) and 2(b) of this
Agreement  as well as a private  office  and  secretary  for one year  following
termination  of  employment.  In either  event,  Employee  shall  continue to be
subject  to the  provisions  of  Section  8 of  this  Agreement  so long as such
payments  are made in the manner and amount and at the times,  required  by this
Agreement.  If Employee's  employment is  terminated  by death,  Employer  shall
continue to pay and provide to  Employee's  spouse all health care and insurance
benefits  provided to  Employee  for a period of one year  following  Employee's
death.

         (c) The  employment of Employee and  Employer's  obligations  hereunder
shall terminate automatically upon (i) the death or disability of Employee, (ii)
Employee resigning or otherwise terminating his employment except as provided in
paragraph 2(h)(ii),  (iii) the termination of Employee's  employment by Employer
for  cause,  or (iv) the  expiration  of the term of this  Agreement;  provided,
however,  that the  representations  contained in paragraph 9 and all continuing
obligations and representations of Employee,  including without limitation those
contained in paragraphs 6, 8 and 9 hereof, shall survive the termination of this
Agreement  and shall  continue to be  binding,  and  further  provided  that any
potential  obligation  



                                      -9-
<PAGE>

of the Employer with respect to the options  granted and already exercised shall
be subject to the limitations of Section 2(c)(iii).

         (d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary, notwithstanding, in the
event that the  Employer's  regularly  retained  firm of  independent  certified
public accountants ("CPA's) shall determine (as hereinafter  described) that any
payment or  distribution  by the Employer to or for the benefit of the Employee,
except that relating to options  granted  under Section 2(c) of this  Agreement,
(whether paid or payable or distributed or  distributable  pursuant to the terms
of this  Agreement or  otherwise) (a "Payment")  would be  nondeductible  by the
employer for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),  then the aggregate present value
of  amounts  payable or  distributable  to or for the  benefit  of the  Employee
pursuant to this  Agreement  (such  payments or  distributions  pursuant to this
Agreement are hereinafter referred to as "Agreement  Payments") shall be reduced
(but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. For purposes of this paragraph,  the
"Reduced  Amount" shall be an amount  expressed in present value which maximizes
the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to
be  nondeductible by the Employer because of said Section 280G of the Code. With
respect  to any  "Excess  Parachute  Payments"  within  the  meaning  of Section
280G(b)(2)  of the Code subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section
4999 of the Code,  Employer shall pay to Employee as an additional  amount equal
to the Excise Tax payable by Employee.

         The Employer  shall elect which and how much of the Agreement  Payments
shall be  eliminated  of reduced (as long as after such  election the  aggregate
present value of the  Agreement  Payments  equals the Reduced  Amount) and shall
notify the employee  promptly of such election.  For purposes of this paragraph,
present value shall be determined in accordance  with Section  280G(d)(4) of the
Code. All determinations made by the CPA's under this paragraph shall be binding
upon the Employer and Employee (absent fraud, willful misconduct of demonstrable
mistake in calculation, but not in judgment) and shall be made within 60 days of
a  termination  of  employment  of the  Employee.  As  promptly  as  practicable
following such determination and the elections hereunder, the Employer shall pay
to or  distribute to or for the benefit of the Employee such amounts as are then
due to the Employee under this Agreement and shall promptly pay to or distribute
for the benefit of the Employee in the future such amounts as become due to this
Employee under this Agreement.


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

         As a result of the  uncertainty  in the  application of Section 280G of
the Code at the time of the initial determination by the CPA's hereunder,  it is
possible that  Agreement  Payments may be made by the Employer  which should not
have been made  ("Overpayment") or that additional Agreement Payments which will
have not been made by the  Employer  could have been made  ("Underpayment"),  in
each case,  consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.  In
the event  that the CPA's,  based  upon the  assertion  of a  deficiency  by the
Internal  Revenue  Service  against the Employer or the Employee which the CPA's
believe has a high  probability of success,  determine  that an Overpayment  has
been made, any such  Overpayment  shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to
Employee which the Employee  shall repay to the Employer  together with interest
at the applicable  Federal rate provided for in Section  7872(f)(2) of the Code;
provided,  however,  that no amount  shall be  payable  by the  Employee  to the
Employer if and to the extent such payment  would not reduce the amount which is
subject to taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the CPA's,
based upon controlling  precedent,  determine that an Underpayment has occurred,
any such  Underpayment  shall be  promptly  paid by the  Employer  to or for the
benefit of the Employee  together with interest at the  applicable  Federal rate
provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.

         8.       NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT

         (a) employee agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent
of Employer as provided by paragraph 10 hereof, Compete (as hereinafter defined)
with Employer  while he is an Employee and, if Employee  voluntarily  leaves the
employ of Employer  other than for a reason  specified  in  subsection  2(h)(ii)
above, for a period of one year thereafter.

         (b) For  the  purposes of  this Agreement,  employee shall be deemed to
Compete with Employer if Employee:

                  (i)      Competes directly with Employer;

                  (ii) Is or becomes  financially or beneficially  interested in
         any Person who or which  competes  with the  business of  Employer  and
         which Person  conducts Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars  ($10,000,000.00)
         or more of its  Gross  Sales  in the  Prohibited  Territory;  provided,
         however,  that ownership of not more than one percent (l%) of any class
         of securities traded over-the-counter or through a stock exchange shall
         not violate this paragraph 8(b)(ii; or



                                      -11-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) Acts,  directly or indirectly  as a broker,  consultant,
         agent, salesman, officer, director or employee or in any other capacity
         for or on behalf of any Person who or which competes with Employer.

         (c) For the purposes of this Agreement,  the following words shall have
the following meaning, respectively:

                  (i)  "Person"  means,  when  not  modified  by  qualifying  or
         limiting words, a person, natural or corporate, or other legal entity.

                  (ii)  "Compete"  means the  manufacture,  assembly,  purchase,
         sale, lease or distribution within the Prohibited  Territory of (A) any
         service,  article or product  (individually or as a group) which at any
         time  prior  to  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  Employer  shall  have
         manufactured,  assembled, purchased, sold, leased and/or distributed as
         a material part of Employer's business, or (B) any service,  product or
         article  (individually  or as a group)  which is  similar,  related  or
         equivalent to any service,  product or article which is a material part
         of Employer's  business  described in clause (A) immediately  above, or
         (C) any other service,  product or article (individually or as a group)
         of any kindred or cognate  kind of character  which,  at any time after
         the  date  hereof  through  the  date  Employee's  employment  shall be
         terminated, Employer shall manufacture, assemble, purchase, sell, lease
         and/or distribute as a material part of Employer's business.  Provided,
         however,  the term "compete" shall not pertain to any service,  article
         or product  (individually or as a group) which, during the term of this
         paragraph 8, Employer has discontinued.

                  (iii)    "Prohibited   Territory" means  the United  States of
         America.

         (d)  Employee  hereby  acknowledges  to and agrees with  Employer  that
Employer's  remedy at law for any breach by Employee  of his  several  promises,
covenants and  undertakings  set forth in Sections 6, 8 and 9 is inadequate  and
that,  in  addition  to money  damages for any such  breach,  Employer  shall be
entitled to injunctive relief against any such breach.

         (e)  Employee  acknowledge  that,  without  limitation,  a violation of
Sections 6, 8 or 9 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.



                                      -12-
<PAGE>

         (f)  The   provisions   of  this  Section  shall  not  apply  after  an
Acceleration  Event or if  Employee's  employment  is terminated by the Employer
other than for Cause or if Employee  resigns for a reason  specified  in Section
2(h)(ii).

         (g) Nothing in this Section shall  prohibit  Employee from investing in
or exploring opportunities which do not Compete with Employer.

         9.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         (a) Employee represents and warrants to Employer that he will cooperate

Agreement  shall  be in  writing  and  shall be  deemed  to be duly  given  when
personally  delivered  to an  officer  of  Employer  (other  than  Employee)  or
personally  delivered  to  Employee,  as  appropriate,   or  when  delivered  by
registered or certified mail,  postage  prepaid,  to the address set forth above
for each party  respectively,  or to such other address as the respective  party

agreement or consent in writing signed by both parties hereto.  Such writing may
only be  signed  on behalf of  Employer  by its  Chairman  of the Board of Chief
Executive Officer.

         12.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  The duties and  obligations  of Employee
under this  Agreement  are  personal  unto  Employee  and may not be assigned or

and shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable term or provision had

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
     AGREEMENT,  effective as of the 15th  day of October, 1994, between VENTURA
ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, LTD., a  Delaware corporation, whose  address is 11466  San
Vicente  Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90049 and any successor ('Employer')
and FLOYD W. KEPHART ('Employee'), whose address is ---------------------------.
 
                                  WITNESSETH:
 
     WHEREAS, Employer desires to employ Employee, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions herein set forth;
 
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of  the premises and the mutual  covenants
and  agreements hereinafter contained, Employer and Employee hereby covenant and
agree as follows:
 
1. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
     (a) Employer hereby employs Employee and Employee hereby accepts employment
from Employer upon the terms and  conditions hereinafter set forth. The term  of
this  Agreement shall begin on  the effective date hereof  and shall continue in
force for  an initial  period  ending December  31,  2000 unless  terminated  in
accordance with Section 7 hereof. Thereafter, the term of the Agreement shall be
automatically extended for successive 3 year periods unless prior written notice
of  at least 180 days is given by one party to the other of his or its intention
to cancel the  Agreement at  the end  of its  initial or,  as the  case may  be,
extended term.
 
     (b)  If as of December 31, 1997, Employer  is not at a break-even cash flow
or Employer's Profit  and Loss  Statement is not  positive for  its fiscal  year
ending  December  31, 1997,  the  Board of  Directors  of Employer  and Employee
mutually agree to enter  into good faith negotiations  concerning the terms  and
conditions  of  this Agreement.  Unless the  Employer and  Employee reach  a new
agreement concerning  Employee's employment  by Employer,  this Agreement  shall
remain in full force and effect.
 
2. COMPENSATION AND FRINGE BENEFITS.
 
     (a)  Employer shall pay Employee and Employee shall accept from Employer as
full compensation  for all  services rendered  by Employee  to Employer  in  any
capacity  whatsoever an annual salary of Three Hundred Sixty Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($360,000.00),  payable in  substantially  equal installments  not  less
frequently  than monthly, plus bonuses,  if any. Such bonuses,  if any, shall be
determined by the Employer's  Board of Directors, in  its sole discretion,  from
time to time.
 
     (b) During the term of this Agreement, Employee shall, except to the extent
not  available (at  a reasonable cost)  due to Employee's  noninsurability or to
nondiscrimination
 
<PAGE>
provisions under  applicable law,  be entitled  to participate  in any  and  all
benefits  from time to time afforded to senior management employees of Employer,
including,  by  way  of  example  and  not  of  limitation,  health,   accident,
hospitalization,  disability and life insurance programs, pension plan and other
similar employee  fringe benefit  plans; provided,  however, that  the  benefits
afforded to Employee may be reduced at such time and in such manner as generally
applicable to senior management employees of Employer.
 
(c)  In addition to the  foregoing, and subject to  the terms and conditions set
forth herein, Employer grants to Employee a non-qualified option to purchase  up
to  350,000 shares of  Employer's common stock, $.001  par value (the 'Shares'),
such option to be exercisable as follows and nontransferable except as  provided
in subsection (v) below:
 
          (i)  Employee shall  have the option  to purchase from  the Employer a
     maximum of 350,000 Shares for a total purchase price equal to the  Exercise
     Price  per Share,  payable as  provided in  subsection (iv)  below. Options
     covering all 350,000 shares shall  vest immediately. Employee may  exercise
     such  options from time  to time but  before October 15,  2004 or the fifth
     anniversary of the termination  of Employee's employment, whichever  occurs
     first,  by delivering written notices of  Employee's exercise of the option
     to the  Employer, to  the attention  of the  Chairman of  the  Compensation
     Committee,  which  notices shall  include the  number  of Shares  for which
     Employee is then exercising his option.
 
          (ii) An Acceleration Event shall occur if at any time during the  term
     of  this Agreement the  Employer shall (aa) consolidate  with or merge into
     another corporation and the Employer or a subsidiary of Employer shall  not
     be the surviving corporation, (bb) have a majority of its Shares, sold in a
     single  transaction or in a series of  transactions, the result of which is
     to consolidate the ownership of such stock  in a single person or group  of
     persons  acting in  concert, (cc)  have a majority  of its  Shares, held by
     Unaffiliated Shareholders  sold in  a  single transaction  or a  series  of
     transactions,  the result of which is  to consolidate the ownership of such
     stock in a single person or group of persons acting in concert, (dd) convey
     all, or substantially all, of its assets to another corporation, entity, or
     person,  the ownership of which is not substantially similar to that of the
     Employer prior  to  such conveyance  or  (ee)  have a  Board  of  Directors
     comprised  of persons, a majority of whom are not Directors of the Employer
     on the date hereof.
 
          The term  'Unaffiliated Shareholder,'  as used  herein, shall  mean  a
     Shareholder  who is not an officer, director or employee of Employer or any
     entity the beneficial interests of which are held by any director,  officer
     or employee of Employer.
 
          (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  (aa) the Employer terminates
     the employment of Employee for Cause  (as defined in Section 7 hereof),  or
     (bb)  the  Employee  terminates  his  employment  hereunder  (except  for a
     termination by Employee for any of the reasons provided in Section 2(h)(ii)
     hereof), the options  granted under Section  2(c) shall immediately  become
     null  and void, except with respect to  that portion of the options granted
     hereunder which have already been  properly exercised. If Employee dies  or
     suffers a disability, as defined in subsection (vi) all unvested options
 
                                       2
 
<PAGE>
        shall vest. If Employee's employment hereunder is terminated by Employer
        other  than for  Cause, then Employee  shall continue to  be entitled to
        exercise the options as provided in this paragraph 2(c).
 
          (iv) Employee's  written notice  of  exercise of  an option  shall  be
     accompanied  by a  check for  the total purchase  price. If  Employee is no
     longer employed by Employer,  Employee's written notice  of exercise of  an
     option shall be accompanied by either a check for the total purchase price,
     by  Employee's written instruction to deduct from the Shares then otherwise
     purchased the least  number of Shares  needed to meet  or exceed the  total
     purchase  price or  by a stock  certificate representing  Shares already in
     Employee's possession, assuming  such Shares  are valued at  the Per  Share
     Trading  Price hereinafter defined.  The Per Share  Trading Price means the
     closing bid price  on the last  business day before  the written notice  of
     exercise  is given as reported in the  Wall Street Journal on NASDAQ or any
     public stock exchange wherever Shares are currently listed.
 
          (v) The Employee may  transfer any option  granted under this  Section
     2(c)  to Employee's spouse or children,  or to  a trust for  the benefit of
     Employee, Employee's spouse and/or Employee's children; provided,  however,
     that such transferee shall be able to exercise such option only if and when
     Employee  could have  exercised such  option and  any Shares  acquired upon
     exercise  of  such  transferred  option  shall  be  subject  to  the   same
     limitations  or restrictions that would have applied had Employee exercised
     such option. The payment provisions of subsection (iv) shall also apply  to
     such transfers.
 
          Subject  to the foregoing, these  options shall be non-transferable by
     the Employee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than  by
     will  or  the laws  of descent  and distribution  and shall  be exercisable
     during the option holder's lifetime  only by the option holder,  regardless
     of  any community  property interest  therein of  the spouse  of the option
     holder, or  such spouse's  successors in  interest. If  the spouse  of  the
     option  holder shall  have acquired a  community property  interest in such
     option, the option holder, or  the option holder's permitted successors  in
     interest,  may exercise the  option on behalf  of the spouse  of the option
     holder or such spouse's successors in interest.
 
          (vi) For  purposes of  this Agreement,  Employee shall  be  considered
     'disabled'  if  as a  result  of physical  or  mental injury  or impairment
     Employee cannot adequately perform the  duties required under Section 3  of
     this  Agreement and if  the Board of Directors,  based upon the independent
     medical advice of a physician selected  by the Board, determines that  such
     inability to perform can be expected to continue for at least one year.
 
          (vii)  If, following  an Acceleration Event,  Employer shall terminate
     Employee's employment other than for Cause, or Employee shall terminate his
     employment for any of  the reasons provided  in Section 2(h)(ii),  Employee
     shall  not be  required to  mitigate the amount  of any  payment or benefit
     provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise.
 
                                       3
 
<PAGE>
     (d) Employer shall have the right  to require Employee to pay to  Employer,
in  addition to the  full purchase price  of Shares acquired  by exercise of any
option,  an  amount  sufficient  to  satisfy  any  federal,  state  or local tax
withholding requirements prior to  the delivery  of any Shares hereunder,  or to
retain an appropriate  number of Shares, valued at  the Per Share Trading Price,
necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation.
 
     (e) In the event of any change in  the Shares of the Employer by reason  of
any  stock  dividend, recapitalization,  reorganization,  merger, consolidation,
split-up, combination or exchange of Shares  or of any similar change  affecting
Shares,  the number of Shares subject to the option provided in Section 2(c) and
their purchase price per Share  shall be appropriately adjusted consistent  with
such  change in  such manner  as the  Board of  Directors may  deem equitable to
prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to Employee under  Section
2(c).  Any adjustment  so made  shall be final  and binding  upon Employee. This
provision shall not apply to any dilution caused by this Agreement.
 
     In the event the Company  sells or offers to sell  Shares at a price  below
the  Exercise  Price, the  Exercise  Price shall  be  adjusted downward  to such
offering or sales price as to all then unexercised options.
 
     In no event shall the number  of Employee's options and shares acquired  by
option be less than 5% of all issued and outstanding Shares of Employer. If such
options  and option Shares do  fall below 5%, Employer  agrees to promptly grant
sufficient additional options to bring  Employee's options and option Shares  up
to  5% of  all issued  and outstanding  Shares of  Employer. Such  options shall
immediately vest and shall have an Exercise Price equal to the Per Share Trading
Price on the date of grant of the option Shares.
 
     (f) Employee  hereby represents  and  warrants that  if and  when  Employee
purchases all or any portion of the Shares, such purchase will be for Employee's
own account and solely for investment and not with a view toward resale or other
distribution.  Employee acknowledges and  agrees that some or  all of the Shares
have not been and will  not be registered under the  Securities Act of 1933,  as
amended  (the 'Act'), or under the securities laws  of any state, and may not be
sold, assigned,  transferred or  otherwise disposed  of (except,  to the  extent
permitted  by applicable securities laws, to any  trust in which Employee is the
grantor and sole  beneficiary during his  lifetime and/or to  any direct  family
members  and/or to Employee's spouse) unless the Shares have been registered and
qualified under the Act and any applicable state's securities law, or unless  an
exemption from such registration or qualification is available.
 
     Employee further acknowledges that some or all of the Shares may constitute
'restricted  securities'  within  the meaning  of  Rule 144  promulgated  by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission and the  Shares may not  be sold,  assigned,
transferred  or otherwise disposed of except and unless all conditions set forth
in Rule 144 are satisfied or unless an exemption from registration under the Act
is otherwise available.
 
     The certificates representing  some or all  of the Shares  may contain  the
following legend:
 
                                       4
 
     'The  shares evidenced by  this certificate have  not been registered under
     the Securities Act of 1933,  as amended (the 'Act'),  or under the laws  of
     any  state and may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed
     of unless such shares have been  registered or qualified under the Act  and
     any  applicable state's  securities law, or  unless an  exemption from such
     registration or qualification is available.'
 
     After endorsement,  the  certificates  representing  the  Shares  shall  be
delivered  to Employee, who  shall, subject to  the terms of  this Agreement, be
entitled to  exercise  all rights  of  ownership of  such  Shares.  Certificates
representing  Shares  not bearing a  legend shall  be  delivered to  Employee in
exchange for the certificates bearing legends as and when,  from time to time,
the Employer receives an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legends
may be  removed, which opinion Employer agrees to seek in good faith if so
requested by Employee.
 
     (g) The Exercise Price  per Share for each  option initially granted  under
Subsection 2(c) shall equal $2.50.

     (h)  Employee shall  not be deemed  to have terminated  his employment with
Employer within the meaning of Section 2(c)(iii)(bb) in the following instances:
 
          (i) in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Employer;
 
          (ii) in  case  of  resignation  by Employee  any  time  following  any
     Acceleration  Event or, if (A) there is in Employee's reasonable judgment a
     significant change  in the  nature or  scope of  Employee's authorities  or
     duties  from those obtaining immediately  prior to such Acceleration Event,
     (B) based on a reasonable determination by Employee that as a result of  an
     Acceleration  Event and a change  of circumstances thereafter significantly
     affecting his position he  is unable to  exercise the authorities,  powers,
     function  or duties attached to  his position, (C) there  is a reduction in
     the base compensation of Employee  from his compensation immediately  prior
     to  such  Acceleration  Event; or  (D)  there  is imposed  upon  Employee a
     requirement that Employee move his principal office out of the Los Angeles,
     California area.
 
          If Employee is removed as Chairman  or Chief Executive Officer by  the
     Board  of Directors of Employer or shareholders of Employer, other than for
     Cause, Employee  will have  the right,  exercisable at  any time  and  upon
     10-day's  notice  to  Employer,  to  require  Employer  to  repurchase  all
     outstanding vested  options by  paying to  Employee the  Spread Amount. For
     purposes  of this  Agreement, the Spread  Amount shall  mean the difference
     between the Exercise Price  per Share and the  Per Share Trading  Price  on
     the  date  notice  is  given  by  Employee  multiplied  by  the  number  of
     outstanding vested options.
 
     3. DUTIES.  Employee  shall  serve  Employer  as  its  Chairman  and  Chief
Executive  Officer  and shall  report  to the  Board  of Directors  of Employer.
Employee shall perform for Employer such duties as may be reasonably assigned to
Employee from time to time by the Board of Directors and are normally  attendant
to  the office of Chief Executive  Officer. Until termination of this Agreement,
Employee shall  devote Employee's  entire time,  energies and 
 
                                       5

attention to  the business and affairs of Employer, except during usual vacation
periods;  provided,  however,  Employee  may  devote  such  reasonable  time and
attention to the  management  of  Employee's assets and investments as  will not
interfere  with  Employee's duties hereunder including Employee's noncompetition
obligations  pursuant  to Section 8  hereof. The Employee shall be entitled to a
private  office  and  a  secretary  and  such  other  accommodations as shall be
suitable to the character of the Employee's position  with  the Employer for the
performance of his duties hereunder.
 
     4. REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES. Employee shall be reimbursed by Employer  for
Employee's  reasonable  traveling, entertainment  and other  incidental expenses
incurred on  business  of Employer  upon  the  submission by  Employee  of  such
vouchers  and other proof and  when approved in accordance with the practice now
existing at Employer or in accordance with such practice as it may hereafter  be
changed and uniformly applied to officers of Employer.
 
     Employer  shall provide either a top  of the lime domestic model automobile
for Employee's use in accordance with  the Employer's standard policies, or,  at
Employer's  option, a  monthly automobile  allowance sufficient  for Employee to
lease a top of the line domestic model authomobile, together with  reimbursement
of automobile expenses provided the expenses do not exceed those associated with
a  top of the line  domestic model automobile. If  Employer is providing such an
automobile to Employee at the termination of this Agreement, Employee shall have
the right to purchase said automobile  at the termination of this Agreement  for
$1.00.
 
     Employer  shall reimburse to Employee  Employee's initiation fees, dues and
reasonable expenses  for  private  clubs,  provided  such  expenses  are  deemed
necessary  and appropriate by Employee to properly perform his function as Chief
Executive Officer.
 
     5. VACATIONS. Employee shall be entitled  to four (4) weeks or such  longer
period  as  may be  approved by  the Board  of  Directors from  time to  time of
vacation during each year  of this Agreement during  which vacation periods  the
compensation of Employee shall be paid in full.
 
     6.  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. Employee agrees  that, during  the period of
Employee's employment hereunder  or at  any time thereafter,  Employee will  not
divulge  to any other Person any details of the business or affairs of Employer,
including but not limited to information about costs, purchasing, profits, gross
margins, financial statements, markets or any customer or advertising lists; any
information, knowledge or data of a technical nature, including but not  limited
to  methods, know-how, processes, discoveries,  machines, inventions or research
projects; any information,  knowledge or data  relating to future  developments,
including  but not  limited to research  and development or  future marketing or
merchandising, or  any and  all other  trade secrets  of Employer  which may  be
imparted to Employee; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to information
regarding  the industry  which is  generally known  to executives  of Employee's
level in  the  industry or  which  is already  in  the public  domain  or  which
hereafter  becomes  part of  the public  domain  through no  action or  fault of
Employee.
 
                                       6

<PAGE>
 
     Upon termination of  the employment  of Employee  hereunder, Employee  will
deliver  to  Employer  any  and  all  drawings,  blueprints,  manuals, sketches,
letters, computer  printouts,  discs,  software, and  related  items,  formulae,
memoranda,  documents, lists, papers, notes,  reports and similar materials, and
all copies,  extracts  and derivatives  thereof,  relating  in any  way  to  the
business  of Employer and in any way  obtained by Employee, and will deliver any
and all other property of Employer in the possession of or under the control  of
Employee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  at any time  after the termination of
the employment of Employee, Employee shall be  entitled to access to or to  make
copies of any materials delivered to Employer pursuant to the preceding sentence
for the sole purpose of establishing his rights, duties, benefits or obligations
due  to or from  Employer, and Employee  warrants that he  will not utilize such
materials to  compete  with  Employer  in  violation  of  paragraph  8  of  this
Agreement.
 
     7. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
 
     (a)  Employer may terminate the employment  of employee at any time whether
for Cause (as the term 'Cause' is  defined in this Section 7) or otherwise  upon
written notice of termination to Employee. If Employer terminates the employment
of  Employee for  Cause, Employer  shall not  be obligated  to make  any further
payments to Employee, whether via salary, bonus, stock options or otherwise.
 
     Termination for Cause shall mean termination because:
 
          (i) Employee  shall  have  breached any  material  provision  of  this
     Agreement or, after receiving written notice of breach from Employer, again
     breached  any  other  provision of  this  Agreement or  any  other material
     written rules,  regulations or  policies of  the employer  now existing  or
     hereafter  arising which are uniformly applied to all employees of Employer
     or which  rules,  regulations  and policies  are  promulgated  for  general
     application to officers or directors of Employer;
 
          (ii)  Employee shall have been repeatedly or habitually intoxicated or
     under the influence  of drugs while  on the premises  of Employer or  while
     performing  his duties  hereunder, after  receiving written  notice thereof
     from Employer, and  after Employer  has provided, at  its cost,  reasonable
     rehabilitation services for Employee, such that Employer determines in good
     faith  that Employee  is impaired in  performing his  duties required under
     this Agreement;
 
          (iii) Employee shall have  been convicted of a  felony under state  or
     federal law; or shall have committed a crime involving moral turpitude;
 
          (iv)  Employee shall have embezzled any property belonging to Employer
     such that he may  be subject to criminal  prosecution therefor or  Employee
     shall have intentionally and materially injured Employer or the property of
     Employer.
 
     (b) If Employer terminates the employment of Employee other than for Cause,
or  if Employee  resigns for  a reason  specified in  Section 2(h)(ii), Employer
shall continue to  pay and provide  Employee the benefits  provided in  Sections
2(a)  and 2(b) of this  Agreement as well

 
                                       7
 
as  a  private  office  and  secretary  for  one  year  following termination of
employment, or  for  remaining term of this Agreement, whichever is greater  and
Employee  shall continue to be subject to the provisions  of  Section 8  of this
Agreement so  long as such payments are made in the manner, and amount,  at  the
times, required by this Agreement.  If  Employee's employment  is  terminated by
death,  Employer  shall  continue to pay and provide  to  Employee's  spouse all
health care and insurance benefits provided to Employee for a period of one year
following Employee's death.
 
     (c) The employment of Employee  and Employer's obligations hereunder  shall
terminate  automatically  upon (i)  the death  or  disability of  Employee, (ii)
Employee resigning or otherwise terminating his employment except as provided in
paragraph 2(h)(ii), (iii) the termination  of Employee's employment by  Employer
for   Cause,  or   (iv)  the   expiration  of   the  term   of  this  Agreement;
provided, however, that  the representations  contained in paragraph  9 and  all
continuing  obligations  and  representations  of  Employee,  including  without
limitation those contained in  paragraphs 6, 8 and  9 hereof, shall survive  the
termination  of this  Agreement and  shall continue  to be  binding, and further
provided that  any potential  obligation of  the Employer  with respect  to  the
options  granted and  already exercised shall  be subject to  the limitations of
Section 2(c)(iii).
 
     (d) Anything in  this Agreement  to the contrary,  notwithstanding, in  the
event  that  the Employer's  regularly  retained firm  of  independent certified
public accountants ('CPAs') shall determine (as hereinafter described) that  any
payment  or distribution by the Employer to  or for the benefit of the Employee,
except that relating  to options granted  under Section 2(c)  of this  Agreement
(whether  paid or payable or distributed  or distributable pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement  or otherwise)  (a 'Payment')  would be  nondeductible by  the
Employer for Federal income tax purposes because of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue  Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), then the aggregate present value
of amounts payable or distributable  to or for the  the benefit of the  Employee
pursuant  to this  Agreement (such  payments or  distributions pursuant  to this
Agreement are hereinafter referred to as 'Agreement Payments') shall be  reduced
(but  not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. For purposes of this paragraph, the
'Reduced Amount' shall be an amount  expressed in present value which  maximizes
the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to
be   nondeductible by  the  Employer because of  said Section 280G  of the Code.
With respect to any  'Excess Parachute Payments' within  the meaning of  Section
280G(b)(2)  of the Code subject to the tax (the 'Excise Tax') imposed by Section
4999 of the Code, Employer shall pay  to Employee an additional amount equal  to
the Excise Tax payable by Employee.
 
     The Employer shall elect which and how much of the Agreement Payments shall
be eliminated or reduced (as long as after  such  election the aggregate present
value  of the Agreement Payments equals the Reduced Amount) and shall notify the
Employee promptly  of such  election. For  purposes of  this paragraph,  present
value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. All
determinations  made by the CPAs under this  paragraph shall be binding upon the
Employer and Employee (absent fraud,  wilful misconduct or demonstrable  mistake
in  calculation, but  not in  judgment) and shall  be made  within 60  days of a
termination of employment of the Employee. As promptly as practicable  following
such  determination and  the elections hereunder,  the Employer shall  pay to or
distribute to or for the

                                       8
<PAGE>
benefit of  the Employee such amounts as are then due to the Employee under this
Agreement  and  shall  promptly  pay  to  or  distribute  for the benefit of the
Employee  in the future  such amounts as  become due to this Employee under this
Agreement.
 
     As a result of the  uncertainty in the application  of Section 280G of  the
Code  at the  time of the  initial determination  by the CPAs   hereunder, it is
possible that Agreement Payments  may be made by  the Employer which should  not
have been made ('Overpayment') or that additional Agreement  Payments which will
have  not been made  by the Employer  could have been  made ('Underpayment'), in
each case, consistent with the calculation  of the Reduced Amount hereunder.  In
the  event  that the  CPAs,  based upon  the assertion  of  a deficiency  by the
Internal Revenue Service  against the Employer  or the Employee  which the  CPAs
believe  has a  high probability of  success, determine that  an Overpayment has
been made, any such Overpayment shall be  treated for all purposes as a loan  to
Employee  which the Employee shall repay  to the Employer together with interest
at the applicable Federal rate provided  for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the  Code;
provided,  however,  that no  amount shall  be  payable by  the Employee  to the
Employer if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which  is
subject  to taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the CPAs,
based upon controlling precedent, determine  that an Underpayment has  occurred,
any such  Underpayment shall  be promptly  paid by  the Employer  to or  for the
benefit of the Employee  together with interest at  the applicable Federal  rate
provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code.
 
     8. NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT.
 
     (a)  Employee agrees that he will not, without the prior written consent of
Employer as provided by  paragraph 10 hereof,  Compete (as hereinafter  defined)
with  Employer while he is  an Employee and, if  Employee voluntarily leaves the
employ of Employer  other than  for a  reason specified  in subsection  2(h)(ii)
above, for a period of one year thereafter.
 
     (b) For the purposes of this Agreement, Employee shall be deemed to Compete
with Employer if Employee:
 
          (i) Competes directly with Employer;
 
          (ii)  Is  or becomes  financially  or beneficially  interested  in any
     Person who or which competes with the business of Employer and which Person
     conducts Ten Million  and 00/100  Dollars ($10,000,000.00) or  more of  its
     Gross  Sales in the Prohibited Territory; provided, however, that ownership
     of not  more  than one  percent  (1%) of  any  class of  securities  traded
     over-the-counter  or  through  a  stock  exchange  shall  not  violate this
     paragraph 8(b)(ii); or
 
          (iii) Acts, directly  or indirectly  as a  broker, consultant,  agent,
     salesman,  officer, director or employee or in any other capacity for or on
     behalf of any Person who or which competes with Employer.
 
     (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the following words shall have  the
following meanings, respectively:

                                       9

<PAGE>
          (i) 'Person' means, when not modified by qualifying or limiting words,
     a person, natural or corporate, or other legal entity.
 
          (ii)  'Compete' means the manufacture, assembly, purchase, sale, lease
     or distribution within the Prohibited Territory of (A) any service, article
     or product (individually or as a group) which at any time prior to the date
     of this Agreement, Employer shall have manufactured, assembled,  purchased,
     sold,  leased and/or distributed as a material part of Employer's business,
     or (B) any service, product or article (individually or as group) which  is
     similar,  related or equivalent to any service, product or article which is
     a material part of Employer's business described in clause (A)  immediately
     above,  or (C) any other service, product  or article (individually or as a
     group) of any kindred or cognate kind of character which, at any time after
     the date hereof through the date Employee's employment shall be terminated,
     Employer  shall  manufacture,  assemble,   purchase,  sell,  lease   and/or
     distribute  as a material  part of Employer's  business. Provided, however,
     the term 'compete'  shall not pertain  to any service,  article or  product
     (individually  or as a group)  which, during the term  of this paragraph 8,
     Employer has discontinued.
 
          (iii) 'Prohibited Territory' means the United States of America.
 
     (d)  Employee  hereby  acknowledges  to  and  agrees  with  Employer   that
Employer's  remedy at law  for any breach  by Employee of  his several promises,
covenants and undertakings set forth  in Sections 6, 8  and 9 is inadequate  and
that,  in  addition to  money damages  for  any such  breach, Employer  shall be
entitled to injunctive relief against any such breach.
 
     (e) Employee acknowledges that, without limitation, a violation of Sections
6, 8 or 9 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
 
     (f) The provisions of  this Section shall not  apply after an  Acceleration
Event,  if Employee's  employment is terminated  by the Employer  other than for
Cause or if Employee resigns for a reason specified in Section 2(h)(ii).
 
     (g) Nothing in this  Section shall prohibit Employee  from investing in  or
exploring opportunities which do not Compete with Employer.
 
     9. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
     (a)  Employee represents  and warrants to  Employer that  he will cooperate
fully with  Employer in  the preparation  and filing  of any  and all  documents
necessary  to be filed  with the Securities and  Exchange Commission pursuant to
its rules.
 
     (b) Employer  represents  and  warrants  that it  will  file  any  and  all

parties  hereto with  respect to  the subject  matter hereof  and supersedes all
other agreements, written  or otherwise. This  Agreement may not  be changed  or
extended  (including additions and deletions) orally  or otherwise, except by an
agreement or consent in writing signed by both parties hereto. Such writing  may
only be signed on behalf of Employer by its Board.
 
     12.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The duties and  obligations of Employee under
