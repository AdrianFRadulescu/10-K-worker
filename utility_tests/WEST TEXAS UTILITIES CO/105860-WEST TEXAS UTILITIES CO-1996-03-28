PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.


GENERAL

     CSW, incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1925, is a
Dallas-based public utility holding company registered under the
Holding Company Act.  CSW owns all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of the Operating Companies, CSW Services, CSW Credit,
CSW Energy, CSW International, CSW Communications and EnerShop.  In
addition, CSW owns 80% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
CSW Leasing.

     On January 10, 1996, CSW's tender offer of approximately $2.12
billion in the United Kingdom for all of the outstanding share
capital of SEEBOARD was declared wholly unconditional.  Through
February 29, 1996, CSW (UK) had acquired shares representing, or had
received valid acceptances in respect of, approximately 92.3% of the
outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD.  CSW (UK) expects to acquire
the remaining 7.7% of the outstanding SEEBOARD share capital by the
end of the second quarter of 1996.  SEEBOARD is a regional
electricity company in the United Kingdom headquartered in Crawley,
West Sussex, with approximately two million customers and a
distribution territory in southeast England that covers approximately
3,000 square miles, extending from the outlying areas of London to
the English Channel.  In addition to the distribution and supply of
electricity, SEEBOARD is involved in gas supply, electricity
generation, electrical contracting and retailing.  See UNITED KINGDOM
UTILITY OPERATIONS below, ITEM 7-MD&A and ITEM 8-NOTE 13. UNAUDITED
PRO FORMA INFORMATION.

     The Electric Operating Companies are public utility companies
engaged in generating, purchasing, transmitting, distributing and
selling electricity.  Information concerning the incorporation of
each of the Electric Operating Companies is presented in the
following table.

                         State of         Year of
Registrant            Incorporation     Incorporation

CPL                       Texas              1945
PSO                      Oklahoma            1913
SWEPCO                    Delaware           1912
WTU                       Texas              1927

     The Electric Operating Companies serve approximately 1.7 million
customers in one of the largest service territories in the United
States covering approximately 152,000 square miles in portions of
Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas.  CPL and WTU operate in
portions of south and central west Texas, respectively.  PSO operates
in portions of eastern and southwestern Oklahoma and SWEPCO operates
in portions of northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana and western
Arkansas.  The Electric Operating Companies' customer base includes a
mix of residential, commercial and diversified industrial customers.
Transok is an intrastate natural gas pipeline and gas marketing
company that gathers, processes and stores natural gas for, and
transports and markets natural gas to the Electric Operating
Companies, principally PSO, as well as other customers.

     CSW is committed to expanding its electric utility business
through strategic domestic and international acquisitions and through
marketing initiatives within these territories.  Acquisitions of
utility assets must meet defined criteria, including the potential to
lower costs, increase long-term efficiency and competitiveness and
provide an acceptable rate of return and benefit to CSW.  CSW
believes that the SEEBOARD acquisition meets these criteria.

<PAGE> 1-2

     CSW continues to seek opportunities to expand its non-utility
business in areas related to its core electric utility business.
Through CSW Energy, which develops and operates independent power and
cogeneration projects, CSW has completed four gas-fired cogeneration
plants.  CSW International was formed to invest internationally
either alone or with local or other partners.  CSW International will
also continue CSW's efforts in Mexico and will seek to expand into
other countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia that meet CSW's
investment criteria.  CSW Communications provides communication
services to the Electric Operating Companies and non-affiliates,
including enhancement of services through fiber optic and other
telecommunications technologies.  EnerShop was formed in 1995 to
provide commercial, industrial, institutional and governmental
customers with energy management services designed to control cost,
enhance productivity and improve convenience, safety and comfort.

     CSW Services performs, at cost, various accounting, engineering,
tax, legal, financial, electronic data processing, centralized
economic dispatching of electric power and other services for the CSW
System.  CSW Credit purchases accounts receivable of the Operating
Companies and non-affiliated utilities and CSW Leasing invests in
leveraged leases.

     The CSW System is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC under
the Holding Company Act with respect to the issuance, acquisition and
sale of securities, the acquisition and sale of certain assets or any
interest in any business and accounting practices and other matters.
See Regulation below, and ITEM 7-MD&A for additional information
regarding the Holding Company Act.

     In 1995, the Operating Companies and SEEBOARD contributed the
following percentages to aggregate operating revenues, operating
income and net income for CSW Common.

SEEBOARD's earnings for November and December 1995, respectively.
See ITEM 8-NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

     The relative contributions of the Operating Companies and
SEEBOARD to the aggregate operating revenues, operating income and
net income for CSW Common differ from year to year due to variations
in weather, fuel costs reflected in charges to customers, timing and
amount of rate changes and other factors, including changes in
business conditions and the results of non-utility businesses.

     In 1995, approximately 61% of the Electric Operating Companies'
electric revenues were earned in Texas, 24% in Oklahoma, 9% in
Louisiana and 6% in Arkansas.

     CPL
     The economic base of CPL's service territory includes
manufacturing, mining, agricultural, transportation and public
utilities sectors.  Major contributing activities to these sectors
include oil and gas extraction, food processing, apparel, metal
refining, chemical and petroleum refining, plastics and machinery
equipment.  In 1995, excluding the effects of the provisions for rate
refunds, industrial customers accounted for approximately 22% of
CPL's total operating revenues.  Contracts with substantially all
large industrial customers provide for both demand and energy
charges.  Demand charges continue under such contracts even during
periods of reduced industrial activity, thus mitigating the effect of
reduced activity on operating income.

     PSO
     The economic base of PSO's service territory includes mining,
petroleum products, manufacturing and agriculture.  The principal
industries in the territory include natural gas and oil production,
oil refining, steel processing, aircraft maintenance, paper
manufacturing and timber products, glass, chemicals, cement and
aircraft components.

     SWEPCO
     The economic base of SWEPCO's service territory includes mining,
manufacturing, chemical products, petroleum products, agriculture and
tourism.  The principal industries in the territory include natural
gas and oil production, petroleum refining, manufacturing of pulp and
paper, chemicals, food processing and metal refining.  The territory
also includes several military installations, colleges and
universities.

     WTU
     The economic base of WTU's service territory includes
agricultural businesses, such as the production of cattle, sheep,
goats, cotton, wool, mohair and feed crops.  Significant gains have
been made in economic diversification through value added processing
of these products.  The natural resources of the territory include

<PAGE> 1-4

oil, natural gas, sulfur, gypsum and ceramic clays.  Important
manufacturing and processing plants served by WTU produce cotton seed
products, oil products, electronic equipment, precision and consumer
metal products, meat products and gypsum products.  The territory
also includes several military installations and state correctional
institutions.


Competition and Industry Challenges

     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting the CSW System and electric utilities generally.
Increased competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex
economic, political and technological factors.  These factors have
resulted in legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely
to result in even greater competition at both the wholesale and
retail level in the future.  As competition in the industry
increases, the Electric Operating Companies will have the
opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at risk of
losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, the Electric
Operating Companies will continue to compete with suppliers of
alternative forms of energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal,
some of which may be cheaper than electricity.  The Electric
Operating Companies believe that their prices for electricity and
the quality and reliability of their service currently place them in
a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.  For
additional information regarding competition and industry
challenges, see ITEM 7-MD&A.

     PURA
     Amendments to PURA, the legal foundation of electric regulation
in Texas, became effective on September 1, 1995.  Among other things,
the amendments deregulate the wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT,
permit pricing flexibility for utilities facing competitive
challenges, provide for a market-driven integrated resource planning
process and mandate comparable open access transmission service.

     On December 21, 1995, a preliminary order was issued by the
Texas Commission that expanded the scope of the CPL rate review to
address certain competitive issues facing the electric utility
industry.  The competitive issues to be addressed by CPL in a
supplemental filing due April 1, 1996, are: (i) the calculation of
rates on an unbundled or functional basis (i.e., generation,
transmission and distribution); (ii) current value of CPL's
generating assets as compared to estimates of market value of such
assets under alternative future industry structures; (iii) the
application of performance based ratemaking; (iv) potential revisions
in the methodology of reconciling and recovering fuel costs; and (v)
the Texas Commission's authority to introduce competition in the
electric utility industry under existing law.  For additional
information regarding PURA and the CPL rate review, see ITEM 7-MD&A.

     Electric Service Areas in Texas
     In Texas, electric service areas are approved by the Texas
Commission.  A given tract in a utility's overall service area may be
singly certificated to a utility, to one of several competing
electric cooperatives or to one of the competing municipal electric
systems, or it may be dually or triply certificated to these
entities.  These certificated areas have changed only slightly since
the formation of the Texas Commission in 1976.

     CPL is generally singly certificated to serve inside most
municipalities, and cooperatives are singly certificated to serve
much of the rural areas.  The suburban areas are mostly dually
certificated.  Since 1990, in dually certificated areas, CPL's rates
have been higher than some competitors for some customers, especially
small commercial and industrial customers.  However, most business
has been retained and some new business acquired, primarily because
of service reliability and other customer service advantages.  The
availability of low cost natural gas and other alternative fuels,
including those used in cogeneration facilities, have resulted in
some losses of sales.  Although there have been some losses,
electricity is still the fuel of choice for most air conditioning
installations.  Renewable energy such as solar and wind is not now a
feasible economic choice for customers of CPL in most instances.  CPL
believes that its rates, the quality and reliability of its service
and the relatively inelastic demand for electricity for certain end
uses should allow it to continue to compete in current retail
markets.

<PAGE> 1-5


     CSW is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or the CSW
System.  As the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more
competitive, however, the principal factor determining success is
likely to be price and, to a lessor extent, reliability, availability
of capacity and customer service.  See ITEM 7-MD&A for additional
discussion of competitive issues facing the utility industry.

Regulation

     The CSW System is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC under
the Holding Company Act.  The Holding Company Act generally limits
the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated
public utility system, plus such additional businesses as are
functionally related to such system.

     The Electric Operating Companies have been classified as public
utilities under the Federal Power Act and accordingly the FERC has
jurisdiction in certain respects over their electric utility
facilities and operations, wholesale rates, and in certain other
matters.

     The Electric Operating Companies are subject to the jurisdiction
of various state commissions as to rates, accounting matters,
standards of service and, in some cases, issuance of securities,
certification of facilities and extensions and division of service
territory.

     Nuclear Regulation - CPL
     Ownership of an interest in a nuclear generating unit exposes
CPL and, indirectly, CSW to regulation not common to a fossil
generating unit.  Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy
Reorganization Act of 1974, operation of nuclear plants is
intensively regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose
licensing and safety-related requirements.  Along with other federal
and state agencies, the NRC also has extensive regulations pertaining
to the environmental aspects of nuclear reactors.  The NRC has the
authority to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is
achieved, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the
situation.  For a discussion of NRC regulation and other
considerations arising from the ownership of nuclear assets, see
NUCLEAR - CPL, below.

     Environmental Regulation
     For a discussion of regulation related to the various
environmental agencies that impact the CSW Electric Operating
Companies, see Environmental Matters below.

Rates

     The retail rates of the Electric Operating Companies are subject
to regulation by the state utility commissions in the states in which
they operate.  As discussed above the wholesale rates of the Electric
Operating Companies are subject to regulation by the FERC.  In
addition, SWEPCO has agreements, which have been approved by the
FERC, with all of its wholesale customers under which rates are based
upon an agreed cost of service formula.  These rates are adjusted
periodically to reflect the actual cost of providing service.

     Texas Rates - CPL, SWEPCO and WTU
     The Texas Commission has original jurisdiction over retail rates
in the unincorporated areas of Texas.  The governing bodies of
incorporated municipalities have original jurisdiction over rates
within their incorporated limits.  Municipalities may elect, and some
have elected, to surrender this jurisdiction to the Texas Commission.
The Texas Commission has appellate jurisdiction over rates set by
incorporated municipalities.

<PAGE> 1-6

     Oklahoma Rates - PSO
     PSO is subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Commission
with respect to retail prices.  Pursuant to authority granted under
RESCTA, the Oklahoma Commission established service territorial
boundary maps in all unincorporated areas for all regulated retail
electric suppliers serving Oklahoma.  In accordance with RESCTA, a
retail electric supplier may not extend retail electric service into
the certified territory of another supplier, except to serve its own
facilities or to serve a new customer with an initial full load of
1,000 KW or more.  RESCTA provides that when any territory certified
to a retail electric supplier or suppliers is annexed and becomes
part of an incorporated city or town, the certification becomes null
and void.  However, once established in the annexed territory, a
supplier may generally continue to serve within the annexed area.

     Arkansas and Louisiana Rates - SWEPCO
     SWEPCO is subject to the jurisdiction of the Arkansas Commission
and Louisiana Commission with respect to retail rates, as well as the
Texas Commission as described above.

Fuel Recovery

     The recovery of fuel costs from retail customers by the Electric
Operating Companies is subject to regulation by the state utility
commissions in the states in which they operate.  All of the Electric
Operating Companies' contracts with their wholesale customers contain
FERC approved fuel-adjustment provisions for recovery of fuel costs.

     Texas Fuel Recovery - CPL,  SWEPCO and WTU
     Electric utilities in Texas, including CPL, SWEPCO and WTU, are
not allowed to make automatic adjustments to recover changes in fuel
costs from retail customers.  A utility is allowed to recover its
known or reasonably predictable fuel costs through a fixed fuel
factor.  The Texas Commission established procedures effective in
1993 whereby each utility under its jurisdiction may petition to
revise its fuel factor every six months according to a specified
schedule.  Fuel factors may also be revised in the case of
emergencies or in a general rate proceeding.  Fuel factors are in the
nature of temporary rates and the utility's collection of revenues by
such factors is subject to adjustment at the time of a fuel
reconciliation.  Under these procedures, at its semi-annual
adjustment date, a utility will be required to petition the Texas
Commission for a surcharge or to make a refund when it has materially
under- or over-collected its fuel costs and projects that it will
continue to materially under- or over-collect.  Material under- or
over-collections including interest are defined as four percent of
the most recent Texas Commission adopted annual estimated fuel cost
for the utility.  A utility does not have to revise its fuel factor
when requesting a surcharge or refund.  An interim emergency fuel
factor order must be issued by the Texas Commission within 30 days
after such petition is filed by the utility.  Final reconciliation of
fuel costs is made through a reconciliation proceeding, which may
contain a maximum of three years and a minimum of one year of
reconcilable data, and must be filed with the Texas Commission no
later than six months after the end of the period to be reconciled.
In addition, a utility must include a reconciliation of fuel costs in
any general rate proceeding regardless of the time since its last
fuel reconciliation proceeding.  Any fuel costs that are determined
unreasonably incurred in a reconciliation proceeding are not
recoverable from retail customers.

     Oklahoma Fuel Recovery - PSO
     All KWH sales to PSO's retail customers, except for sales
pursuant to FUSER and CSF, were made under rates which include a fuel
cost adjustment clause.  Oklahoma law requires that an examination of
PSO's retail fuel cost adjustment clause be performed annually by the
Oklahoma Commission.  The fuel cost adjustment is computed for each
month on the basis of the average cost of fuel consumed in the month.
The amount of any difference in such cost over or under a base rate
is applied on a KWH basis and reflected in adjustments to customers'
bills during the second month subsequent to the month in which the
difference occurred.

     The FUSER program, for qualified commercial and industrial
customers, and the CSF program, for qualified wholesale customers,
were developed to allow program participants to purchase natural gas
directly from suppliers, at negotiated prices, to be delivered to and
burned in PSO's gas-fired power plants, resulting in reduced prices
because of the low cost spot gas fuel provided.  Under these
programs, participants could deliver sufficient quantities of natural
gas to meet 70% of their generation requirements with the remaining
30% met with electricity generated by PSO's coal-fired plants.  The
FUSER and CSF programs resulted in lower electric costs to all
classes of PSO's customers.  The FUSER program was canceled effective
October 1, 1993 because changing market and supply conditions
eliminated the economic viability of the program.

<PAGE> 1-7

     Arkansas and Louisiana Fuel Recovery - SWEPCO
     SWEPCO's retail rates currently in effect in Louisiana are
adjusted based on SWEPCO's cost of fuel in accordance with a fuel
cost adjustment which is applied to each billing month based on the
second previous month's average cost of fuel.  Provision for any over-
or under-recovery of fuel costs is allowed under an automatic fuel
clause.  Under SWEPCO's fuel adjustment rider currently in effect in
Arkansas, the fuel cost adjustment is applied for each billing month
on a basis which permits SWEPCO to recover the level of fuel cost
experienced two months earlier.

     Recoverability of Fuel
     The inability of any Electric Operating Company to recover its
fuel costs under the procedures described above could have a material
adverse effect on such company's results of operations and financial
condition.

     See ITEM 7-MD&A and ITEM 8-NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS for further information with respect to regulatory, rate
and fuel proceedings.

Nuclear - CPL

     CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which is
located near Bay City, Texas.  In addition, HLP, the Project Manager,
owns 30.8%; San Antonio owns 28.0%; and Austin owns 16.0%  of STP.
STP Unit 1 was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit 2 was
placed in service in June 1989.

     Nuclear Decommissioning
     At the end of STP's service life, decommissioning is expected to
be accomplished using the decontamination method, which is one of the
techniques acceptable to the NRC.  Using this method, the
decontamination activities occur as soon as possible after the end of
plant operations.  Contaminated equipment is cleaned and removed to a
permanent disposal location, and the site is generally returned to
its pre-plant state.

     CPL's decommissioning costs are accrued and funded to an
external trust over the expected service life of the STP units.  The
existing NRC operating licenses will allow the operation of STP Unit
1 until 2027, and Unit 2 until 2028.  The accrual for decommissioning
costs is an annual level cost based on the estimated future cost to
decommission STP, including escalations for expected inflation to the
expected time of decommissioning, and is net of expected earnings
from the trust fund.  See ITEM 8-NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES for further information related to nuclear
decommissioning.

     CPL Deferred Accounting
     CPL was granted deferred accounting treatment for certain STP
Unit 1 and 2 costs by Texas Commission orders.  These orders allowed
CPL to defer post-in-service operating and maintenance costs,
including taxes and depreciation, and carrying costs until these
costs were reflected in retail rates.  Deferred accounting had an
immediate positive effect on net income in the years allowed, but
cash earnings were not increased until rates went into effect
reflecting STP in service.  See ITEM 8-NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES and NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS, for additional information related to deferred
accounting at STP.

(a) Some plants have the capability of burning oil in combination
    with gas.  Use of oil in facilities primarily designed to burn
    gas results in increased maintenance expense and a reduction of
    approximately 5% to 15% in capability.  PSO and WTU have 25 MW
    and 11 MW, respectively, of facilities primarily designed to burn
    oil.
(b) Data reflects only CSW System's portion of plants which are
    jointly owned with non-affiliates.  For additional information
    concerning jointly owned facilities see ITEM 8-NOTE 6. JOINTLY
    OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT.
(c) Excludes units in storage, consisting of 34 MW at Nueces Bay, 60
    MW at Victoria, and 48 MW at La Palma for CPL and 250 MW at Tulsa
    for PSO.
(d) Although both Fort Phantom units burn primarily gas, Unit 1 is
    designed to burn fuel oil for extended periods of time before
    maintenance is required and Unit 2 is designed to burn fuel oil
    on a continuous basis.

     All of the generating plants described above are located on
land owned by the Electric Operating Companies or, in the case of
jointly owned plants, jointly with other participants.  The Electric
Operating Companies' electric transmission and distribution
facilities are mostly located over or under highways, streets and
other public places or property owned by others, for which permits,
grants, easements or licenses (which the Electric Operating
Companies believe to be satisfactory, but without examination of
underlying land titles) have been obtained.  The principal plants
and properties of the Electric Operating Companies are subject to
the liens of the first mortgage indentures under which the Electric
Operating Companies' bonds are issued.

     Construction Expenditures
     The Electric Operating Companies maintain a continuing
construction program, the nature and extent of which is based upon
current and estimated demands upon the system.  See ITEM 7-MD&A for
additional information related to construction expenditures.

Power Purchases and Sales

     Various municipalities, electric cooperatives and public power
authorities are served by the Electric Operating Companies.  The
Electric Operating Companies exchange power on an emergency or
economy basis with various neighboring systems and engage in economy
interchanges with each other. In addition, they contract with certain
suppliers for the purchase or sale of power on a unit capacity basis.

     SWEPCO - BREMCO
     As part of the agreement to acquire BREMCO, SWEPCO entered into
a long-term purchased power contract with Cajun, BREMCO's previous
full-requirements wholesale supplier.  The contract covered the
purchase of energy at a fixed price for 1993 and 1994, and the
purchase of capacity and energy in subsequent years.  See ITEM 7-MD&A
for information regarding SWEPCO's pending proposal to acquire all of
Cajun's non-nuclear assets.

     SWEPCO and WTU - Tex-La
     WTU sells 92 MW of power and energy to Tex-La.  Tex-La has a
peak requirement of approximately 120 MW.  WTU will serve Tex-La
until facilities are completed to connect Tex-La to SWEPCO, at which
time SWEPCO will provide 85 MW and WTU will retain 35 MW of the Tex-
La electric load.

     PSO - MCPC
     In 1989, PSO entered into certain long-term contracts with MCPC,
a cogeneration development company located in northeastern Oklahoma.
These contracts include: (i) an Interconnection and Interchange
Agreement providing terms and conditions under which MCPC could
connect its electric generating facilities to PSO's transmission
system and providing for future transmission by PSO of specified
amounts of MCPC's power to an unaffiliated utility; (ii) a
Stock/Asset Purchase Agreement which allows PSO under certain
conditions to acquire the stock or assets of MCPC; and (iii) an
Energy Conversion Agreement which required PSO to deliver natural gas
to MCPC for conversion to electrical energy to be delivered by MCPC
to PSO.  Under the Energy Conversion Agreement, PSO had the right to
dispatch up to 60 MWH per hour of quick-start capability.  See ITEM 8-
NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, for information
regarding litigation arising out of PSO's contracts with MCPC.

     SWEPCO - Other Wholesale
     SWEPCO furnishes energy at wholesale to three municipalities and
also supplies electric energy at wholesale to eight electric
cooperatives operating in its territory.

     WTU - Other Wholesale
     WTU provides wholesale electricity to four electric cooperatives
and one municipality for all their respective electric energy
requirements.  WTU also provides wholesale power to nine other
electric cooperatives, one other municipal customer and one investor
owned electric utility company.  WTU's contractual obligations with
fifteen of its wholesale customers require a five-year notice of
termination, and one wholesale customer has a fourteen-year
obligation.

Other Operational Information

     System Interconnection
     The CSW System operates on an interstate basis to facilitate
exchanges of power.  PSO and WTU are interconnected through the 200
MW North HVdc transmission interconnection.  In 1992, SWEPCO and CPL
entered into an agreement with HLP and TU to construct and operate an
East Texas HVdc transmission interconnection to facilitate exchanges
of power for the CSW System.  This interconnection consists of a back-
to-back HVdc converter station and 16 miles of 345 KV transmission
line connecting transmission substations at SWEPCO's Welsh Power
Plant and TU's Monticello Power Plant.  In 1993, an application for a

<PAGE> 1-18

Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the  transmission
interconnection was approved by the Texas Commission, and in mid-
1995, the 600 MW East Texas HVdc project was completed.  Transmission
charges paid to TU are recorded as transmission expenses and are then
recovered from customers through the fuel recovery mechanisms in
Texas.

     CPL and WTU are members of ERCOT, which also includes TU, HLP,
Texas Municipal Power Agency, Texas Municipal Power Pool, Lower
Colorado River Authority, the municipal systems of San Antonio,
Austin and Brownsville, the South Texas and Medina Electric
Cooperatives, and several other interconnected systems and
cooperatives.  PSO and SWEPCO are members of the Southwest Power
Pool, which is comprised of 43 members, including 17 investor-owned
utilities, 12 municipalities, 10 cooperatives, 3 state and 1 federal
agency operating in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and parts of Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico and Texas.
ERCOT members interchange power and energy with one another on a
firm, economy and emergency basis, as do the members of the Southwest
Power Pool.

     Seasonality
     Sales of electricity by the Electric Operating Companies tend to
increase during warmer summer months and, to a lesser extent, cooler
winter months, because of higher demand for power.

     Franchises
     The Electric Operating Companies hold franchises to provide
electric service in various municipalities in their service areas.
These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates
including, in some cases, termination and buy-out provisions.  CSW
considers the Electric Operating Companies' franchises to be
adequate for the conduct of their business.

     Natural Gas
     The Electric Operating Companies purchase their gas from a
number of suppliers operating in and around their service
territories.  In 1995, approximately 43% of the Electric Operating
Companies' total gas purchases were made under long-term contracts
and approximately 57% came from short-term contracts and spot purchases.

     CPL
     CPL's eight gas-fired electric generating plants are supplied by
a portfolio of long-term and short-term natural gas purchase
agreements through multiple natural gas pipeline systems.
Approximately 59% of CPL's total gas requirements in 1995 were
purchased under long-term arrangements representing both purchase
obligations and discretionary purchases, while the balance of CPL's
requirements were acquired under short-term arrangements in the spot market.

     PSO
     PSO engages in a program to maintain adequate gas supplies
necessary for operation.  Natural gas for generation is provided by
purchases under a number of long-term and spot market contracts.
Approximately 49% of PSO's natural gas requirements in 1995 were
provided for under firm contracts.  Transok acts as an administrator
with respect to purchases of natural gas supplies.  Gas is
transported by Transok to PSO facilities under agreements pursuant to
which PSO pays Transok for actual costs incurred in providing the
services as determined on an allocated cost of service basis,
including a rate of return on equity applicable between affiliates as
specified by the Oklahoma Commission in PSO's most recent Oklahoma
price review.  See ITEM 7-MD&A and ITEM 8-NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, for further information with respect to
Transok and the agreements between PSO and Transok.

     SWEPCO
     SWEPCO purchased approximately 100% of its gas requirements in
1995 pursuant to spot purchase contracts with no take-or-pay
obligations.  Subject to market conditions, SWEPCO plans to continue
to enter into short-term contracts with various suppliers to provide
gas for peaking purposes.

     WTU
     WTU has gas purchase contracts with several suppliers.  The
largest long-term contract, which is with Lone Star, provided
approximately 11% of WTU's total gas requirements in 1995.  Lone Star
is obligated, except during curtailments, to have gas available for
125% of the estimated annual fuel requirements of each plant served,
provided the total of all plants does not exceed 110% of the
estimated annual fuel requirement.  The Lone Star contract, which
expires in 2000, allows WTU considerable flexibility to purchase gas
from other sources.  Utilizing this flexibility in 1995, WTU
purchased approximately 72% of its gas requirements on the spot
market from many different suppliers.  The remaining 17% of WTU's
1995 gas requirements came from supplemental firm contracts with
several suppliers.  The contracts with suppliers vary in their terms,
but generally provide for periodic or other price adjustments.

     Coal and Lignite
     The Electric Operating Companies purchase coal from a number of
suppliers.  In 1995, approximately 74% of the Electric Operating
Companies' total coal purchases were supplied under long-term
contracts with the balance procured on the spot market.  The coal for
the CSW System plants comes primarily from Wyoming or Colorado mines
which are located between 1,000 and 1,700 rail miles from the
generating plants.

     Proposed Railroad Merger
     On November 30, 1995, Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and
certain other affiliates of each filed an application with the
Interstate Commerce Commission to merge their rail operations.  Union
Pacific and Southern Pacific currently compete for portions of the
coal transportation traffic to CPL's Coleto Creek Power Plant.  In
addition, Southern Pacific controls the destination portion of
movements of coal from the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, where Union
Pacific competes with Burlington Northern for the origination portion
of the movements.  Because of the potential elimination of such

<PAGE> 1-20

competition and other factors, CPL may be adversely affected by this
merger, if approved, unless conditions mitigating the impact are
included in the merger.

     Oklaunion - CPL, PSO and WTU
     The jointly owned Oklaunion plant purchases coal under a coal
supply contract with Caballo Coal Company.  Approximately 99% of the
total 1995 Oklaunion coal requirements for WTU, 78% for CPL and 85%
for PSO were supplied under the Caballo Coal Company contract with
the balance procured on the spot market.  As of December 31, 1995,
CPL's share of the coal inventory at Oklaunion was approximately
46,000 tons, representing approximately 83 days supply; PSO's share
was approximately 78,000 tons, representing approximately 71 days
supply; and WTU's share was approximately 205,000 tons, representing
approximately 67 days supply.

     Prior to the expiration of a coal transportation contract in
October 1995, all coal used at Oklaunion was transported
approximately 1,100 miles to the plant by Burlington Northern.
Subsequently, coal has been transported in Burlington Northern
supplied rail cars pursuant to a tariff filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission, whose authority in the matter was transferred to
the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. Department of
Transportation effective January 1, 1996.  In a case currently
pending before such board, WTU has challenged the rate filed by
Burlington Northern and requested prescription of a reasonable rate
by the Surface Transportation Board.

     Coleto Creek - CPL
     CPL acquired approximately 34% of the 1995 coal requirements for
its Coleto Creek plant pursuant to a long-term agreement with Colowyo
Coal Company, which expires in 1999.  CPL's remaining purchase
obligation under the Colowyo agreement is for approximately 25% of
Coleto Creek's requirements.  The coal is mined in northwestern
Colorado and is transported approximately 1,400 miles by Denver & Rio
Grande Western Railroad Company and Southern Pacific.  Southern
Pacific is currently the only rail carrier with access to the Coleto
Creek plant.  CPL owns sufficient railcars for operation of three
unit trains.  CPL has instituted a proceeding at the Interstate
Commerce Commission, whose authority in the matter was transferred to
the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. Department of
Transportation, effective January 1, 1996, requesting a reasonable
rate for the 16 mile movement from Victoria, Texas, a station served
by Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, to Coleto Creek.  CPL has
entered into an agreement with Colowyo Coal Company for most of
Coleto Creek's coal requirements for 1996.  Under this contract,
transportation charges are paid by Colowyo Coal Company.  CPL has
also contracted for a test burn of coal from the Powder River Basin
of Wyoming during 1996.  After 1996, CPL intends to utilize Powder
River Basin coal for a portion of the Coleto Creek plant requirements
and intends to negotiate rail transportation agreements for such
coal.  Powder River Basin coal is transported approximately 1,700
miles, using either Burlington Northern or Union Pacific as the
originating carrier and Southern Pacific as the destination carrier.
See Proposed Railroad Merger above.  At December 31, 1995, CPL had
approximately 531,000 tons of coal in inventory at Coleto Creek,
representing approximately 73 days supply.

     Northeastern Station - PSO
     PSO has a contract with Kerr-McGee Coal Corporation, which
substantially covers the coal supply for PSO's Northeastern Station
coal units through at least 2014.  Coal delivery is by unit trains
from mines located in the Gillette, Wyoming vicinity, a distance of
about 1,100 rail miles from Northeastern Station.  PSO owns
sufficient rail cars and spares for operation of six unit trains.
Coal is transported to Northeastern Station pursuant to a long-term
contract with Burlington Northern.  At December 31, 1995, PSO had
approximately 438,000 tons of coal in inventory at Northeastern
representing approximately 41 days supply.  See ITEM 8-NOTE 2.
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, for additional information.

     Welsh and Flint Creek - SWEPCO
     All of the long-term supply for SWEPCO's Welsh plant and its 50
percent-owned Flint Creek plant is provided under a contract with

<PAGE> 1-21

AMAX.  Coal under the AMAX contract is mined near Gillette, Wyoming,
a distance of about 1,500 and 1,100 miles, respectively, from the
Welsh and Flint Creek plants. Coal is delivered to the plants under
rail transportation contracts with Burlington Northern and the Kansas
City Southern Railroad Company having expiration dates ranging
between 1996 and 2007.  SWEPCO owns or leases under long-term leases
sufficient cars and spares for operation of twelve unit trains.
SWEPCO has supplemented its railcar fleet from time to time with
short-term leases.  At December 31, 1995, SWEPCO had coal inventories
of approximately 1,552,000 tons at Welsh, representing 68 days
supply, and approximately 468,000 tons at Flint Creek, representing
68 days supply.  See ITEM 8-NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS and ITEM 8-NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT
LIABILITIES, for information additional information.

     Pirkey and Dolet Hills - SWEPCO
     SWEPCO has acquired lignite leases covering an aggregate of
about 27,000 acres near the Henry W. Pirkey power plant.  Sabine
Mining Company is the contract miner of these reserves.  At December
31, 1995, approximately 238,000 tons of lignite were in inventory at
the plant representing 22 days supply.  Another 25,000 acres are
jointly leased in equal portions by SWEPCO and Central Louisiana
Electric Company in the Dolet Hills area of Louisiana near Dolet
Hills Power Plant.  The Dolet Hills Mining Venture is the contract
miner for these reserves.  At December 31, 1995, SWEPCO had
approximately 207,000 tons of lignite in inventory at the plant
representing 40 days supply.  In the opinion of the management of
SWEPCO, the acreage under lease in these areas contains sufficient
reserves to cover the anticipated lignite requirements for the
estimated useful lives of the lignite-fired plants.

     Nuclear Fuel - CPL
     The supply of fuel for STP involves a complex process.  This
process includes the acquisition of uranium concentrate, the
conversion of uranium concentrate to uranium hexafluoride, the
enrichment of uranium hexafluoride in the isotope U235 and the
fabrication of the enriched uranium into fuel rods and incorporation
of fuel rods into fuel assemblies.  The fuel assemblies are the final
product loaded into the reactor core.  The time associated with this
process requires that fuel decisions be made years in advance of the
actual need to refuel the reactor.  Fuel requirements for STP are
being handled by the STP Management Committee, comprised of
representatives of all participants in STP.

     Outages are necessary approximately every 18 months for
refueling.  Because STP's fuel costs are significantly lower than any
of the other CPL units, CPL's average fuel costs are expected to be
higher whenever an STP unit is down for refueling or maintenance.

     CPL and the other STP participants have entered into contracts
with suppliers for uranium concentrate and conversion service
sufficient for the operation of both STP units through November 1997.
Additional flexible contracts are in place to provide 50% of the
uranium concentrate and 100% of the conversion service needed for STP
from the end of 1997 through 2000.  Enrichment contracts were secured
for a 30-year period from the initial operation of each unit.  The
STP participants have canceled the enrichment requirements for the
period from October 2000 to September 2005 under a ten year no cost
termination provision of the enrichment contract.  The STP
participants believe that other, lower cost options will be available
in the future.  Also, fuel fabrication services have been contracted
for operation through 2005 for Unit 1 and 2006 for Unit 2.  Although
CPL and the other STP owners cannot predict the availability of
uranium and related services, CPL and the other STP owners do not
currently expect to have difficulty obtaining uranium and related
services required for the remaining years of STP operation.

     The Energy Policy Act has provisions for the recovery of a
portion of the costs associated with the decommissioning and
decontamination of the gaseous diffusion plants used in the
enrichment process.  These costs are being recovered on the basis of
enrichment services purchased by utilities from the DOE prior to
October of 1992.  The total annual assessment for all domestic

<PAGE> 1-22


utilities is limited to $150 million per federal fiscal year and
assessable until October 2007.  The STP assessment will be
approximately $2.0 million each year with CPL's share being 25.2% of
the annual STP assessment.

     The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires the
DOE to develop a permanent high level waste disposal facility for the
storage of spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  The DOE last estimated that
the permanent facility will not be available until 2010.  The DOE
will be taking possession of all spent fuel generated at STP as a
result of a contract CPL and other STP participants have entered into
with the DOE.  STP has on-site storage facilities with the capability
to store all the spent nuclear fuel generated by the STP units over
their lives.  Therefore, the DOE delay in providing the disposal
facility will not impact the operation of the STP units.  Under
provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1992, a one-mill per
KWH assessment on electricity generated and sold from nuclear
reactors funds the DOE waste disposal program.

     Risks of substantial liability could arise from the operation of
STP and from the use, handling, disposal and possible radioactive
emissions associated with nuclear fuel.  While CPL carries insurance,
the availability, amount and coverage thereof is limited and may
become more limited in the future.  The available insurance may not
cover all types or amounts of loss or expense which may be
experienced in connection with the ownership of STP.  See ITEM 8-NOTE
3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for information relating to
nuclear insurance.

     Governmental Regulation
     The price and availability of each of the foregoing fuel types
are significantly affected by governmental regulation.  Any inability
in the future to obtain adequate fuel supplies, or adoption of
additional regulatory measures restricting the use of such fuels for
the generation of electricity might affect the CSW System's ability
to economically meet the needs of its customers, and could require
the Electric Operating Companies to supplement or replace, prior to
normal retirement, existing generating capability with units using
other fuels.  This would be impossible to accomplish quickly, would
require substantial additional expenditures for construction and
could have a material adverse effect on CSW's and/or the Electric
Operating Companies' financial condition and results of operations.

     Fuel Costs and Consumption
     Additional fuel cost data for the CSW System appears under
Operating Statistics above.  Average fuel costs and consumption by
fuel type for 1995 are presented in the following table.

costs.

Environmental Matters

     The Operating Companies and CSW Energy are subject to regulation
with respect to air and water quality and solid waste standards and
other environmental matters by various federal, state and local
authorities. These authorities have continuing jurisdiction in most
cases to require modifications in the Electric Operating Companies'
facilities and operations.  Changes in environmental statutes or
regulations could require substantial additional expenditures to
modify the Electric Operating Companies' facilities and operations
and could have a material adverse effect on CSW's and each of the
Electric Operating Companies' results of operations and financial
condition.  Violations of environmental statutes or regulations can
result in fines and other costs.

     Air Quality
     Air quality standards and emission limitations are subject to
the jurisdiction of state regulatory authorities in each state in
which the CSW System operates, with oversight by the EPA.  In
accordance with regulations of these state authorities, permits are
required for all generating units on which construction is commenced
or which are substantially modified after the effective date of the
applicable regulations.

<PAGE> 1-24

     In 1990, the United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act
which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide from gas-
, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning in the year
2000, the Electric Operating Companies will be required to hold
allowances in order to emit sulfur dioxide.  The EPA issues
allowances to owners of existing generating units based on historical
operating conditions.  Based on the CSW System facilities plan, CSW
believes that the Electric Operating Companies' allowances are
adequate to meet their needs at least through 2008.  Public and
private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.

     The Clean Air Act also directs the EPA to issue regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and require government studies to
determine what controls, if any, should be imposed on utilities to
control air toxics emissions.  The impact that the nitrogen oxide
emission regulations and the air toxics study will have on CSW and
the Electric Operating Companies cannot be determined at this time.

     As a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act, CSW
expects to spend approximately $1.7 million over a three year period
from 1995 to 1997 for annual testing of, software modifications to,
and maintenance of continuous emission monitoring equipment.  Of
this, approximately $0.5 million was spent in 1995.  The expected
expenditures and the 1995 expenditures for each of the Electric
Operating Companies are presented in the following table.



                                             CPL     PSO    SWEPCO  WTU
                                                    (thousands)

Total expected expenditures (1995-1997)      $540    $329   $488    $309
Expenditures in 1995                         $146     $98   $131     $86

     Water Quality
     Water quality is subject to the jurisdiction of each of the
state regulatory authorities in which the CSW System operates as well
as the EPA.  These authorities have jurisdiction over all wastewater
discharges into state waters and also for establishing water quality
standards and issuing waste control permits covering discharges which
might affect the quality of state waters.  The EPA has jurisdiction
over point source discharges through the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System provisions of the Clean Water Act.

     RCRA and CERCLA
     The RCRA and the Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas solid
waste rules provide for comprehensive control of all solid wastes
from generation to final disposal.  The appropriate state regulatory
authorities in the states in which the CSW System operates have
received authorization from the EPA to administer the RCRA solid
waste control program for their respective states.

     The operations of the CSW System, like those of other utility
systems, generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject
to environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law,
addresses the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.
Theoretically, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire
cost of a cleanup.  Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated
among PRPs.

     CSW's subsidiaries incur significant costs for the handling,
transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous
waste materials.  Unit costs for waste classified as hazardous exceed
by a substantial margin unit costs for waste classified as non-
hazardous.

     The Electric Operating Companies, like other electric utilities,
produce combustion and other generation by-products, such as ash
sludge, slag, low-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.
The Electric Operating Companies own distribution poles treated with

<PAGE> 1-25

creosote or related substances.  The EPA currently exempts coal
combustion by-products from regulation as hazardous wastes.
Distribution poles treated with creosote or similar substances are
not expected to exhibit characteristics that would cause them to be
hazardous waste.  In connection with their operations, the Electric
Operating Companies also have used asbestos, PCBs and materials
classified as hazardous waste.  If additional by-products or other
materials generated or used by companies in the CSW System were
reclassified as hazardous wastes, or other new laws or regulations
concerning hazardous wastes or other materials were put in effect,
CSW System disposal and remedial costs could increase materially.
The EPA is expected to issue new regulations stating whether certain
other materials will be classified as hazardous.

     TSCA Violation - CPL
     Under the TSCA, the storage, use and disposal, among other
things, of PCBs are regulated.  Violations of the TSCA may lead to
fines and penalties.  CPL was inspected by the EPA in 1992 and found
to have TSCA record-keeping and other violations for PCBs.  During
1995, CPL negotiated a settlement, signed a consent agreement and
paid a penalty of approximately $76,000.

     Sol Lynn Superfund Site - CPL
     The Sol Lynn salvage yard was declared a Superfund site by the
EPA after it was found to contain a number of contaminants including
PCBs.  Gulf States Utilities Company remediated the site for
approximately $2 million and attempted to recover a portion of the
remediation costs from alleged PRPs, including CPL.  During 1995, CPL
and Gulf States Utilities Company reached an agreement whereby CPL
paid $50,000 as its share of the remediation costs.

     Rose Chemical Site - SWEPCO, WTU and CPL
     SWEPCO, WTU and CPL were named PRPs in the cleanup of the Rose
Chemical Site, in Missouri, along with 750 other companies.  A
cleanup fund was established through payments by PRPs who agreed to a
"buyout settlement," and the site remediation was undertaken.  The
site buildings were removed and the grounds cleaned to standards
acceptable to the EPA.  The court settlement became final in July
1994, and during 1995, SWEPCO, WTU and CPL received refunds of
$225,000, $235,000 and $60,000, respectively, from the previously
collected cleanup fund.

     PCB Storage Facilities - PSO
     PSO investigated and identified PCB contamination at one of its
PCB storage facilities in Sand Springs, Oklahoma.  PSO made proper
notification to the EPA of the contamination that was caused by
spills prior to the adoption of PCB spill regulations.  PSO
negotiated a remediation plan with the EPA.  Remediation of the PCB
storage site began in November 1994 and was completed in 1995 at a
cost of approximately $235,000.  As part of the remediation plan,
however, the EPA requested PSO to sample the land surrounding the PCB
storage building site.  The land includes an active PSO substation
and a privately owned industrial area.  Testing of the PSO property
conducted during 1995 revealed minor contamination, and a resulting
cleanup of the substation was completed at a cost of $73,000.  PSO
has not been able to test the adjoining industrial area, so it has
been unable to determine the extent of any PCB contamination.

     Compass Industries Superfund Site - PSO
     PSO has received notice from the EPA that it is a PRP under
CERCLA and may be required to share in the reimbursement of cleanup
costs for the Compass Industries Superfund site which has been
remediated.  PSO has been named defendant in a lawsuit filed in
Federal District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August 29, 1994, for
reimbursement of the cleanup costs.  PSO's degree of responsibility,
if any, as a de minimis party appears to be insignificant and
management expects that PSO will have an opportunity to pay its share
of costs and remove itself from the case.  Accordingly, in 1995, PSO
accrued a $100,000 liability for this expected settlement in 1996.

     Coal Mine Reclamation - PSO
     In August 1994, PSO received approval from the Wyoming
Department of Environmental Quality to begin reclamation of a coal
mine in Sheridan, Wyoming, owned by Ash Creek, a wholly owned

<PAGE> 1-26

subsidiary of PSO.  Ash Creek recorded a $3 million liability in 1993
for the estimated reclamation costs and subsequently accrued an
additional $500,000 in 1995.  Actual reclamation work commenced in
September 1995, with completion expected in late 1996.  Surveillance
monitoring will continue for ten years after final reclamation.
Management believes that ultimate resolution of this matter will not
have a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's consolidated results
of operations or financial condition.

     Suspected Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site - SWEPCO
     In 1994, SWEPCO was notified by Mississippi Power that it may be
a PRP at a MGP site in Biloxi, Mississippi, formerly owned and
operated by a predecessor of SWEPCO.  SWEPCO worked with Mississippi
Power to investigate the extent of contamination at this site.  The
MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan and, in January 1995,
SWEPCO and Mississippi Power initiated sampling pursuant to that work
plan.  Contamination at the site was identified as a result of the
investigation of the property and adjacent properties.  Soil and
grounds water test results were sent to the MDEQ for review and
comment.  The test results confirmed the contamination on the
property and indicated the possibility of contamination of an
adjacent property.  A risk assessment has been performed to assist
SWEPCO and Mississippi Power in determining remediation alternatives.
A final range of cleanup costs has not been determined, but based on
preliminary estimates, SWEPCO has accrued approximately $2 million
for its portion of the cleanup of this site.

     Suspected MGP Sites in Texarkana, Arkansas and Shreveport,
Louisiana - SWEPCO
     SWEPCO owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana, Arkansas.
The EPA ordered an initial investigation of this site, as well as a
site in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no longer owned by SWEPCO.
The contractor who performed the investigations of these two sites
recommended to the EPA that no further action be taken at this time.
SWEPCO discovered that an underground storage tank was in place at the
Texarkana site and that it was leaking.  SWEPCO removed the tank in
early 1995 and has made a request for closure from the ADPCE based on
soil and ground water quality results.  SWEPCO does not believe that
any further action will be required for either of these sites.

     Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas - SWEPCO
     SWEPCO owns a suspected former MGP site in Marshall, Texas.
SWEPCO notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination has been
found at the site.  Sampling was conducted at the end of 1993 and
early 1994, to evaluate the extent, if any, to which contamination has
impacted soil, groundwater and other conditions in the area.  SWEPCO
later conducted another round of groundwater sampling from the site's
groundwater monitor wells.  Sample results from each of the nine
monitor wells indicate that there were no drinking water standards
exceeded for RCRA metals.  In April 1995, additional off-site soil
samples were collected and were analyzed for metals concentrations to
provide for statistical comparison of on-site soils metals
concentrations with off-site or background levels.  Metal
concentrations were determined to be comparable to background levels,
so SWEPCO proceeded with closure of the site with the TNRCC.  Cleanup
work at the site was completed for substantially less than the
preliminary $2 million estimate that was accrued in 1993.

     EMFs
     Research is ongoing whether exposure to EMFs may result in
adverse health effects.  Although a few of the studies to date have
suggested certain associations between EMFs and some types of
effects, the research to date has not established a cause-and-effect
relationship between EMFs and adverse health effects.  CSW cannot
predict the impact on CSW or the electric utility industry if
further investigations or proceedings were to establish that the
present electricity delivery system is contributing to increased
risk or incidence of health problems.

     Other Environmental Matters
     From time to time the registrants are made aware of various
other environmental issues or are named as a party to various other
legal claims, actions, complaints or other proceedings related to
environmental matters.  Management does not expect disposition of
any such pending environmental proceedings to have a material
adverse effect on CSW's or any of the Electric Operating Companies'
results of operations or financial condition.

UNITED KINGDOM UTILITY OPERATIONS

Background and Overview

     On November 6, 1995, CSW, indirectly through CSW (UK), announced
its intention to commence the Tender Offer in the United Kingdom to
acquire all of the outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD, a regional
electricity company in the United Kingdom, for an aggregate adjusted
purchase price of approximately $2.12 billion.  Through February 29,
1996, CSW (UK) had acquired shares representing, or had received
valid acceptances in respect of, approximately 92.3% of the
outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD.  CSW (UK) expects to acquire
the remaining 7.7% of the outstanding SEEBOARD share capital by the
end of the second quarter of 1996.

     SEEBOARD is one of the 12 regional electricity companies which
came into existence as a result of the restructuring and subsequent
privatization of the United Kingdom electricity industry in 1990.
SEEBOARD's primary regulated businesses are the distribution and
supply of electricity within its southeast England service area.
SEEBOARD is also involved in other activities, including gas supply,
electricity generation, electrical contracting and retailing.
SEEBOARD serves an affluent suburban and rural area in the United
Kingdom.  SEEBOARD is also one of the lowest cost suppliers of below
100 KV customers among the United Kingdom's regional electricity
companies.

Distribution and Supply Businesses

     Service Area
     SEEBOARD's service area covers approximately 3,000 square miles
in southeast England, extending from the outlying areas of London to
the English Channel.  SEEBOARD's service area includes large towns
such as Kingston-upon-Thames, Croydon, Crawley, Maidstone, Ashford
and Brighton, as well as substantial rural areas.  The area has a
population of approximately 4.6 million people with significant
portions of the area, such as south London, having a high population
density.  Over the past 25 years, the services sector of the area's
economy has become increasingly important, while the industrial
sector has been in decline.  There has been considerable commercial
development in a number of towns in the area over the last ten years,
in particular in the areas around Gatwick Airport and the English
Channel ports.

     Distribution Business
     Distribution is the core business of SEEBOARD and involves the
distribution of electricity to consumers over SEEBOARD's distribution
system.  Electricity is transported from generating plants across the
United Kingdom, typically at 400 KV or at 275 KV via the National
Grid, to points within SEEBOARD's geographical area.  It is then
transformed to 132 KV and enters SEEBOARD's distribution system.
Almost all of the electricity that enters SEEBOARD's system is
received at these National Grid supply points.  However, a small
amount of electricity is received from power stations within
SEEBOARD's geographical area.  At December 31, 1995, SEEBOARD's
distribution system contained approximately 7,655 miles of overhead
lines and approximately 19,874 miles of underground cables.  The bulk
of SEEBOARD's tangible fixed assets are currently employed in the
distribution business.

     Supply Business
     SEEBOARD's supply business consists of the bulk purchase of
electricity and its sale to customers.  The majority of electricity

<PAGE> 1-28


sold by SEEBOARD in its supply business is purchased through a pool
created in 1990 for the bulk trading of electricity.  Pool prices are
variable and difficult to predict.  Accordingly, in an effort to
control exposure to prices, SEEBOARD has a portfolio of contracts
with major generators as a means of hedging price fluctuations in the
pool.  The physical delivery of electricity via SEEBOARD's
distribution network results in a cost to the supply business and
income to the distribution business.

     SEEBOARD currently has the sole right to supply substantially
all of the consumers in its authorized area, except where demand is
above 100 KW.  As a part of the restructuring of the electricity
industry, competition is being introduced into the market for
electricity supply on a phased basis.  The threshold for competitive
supply was reduced from 1 MW to 100 KW effective April 1, 1994.
SEEBOARD, as well as other licensed suppliers, are permitted to
supply electricity to customers whose peak demand exceeds 100 KW in
the areas of other regional electricity companies.  All holders of a
second-tier license, including SEEBOARD, who supply electricity to
non-franchise customers (i.e., demand of 100 KW or above) must pay
charges to the host regional electricity company for the use of its
distribution network.  It is currently intended that, effective April
1, 1998, the regional electricity companies' supply businesses
(including SEEBOARD's) will no longer be protected by a franchise.
SEEBOARD has always been a strong supporter of extending competition
in electricity whenever feasible and practicable.  To date, SEEBOARD
has established a profitable business in supplying customers outside
of its franchise area.  While SEEBOARD is currently unable to predict
the impact that the transition in 1998 to full competition will have
on its electricity supply business, its primary objective is one of
profit and not market share.

     Regulation
     The distribution and supply businesses of SEEBOARD are
principally regulated by the Electricity Act of 1989 and by the
conditions contained in SEEBOARD's public electricity supply license.
The public electricity supply license generally continues until at
least 2025, although it may be revoked upon 25 years prior notice.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the DGES are the
principal regulators of SEEBOARD's business.

     Most of the income of the distribution business is regulated by
a formula set by the DGES based upon, among other factors, the UK
RPI.  The formula generally sets a cap on the average price per unit
distributed, with allowed annual increases based upon changes in the
UK RPI plus a percentage factor set from time to time by the DGES
(which was initially set at 0.75%).  In August 1994, the DGES
announced that SEEBOARD's allowed per unit price would be reduced by
14% effective April 1, 1995 and that increases (or, if applicable,
decreases) in the allowed per unit price in subsequent years would be
based upon changes in the UK RPI minus 2%.  In July 1995, the DGES
proposed a further revision to SEEBOARD's price controls which would
further reduce the allowed per unit price by 13%, effective April 1,
1996, and restrict increases (or, if applicable, require decreases)
in the allowed per unit price in each of the three subsequent years
based upon changes in the UK RPI minus 3%.  The DGES is not scheduled
to review the allowed distribution charges for the regional
electricity companies, including SEEBOARD, until 2000, although the
DGES may reopen the review before such time under certain
circumstances.

     The prices charged by SEEBOARD in its franchise supply business
are also determined from a formula set from time to time by the DGES.
The formula generally provides for the pass through to customers of
certain costs incurred by SEEBOARD in supplying the electricity,
which include electricity purchase costs, transmission charges, and
distribution costs, together with an allowed margin as determined by
the DGES.  Under the current formula, SEEBOARD is permitted annual
increases (or, if applicable, decreases) in its allowed margin by an
amount equal to the UK RPI minus 2%.  The DGES is not scheduled to
review the allowed supply charges for the regional electricity
companies, including SEEBOARD, until 1998, although the DGES may
reopen the review before such time under certain circumstances.


<PAGE> 1-29
Other Businesses

     In addition to its distribution and supply businesses, SEEBOARD
is also engaged in other activities, including gas supply,
electricity generation, electrical contracting and retailing.
SEEBOARD's gas supply business was established in 1993 to compete in
the competitive commercial and industrial markets.  In 1995, a joint
venture was entered into with Amoco to take advantage of the
extension of competition into the United Kingdom natural gas domestic
market, and will result in the supply by SEEBOARD of natural gas
throughout the United Kingdom.  SEEBOARD's electricity generation
business is conducted through its 37.5% interest in Medway Power
Ltd's 660 MW gas fired power plant located on the Isle of Grain.
SEEBOARD also provides electrical contracting services as both a
primary contractor and subcontractor to a variety of industrial,
commercial and domestic customers.  These operations are primarily in
Southeast England but include a growing national element.  Finally,
SEEBOARD conducts an electrical retailing business through its chain
of retail electrical appliance shops and superstores.  Although the
retail business remains concentrated in SEEBOARD's authorized service
area, a small number of superstores have been developed successfully
outside of the region.

Financial Information

     For the year ended December 31, 1995, SEEBOARD had electricity
sales of approximately 18 billion KWH and, excluding exceptional
items,  net earnings of approximately $118 million on revenues of
approximately $1.9 billion (1.00 pound=$1.58).  SEEBOARD's results for the
year ended December 31, 1995 are not indicative of the results that
will be experienced by SEEBOARD as a subsidiary of CSW due, in part,
to the debt incurred in connection with the financing of the
acquisition, the purchase accounting adjustments and the other
accounting adjustments made to adjust SEEBOARD's results for U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  See ITEM 7-MD&A and ITEM 8-
NOTE 13. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION for more information
regarding SEEBOARD.

Environmental Regulation

     SEEBOARD's operations are subject to regulation with respect to
water quality standards and other environmental matters by various
authorities within the United Kingdom.  Under certain circumstances,
these authorities may require modifications to SEEBOARD's facilities
and operations or impose fines and other costs for violations of
applicable statutes and regulations.  From time to time SEEBOARD is
made aware of various environmental issues or is named as a party to
various other legal claims, actions, complaints or other proceedings
related to environmental matters.   Management does not expect
disposition of any such pending environmental proceedings to have a
material adverse effect on CSW's  results of operations or financial
condition.


NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

Transok

     Transok, is an intrastate natural gas pipeline and gas
marketing company that gathers, processes and stores natural gas
for, and transports and markets natural gas to, the Electric
Operating Companies and other customers.  Transok, which was
incorporated in Oklahoma in 1955, was acquired by CSW in 1961 to
supply natural gas to PSO's power stations.  Transok's operations in
recent years have included the marketing and transportation of
natural gas for third parties, as well as the supply of gas and
services to the other Electric Operating Companies and CSW Energy.

     Transok provides a variety of services to the Electric Operating
Companies including acquiring and transporting natural gas to meet
certain of their power generation needs.  Transok's largest customer
is PSO.  The contract between PSO and Transok provides (i) for the
transportation of PSO's natural gas fuel supply through Transok's
pipeline system and (ii) for Transok to act as PSO's supply

<PAGE> 1-30

administrator in acquiring natural gas and negotiating and
administering supply contracts.  PSO pays Transok for such services
at cost, including a return on equity applicable between affiliates
as specified by the Oklahoma Commission in PSO's most recent Oklahoma
price review.  The contract expires on January 1, 2003.  Under the
contract, PSO has the right to require delivery of up to 165,000
MMbtu per day of natural gas through Transok's pipeline system.  PSO
has the option, exercisable on or before July 1, 1997, to increase
delivery of natural gas under the contract up to 255,000 MMbtu per
day effective January 1, 1998.  Transok's current delivery rate to
PSO is approximately 98 Bcf of natural gas annually, which is
projected to increase in the future.

     Natural Gas Transportation and Gathering
     Transok provides natural gas suppliers and shippers with
pipeline interconnects for access to the Electric Operating Companies
and other end-users throughout the United States.  At December 31,
1995, Transok's pipeline system consisted of approximately 6,504
miles of gathering and transmission lines which include approximately
4,030 miles of gathering lines in Oklahoma, 276 miles in Louisiana
and 214 miles in Texas.  At December 31, 1995, Transok's pipeline
system consisted of 205 compressors with 228,300 horsepower to
provide both gathering and transmission line compression.  Transok's
pipeline facilities are located in the major natural gas producing
basins in Oklahoma, including the Anadarko and Arkoma basins, and in
the major Louisiana corridor of pipelines transporting natural gas to
the northeast from the Gulf Coast and mid-continent areas.  The
Transok pipeline system has numerous connections with major
interstate pipelines through which natural gas is transported to
markets throughout the United States.  In 1995, the Transok pipeline
system had a throughput of 511 Bcf of natural gas.

     Transok transported approximately 89 Bcf of natural gas for PSO
in 1995 and provided administrative services to PSO to manage its
supply of natural gas.  Transok has been active in the development of
joint gas purchase arrangements with its other CSW affiliates as
well.  Transok's access to diverse natural gas markets combined with
the natural gas fuel needs of the Electric Operating Companies allow
for natural gas opportunities at high load factors, reducing the cost
of natural gas fuel for the CSW System.

     Natural Gas Processing
     Transok also owns and operates eight natural gas processing
plants, including the Cox City plant which began operations in
January 1996, for the production of natural gas liquids.  The plants
have an aggregate capacity of 564 MMcf/d.  Transok is the largest
natural gas processor in Oklahoma and ranks eighteenth among natural
gas liquids producers nationwide.  In 1995, Transok's plants produced
344 million gallons of natural gas liquids while revenue from the
sale of natural gas liquids amounted to $135 million for the year.

     Natural Gas Storage
     Transok owns and operates an underground natural gas storage
reservoir in Oklahoma with an aggregate storage capacity of
approximately 26 Bcf.  Operational capabilities include injection
into storage at a rate of 200 MMcf/d and a withdrawal rate in excess
of 300 MMcf/d.  The FERC has approved market-based storage rates for
Transok which enables it to sell storage services to interstate
customers at negotiated fees based on the value of those services in
the competitive marketplace.  Transok's gas storage field also allows
Transok to offer peaking services, accommodate volume swings on its
pipeline system and support the natural gas requirements of the
Electric Operating Companies.

     Natural Gas Marketing
     In 1989, Transok began its natural gas marketing program and
sold 26 Bcf to a variety of customers including local distribution
companies, end-users and other pipelines.  In 1995, Transok's natural
gas sales volumes were 326 Bcf with a sales revenue of $529 million.
Off-system sales of natural gas accounted for 164 Bcf of the natural
gas sold in 1995.  This increase was the result of pipeline
acquisition and construction activities combined with new customers.
Transok aggregates natural gas supply into various supply pools,
which provide Transok with reliable sources of natural gas at market
sensitive prices, allowing Transok to meet its natural gas supply
needs.  Transok offers various gas supply services to provide

<PAGE> 1-31

customers with peaking and balancing alternatives utilizing Transok's
gas supplies and facilities.  In addition, Transok's customers have
the opportunity to select various pricing options including: (i)
fixed or variable pricing; (ii) indexed to New York Mercantile
Exchange pricing; or (iii) cash quotes.

     Transok uses natural gas futures, options and basis swaps to
reduce its price risk exposure arising from the purchase and sale of
natural gas.  Natural gas futures and options allow Transok to
protect against volatility in supply costs in fulfilling fixed price
contracts, meeting storage requirements and purchasing natural gas
for processing operations.  Natural gas futures and options also are
used to protect Transok against price exposure on sales of natural
gas from storage or anticipated purchases.  In addition, basis swaps
protect Transok against volatility in price differentials between
geographic areas in matching anticipated supply and demand prices.

     In 1992, FERC Order 636 went into effect to deregulate the
natural gas industry and increase competition.  Although Transok
operations were not directly affected by Order 636, Transok has
developed tariff services, flexible contracts and other natural gas
related services in order to meet customers' needs and take advantage
of new competitive opportunities.

     Services for CSW Energy
     Transok provides natural gas fuel planning and management
services for CSW Energy.  Transok assists CSW Energy in developing
natural gas supply and transportation strategies for CSW Energy's non-
utility electric generation projects.

     Regulation
     As a subsidiary of CSW, Transok is subject to regulation under
the Holding Company Act.  The Holding Company Act, among other
things, requires that regulated companies seek prior SEC approval
before entering into certain transactions, including the acquisition
or issuance of securities.

     Transok's pipelines are considered gathering systems or
intrastate pipelines.  Transok is therefore exempt from regulation by
the FERC under the Natural Gas Act.  However, Transok's rates for
transporting gas in interstate commerce are subject to FERC
regulation under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  The FERC
approves Transok's rates for transportation of gas in interstate
commerce through Transok's pipelines in Oklahoma and Louisiana and
the Texas Railroad Commission approves the rates for such
transportation through pipelines in Texas.  The FERC also has given
Transok approval to charge market-based rates for storage of gas
using Transok's storage facility in Oklahoma.

     While Transok is not subject to direct regulation by any state
public utility commission, the costs that result from transactions
with the Electric Operating Companies are subject to review by the
state commissions regulating affiliates and are required to meet
standards for affiliate transactions to be recoverable by the
Electric Operating Companies.

     Transok's compressor engines and other emission sources are
subject to air permit requirements, including monitoring.  As a
result of new requirements under the Clean Air Act, seven of
Transok's facilities will be subject to additional permit
requirements.  The Clean Air Act may also impose additional enhanced
monitoring requirements on these seven facilities.

     Strategic Alternatives for Transok
     In January 1996, CSW announced it was exploring strategic
alternatives for its investment in Transok.  The alternatives for
Transok, which include a possible sale, are a part of CSW's
continuous strategic asset review.  Although it is not presently
possible to predict the terms upon which any sale of Transok would be
effected, CSW does not expect that the sale of Transok to an
unaffiliated third party would have a material adverse effect on the
price or availability of natural gas for PSO or any of the other
Electric Operating Companies.

CSW Energy

     CSW Energy is authorized to develop various independent power
and cogeneration facilities and to own and operate such non-utility
projects, subject to regulatory approval.  CSW Energy's participation
in projects as of the end of 1995 is presented in the following
table.

     In addition to these projects, CSW Energy has another six
projects totaling approximately 2,000 MW in various stages of
development, mostly in affiliation with other developers.  See ITEM 7-
MD&A for additional discussion of the settlement of certain issues
between CSW Energy and a former business partner that resulted in a
new business partner for the Mulberry and Orange projects.

CSW International

     CSW International was formed in 1994 to engage in international
activities, including developing, acquiring, financing and owning
EWGs and foreign utility companies.  CSW International's most
significant activity to date is the acquisition, indirectly through
CSW (UK), of the outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD pursuant to
the Tender Offer.  See UNITED KINGDOM UTILITY OPERATIONS above, and
ITEM 7-MD&A.  CSW International also intends to continue its efforts
in Mexico, with a stated goal of participating in providing Mexico's
future electricity needs.  Although the recent devaluation of the
Mexican peso has slowed previously projected power demand, CSW
International continues to believe that the geographic location of
the CSW System offers opportunities to provide bulk power to Mexico.
CSW International continues to seek to expand into other countries
in Latin America, Europe and Asia that meet its investment criteria.

CSW Credit

     CSW Credit was formed to purchase, without recourse, the
accounts receivables from the Operating Companies.  This helps
provide liquidity to the Operating Companies due to the seasonal
nature of the electric utility industry.  CSW Credit's business has
been expanded to include the purchase, without recourse, of accounts
receivables for certain non-affiliated parties as well.  In
addition, CSW Credit's capital structure contains greater leverage
than that of the Operating Companies, consequently lowering CSW's
overall cost of capital.  CSW Credit, as a subsidiary of CSW, is
subject to the Holding Company Act.  As such, CSW Credit must comply
with a restriction whereby no more than 50% of the average
outstanding accounts receivable balances held may be from non-
affiliated parties.

<PAGE> 1-33

CSW Communications

     CSW Communications was formed to provide communication services
to the Operating Companies and non-affiliates.  One important goal
of CSW Communications is to enhance services to CSW System customers
through fiber optics and other telecommunications technologies.  In
Laredo, Texas, a project has been undertaken to install fiber optic
lines and coaxial cable to CPL residential customers.  The project,
a network of over 3,000 homes with approximately 700 customers
currently participating, will demonstrate the energy efficiency and
cost savings that result from giving customers greater choice and
control over their electric service.  CSW Communications offers
similar energy efficiency services to other parties, including
affiliates as well as non-affiliates.  In the future, CSW
Communications may, subject to any required regulatory approvals,
seek to lease or otherwise use the remaining capacity for other
services including possibly telephone service, cable television and
home security systems.  CSW Communications presently owns and
manages a 185 mile fiber-optic line connecting the south Texas
cities of Corpus Christi, Harlingen and McAllen, and anticipates the
construction of another fiber-optic line, connecting Shreveport,
Louisiana and Longview, Texas, to begin in mid-1996.

     CSW Communications filed for "exempt telecommunications
company" status with the FCC on February 8, 1996, subsequent to
legislation that introduced competition to telephone and other
communications industries that operated within regulated
environments.  The filing with the FCC automatically qualifies CSW
Communications as an exempt telecommunications company, pending the
FCC's review of the application (which is required to be completed
within 60 days).  CSW believes that CSW Communications' exempt
telecommunications company status will enable it to compete more
effectively with other telecommunications companies.

EnerShop

     In September 1995, EnerShop was formed to provide energy
services to customers throughout the Southwest.  EnerShop offers
services that help reduce customers' operating costs through
increased energy efficiencies and improved equipment operations.
EnerShop utilizes the skills of local trade allies in offering
services that include energy and facility analysis, project
management, engineering design and equipment procurement and
construction, third party financing and equipment leasing, savings
and performance guarantees and performance monitoring.  EnerShop
recently secured its first major contract and has bids outstanding
for several additional projects in 1996.

CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEST CORPORATION
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Reference is made to CSW's Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes to Financial Statements and Selected Financial
Data.  The information contained therein should be read in
conjunction with, and is essential in understanding, the following
discussion and analysis.


OVERVIEW

          The electric utility industry is changing rapidly as it is
becoming more competitive.  Several years ago, in anticipation of
increasing competition and fundamental changes in the industry,
CSW's management developed the following four-part strategic plan
designed to help position CSW to be competitive in this rapidly
changing environment:

     *  Enhance CSW's core electric utility business
     *  Expand CSW's core electric utility business
     *  Expand CSW's non-utility business
     *  Pursue financial initiatives

     Since the introduction of CSW's strategic plan in 1990, CSW has
undertaken key initiatives in each of these areas that are important
steps in the implementation of the overall strategy.  These
initiatives were marked by the restructuring of CSW's core business
in 1993 and 1994, the recent SEEBOARD acquisition and, although it
was not consummated, the proposed acquisition of El Paso.  These
events are discussed below and elsewhere in this report.

     CSW believes that, compared to other electric utilities, the
CSW System is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities and
challenges of an increasingly deregulated and competitive market for
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  The
CSW System benefits from economies of scale by virtue of its size
and is a reliable and relatively low-cost provider of electric
power.  More specifically, CSW seeks competitive advantages through
its diverse and stable customer base, competitive prices for
electricity, diversified fuel mix, extensive transmission
interconnections, diversity of regulation and financial flexibility.
See RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS.


SEEBOARD ACQUISITION

     On November 6, 1995, CSW, indirectly through CSW (UK),
announced its intention to commence the Tender Offer in the United
Kingdom to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD,
a regional electricity company in the United Kingdom, for an
aggregate adjusted purchase price of approximately $2.12 billion.
SEEBOARD is one of the 12 regional electricity companies which came
into existence as a result of the restructuring and subsequent
privatization of the United Kingdom electric industry in 1990.  Its
principal businesses are the distribution and supply of electricity
in southeast England.  SEEBOARD is also involved in other
activities, including gas supply, electricity generation, electrical
contracting and retailing.

     SEEBOARD serves an affluent suburban and rural area in the
United Kingdom.  SEEBOARD is also one of the lowest cost suppliers
among the United Kingdom's regional electricity companies.
Approximately 91% of SEEBOARD's customers are residential.  For the
year ended December 31, 1995, SEEBOARD had electricity sales of
approximately 18 billion KWH and, excluding exceptional items,  net

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-7
earnings of approximately $118 million on revenues of approximately
$1.9 billion (1.00 pound=$1.58).  SEEBOARD's results for the year ended
December 31, 1995 are not indicative of the results that will be
experienced by SEEBOARD as a subsidiary of CSW due, in part, to the
debt incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition,
the purchase accounting adjustments and the accounting adjustments
made to adjust SEEBOARD's results for U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.  See LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES and NOTE
13. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION.

     On January 10, 1996, CSW's Tender Offer was declared wholly
unconditional.  Through February 29, 1996, CSW (UK) had acquired
shares representing, or had received valid acceptances in respect
of, approximately 92.3% of the outstanding share capital of
SEEBOARD.  CSW (UK) expects to acquire the remaining 7.7% of the
outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD by the end of the second
quarter of 1996.


TERMINATION OF EL PASO MERGER

     In May 1993, CSW entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to
which El Paso would emerge from bankruptcy as a wholly owned
subsidiary of CSW.  El Paso is an electric utility company
headquartered in El Paso, Texas, which filed a voluntary petition
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on
January 8, 1992.  On June 9, 1995, CSW notified El Paso that CSW
would not extend the termination date under the Merger Agreement as
had been requested by El Paso and, accordingly, that it was
terminating the Merger Agreement.  CSW also informed El Paso on June
9, 1995 that it was withdrawing the Modified Plan for the proposed
Merger with El Paso by a contemporaneous filing with the Bankruptcy
Court.  On June 9, 1995, following CSW's notification that it was
terminating the Merger and withdrawing the Modified Plan, El Paso
filed suit against CSW.  On June 15, 1995, CSW filed suit against El
Paso.  See NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS for a
discussion of the legal proceedings surrounding this termination.


RESTRUCTURING

     During 1993, CSW announced a restructuring under which the CSW
System restructured the Electric Operating Companies under a new
business unit called CSW Electric and centralized many common
service functions into CSW Services in order to reduce costs and
improve efficiency and productivity.  The restructuring included
restaffing positions throughout the CSW System and a reduction in
the workforce by more than 7% system-wide. The restructuring costs
were initially estimated to be $97 million and were expensed in
1993.  The actual costs of the restructuring, approximately $86
million, were incurred primarily during 1994.  CSW has realized a
number of benefits from the restructuring, including increased
efficiencies and synergies through the elimination of previously
duplicated functions.


RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

     CPL Rate Review
     On November 6, 1995, CPL filed with the Texas Commission a
request to increase its retail base rates by $71 million and reduce
its annual retail fuel factors by $17 million. The net effect of
these proposals would be an increase of $54 million, or 4.6%, in
total annual retail revenues based on a test year ended June 30,
1995. CPL is not seeking interim rate relief, but will implement
bonded rates in May 1996, the earliest date permitted by law.  CPL
also is seeking to reconcile $229 million of fuel costs incurred
during the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.  CPL's previous
request to reconcile fuel costs from March 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994
in Docket No. 13650 was consolidated with the current rate review.

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-8
If the requested increase and other adjustments in rate structure are
approved, CPL has committed not to increase its base rates prior to
January 1, 2001, subject to certain force majeure events.

     CPL is requesting this rate review in large part as a result of
the expiration of the amortization of its Mirror CWIP liability. The
Mirror CWIP liability was amortized to income in declining amounts
over a five-year period from 1991 through 1995 pursuant to rate
settlements reached by CPL in 1990 and 1991. In 1995, Mirror CWIP
provided $41 million in non-cash earnings at CPL. Also included in
the request are proposals by CPL to accelerate recovery of nuclear
and regulatory assets as a way to proactively address certain assets
that could possibly be unrecoverable or stranded in a more
competitive electric utility industry.  In a preliminary order issued
December 21, 1995, the Texas Commission expanded the scope of the
rate review to address certain competitive issues facing the electric
utility industry.  The competitive issues to be addressed by CPL in a
supplemental filing due April 1, 1996, are: (i) the calculation of
rates on an unbundled or functional basis (i.e., generation,
transmission and distribution); (ii) the current value of CPL's
generating assets as compared to estimates of the market value of
such assets under alternate future industry structures; (iii) the
application of performance based ratemaking; (iv) potential revisions
in the methodology of reconciling and recovering fuel costs; and (v)
the Texas Commission's authority to introduce competition in the
electric utility industry under existing law.

     On February 13, 1996, intervening parties filed testimony in the
revenue requirements phase of CPL's base rate case.  Among the
parties that filed testimony were the OPUC which recommended a base
rate decrease of approximately $75 million on a total company basis
and the Cities which recommended a base rate reduction of
approximately $52 million on a total company basis.

     On February 20, 1996, the Staff filed testimony recommending an
increase in total company base rates of approximately $30 million.
Certain elements of the Staff's proposal are described below.

     The Staff recommended a return on common stock equity of 11.35%
compared to the 12.25% return on common equity requested by CPL.  The
Staff recommended a disallowance of $16 million in costs billed for
administrative services by CSW Services to CPL on the basis that the
specific benefits to CPL were not clearly identified.  Additionally,
the Staff recommended a $7 million reduction in CPL's current annual
depreciation accrual and a $3 million reduction in CPL's requested
accrual for decommissioning STP.  A comparison of the Staff's
recommendation for a base rate increase, compared to CPL's claimed
revenue deficiency is provided in the CPL RATE REVIEW COMPARISON
table.

                   retail jurisdiction) in accordance with rate
                   settlements entered into by CPL in 1990 and
                   1991.
              (2)  The Staff recommended that CPL be granted a
                   $23 million base rate increase and an annual
                   increase of $7 million in customer service
                   charges.

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-9
     The Staff and Cities recently filed testimony on the fuel
portion of the rate case recommending a reduction to CPL's eligible
fuel costs of $16 million and $32 million, respectively.

     After completion of hearings in all phases of the rate case,
which began in late February 1996 and are expected to conclude during
the third quarter of 1996, the ALJs assigned to hear the case will
issue a proposal for decision for consideration by the Texas
Commission. Testimony filed by parties to the rate case, including
the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJs or the Texas Commission.
A final decision on the rate request is not anticipated from the
Texas Commission prior to December 1996.

     Management of CSW and CPL cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
CPL's rate case, although management believes that the ultimate
resolution will not have a material adverse effect on CPL's or CSW's
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  However,
if CPL ultimately is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate rate relief,
CPL and CSW could experience a material adverse effect on their
results of operations and financial condition.

     CPL 1995 Agreement
     On April 5, 1995, CPL reached an agreement in principle with
other parties to pending regulatory proceedings involving base rate,
fuel and prudence issues relating to an outage experienced at STP
during 1993 and 1994.  On May 16, 1995, CPL filed the CPL 1995
Agreement with the Texas Commission.  Pursuant to the CPL 1995
Agreement, base rate refunds, fuel refunds and the reduction of CPL's
fuel factors were implemented on an interim basis during the summer
of 1995.  Under the CPL 1995 Agreement, CPL provided customers a one-
time base rate refund of $50 million.  In addition, CPL refunded
approximately $30 million in over-recovered fuel costs through April
1995.  Furthermore, CPL did not charge customers for $62.25 million
in replacement power costs and related interest primarily associated
with the 1993-1994 STP outage.  The CPL 1995 Agreement did not result
in any ongoing change in base rate levels and provided that there
would be no new rate review requests filed prior to September 28,
1995.  CPL also reduced its fuel factors, effective in July 1995, by
approximately $55 million on an annual basis due to projections of
lower fuel costs.  Hearings on the CPL 1995 Agreement were held on
July 19, 1995, and the final written Texas Commission order approving
the CPL 1995 Agreement was received on October 4, 1995.  See NOTE 2.
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

     WTU Stipulation and Agreement
     WTU has been the subject of several pending regulatory matters,
including the following:  (i) a retail rate proceeding and fuel
reconciliation before the Texas Commission in Docket No. 13369; (ii)
Writ of Error to the Supreme Court - review of WTU's 1987 Texas rate
case in Docket No. 7510; and (iii)  the Texas Commission's proceeding
on remand in Docket No. 13949 regarding deferred accounting treatment
for Oklaunion Power Station Unit No. 1 originally authorized in the
Texas Commission's order in Docket No. 7289.

     On September 22, 1995, WTU, along with other major parties to
the above described matters, filed with the Texas Commission a joint
stipulation and agreement to resolve all of these matters.  The WTU
Stipulation and Agreement is a unified package that included: (i) a
retail base rate reduction of approximately $13.5 million annually
starting with WTU's October 1995 revenue month billing cycle; (ii) a
$21 million retail refund which was not attributed to any specific
cause but was inclusive of all claims related to the three above
described litigation and regulatory matters and included the effect
of the rate reduction retroactive to October 1, 1994; (iii) a
reduction of reduced fixed fuel factors by approximately 2%; (iv)
various rate and accounting treatments including a reasonable return
on equity for retail operations of 11.375%; and (v) a retail base
rate freeze until October 1, 1998, subject to certain force majeure
provisions.

<PAGE> 2-10
     On November 9, 1995, the Texas Commission rendered a final order
that implemented the joint stipulation and agreement.  The WTU
Stipulation and Agreement is expected to impact WTU's results of
operations for the next several years, reducing annual earnings by
approximately $8 million beginning in 1996.  The WTU Stipulation and
Agreement also eliminated several significant risks that have been
the subject of regulatory proceedings relating to deferred accounting
plant costs and rates and will enable WTU's rates to remain at
competitive levels for the foreseeable future.  See NOTE 2.

TRANSOK

     In January 1996, CSW announced it was exploring strategic
alternatives for Transok, CSW's wholly owned intrastate natural gas
gathering, transmission, marketing and processing subsidiary.  The
alternatives for Transok, which include a possible sale, are a part
of CSW's continuous strategic review of its business.  See NON-
UTILITY INITIATIVES.


SOUTH TEXAS PROJECT

     CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which is
located near Bay City, Texas.  In addition, HLP, the Project Manager
of STP, owns 30.8%, San Antonio owns 28.0%, and Austin owns 16.0% of
STP.  STP Unit 1 was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit 2
was placed in service in June 1989.

     From February 1993 until May 1994, STP experienced an
unscheduled outage resulting from mechanical problems.  The outage
resulted in significant rate and regulatory proceedings involving
CPL, including a base rate case and fuel reconciliation proceedings
as previously discussed.  Unit 1 restarted on February 25, 1994 and
reached 100% power on April 8, 1994 and Unit 2 resumed operation on
May 30, 1994 and reached 100% power on June 16, 1994.  During the
last six months of 1994, the STP units operated at capacity factors
of 98.6% for Unit 1 and 99.2% for Unit 2.  For a discussion of
regulatory matters surrounding the STP outage, see RATES AND
REGULATORY MATTERS above and NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS.

     Both STP units were removed from service during 1995 for
scheduled refueling outages.  The fueling outages lasted 41 days for
Unit 1 and 26 days for Unit 2.  For the year 1995, Unit 1 and Unit 2
operated at net capacity factors of 84.9% and 90.6%, respectively.

     For additional information regarding STP and the accounting for
the decommissioning of STP, see NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES and NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Overview
     The historical capital requirements of the CSW System have been
primarily for the construction of electric utility plant.  Based on
projections of growth in peak demand, CSW does not anticipate that
large capital expenditures for the construction of new generating
capacity will be required through the end of this decade.

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-11
Accordingly, future capital expenditures for the Electric Operating
Companies, as well as SEEBOARD, are anticipated to be primarily for
existing distribution systems.  Primary sources of capital are long-
term debt and preferred stock issued by the Electric Operating
Companies, long-term and short-term debt and common stock issued by
CSW and internally generated funds.  CSW Energy and CSW
International typically use various forms of non-recourse project
financing to provide a portion of the capital required for their
respective projects.  In addition, CSW, in order to strengthen its
capital structure and support growth from time to time, may issue
additional shares of CSW Common.

     Internally generated funds should meet most of  the capital
requirements of the Electric Operating Companies.  However, CSW's
strategic initiatives, including expanding CSW's core electric
utility and non-utility businesses through acquisitions or
otherwise, may require additional capital from external sources.  As
of February 29, 1996, CSW Investments had borrowed approximately
$1.0 billion to fund a portion of the SEEBOARD acquisition purchase
price pursuant to a credit facility for which neither CSW nor CSW
International is subject to recourse.  On February 27, 1996, CSW
sold 15,525,000 shares of CSW Common pursuant to the 1996 Stock
Offering and received approximately $398 million in net proceeds,
which it used to repay a portion of the indebtedness incurred by CSW
to finance the acquisition of SEEBOARD.

     Productive investment of net funds from operations in excess of
capital expenditures and dividend payments are necessary to enhance
the long-term value of CSW for its investors.  CSW is continually
evaluating the best use of these funds.  Subject to certain
exceptions, CSW is required to obtain authorization from various
regulators in order to invest in any additional business activities.
See RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS - Holding Company Act below.

     SEEBOARD Acquisition Financing
     The aggregate adjusted purchase price to be paid for SEEBOARD in
the Tender Offer is approximately $2.12 billion.  As of February 29,
1996, CSW had contributed approximately $829 million of the purchase
price to complete the acquisition of SEEBOARD shares in connection
with the Tender Offer.  CSW obtained such funds through borrowings
under the $850 million CSW Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the
CSW Credit Agreement are unsecured and mature on November 6, 2000,
subject to prepayment by CSW at any time.  On February 28, 1996, CSW
used the $398 million net proceeds from the 1996 Stock Offering to
repay a portion of these borrowings.  CSW anticipates that the
remaining amounts owed under the CSW Credit Agreement will be repaid
through a combination of internally generated funds, additional sales
of CSW Common (including sales through CSW's Thrift Plan and
PowerShare) or strategic sales of assets, including possibly Transok.
See TRANSOK, and 1996 Stock Offering, ThriftPlus Plan and PowerShare
below.

     CSW (UK) has obtained or will obtain the remaining funds
necessary to consummate the Tender Offer, approximately $1.29
billion, from capital contributions or loans to be made to CSW (UK)
by its sole shareholder, CSW Investments, which has arranged the CSW
Investment Credit Facility for that purpose.  Neither CSW nor CSW
International, the indirect parent of CSW Investments and CSW (UK),
has guaranteed or is otherwise subject to recourse for amounts
borrowed under the CSW Investments Credit Facility. As of February
29, 1996, CSW Investments had borrowed approximately $1.0 billion
under the CSW Investments Credit Facility.  CSW Investments
anticipates that amounts borrowed under the CSW Investments Credit
Facility will be repaid through dividends and other amounts
received, indirectly through CSW (UK), from SEEBOARD.

     Capital Expenditures
     Total capital expenditures for CSW, including the Electric
Operating Companies, SEEBOARD, Transok and other diversified
operations (but excluding capital that may be required for
acquisitions), are estimated to be approximately $636 million, $671
million and $563 million for the years 1996 through 1998.  The
foregoing consists of forward looking information and, accordingly,
actual results may differ materially from such projected information
due to changes in the underlying assumptions.  Such assumptions are

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-12
based on numerous factors, including factors such as the rate of
load growth, escalation of construction costs, changes in lead times
in manufacturing, inflation, the availability and pricing of
alternatives to construction, nuclear, environmental and other
regulation, delays from regulatory hearings, adequacy of rate relief
and the availability of necessary external capital.  In addition,
actual results may differ materially from the projected information
due to changes in the nature and scope of CSW's diversified
operations and the capital requirements that may be required to fund
such operations.

     CSW periodically revaluates its capital spending policies and
generally seeks to fund only those construction projects and
investments that management believes will offer satisfactory returns
in the current environment.  Consistent with this strategy, the CSW
System is likely to continue to make additional investments in
energy-related and non-utility businesses and will continue to
search for electric utility companies or other electric utility
properties to acquire.  CSW expects to fund the majority of its
construction expenditures through internally generated funds.
However, for any significant investment or acquisition, additional
funds from the capital markets, including from the issuance and sale
of additional CSW Common and short-term and long-term borrowings,
may be required.

     Construction Expenditures
     The Electric Operating Companies maintain a continuing
construction program, the nature and extent of which is based upon
current and estimated future demands upon the system.  Planned
construction expenditures for the Electric Operating Companies for
the next three years are primarily to improve and expand distribution
facilities and will be funded primarily through internally generated
funds.  These improvements will be required to meet the anticipated
needs of new customers and the growth in the requirements of existing
customers.  Construction expenditures for the Electric Operating
Companies were approximately $398 million in 1995, $492 million in
1994 and $445 million in 1993.  The estimated total construction
expenditures for the Electric Operating Companies for the years 1996
through 1998 are presented in the following CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES
table.

                   CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES

                          $332    $356    $343  $1,031

     Information in the foregoing table is a forward looking
statement and, accordingly, actual results may differ materially
from such projected information due to changes in the underlying
assumptions based on numerous factors, including those factors
enumerated above under Capital Expenditures.  Changes in those and
other factors could cause each of the Electric Operating Companies
to defer or accelerate construction or to sell or buy more power,
which would affect its cash position, revenues and income to an
extent that cannot now be reliably predicted.

     Although CSW does not believe that the Electric Operating
Companies will require substantial additions of generating capacity
through the end of the decade, the CSW System's internal resource
plan presently anticipates that any additional capacity needs will
come from a variety of sources including projected coal- and lignite-
fired generating plants for which the CSW System has invested
approximately $135 million in prior years for plant sites,
engineering studies and lignite reserves.  Should future plans
exclude these plants for environmental, economical  or other
reasons, CSW would evaluate the probability of recovery of these
investments and may record appropriate reserves.

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-13
     Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1995, the capitalization ratios of CSW were
43% common stock equity, 4% preferred stock and 53% long-term debt.
CSW continues to be committed to maintaining financial flexibility
through maintaining a strong capital structure and favorable
securities ratings in order to access capital markets
opportunistically or when required.  The 1995 capitalization ratios
were significantly impacted when compared to 1994 due to the amount
of indebtedness utilized to finance the SEEBOARD acquisition, a
portion of which was repaid on February 28, 1996, with the $398
million net proceeds from the 1996 Stock Offering.

     CSW continually monitors the capital markets for opportunities
to lower its cost of capital through refinancing.  Since 1991, CSW
has refinanced nearly $2.0 billion of outstanding securities and has
lowered its embedded cost of debt from approximately 9.0% to 7.2% at
the end of 1995.  CSW's significant long-term financing activity for
1995 and 1996 through February 29, 1996 is summarized in the
following table.

     on the balance sheet at December 31, 1995.  See SEEBOARD
     Acquisition Financing above.  On February 28, 1996, CSW repaid

     1996 Stock Offering
     On February 27, 1996, CSW sold 15,525,000 shares of CSW Common
in the 1996 Stock Offering and received net proceeds of
approximately $398 million.  These proceeds were used to repay a
portion of the indebtedness incurred by CSW under the CSW Credit
Agreement to fund the acquisition of SEEBOARD.

<PAGE> 2-14
     Shelf Registration Statements
     CSW and the Electric Operating Companies may issue additional
securities subject to market conditions and other factors.  CPL and
PSO have filed shelf registration statements with the SEC for the
issuance of securities from time to time based upon market
conditions.  CPL has shelf registration statements on file for up to
$60 million of FMBs and up to $75 million of  preferred stock.  PSO
has a shelf registration statement on file for the sale of up to $75
million of Senior Notes, $45 million of which was remaining as of
February 29, 1996.

     Short-Term Financing
     The Electric Operating Companies utilize short-term debt to
meet fluctuations in working capital requirements due to the
seasonal nature of electric sales and other interim capital needs.
The CSW System has established a money pool to coordinate short-term
borrowings by the Electric Operating Companies, Transok and CSW
Services, which is funded through CSW's issuance of commercial
paper.  At December 31, 1995, the CSW System had two credit
facilities in place aggregating $1.2 billion to back up the CSW
commercial paper program.

     During 1995, the maximum amount of consolidated short-term debt
outstanding for the CSW System was $1.65 billion in March 1995,
which represented 22% of the total capitalization at December 31,
1995.  The average amount of short-term debt during 1995 was $1.47
billion, of which $667 million was attributable to CSW Credit.  The
weighted average cost of short-term debt was 6.64% in 1995.

     PowerShare
     CSW's PowerShare plan is available to all CSW shareholders,
employees, eligible retirees, utility customers and other residents
of the four states where the Electric Operating Companies operate.
Under this dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan,
participants are able to make optional cash payments and reinvest all
or any portion of their dividends in additional CSW Common.

     In February 1996, CSW filed a registration statement with the
SEC relating (i) to the issue and sale of an additional five million
shares of CSW Common through the PowerShare plan and (ii) proposed
amendments to the plan that would, among other things, make the plan
available to the residents of all fifty states and the District of
Columbia.  During 1995 and 1994, CSW raised approximately $57 million
and $50 million, respectively, in new equity through PowerShare.  CSW
expects to use the proceeds from sales of CSW Common made pursuant to
PowerShare to reduce short-term and long-term debt and for other
general corporate purposes.

     ThriftPlus Plan
     CSW's ThriftPlus plan permits eligible employees to contribute
up to 12% of their annual compensation to the plan, subject to
certain exceptions.  Funds contributed to the plan are invested by
the plan trustee, at the employee's direction, in any of five
investment options, including an option consisting of CSW Common.
Historically, funds allocated to the CSW Common option under the plan
have been used by the trustee to purchase shares of CSW Common in the
open market.  In order to provide the plan with the flexibility to
acquire shares of CSW Common directly from CSW rather than on the
open market, CSW filed a registration statement with the SEC during
1995 with respect to the issue and sale of up to an additional five
million shares of CSW Common.  In the event the ThriftPlus plan
trustee elects, on behalf of the plan, to purchase CSW Common
directly from CSW, CSW expects to use the proceeds from such sales to
reduce short-term and long-term debt and for other general corporate
purposes.

     Internally Generated Funds
     Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  The Electric
Operating Companies utilize short-term debt to meet fluctuations in

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-15
working capital requirements due to the seasonal nature of energy

     CSW Energy
     At December 31, 1995, CSW had loaned $66 million to CSW Energy
on an interim basis for the purpose of developing and constructing
independent power and cogeneration facilities.  Repayment of these
amounts to CSW is expected to be made through funds obtained from
third party non-recourse  project financing.  During 1995, CSW
Energy secured such financing for its Ft. Lupton and Mulberry
projects and reimbursed CSW for the interim loans.  In addition to
the amounts already expended for the development of projects, CSW
Energy has, subject to certain limitations in the case of EWG and
foreign utility investments, authority from the SEC to expend up to
$250 million on future projects.  The following table summarizes
CSW's investments and commitments in CSW Energy projects at December
31, 1995.

     CSW Energy through CSW Development-I, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of CSW Energy, entered into a fixed price contract of $14
million to construct the Mulberry thermal host.  At November 2, 1995,
the thermal host was substantially completed for an aggregate cost of
approximately $43 million and CSW Energy reached an agreement and
settlement with its business partner regarding the $29 million cost
overruns for the host facility.  These negotiations also resulted in
a change in the business partner for the Mulberry and Orange
Cogeneration projects.  Under the terms of the settlement, the newly
admitted partner paid to CSW Energy 50%, or $53.2 million, of the
outstanding obligations of Orange Cogeneration and assumed 50%, or
$2.3 million, of the letters of credit and guarantees of the project.
Concurrently, CSW Energy contributed as partners capital the
remaining debt of $53.2 million to Orange Cogeneration.  On the same
date, CSW Energy obtained its term financing for the Mulberry
project.

     CSW Credit
     CSW Credit purchases, without recourse, the accounts receivable
of the Operating Companies and certain non-affiliated electric
companies.  CSW Credit's capital structure contains greater leverage
than that of the Operating Companies, consequently lowering CSW's
cost of capital.  CSW Credit issues commercial paper, secured by the
assignment of its receivables, to meet its financing needs.  CSW
Credit maintains a secured revolving credit agreement which
aggregated $900 million at December 31, 1995 to back up its
commercial paper program.  The sale of these accounts receivables
provides the Operating Companies with cash immediately, thereby
reducing working capital needs and revenue requirements.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS

     Competition and Industry Challenges
     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting the CSW System and electric utilities generally.
Increased competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex
economic, political and technological factors.  These factors have
resulted in legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely
to result in even greater competition at both the wholesale and
retail level in the future.  As competition in the industry
increases, the Electric Operating Companies will have the
opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at risk of
losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, the Electric
Operating Companies will continue to compete with suppliers of
alternative forms of energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal,
some of which may be cheaper than electricity.  The Electric
Operating Companies believe that their prices for electricity and
the quality and reliability of their service currently place them in
a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

     The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy
Policy Act creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding
Company Act and permits utilities, including registered utility
holding companies and non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are
a new category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are
free from most federal and state regulation, including the principal
restrictions of the Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable
broader participation in wholesale power markets by reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act
also allows the FERC, on a case-by-case basis and with certain
restrictions, to order wholesale transmission access and to order
electric utilities to enlarge their transmission systems.  A FERC
order requiring a transmitting utility to provide wholesale
transmission service must include provisions generally that permit
the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services and any
enlargement of the transmission system and associated services.
Wholesale energy markets, including the market for wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment
of the Energy Policy Act.  The Electric Operating Companies must
compete in the wholesale energy markets with other public utilities,
cogenerators, qualifying facilities, EWGs and others for sales of
electric power.  While CSW believes that the Energy Policy Act will
continue to make the wholesale markets more competitive, CSW is
unable to predict the extent to which the Energy Policy Act will
impact CSW System operations.

     On March 29, 1995, consistent with the direction of the Energy
Policy Act, the FERC announced in a NOPR a requirement that each
public utility that owns and controls transmission facilities in
interstate commerce must unbundle its services and file open access
transmission tariffs under which such utility will offer comparable
open access transmission services to its transmission customers.  In
addition, the FERC revised its proposed mechanisms by which utilities
will be permitted to recover stranded investment costs expected to be
brought about by the proposed changes.  On August 7, 1995, CSW filed
comments on the proposed approach in the NOPR with the FERC.
Although CSW supports the concept of comparable open access for the
nation's transmission service, CSW believes that certain changes must
be made in the FERC's proposed approach of implementing the open
transmission system.  First, with respect to the issue of stranded
investments, the FERC proposed that customers who left the utility
company pay for a portion, but not all, of the costs incurred by the
owner of existing facilities that are not utilized as a result of the
loss of such customers. CSW raised concerns about the FERC's proposed
methodology for addressing stranded investment because it did not, in
CSW's view, provide for the fair recovery of the full amount
previously invested.  Second, CSW proposed that the FERC adopt a
"power flow pricing" approach whereby all electric systems that incur
costs because of a transmission transaction are compensated, as
opposed to the traditional "postage stamp" method whereby only the
companies that are directly involved in the actual purchase and sale
of the electricity are compensated or charged.


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-17
     On February 9, 1996, the Electric Operating Companies filed at
the FERC complete sets of open access transmission tariffs for both
the companies that are members of the Southwest Power Pool as well as
the companies that are members of ERCOT.  These tariffs substantially
reflect the pro forma tariffs attached to the FERC's March 29, 1995
NOPR.  Open access and market pricing should increase marketing
opportunities for the Electric Operating Companies, but may also
expose them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues due to
competition with alternate suppliers.

     Increasing competition in the utility industry brings an
increased need to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail regulatory
environment is beginning to shift from traditional rate base
regulation to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and performance-
based plans encourage efficiencies and increased productivity while
permitting utilities to share in the results.  Retail wheeling, a
major industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel" or move
power from third parties to their own retail customers, is evolving
gradually.  Many states throughout the country currently have
preliminary legislation introduced to investigate the issue.  For
example, in Oklahoma (portions of which are served by PSO), a
legislative task force is examining state laws affecting retail
electric companies.  Issues being addressed include retail wheeling,
territorial boundaries, taxes and condemnations.

     CSW believes that retail competition would harm the best
interests of CSW's and the Electric Operating Companies' customers
and security holders unless CSW receives fair recovery of the full
amounts previously invested to finance power plants.  These
investments, which were reasonably incurred, were made by the CSW
System to meet their obligation to serve the public interest,
necessity and convenience.  This obligation has existed for nearly a
century and remains in force under current law.  CSW intends to
strongly oppose attempts to impose retail competition without just
compensation for the risks and investments CSW undertook to serve
the public's demand for electricity.

     CSW is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or the CSW
System.  As the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more
competitive, however, the principal factor determining success is
likely to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability,
availability of capacity, and customer service.

     PURA
     Amendments to PURA, the legal foundation of electric regulation
in Texas, became effective on September 1, 1995.  Among other things,
the amendments deregulate the wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT,
permit pricing flexibility for utilities facing competitive
challenges, provide for a market-driven integrated resource planning
process and mandate comparable open access transmission service.

     PURA also requires that the Texas Commission adopt a rule on
comparable open transmission access by March 1, 1996.  In
conjunction with this rulemaking proceeding (Project No. 14045),
Texas Commission Chairman Pat Wood issued a proposal on September 6,
1995, for the purpose of maximizing competition in the ERCOT
wholesale bulk power market.  The proposal calls for the functional
unbundling of integrated utilities where distribution entities could
purchase their power requirements from any generator or set of
generators in ERCOT.  Those generators which are currently regulated
would be deregulated after provisions are in place to recover
stranded costs.  The proposal has been assigned to a separate
proceeding (Project No. 15000).  CSW expects this project to provide
the vehicle for the Texas Commission and other interested parties to
develop positions on industry restructuring before the Texas
Legislature convenes in January 1997.  A schedule has been developed
for Project No. 15000 that includes a series of workshops and
technical conferences during the first half of 1996.  The schedule
contemplates that the Texas Commission will develop legislative
recommendations on restructuring and stranded costs during the
second half of 1996.

     On February 7, 1996, the Texas Commission adopted a rule
governing transmission access and pricing (Project No. 14045).  The
pricing method tentatively adopted by the Texas Commission is a
hybrid combination of an ERCOT-wide postage stamp rate covering 70%
of total ERCOT transmission costs and a distance-sensitive component

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-18
referred to as a vector-absolute megawatt mile which recovers the
remaining 30% of ERCOT transmission costs.  Although the open access
tariffs filed with the FERC on February 9, 1996 do not reflect
Project No. 14045 pricing, CSW anticipates filing tariffs with the
FERC that do conform to the Texas Commission's rule in the second
quarter of 1996.

     Regulatory Accounting
     Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS
No. 71, which allows for the recognition and recovery of regulatory
assets, the Electric Operating Companies have recognized significant
regulatory assets and liabilities.  Management believes that the
Electric Operating Companies will continue to meet the criteria for
following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event the Electric Operating
Companies no longer meet the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a
write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.
For additional information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made
to NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

     Holding Company Act
     The Holding Company Act generally has been construed to limit
the operations of a registered holding company to a single
integrated public utility system, plus such additional businesses as
are functionally related to such system.  Among other things, the
Holding Company Act requires CSW and its subsidiaries to seek prior
SEC approval before effecting mergers and acquisitions or pursuing
other types of non-utility initiatives.  Pervasive regulation under
the Holding Company Act may impede or delay CSW's efforts to achieve
its strategic and operating objectives, including its pursuit of non-
utility initiatives.  During 1995, a bill was introduced in the
United States Senate which, if adopted, would repeal the Holding
Company Act and replace it with a new, less restrictive, holding
company law administered by the FERC.  CSW cannot predict if or when
Holding Company Act repeal legislation will be enacted or what form
such legislation will take if adopted.  However, CSW intends to
continue its efforts to repeal or modify the Holding Company Act in
order to provide the flexibility to compete within the changing
environment.

     Consolidated Taxes
     Prior to 1992, the Texas Commission allowed income taxes to be
recovered in rates based on the federal income tax incurred by a
utility as if it were a stand-alone company.  This "stand-alone"
approach treated the regulated activities of a utility as a separate
entity and considered only those revenues and expenses that are
included in the utility's cost of service to calculate the federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.  However, in 1992 the
Texas Commission changed its method of calculating the federal income
tax component of rates to the "actual tax approach."  This approach
reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions which are not
considered for or included in setting rates for the utility.

     On April 13, 1995, the Supreme Court issued a decision which
holds that the Texas Commission is not required to use the tax
benefits associated with the losses of unregulated affiliates to
reduce tax expense in cost of service.  The Supreme Court also ruled
that the Texas Commission cannot include the income tax deductions
taken by the utility for disallowed expenses when determining the
utility's federal income tax liability.  This decision will allow
CSW, and indirectly its shareholders, to retain the tax benefits
associated with disallowed expenditures.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of the CSW System, like those of other utility
systems, generally involve the use and disposal of substances
subject to environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law,
addresses the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-19
Legally, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of
a cleanup.  Usually, however, cleanup costs are allocated among
PRPs.

     The Electric Operating Companies are subject to various pending
claims alleging that they are PRPs under federal or state remedial
laws for investigating and cleaning up contaminated property.  CSW
anticipates that resolution of these claims, individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on CSW's or any
Electric Operating Company's results of operations or financial
condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ from
site to site, factors that are the basis for the expectation for
specific sites include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly
contributed by the Electric Operating Company, the estimated amount
of costs allocated to the Electric Operating Company and the
participation of other parties.  See ITEM 1-.  BUSINESS, NOTE 2.
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS and NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for additional discussion regarding
environmental matters.


NON-UTILITY INITIATIVES

     As indicated above, one component of CSW's four-part strategy
to meet the increasing competition and fundamental changes in the
electric utility industry is to expand CSW's non-utility and energy-
related business.  While CSW believes that such initiatives are
necessary to maintain its competitiveness and to supplement its
growth in the future, the Holding Company Act may impede or delay
its ability to successfully pursue such initiatives.  See RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS above.

     Transok
     Transok is an intrastate natural gas gathering, transmission,
marketing and processing company that provides natural gas services
to CSW System companies, predominately PSO, and to non-affiliated
gas customers throughout the United States.  Transok's natural gas
facilities are located in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas.  It
operates gas processing plants and markets natural gas liquids
produced from those plants to various markets.  During 1995, a new
processing plant was completed that increased Transok's processing
capacity by approximately 27%.  In addition, during the second
quarter of 1996, two new natural gas compression units are scheduled
to be completed.  These units will increase Transok's west to east
transport capacity by approximately 22%.

     In January 1996, CSW announced it was exploring strategic
alternatives for its investment in Transok.  The alternatives, which
include a possible sale, are a part of CSW's ongoing strategic
review of its business.

     CSW Energy
     CSW Energy is authorized to develop various independent power
and cogeneration facilities and to own and operate such non-utility
projects, subject to regulatory approval.  The table below summarizes
CSW Energy's participation in projects as of the end of 1995.

     In addition to these projects, CSW Energy has another six
projects totaling approximately 2,000 MW in various stages of
development, mostly in affiliation with other developers.

     CSW International
     CSW International was formed in 1994 to engage in international
activities, including developing, acquiring, financing and owning
EWGs and foreign utility companies.  CSW International's most
significant activity to date is the acquisition, indirectly through
CSW (UK), of the outstanding share capital of SEEBOARD pursuant to
the Tender Offer. See SEEBOARD ACQUISITION above.  CSW International
also intends to continue its efforts in Mexico, with a stated goal
of participating in providing Mexico's future electricity needs.
Although the recent devaluation of the Mexican peso has slowed
previously projected power demand, CSW International continues to
believe that the geographic location of the CSW System offers
opportunities to provide bulk power to Mexico.  CSW International
continues to seek to expand into other countries in Latin America,
Europe and Asia that meet its investment criteria.

     CSW Communications
     CSW Communications was formed in 1994 to provide communication
services to the Electric Operating Companies and non-affiliates.
One important goal of CSW Communications is to enhance services to
CSW System customers through fiber optics and other
telecommunications technologies.  In Laredo, Texas, a project has
been undertaken to install fiber optic lines and coaxial cable to
CPL customers.  The project, a network of over 3,000 homes with
approximately 700 customers currently participating, will
demonstrate the energy efficiency and cost savings that result from
giving customers greater choice and control over their electric
service.  CSW Communications offers similar utility management
services to other parties, including affiliates as well as non-
affiliates.  In the future, CSW Communications may, subject to any
required regulatory approvals, seek to lease or otherwise use the
reserve capacity for other services including telephone service,
cable television and home security systems.  CSW Communications
presently owns and manages a 185 mile fiber-optic line connecting
the south Texas cities of Corpus Christi, Harlingen and McAllen, and
anticipates the construction of another fiber-optic line, connecting
Shreveport, Louisiana and Longview, Texas, to begin in mid-1996.

     CSW Communications filed for "exempt telecommunications
company" status with the FCC on February 8, 1996, subsequent to
legislation that introduced competition to telephone and other
communications industries that operated within regulated
environments.  The filing with the FCC automatically qualifies CSW
Communications as an exempt telecommunications company, pending the
FCC's review of the application (which is required to be completed
within 60 days).  CSW believes that CSW Communications' exempt
telecommunications company status will enable it to compete more
effectively with other telecommunications companies.

     EnerShop
     In September 1995, EnerShop was formed to provide energy
services to customers throughout the Southwest.  EnerShop offers
services that help reduce customers' operating costs through
increased energy efficiencies and improved equipment operations.
EnerShop utilizes the skills of local trade allies in offering
services that include energy and facility analysis, project
management, engineering design and equipment procurement and
construction, third party financing and equipment leasing, savings
and performance guarantees and performance monitoring.  EnerShop
recently secured its first major contract and has bids outstanding
for several additional projects in 1996.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     SFAS No. 121
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121 to be effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The statement establishes a two-fold test for identification
and quantification of an impaired asset.  The first test in
determining an impairment is to compare the sum of expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) related to an
asset to the carrying amount of the asset.  If the sum of expected
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
asset, then an impairment is recognized.  Once an impairment is
identified, the second part of the test is applied to quantify the
amount of the impairment.  The statement lists several alternative
methods of establishing fair market value and quantifying the
impairment.  Cash flows used to measure possible impairment of an
asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets.  For the Electric Operating
Companies, the lowest independently identifiable cash flow level
used for this analysis is jurisdictional rates charged to customers.

     CSW will adopt SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.
Under the current regulatory environment, CSW does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 121 to have a significant impact on CSW's
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  However,
future developments in the electric industry and utility regulation
could jeopardize the full recovery of the carrying cost of certain
investments.  Consequently, CSW is monitoring the changing
conditions facing the electric utility industry.

     SFAS No. 123
     SFAS No. 123 was issued in October 1995 with an effective date
for transactions entered into after December 15, 1995.  This
statement requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions where such value
cannot otherwise be determined, but then allows for two alternative
methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current
period.  The alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the
compensation cost, without charging the amount against current
earnings.

     As provided by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, CSW will
continue to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and adopt the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 in 1996.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not
impact CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of Results

     CSW's earnings increased to $402 million or $2.10 per share in
1995 as compared to $394 million or $2.08 per share in 1994 and $308
million or $1.63 per share in 1993.  The return on average common
stock equity was 13.1% in 1995 compared to 13.4% in 1994 and 10.6%
in 1993.  Electric operations contributed approximately 105% of
total earnings in 1995 and approximately 100% of total earnings in
1994 and 1993.  In 1995, corporate expenses, including $42 million
of expenses related to the termination of the El Paso Merger, were
offset in part by earnings at Transok, CSW Energy, SEEBOARD and CSW
Credit, totaling $51 million in the aggregate.

     Earnings increased in 1995 compared to 1994 due primarily to
higher electric revenues from customer growth and increased usage
and lower operation and maintenance expenses.  In addition, earnings
from SEEBOARD contributed to the increase.  Partially offsetting
these factors were higher depreciation and interest and lower
earnings from Mirror CWIP.  Significant one time items impacting
1995 earnings are set forth in the SIGNIFICANT ITEMS table.

     Earnings increased in 1994 compared to 1993 due primarily to
higher KWH sales and natural gas margins and decreased costs
associated with the end of the outage at STP.  In addition, CSW
Energy, which had three projects become operational during 1994,
contributed $2 million to earnings in 1994.  These items were
partially offset by increased interest and depreciation and
amortization expense.  In addition, earnings in 1993 were
significantly affected by several items set forth in the SIGNIFICANT
ITEMS table.

     Electric Revenues
     Electric revenues decreased $182 million or 6% in 1995 compared
to 1994.  The acquisition of SEEBOARD contributed $208 million in
revenues for the month of December 1995 and total U.S. Electric KWH
sales increased approximately 5%, with increases in sales among all
customer classes.  During 1995, the average number of customers
increased approximately 2%.  In addition to customer growth, there
was increased usage during 1995 as compared to 1994.  However,
offsetting the increases in revenue due to SEEBOARD and increased
KWH sales were customer refunds made by CPL and WTU resulting from
the resolution of rate proceedings during 1995 and lower fuel costs.

     Electric revenues increased $10 million in 1994 as compared to
1993 due primarily to increased KWH sales offset in part by
decreased fuel revenues.  Base rates increased in 1994 from 1993 due
to a rate increase implemented by PSO in February 1994, offset in
part by a 3.2% interim rate reduction implemented by WTU during the
fourth quarter of 1994.

     The percentage changes in U.S. ElectricUtility KWH sales from
the previous year for 1995 and 1994 are presented in the U.S.
ELECTRIC KWH SALES VARIANCE table.  KWH sales to retail customers
increased in 1995 as a result of increased customer usage and
customer growth.  KWH sales to retail customers in 1994 increased as
a result of more favorable weather and increased residential
customers.  SWEPCO acquired BREMCO in July 1993, and accordingly,
there were twelve months of KWH sales to these customers in 1994
compared to only six months in 1993.  Weather was more favorable in
1994 than in 1993.

                    Total sales           4.5       5.5

     The continued increases in industrial sales over the last two
years reflect the increased marketing efforts by the Electric
Operating Companies and the continued improvement in the economy
throughout their service areas.  Sales for resale increased in 1995
because STP was operational for the full year as compared to most of
1994, thereby eliminating the need for plants in the CSW System to
produce power to replace the power normally produced at STP.  In
addition, during 1995, WTU began supplying a major new wholesale

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-24
customer.  The Electric Operating Companies have maintained
relatively low competitive rates in an increasingly competitive
marketplace.  Efforts have increased at each of the Electric
Operating Companies to attract new customers while efficiently
serving all customers.

     Natural Gas Revenues
     Revenues from natural gas increased 14% to $592 million in 1995
from $518 million in 1994 due primarily to an increase in natural
gas sales volumes which was partially offset by a reduction in sales
prices.  Also contributing to the increase in 1995 natural gas
revenues were increased natural gas liquids sales volumes and
prices.  The 14% decrease in revenues in 1994 from $603 million in
1993 was due to a decrease in natural gas prices which was partially
offset by an increase in volumes.

     Other Diversified Revenues
     Other diversified revenues increased 30% to $52 million in 1995
as compared to $40 million in 1994 due primarily to two CSW Energy
projects that went into operation during the second and third
quarter of 1994 and increased factoring revenues at CSW Credit.
Other diversified revenues increased 38% in 1994 from $29 million in
1993 due to the reclassification of CSW Energy's operating revenues
as discussed below under Other Income and Deductions.

     Revenues from SEEBOARD
     CSW's operating revenues includes $208 million of revenues from
SEEBOARD for the month of December 1995.  During the month of
December 1995, pursuant to its effective control of SEEBOARD through
its 76.45% ownership interest, CSW began full consolidation
accounting for SEEBOARD in its consolidated financial statements.

Operating Expenses

     Fuel and Purchased Power Expense
     During 1995, the Electric Operating Companies generated
approximately 98% of their electric energy requirements.  During
1994 and 1993, they generated 95% and 92%, respectively.  Total fuel
and purchased power expenses increased $58 million or 5% from 1994,
due primarily to SEEBOARD's December 1995 power purchases.  Without
including such purchases, total  fuel and purchased power decreased
$116 million during 1995 due mainly to a decrease in natural gas
prices and an increased usage of lower cost nuclear fuel.  The
average unit cost of fuel was $1.58 per MMbtu during 1995, compared
to $1.82 in 1994 and $2.11 in 1993.  Purchased power decreased $8
million during 1995 due primarily to increased generation from STP
which replaced power that had been purchased during the first six
months of 1994 when STP was out of service.  During 1995 STP was
operational for the entire year allowing the use of lower cost
nuclear fuel.  The decrease in fuel and purchased power expense in
1994 compared to 1993 was attributable to a decrease in fossil fuel
costs and increased usage of lower cost nuclear fuel.

     Gas Purchased for Resale/Gas Extraction and Marketing
     Gas purchased for resale increased 20% in 1995 from 1994, while
it decreased 27% in 1994 from 1993.  The increase in 1995 was caused
by higher sales volumes, which more than offset the relatively low
average cost of gas which prevailed during 1995 compared to 1994.
Lower gas prices caused the decrease in 1994, including a
significant reduction in prices attributable to sales made on
natural gas drawn from storage.  Gas extraction and marketing
expenses increased 11% in 1995 from 1994 and 14% in 1994 from 1993.
The 1995 and 1994 increases were both due to increases in natural
gas liquids purchased for resale.

     Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses and Taxes
     Other operating and maintenance expenses in 1995 increased $18
million or 2% from 1994 due primarily to the establishment of a $42
million reserve for expenses incurred in association with the
terminated El Paso Merger and the inclusion of SEEBOARD's December
1995 operating and maintenance expenses, offset in part by the

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-25
benefits that were realized from a cost-reduction initiative whereby
CSW System employees received a portion of the operating and
maintenance expense savings.  In 1994, the 2% decrease in other
operating and maintenance expenses from 1993 was due primarily to
the absence of $29 million in maintenance expenses that were
incurred during the 1993 STP outages, expenses associated with the
1993 adoption of SFAS No. 106 and reserves taken in 1993 on fuel and
other properties, offset in part by the reclassification of CSW
Energy's operating costs as discussed below under Other Income and
Deductions.

     Income taxes were lower in 1995 than 1994 due to prior year
adjustments, the reserve established in connection with the
termination of the El Paso Merger as well as both the  tax
adjustments and the tax effects of  the CPL 1995 Agreement and the
WTU Stipulation and Agreement.  In 1994, income taxes were higher
than 1993 due to higher pre-tax income.  Taxes other than income
decreased in 1995 due to prior year adjustments but remained
approximately the same in 1994 as in 1993.

     Restructuring Charges
     Restructuring charges reflect the original accrual of $97
million in 1993, which was subsequently reduced by $9 million in
1994 and $2 million in 1995.  In addition, during 1995, $34 million
in regulatory assets were capitalized in accordance with the CPL
1995 Agreement and the WTU Stipulation and Agreement for costs
associated with the restructuring that had previously been charged
to expense.

     Depreciation and Amortization
     Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 1995 and
1994 when compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in
depreciable plant.

Other Items

     Other Income and Deductions
     Other income and deductions decreased $12 million or 11% in
1995 compared to 1994, as a result of decreased Mirror CWIP
liability amortization offset in part by approximately $11 million
in previously deferred factoring income recognized as income by CPL
beginning in 1995 pursuant to the CPL 1995 Agreement, increased
interest income of $4 million and a $3 million gain on PSO's sale of
non-utility fiber optic telecommunication property.

     Other income and deductions increased $18 million or 19% in
1994 compared to 1993 as a result of the reclassification of CSW
Energy's operating activities offset partially by decreased Mirror
CWIP liability amortization and the absence of adjustments recorded
in 1993 associated with Transok's 1991 acquisition of TEX/CON.
Prior to 1994, CSW Energy was in the developmental stage of its
business and, as a result, its operating activities were classified
in CSW's Other Income and Deductions.  However, in conjunction with
the completion of three projects in 1994, CSW Energy's revenues and
expenses were classified as operating activities in CSW's Operating
Revenues and Other Operating Expenses.  The net amount of these
components had negative earnings impacts classified in Other Income
and Deductions in 1993.

     Interest Charges
     Interest expense on long-term debt increased 30% in 1995 from
1994 due to higher levels of debt outstanding, whereas interest
expense on long-term debt in 1994 was comparable to 1993.  CSW's
embedded cost of long-term debt decreased to 7.2% in 1995 from 7.7%
in 1994.  Short-term interest expense increased in 1994 due
primarily to higher short-term interest rates combined with higher
general corporate borrowings.

     Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
     In 1993, CSW implemented SFAS No. 112, SFAS No. 109, and
changed the method of accounting for unbilled revenues.  These
changes had a cumulative effect of increasing net income
approximately $46 million.



<PAGE> 2-26
     Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the national Consumer
Price Index, have averaged approximately 2.8% during the three years
ended December 31, 1995.  Management believes that inflation, at
this level, does not materially affect CSW's consolidated results of
operations or financial position.  However, under existing
regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is
recoverable from customers.  As a result, cash flows designed to
provide recovery of historical plant costs may not be adequate to
replace plant in future years.

CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEST CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       Nature of Operations
       CSW is a registered holding company under the Holding
  Company Act subject to regulation by the SEC.  CSW's four Electric
  Operating Companies are also regulated by the SEC under the
  Holding Company Act.

       The principal business of CSW's four Electric Operating
  Companies, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU, is the generation,
  transmission, and distribution of electric power and energy.
  These four companies are subject to regulation by the FERC under
  the Federal Power Act and follow the Uniform System of Accounts
  prescribed by the FERC.  They are subject to further regulation
  with regard to rates and other matters by state regulatory
  commissions as follows: CPL and WTU are subject to the Texas
  Commission; PSO is subject to the Oklahoma Commission; and SWEPCO
  is subject to the Arkansas Commission, Louisiana Commission,
  Oklahoma Commission and the Texas Commission.

       The principal business of CSW's United Kingdom electric
  operating subsidiary, SEEBOARD, is the distribution of electric
  power and energy in southeast England.  SEEBOARD is subject to
  regulation of rates by the United Kingdom Office of Electricity
  Regulation.

       In addition to the electric utility operations, CSW has
  subsidiaries involved in a variety of business activities.
  Transok is an Oklahoma natural gas company, CSW Energy and CSW
  International pursue cogeneration and other energy-related
  ventures, CSW Credit purchases the accounts receivable of
  affiliates and non-affiliates, CSW Communications pursues
  telecommunications projects, CSW Leasing invests in leveraged
  leases and EnerShop offers energy-management services.

       The more significant accounting policies of the CSW System
  are summarized below:

       Principles of Consolidation
       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
  of CSW and its subsidiary companies.  The consolidated financial
  statements for PSO include the accounts of its wholly owned
  subsidiary, Ash Creek.  All significant intercompany items and
  transactions system have been eliminated.

       Use of Estimates
       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
  generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
  liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported
  amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       Fixed Assets
       Electric fixed assets are stated at the original cost of
  construction, which includes the cost of contracted services,
  direct labor, materials, overhead items and allowances for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.  SEEBOARD's
  fixed assets are stated at fair market value based on the
  preliminary allocation of the purchase price CSW paid for
  SEEBOARD.  Transok's gas plant acquisitions are stated at fair
  market value based on the purchase price while other gas plant is
  stated at original cost of construction, which includes the cost
  of contracted services, direct labor, materials, overhead items


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-33
  and capitalized interest.  See SEEBOARD Acquisition below for
  additional information, including the allocation of purchase price
  to the SEEBOARD Group's fixed asset accounts.

       Depreciation
       Provisions for depreciation of plant are computed using the
  straight-line method, generally at individual rates applied to the
  various classes of depreciable property.  The annual average
  consolidated composite rates are presented in the following table.

                        CSW     CPL      PSO    SWEPCO    WTU

           1995         3.4%    2.9%     3.6%    3.2%     3.2%
           1994         3.2%    3.0%     3.5%    3.2%     3.2%
           1993         3.2%    3.0%     3.5%    3.2%     3.2%

       CPL Nuclear Decommissioning of the STP Plant
       At the end of STP's service life, decommissioning is
  expected to be accomplished using the decontamination method,
  which is one of the techniques acceptable to the NRC.  Using this
  method, the decontamination activities occur as soon as possible
  after the end of plant operations.  Contaminated equipment is
  cleaned and removed to a permanent disposal location, and the site
  is generally returned to its pre-plant state.

       CPL's decommissioning costs are accrued and funded to an
  external trust over the expected service life of the STP units.
  The existing NRC operating licenses will allow the operation of
  STP Unit 1 until 2027 and Unit 2 until  2028.  The accrual for
  decommissioning costs is an annual level cost based on the
  estimated future cost to decommission STP, including escalations
  for expected inflation to the expected time of decommissioning,
  and is net of expected earnings on the trust fund.

       CPL's portion of the costs of decommissioning STP were
  estimated to be $85 million in 1986 dollars based on a site
  specific study completed in 1986.  CPL is recovering these
  decommissioning costs through rates based on the service life of
  STP at a rate of $4.2 million per year.  The $4.2 million annual
  cost of decommissioning is reflected on the income statement in
  other operating expense.  Decommissioning costs are paid to an
  irrevocable external trust and as such are not reflected on CPL's
  balance sheet.  At December 31, 1995, the trust balance was $28.0
  million.

       In August 1995, CPL received a new decommissioning study
  updating the cost estimates to decommission STP that indicated
  that CPL's share of such costs would increase from $85 million, as
  stated in 1986 dollars, to $258 million, as stated in 1995
  dollars.  The increase in costs occurred primarily as a result of
  extended on-site storage of high level waste, much higher
  estimates of low-level waste disposal costs and increased labor
  costs since the prior study.  These costs are expected to be
  incurred during the years 2027 through 2062.  While this is the
  best estimate available at this time, these costs may change
  between now and when the funds are actually expended because of
  changes in the assumptions used to derive the estimates, including
  the prices of the goods and services required to accomplish the
  decommissioning.  Additional studies will be completed
  periodically to update this information.

       Based on this projected cost to decommission STP, CPL
  estimates that its annual funding level should increase to $10.5
  million.  CPL has requested this amount as part of its cost of
  service in its current rate filing.  Other parties to the
  proceeding have filed annual projections ranging from $1.4 million
  to $8.2 million.  CPL expects to fund at the level ultimately
  ordered by the Texas Commission although CPL cannot predict that
  level.  Historically, the Texas Commission has allowed full
  recovery of nuclear decommissioning costs.  For further
  information on CPL's current rate filing, see NOTE 2. LITIGATION
  AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

       Electric Revenues and Fuel
       Prior to 1993, electric revenues were recorded at the time
  billings were made to customers on a cycle-billing basis.
  Electric service provided subsequent to billing dates through the
  end of each calendar month became part of operating revenues of
  the next month.  To conform to general industry standards, the
  Electric Operating Companies changed their method of accounting to
  accrue for estimated unbilled revenues.  The effect of this change
  on 1993 net income was pre-tax increase of $75 million, and an
  after-tax increase of $49 million, included in cumulative effect
  of changes in accounting principles.  See the effects of this
  change under Accounting Changes below.

       CPL, SWEPCO and WTU recover fuel costs in Texas as a fixed
  component of base rates whereby over-recoveries of fuel are
  payable to customers and under-recoveries may be billed to
  customers after Texas Commission approval.  The cost of fuel is
  charged to expense as consumed.  PSO recovers fuel costs in
  Oklahoma and SWEPCO recovers fuel costs in Arkansas and Louisiana
  through automatic fuel recovery mechanisms.  The application of
  these mechanisms varies by jurisdiction.  See NOTE 2. LITIGATION
  AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, for further information about fuel
  recovery.

       CPL, PSO and WTU recover fuel costs applicable to wholesale
  customers, which are regulated by the FERC, through an automatic
  fuel adjustment clause.  SWEPCO recovers fuel costs applicable to
  wholesale customers through formula rates.

       CPL amortizes direct nuclear fuel costs to fuel expense on
  the basis of a ratio of the estimated energy used in the core to
  the energy expected to be derived from such fuel assembly over its
  life in the core.  In addition to fuel amortization, CPL also
  records nuclear fuel expense as a result of other items, including
  spent fuel disposal fees assessed on the basis of net KWHs sold
  from STP and DOE special assessment fees for decontamination and
  decommissioning of the enrichment facilities on the basis of prior
  usage of enrichment services.

       Accounts Receivable
       CSW Credit, as a wholly owned subsidiary of CSW, purchases,
  without recourse, the billed and unbilled accounts receivable of
  the Electric Operating Companies, Transok and certain non-
  affiliated companies.

       Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
       For their regulated activities, each of the Electric Operating
  Companies follows SFAS No. 71, which defines the criteria for
  establishing regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.
  Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue to the company
  associated with certain costs which will be recovered from customers
  through the ratemaking process.  Regulatory liabilities represent
  probable future refunds to customers.  The significant regulatory
  assets and liabilities that have been recorded by the CSW System are
  presented in the following table.

       Deferred Plant Costs at CPL and WTU
       In accordance with orders of the Texas Commission, CPL and
  WTU deferred carrying costs, as well as operating, depreciation
  and tax costs incurred for STP and Oklaunion, respectively.  These
  deferrals were for the period beginning on the date when the
  plants began commercial operation until the date the plants were
  included in rate base.  CPL is amortizing and recovering these
  deferred costs through rates over the life of the plant.  WTU is
  amortizing and recovering such costs over seven years.  See NOTE
  2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, for further discussion
  of the deferred accounting proceedings.

       CPL Mirror CWIP
       In accordance with Texas Commission orders, CPL previously
  recorded a Mirror CWIP asset, which is being amortized over the
  life of STP.  For further information regarding Mirror CWIP,
  reference is made to NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
  PROCEEDINGS.

       SEEBOARD Acquisition
       The acquisition of SEEBOARD was accounted for as a purchase
  combination.  A preliminary allocation of the purchase price has
  been performed and is reflected in the consolidated financial
  statements.  This includes an allocation of approximately $1.0
  billion to goodwill at December 31, 1995, which will increase to
  approximately $1.4 billion when CSW reaches its eventual 100%
  ownership interest in SEEBOARD.  While the allocation of the
  purchase price may be revised at a later date, the goodwill is
  expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
  SEEBOARD's results of operations are included in the consolidated
  CSW results in the following manner.  Equity earnings representing
  the 27.6% CSW ownership interest in SEEBOARD during November 1995
  were recorded in Other Income and Deductions.  During December
  1995, pursuant to its effective control of SEEBOARD through its
  76.45% ownership interest, CSW began full consolidation accounting


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-36
  for SEEBOARD in its consolidated financial statements.  At that
  time, CSW recorded a current liability of approximately $1.0
  billion representing the obligation to purchase the controlled
  shares for which CSW had received acceptances but had not actually
  purchased.

       National Grid Assets Held for Sale
       Pursuant to a December 11, 1995 distribution by SEEBOARD,
  CSW (UK), as a shareholder of SEEBOARD, received 32,492,966 shares
  of National Grid common stock.  At December 31, 1995, the carrying
  value of the National Grid assets held for sale, when converted to
  U.S. dollars, was approximately $100 million.  On February 2,
  1996, all of the shares of National Grid that CSW (UK) held were
  sold.  On February 29, 1996, the proceeds from the sale of the
  National Grid shares were used to repay a portion of the CSW
  Investments Credit Facility.

       Price Risk Management Activities
       Transok periodically uses natural gas futures, options and
  basis swap contracts to manage the impact of price fluctuations on
  its inventory of natural gas, fuel and shrinkage requirements for
  its processing plants and certain fixed price purchase and sales
  contracts.  Such contracts are designated at inception as a hedge
  when there is a direct relationship to the price risk associated
  with Transok's operations.  Gains and losses on hedge contracts
  are deferred until the effect of the corresponding hedged
  transaction is recognized.  For those contracts that are not
  designated as hedges, changes in the fair value of those contracts
  are recognized as gains or losses in income currently and are
  recorded in the balance sheet at fair value at the reporting date.
  Transok determines the fair value of its contracts based upon
  settlement prices for exchange traded contracts, market-related
  indexes or by obtaining quotes from brokers.  Transok's trading
  gains and losses, either from its hedging or its speculative
  trading, did not have a material impact upon CSW's consolidated
  results of operations.  Transok's open trade positions at December
  31, 1995, were not material to CSW's financial position.

       Accounting Changes
       Effective January 1, 1993, the CSW System adopted SFAS No.
  106,  SFAS No. 112 and  SFAS No. 109.  In addition, the Electric
  Operating Companies also changed their method of accounting for
  unbilled revenues.  See Electric Revenues and Fuel above for
  further information regarding the change in method of accounting
  for unbilled revenue.  See NOTE 4. INCOME TAXES for further
  information regarding the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and see NOTE 5.
  BENEFIT PLANS for further information regarding the adoption of
  SFAS No. 106.

       In 1993, the change in accounting for unbilled revenues and
  the adoption of both SFAS No. 109 and SFAS No. 112 were presented
  as a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for CSW
  and the Electric Operating Companies as presented in the following
  table.

2.LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

       Termination of El Paso Merger
       In May 1993, CSW entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to
  which El Paso would emerge from bankruptcy as a wholly owned
  subsidiary of CSW.  El Paso is an electric utility company
  headquartered in El Paso, Texas, which filed a voluntary petition
  for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on
  January 8, 1992.

       On June 9, 1995, CSW notified El Paso that CSW would not
  extend the termination date under the Merger Agreement as had been
  requested by El Paso and, accordingly, that it was terminating the
  Merger Agreement.  CSW also informed El Paso on June 9, 1995, that
  it was withdrawing the Modified Plan for the proposed Merger with
  El Paso by a contemporaneous filing with the United States
  Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin
  Division, before which the El Paso bankruptcy reorganization
  proceeding was pending.

       On June 9, 1995, following CSW's notification that it was
  terminating the Merger and withdrawing the Modified Plan, El Paso
  filed the El Paso Suit against CSW in state district court in El
  Paso, Texas, claiming breach of contract, breach of duty of good
  faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, business
  disparagement, tortious interference with contract and fraud in
  the inducement.  The El Paso Suit seeks a $25 million termination
  fee from CSW, certain costs related to the Modified Plan,

                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-38
  additional unspecified damages, punitive damages, interest as
  permitted by law, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.  On
  June 15, 1995, CSW filed the CSW Suit against El Paso in the
  United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas,
  Austin Division, seeking a $25 million termination fee from El
  Paso due to El Paso's breach of the Merger Agreement, at least
  $3.6 million in rate case expenses incurred by CSW on behalf of El
  Paso related to state regulatory merger proceedings and a
  declaratory judgment that CSW properly terminated the Merger
  Agreement.  CSW also removed the El Paso Suit from state district
  court to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western
  District of Texas, El Paso Division.  The El Paso Suit was then
  transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court in Austin,
  Texas.

       On August 4, 1995, El Paso filed motions with the Austin
  bankruptcy court to remand the El Paso Suit back to the state
  district court in El Paso and abstain from hearing the CSW Suit.
  The bankruptcy court denied El Paso's motions, and in connection
  therewith the judge presiding over El Paso's bankruptcy proceeding
  recused himself from hearing the El Paso Suit and the CSW Suit.
  Both lawsuits have since been assigned to another judge of the
  United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas,
  Austin Division.  On October 19, 1995, El Paso filed motions (i)
  to withdraw the reference of both lawsuits from the United States
  Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas to the United
  States District Court for the Western District of Texas and (ii)
  to change venue in both lawsuits to the El Paso Division.  El
  Paso's motion to withdraw the reference was denied on November 15,
  1995, by the United States District Court for the Western District
  of Texas, Austin Division, and El Paso's motion for
  reconsideration of this ruling was denied on December 11, 1995.
  On January 26, 1996, El Paso filed a petition for writ of mandamus
  in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
  seeking an order directing the withdrawal of the reference of both
  lawsuits from the Bankruptcy Court.  On February 26, 1996, El
  Paso's motion to transfer venue was denied by the United States
  Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin
  Division, and the court consolidated the El Paso Suit and the CSW
  Suit into one adversary proceeding.  CSW is the named plaintiff in
  the consolidated adversary proceeding.  On February 27, 1996, the
  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal's denied El Paso's petition for writ
  of mandamus.  No trial date has been set for the lawsuits.

       Although CSW believes that it has substantial defenses to El
  Paso's claims and intends to defend El Paso's claims and pursue
  CSW's claims vigorously, CSW cannot presently predict the outcome
  of the lawsuit.  However, if the lawsuit is decided adversely to
  CSW, it could have a material adverse effect on CSW's consolidated
  results of operations and financial condition.

       CPL Rate Review
       On November 6, 1995, CPL filed with the Texas Commission a
  request to increase its retail base rates by $71 million and
  reduce its annual retail fuel factors by $17 million. The net
  effect of these proposals would be an increase of $54 million, or
  4.6%, in total annual retail revenues based on a test year ended
  June 30, 1995. CPL is not seeking interim rate relief, but will
  implement bonded rates in May 1996, the earliest date permitted by
  law.  CPL also is seeking to reconcile $229 million of fuel costs
  incurred during the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.
  CPL's previous request to reconcile fuel costs from March 1, 1990
  to June 30, 1994 in Docket No. 13650 was consolidated with the
  current rate review. If the requested increase and other
  adjustments in rate structure are approved, CPL has committed not
  to increase its base rates prior to January 1, 2001, subject to
  certain force majeure events.

       CPL is requesting this rate review in large part as a result
  of the expiration of the amortization of its Mirror CWIP
  liability. The Mirror CWIP liability was amortized to income in
  declining amounts over a five-year period from 1991 through 1995
  pursuant to rate settlements reached by CPL in 1990 and 1991. In
  1995, Mirror CWIP provided $41 million in non-cash earnings at
  CPL. Also included in the request are proposals by CPL to
  accelerate recovery of nuclear and regulatory assets as a way to
  proactively address certain assets that could possibly be
  unrecoverable or stranded in a more competitive electric utility
  industry.  In a preliminary order issued December 21, 1995, the
  Texas Commission expanded the scope of the rate review to address


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-39
  certain competitive issues facing the electric utility industry.
  The competitive issues to be addressed by CPL in a supplemental
  filing due April 1, 1996, are: (i) the calculation of rates on an
  unbundled or functional basis (i.e., generation, transmission and
  distribution); (ii) the current value of CPL's generating assets
  as compared to estimates of the market value of such assets under
  alternate future industry structures; (iii) the application of
  performance based ratemaking; (iv) potential revisions in the
  methodology of reconciling and recovering fuel costs; and (v) the
  Texas Commission's authority to introduce competition in the
  electric utility industry under existing law.

       On February 13, 1996, intervening parties filed testimony in
  the revenue requirements phase of CPL's base rate case.  Among the
  parties that filed testimony were the OPUC which recommended a
  base rate decrease of approximately $75 million on a total company
  basis and the Cities which recommended a base rate reduction of
  approximately $52 million on a total company basis.

       On February 20, 1996, the Staff filed testimony recommending
  an increase in total company base rates of approximately $30
  million. Certain elements of the Staff's proposal are described
  below.

       The Staff recommended a return on common stock equity of
  11.35% compared to the 12.25% return on common equity requested by
  CPL.  The Staff recommended a disallowance of $16 million in costs
  billed for administrative services by CSW Services to CPL on the
  basis that the specific benefits to CPL were not clearly
  identified.  Additionally, the Staff recommended a $7 million
  reduction in CPL's current annual depreciation accrual and a $3
  million reduction in CPL's requested accrual for decommissioning
  STP.  A comparison of the Staff's recommendation for a base rate
  increase, compared to CPL's claimed revenue deficiency is provided
  in the CPL RATE REVIEW COMPARISON table.

                Staff recommended revenue increase (2)    $30

                (1) The total company rate increase requested by
                    CPL was reduced from $103 million to $78 million
                    ($71 million allocated to the Texas retail
                    jurisdiction) in accordance with rate settlements
                    entered into by CPL in 1990 and 1991.
                (2) The Staff recommended that CPL be granted a $23
                    million base rate increase and an annual increase
                    of $7 million in customer service charges.

       The Staff and Cities recently filed testimony on the fuel
  portion of the rate case recommending a reduction to CPL's
  eligible fuel costs of $16 million and $32 million, respectively.

       After completion of hearings in all phases of the rate case,
  which began in late February 1996 and are expected to conclude
  during the third quarter of 1996, the ALJs assigned to hear the
  case will issue a proposal for decision for consideration by the
  Texas Commission. Testimony filed by parties to the rate case,
  including the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJs or the
  Texas Commission.  A final decision on the rate request is not
  anticipated from the Texas Commission prior to December 1996.



                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-40
       Management of CSW and CPL cannot predict the ultimate outcome
  of CPL's rate case, although management believes that the ultimate
  resolution will not have a material adverse effect on CPL's or
  CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
  However, if CPL ultimately is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate
  rate relief, CPL and CSW could experience a material adverse
  effect on their results of operations and financial condition.

       CPL 1995 Agreement
       On April 5, 1995, CPL reached an agreement in principle with
  other parties to pending regulatory proceedings involving base
  rate, fuel and prudence issues relating to an outage experienced
  at STP during 1993 and 1994.  On May 16, 1995, CPL filed the CPL
  1995 Agreement with the Texas Commission.  Pursuant to the CPL
  1995 Agreement, base rate refunds, fuel refunds and the reduction
  of CPL's fuel factors were implemented during the summer of 1995.
  Under the CPL 1995 Agreement, CPL provided customers a one-time
  base rate refund of $50 million.  In addition, CPL refunded
  approximately $30 million in over-recovered fuel costs through
  April 1995.  Furthermore, CPL did not charge customers for $62.25
  million in replacement power costs and related interest primarily
  associated with the 1993-1994 STP outage.  The CPL 1995 Agreement
  did not result in any ongoing change in base rate levels and
  provided that there would be no new rate review requests filed
  prior to September 28, 1995.  CPL also reduced its fuel factors,
  effective in July 1995, by approximately $55 million on an annual
  basis due to projections of lower fuel costs.  Hearings on the CPL
  1995 Agreement were held on July 19, 1995, and the final written
  Texas Commission order approving the CPL 1995 Agreement was
  received on October 4, 1995.  Details of the items in the CPL 1995
  Agreement and the total 1995 earnings impact for CPL, including
  certain accounting provisions, are set forth in the following
  table.

       CPL Deferred Accounting
       CPL was granted deferred accounting treatment for certain
  STP Unit 1 and 2 costs by Texas Commission orders issued in
  October 1990 and December 1990, respectively.  In 1994, the
  Supreme Court sustained deferred accounting as an appropriate
  mechanism for the Texas Commission to use in preserving the
  financial integrity of CPL, but remanded CPL's case to the Court
  of Appeals to consider certain substantial evidence points of
  error not previously decided by the Court of Appeals given its
  prior determinations.  On August 16, 1995, the Court of Appeals
  rendered its opinion in the remand proceeding and affirmed the
  Texas Commission's order in all respects.

       CPL believes that the language of the Supreme Court's
  opinion suggests that the appropriateness of allowing deferred
  accounting may be reviewed under a financial integrity standard in
  the first case in which the deferred STP costs are recovered
  through rates.  If the courts decide that subsequent review under
  the financial integrity standard is required, that review would be
  conducted in a remand of the STP Unit 1 and 2 orders.  Pending the
  ultimate resolution of CPL's deferred accounting issues, CPL is
  unable to predict how its deferred accounting orders will
  ultimately be resolved by the Texas Commission.


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-41
       If CPL's deferred accounting matters are not favorably
  resolved, CSW and CPL could experience a material adverse effect
  on their respective results of operations and financial condition.
  While CPL's management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome
  of these matters, management believes CPL will receive approval of
  its deferred accounting orders or will be successful in
  renegotiation of its rate orders, so that there will be no
  material adverse effect on CSW's or CPL's results of operation or
  financial condition.

       CPL Westinghouse Litigation
       CPL and other owners of STP were plaintiffs in a lawsuit
  filed in October 1990 in the District Court in Matagorda County,
  Texas against Westinghouse, seeking damages and other relief.  The
  suit alleged that Westinghouse supplied STP with defective steam
  generator tubes that are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.
  On December 8, 1995, CPL and the other owners of STP settled the
  lawsuit.  While the court order prohibits disclosure of the terms
  of the settlement, CPL believes the litigation was settled on
  terms that provided satisfactory consideration to CPL and STP and
  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of
  operations or financial condition of CSW or CPL.

       CPL Civil Penalties
       In October 1995, the NRC notified HLP of a Notice of
  Violation and proposed penalties totaling $160,000 related to
  events that occurred at STP in May 1992.  The Notice of Violation
  and penalties reflect the NRC's belief that certain STP employees
  were terminated as a result of raising safety concerns with the
  NRC.  The Notice of Violation was the result of a Department of
  Labor decision and order in April 1995 and is awaiting final
  action by the Secretary of Labor.  HLP is not required to reply to
  the NRC's Notice of Violation or pay the penalties pending the
  Secretary of Labor's final decision.  The NRC indicated that the
  proposed civil penalties reflect minimum penalties allowed because
  of improvements made to the STP Employee Concerns Program since
  1992.  CPL's share of any penalty that is ultimately paid would be
  approximately 25%, reflecting its ownership interest in STP.

        CPL Industrial Road and Industrial Metals Site
        Three suits naming CPL and others as defendants relating to
  a third-party owned and operated site in Corpus Christi, Texas
  formerly used for commercial reclamation of used electrical
  transformers, lead acid batteries and other scrap metals, are
  currently pending in federal and state court in Corpus Christi,
  Texas.  Plaintiffs' complaints seek damages for alleged property
  damage and health impairment as a result of operations on the site
  and cleanup activities.  Management cannot predict the outcome of
  these suits.  However, management believes that CPL has defenses
  to the plaintiffs' complaints and intends to defend the suits
  vigorously.  Management also believes that the ultimate resolution
  of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on CSW's
  or CPL's results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO Gas Transportation and Fuel Management Fees
       An order issued by the Oklahoma Commission in 1991 required
  that the level of gas transportation and fuel management fees,
  paid to Transok by PSO, permitted for recovery through the fuel
  adjustment clause be reviewed in PSO's 1993 rate proceeding.  This
  portion of the 1993 rate review was subsequently bifurcated.  In
  March 1995, an order was issued by the Oklahoma Commission
  approving an agreement which allows PSO to recover approximately
  $28.4 million of transportation and fuel management fees in base
  rates using 1991 determinants and approximately $1 million through
  the fuel adjustment clause.  The agreement also requires the phase-
  in of competitive bidding of natural gas transportation
  requirements in excess of 165 MMcf/d.

       PSO Gas Purchase Contracts
       PSO has been named defendant in complaints filed in federal
  and state courts of Oklahoma and Texas in 1984 through 1995 by gas
  suppliers alleging claims arising out of certain gas purchase
  contracts.  The plaintiffs seek relief through the filing dates as
  well as attorneys' fees.  In January 1996, complaints representing


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-42
  approximately $10 million in claims were settled.  Remaining
  complaints currently total approximately $1 million in claimed
  actual damages.  The settlements did not have a material effect on
  CSW's and PSO's consolidated results of operations or financial
  condition.  The remaining suits are in the preliminary stages.
  Management cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.
  However, management believes that PSO has defenses to the
  remaining complaints and intends to defend the suits vigorously.
  Management also believes that the ultimate resolution of the
  remaining complaints will not have a material adverse effect on
  CSW's or PSO's consolidated results of  operations or financial
  condition.

       PSO PCB Cases
       PSO has been named a defendant in complaints filed in
  federal and state courts of Oklahoma in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1993 and
  1996.  The complaints allege, among other things, that some of the
  plaintiffs and the property of other plaintiffs were contaminated
  with PCBs and other toxic by-products following certain incidents,
  including transformer malfunctions, in April 1982, December 1983
  and May 1984.  To date, all complaints, except for claims
  representing approximately $13 million in alleged damages and
  claims filed in February 1996 for additional unspecified actual
  and punitive damages, have been dismissed, certain of which
  resulted from settlements among the parties.  Management believes
  that PSO has defenses to the remaining complaints and intends to
  defend the suits vigorously.  Moreover, management believes that
  the remaining claims are covered under insurance.  Management also
  believes that the ultimate resolution of the remaining complaints
  will not have a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
       In June 1992, PSO filed suit in the United States District
  Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against Burlington
  Northern seeking declaratory relief under a long-term contract for
  the transportation of coal.  In July 1992, Burlington Northern
  asserted counterclaims for unspecified damages against PSO
  alleging that PSO breached the contract.  In December 1993, PSO
  amended its suit against Burlington Northern seeking damages and
  declaratory relief under federal and state antitrust laws.  In
  December 1995, PSO and Burlington Northern reached a compromise
  settlement of all outstanding claims and counterclaims, and the
  action was dismissed with prejudice.  The settlement did not have
  a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's consolidated results
  of operations or financial condition.

       PSO Burlington Northern Arbitration
       In May 1994, in an arbitration related to the Burlington
  Northern coal transportation contract described above, an
  arbitration panel made an award in favor of PSO concerning basic
  transportation rates under the coal transportation contract and
  concerning the contract mechanism for adjustment for future
  transportation rates.  This arbitration award was then the subject
  of litigation in the United States District Courts for the
  Northern Districts of Oklahoma and Texas and the United States
  Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  In December 1995, this
  litigation was settled as part of the compromise settlement of the
  related lawsuit described above.  Under the settlement, a $16.4
  million judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Northern
  District of Oklahoma confirming the arbitration award became final
  and was then released and satisfied of record.

       PSO Ash Creek Coal Mine Reclamation
       In August 1994, PSO received approval from the Wyoming
  Department of Environmental Quality to begin reclamation of a coal
  mine in Sheridan, Wyoming, owned by Ash Creek, a wholly owned
  subsidiary of PSO.  Ash Creek recorded a $3 million liability in
  1993 for the estimated reclamation costs and subsequently accrued
  an additional $500,000 in 1995.  Actual reclamation work commenced
  in September 1995, with completion expected in late 1996.
  Surveillance monitoring will continue for ten years after final
  reclamation.  Management believes that ultimate resolution of this
  matter will not have a material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO MCPC
       In 1989, PSO entered into certain long-term contracts with
  MCPC, a cogeneration development company located in northeastern
  Oklahoma.  These contracts include: (i) an Interconnection and
  Interchange Agreement providing terms and conditions under which
  MCPC could connect its electric generating facilities to PSO's
  transmission system and providing for future transmission by PSO
  of specified amounts of MCPC's power to an unaffiliated utility;
  (ii) a Stock/Asset Purchase Agreement which allows PSO under
  certain conditions to acquire the stock or assets of MCPC; and
  (iii) an Energy Conversion Agreement which required PSO to deliver
  natural gas to MCPC for conversion to electrical energy to be
  delivered by MCPC to PSO.  Under the Energy Conversion Agreement,
  PSO had the right to dispatch up to 60 MWH per hour of quick-start
  capability.

       In 1993, MCPC filed an application with the Oklahoma
  Commission requesting relief through the modification of the
  existing Energy Conversion Agreement.  An emergency order was
  issued under MCPC's application which increased the payment made
  by PSO to MCPC for energy purchases and decreased the amount of
  firm energy MCPC was required to deliver to PSO.  The emergency
  order was subject to a permanent ruling.

       In July 1993, PSO commenced a lawsuit in the District Court
  of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, seeking a declaratory judgment that PSO
  was entitled to terminate the Energy Conversion Agreement as of
  August 1, 1993, because of a default committed by MCPC.  On March
  31, 1995, PSO, MCPC and the Oklahoma Commission Staff signed a
  joint settlement resolving all issues pursuant to the various
  proceedings before the Oklahoma Commission and the District Court
  of Tulsa County, Oklahoma.  The settlement, among other things,
  eliminated a requirement that MCPC deliver an annual minimum of
  394,200 MWH of Assured Delivery Energy and related provisions
  associated with underdelivery charges.  Most other provisions of
  the agreement between PSO and MCPC were kept intact.  The Oklahoma
  Commission issued an order in May 1995 approving the settlement.
  The settlement is on terms satisfactory to PSO and will not have a
  material adverse effect on CSW's or PSO's consolidated results of
  operations or financial condition.

       SWEPCO Fuel Factor Proceedings
       On October 6, 1995, SWEPCO filed a petition, designated as
  Docket No. 14819, with the Texas Commission to revise its fixed
  fuel factors for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.
  SWEPCO was experiencing an over-recovery of fuel costs based on
  application of its then current factors which became effective in
  July 1994.  The original filing with the Texas Commission proposed
  decreasing SWEPCO's fixed fuel factors and refunding to customers
  $7.1 million of cumulative over-recoveries for the period January
  1994 to June 1995.  SWEPCO subsequently revised its petition to
  the Texas Commission, updating the cumulative fuel over-recovery
  to $10.4 million through September 1995.  On December 20, 1995,
  the Texas Commission issued an order approving SWEPCO's revised
  fixed fuel factors and authorizing the refund of $10.8 million,
  including interest, to customers primarily as billing credits on
  January 1996 monthly bills.

       SWEPCO Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
       On January 20, 1995, a state district court in Bowie County,
  Texas, entered judgment in favor of SWEPCO against Burlington
  Northern in a lawsuit regarding rates charged under two rail
  transportation contracts for delivery of coal to SWEPCO's Welsh
  and Flint Creek power plants.  The court awarded SWEPCO
  approximately $72 million covering damages for the period from
  April 27, 1989 through September 26, 1994, post-judgment interest
  and attorneys' fees and granted certain declaratory relief
  requested by SWEPCO.  Burlington Northern appealed the state
  district court's judgment to the Texarkana, Texas Court of
  Appeals.  The appeal is now pending.

       WTU Stipulation and Agreement
       WTU has been the subject of several pending regulatory
  matters, including the following: (i) a retail rate proceeding and
  fuel reconciliation before the Texas Commission in Docket No.
  13369; (ii) Writ of Error to the Supreme Court - review of WTU's
  1987 Texas rate case in Docket No. 7510; and (iii)  the Texas
  Commission's proceeding on remand in Docket No. 13949 regarding
  deferred accounting treatment for Oklaunion Power Station Unit No.
  1 originally authorized in the Texas Commission's Docket No. 7289.

       On September 22, 1995, WTU, along with other major parties
  to the above described matters, filed with the Texas Commission a
  joint stipulation and agreement to resolve all of these matters.
  The WTU Stipulation and Agreement is a unified package that
  included: (i) a retail base rate reduction of approximately $13.5
  million annually starting with WTU's October 1995 revenue month
  billing cycle; (ii) a $21 million retail refund which was not
  attributed to any specific cause but was inclusive of all claims
  related to the three above described litigation and regulatory
  matters and included the effect of the rate reduction to October
  1, 1994; (iii) a reduction of fixed fuel factors by approximately
  2%; (iv) various rate and accounting treatments including a
  reasonable return on equity for retail operations of 11.375%; and
  (v) a retail base rate freeze until October 1, 1998, subject to
  certain force majeure provisions.

       On November 9, 1995, the Texas Commission rendered a final
  order that implemented the joint stipulation and agreement, ending
  the rate proceeding and fuel reconciliation in Docket No. 13369
  and the remand, designated Docket No. 13949, to the Texas
  Commission by the Supreme Court for the deferred accounting
  treatment of Oklaunion Power Station Unit No. 1 originally
  authorized by the Texas Commission in Docket No. 7289.  The final
  order also set into motion the actions required to seek a remand
  of the appeal of Docket No. 7510 to the Texas Commission to
  implement a final order consistent with the WTU Stipulation and
  Agreement.

       On December 8, 1995, all parties to the appeals filed a
  joint motion with the Supreme Court and, on December 22, 1995, the
  Supreme Court approved the joint motion to withdraw and dismissed
  the case.  The case will now go back to the Court of Appeals so
  that it can be remanded back to the Texas Commission.  The date of
  this remand and final action by the Texas Commission is not known.

       The WTU Stipulation and Agreement is expected to impact
  WTU's results of operations for the next several years, reducing
  annual earnings by approximately $8 million beginning in 1996.
  Details of the items with significant earnings impact for 1995 and
  1996, including certain accounting treatments, are set forth in
  the following table.

       The WTU Stipulation and Agreement also eliminated several
  significant risks that have been the subject of regulatory
  proceedings relating to deferred accounting and rates and will
  enable WTU's rates to remain at competitive levels for the
  foreseeable future.

       CSW Energy Cimmaron Litigation
       On January 12, 1994, Cimmaron brought suit against CSW and
  its wholly owned subsidiary, CSW Energy, in the 125th District
  Court of Houston, Harris County, Texas.  Cimmaron alleged that CSW
  and CSW Energy breached commitments to participate with Cimmaron
  in the failed BioTech Cogeneration project located in Colorado.

       CSW Energy filed a counterclaim against Cimmaron and third-
  party claims against the principals of Cimmaron on December 22,
  1994.  On January 10, 1995, Cimmaron added claims of negligence
  and gross negligence against the members of CSW Energy's board of
  directors at the time of the failed project.  Effective July 27,
  1995, the parties agreed upon a settlement whereby they would
  dismiss their respective claims.  The terms of the settlement were
  on terms satisfactory to CSW and CSW Energy and had no material
  adverse impact on CSW's consolidated results of operations or
  financial condition.

       Other
       CSW is party to various other legal claims, actions and
  complaints arising in the normal course of business.  Management
  does not expect disposition of these matters to have a material
  adverse effect on CSW's consolidated results of operations or
  financial condition.


3.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

  Construction and Capital Expenditures

       It is estimated that CSW, including the Electric Operating
  Companies, SEEBOARD, Transok and other diversified operations,
  will spend approximately $636 million in capital expenditures
  during 1996.  Substantial commitments have been made in connection
  with these programs.  During 1996, each of the Electric Operating
  Companies expects to spend, including AFUDC, approximately the
  following amounts in construction expenditures:

  CPL-$137 million  PSO-$68 million  SWEPCO-$98 million  WTU-$42 million

  Fuel Commitments

       To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the CSW
  System, the subsidiary companies have entered into various
  commitments for the procurement of fuel.

       SWEPCO Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant
       In connection with the South Hallsville lignite mining
  contract for its Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant, SWEPCO has agreed,
  under certain conditions, to assume the obligations of the mining
  contractor.  As of December 31, 1995, the maximum amount SWEPCO
  would have to assume was $71.9 million.  The maximum amount may
  vary as the mining contractor's need for funds fluctuates.  The
  contractor's actual obligation outstanding at December 31, 1995
  was $58.7 million.

       SWEPCO South Hallsville Lignite Mine
       As part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas
  Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining at the South
  Hallsville lignite mine, SWEPCO has agreed to provide bond
  guarantees on mine reclamation in the amount of $70 million.
  Since SWEPCO uses self-bonding, the guarantee provides for SWEPCO


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-46
  to commit to use its resources to complete the reclamation in the
  event the work is not completed by the third party miner.  The
  current cost to reclaim the mine is estimated to be approximately
  $25 million.

       WTU Pipeline Leases
       WTU has entered into various commitments for the procurement
  of fuel.  WTU has a sale/leaseback agreement with Transok, an
  affiliated company, for full capacity use of a natural gas
  pipeline to WTU's Ft. Phantom generating plant.  The lease
  agreement also provides for full capacity use of Transok's natural
  gas pipelines serving WTU's San Angelo, Oak Creek and Rio Pecos
  generating plants.  The initial terms of the agreement entered
  into in 1992 are for twelve years with renewable options
  thereafter.

  Other Commitments and Contingencies

       CPL Nuclear Insurance
       In connection with the licensing and operation of STP, the
  owners have purchased the maximum limits of nuclear liability
  insurance, as required by law, and have executed indemnification
  agreements with the NRC in accordance with the financial
  protection requirements of the Price-Anderson Act.

       The Price-Anderson Act, a comprehensive statutory
  arrangement providing limitations on nuclear liability and
  governmental indemnities, is in effect until August 1, 2002.  The
  limit of liability under the Price-Anderson Act for licensees of
  nuclear power plants is $8.92 billion per incident, effective as
  of January 1995.  The owners of STP are insured for their share of
  this liability through a combination of private insurance
  amounting to $200 million and a mandatory industry-wide program
  for self-insurance totaling $8.72 billion.  The maximum amount
  that each licensee may be assessed under the industry-wide program
  of self-insurance following a nuclear incident at an insured
  facility is $75.5 million per reactor, which may be adjusted for
  inflation, plus a five percent charge for legal expenses, but not
  more than $10 million per reactor for each nuclear incident in any
  one year.  CPL and each of the other STP owners are subject to
  such assessments, which CPL and other owners have agreed will be
  allocated on the basis of their respective ownership interests in
  STP.  For purposes of these assessments, STP has two licensed
  reactors.

       The owners of STP currently maintain on-site decontamination
  liability and property damage insurance in the amount of $2.75
  billion provided by ANI and NEIL.  Policies of insurance issued by
  ANI and NEIL stipulate that policy proceeds must be used first to
  pay decontamination and cleanup costs before being used to cover
  direct losses to property.  Under project agreements, CPL and the
  other owners of STP will share the total cost of decontamination
  liability and property insurance for STP, including premiums and
  assessments, on a pro rata basis, according to each owner's
  respective ownership interest in STP.

       CPL purchases, for its own account, a NEIL I Business
  Interruption and/or Extra Expense policy.  This insurance will
  reimburse CPL for extra expenses incurred for replacement
  generation or purchased power as the result of a covered accident
  that shuts down production at one or both of the STP Units for
  more than 21 consecutive weeks.  In the event of an outage of STP
  Units 1 and 2 and the outage is the result of the same accident,
  insurance will reimburse CPL up to 80% of the single unit
  recovery.  The maximum amount recoverable for a single unit outage
  is $86.02 million for Unit 1 and $85.96 million for Unit 2.  CPL
  is subject to an additional assessment up to $1.6 million for the
  current policy year in the event that insured losses at a nuclear
  facility covered under the NEIL I policy exceeds the accumulated
  funds available under the policy.

       On August 28, 1994, CPL filed a claim under the NEIL I
  policy relating to the 1993 - 1994 outage at STP Units 1 and 2.
  NEIL has denied the claim.  CPL management is currently evaluating
  its options regarding this claim, but cannot predict the ultimate
  outcome of this matter.

       SWEPCO Rental and Lease Commitments
       SWEPCO has entered into various financing arrangements
  primarily with respect to coal transportation and related
  equipment, which are treated as operating leases for rate-making
  purposes.  At December 31, 1995, leased assets of $46 million, net
  of accumulated amortization of $33.7 million, were included in
  Electric fixed assets on the balance sheet and at December 31,
  1994, leased assets were $46 million, net of accumulated
  amortization of $30.1 million.  Total charges to SWEPCO's
  operating expenses for expenses associated with these financing
  arrangements were $6.3 million, $6.8 million and $7.1 million for
  the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

       SWEPCO Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
       In 1994, SWEPCO was notified by Mississippi Power that it may
  be a PRP at a MGP site in Biloxi, Mississippi, formerly owned and
  operated by a predecessor of SWEPCO.  SWEPCO worked with
  Mississippi Power to investigate the extent of contamination at
  this site.  The MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan and,
  in January 1995, SWEPCO and Mississippi Power initiated sampling
  pursuant to that work plan.  Contamination at the site was
  identified as a result of the investigation of property and
  adjacent properties.  Soil and grounds water test results were
  sent to the MDEQ for review and comment.  The test results
  confirmed the contamination on the property and indicated the
  possibility of contamination of an adjacent property.  A risk
  assessment has been performed to assist SWEPCO and Mississippi
  Power in determining remediation alternatives.  A final range of
  cleanup costs has not been determined, but based on preliminary
  estimates, SWEPCO has accrued approximately $2 million for its
  portion of the cleanup of this site.

    CSW Energy Investments and Commitments
    CSW Energy provided construction services to the Mulberry
  cogeneration facility through a wholly owned subsidiary, CSW
  Development-I, Inc.  The project achieved commercial operation in
  August 1994 and added 120 MW of on-line capacity of which CSW
  Energy owns 50%.  CSW Energy's maximum potential liability under
  the fixed price contract is $29 million which will decrease to
  zero in August 1996.  As of December 31, 1995, CSW had provided
  additional guarantees to the project totaling approximately $3.3
  million.

    CSW Energy has entered into a purchase agreement on the Ft.
  Lupton project to provide $80.6 million of equity upon the
  occurrence of certain events.  As of December 31, 1995, $44
  million has been paid and CSW has provided a guarantee for $40
  million.  Additionally, CSW Energy has provided four letters of
  credit to the project totaling $18.9 million.  In March 1995, CSW
  Energy closed permanent project financing on the Ft. Lupton
  facility in the amount of $208 million which allowed the project
  to repay its $102 million construction borrowing to CSW.  The
  following table summarizes the investments and commitments in CSW
  Energy's projects at December 31, 1995.

       SEEBOARD Medway Commitment
       In April 1992, SEEBOARD entered into an agreement to provide
  37.5% of the equity to Medway Power Ltd., a company formed to
  construct, own and operate a 660 MW gas-fired power plant on the


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-48
  Isle of Grain, Kent, in the United Kingdom.  Through December 31,
  1995, SEEBOARD has invested 11.6 million pounds or approximately $18.0
  million in the project and remains committed for an additional
  maximum amount of 11.3 million pounds or approximately $17.5 million
  (1.00 pound=$1.55).  In addition, SEEBOARD has entered into a
  commitment to purchase 50% of the Medway power plant's output for
  15 years commencing in 1996.


4.INCOME TAXES

       CSW files a consolidated federal income tax return and
  participates in a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries.
  Income tax includes federal income taxes, applicable state income
  taxes and SEEBOARD's United Kingdom Corporation income taxes.

       The CSW System adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 109
  effective January 1, 1993.  The net effect on CSW's earnings for
  the year ended December 31, 1993, was a one-time adjustment to
  increase net income by $6 million or $0.03 per share.  This
  adjustment was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in
  accounting principle.  The benefit was attributable to the
  reduction in deferred taxes associated with CSW's non-utility
  operations previously recorded at rates higher than current rates.

       For the Electric Operating Companies, there were no material
  effects of SFAS No. 109 on CSW's earnings.  As a result of this
  change, CSW recognized additional accumulated deferred income
  taxes from its utility operations and corresponding regulatory
  assets and liabilities to ratepayers in amounts equal to future
  revenues or the reduction in future revenues required when the
  book versus tax differences reverse and are recovered or settled
  in rates.  As a result of a favorable earnings history, the CSW
  System did not record any valuation allowance against deferred tax
  assets at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993.

       Total income taxes (income taxes included in Operating
  Expenses and Taxes as well as Other Income and Deductions) differ
  from the amounts computed by applying the federal statutory income
  tax rates to income before taxes for a number of reasons.  The tax
  implications of the CPL 1995 Agreement and the WTU Stipulation and
  Agreement, whereby the flowback of unprotected excess deferred
  income taxes was accelerated, contributed to the difference as did
  adjustments that were made to eliminate tax obligations that no
  longer exist.  These differences are presented in the INCOME TAX
  RATE RECONCILIATION table below.

       Information concerning income taxes, including total income
  tax expense, a reconciliation between the federal statutory tax
  rate and the effective tax rate and significant components of
  deferred income taxes follow.

5.BENEFIT PLANS

       Defined Benefit Pension Plan
       The CSW System maintains a tax qualified, non-contributory
  defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees.
  Benefits are based on employees' years of credited service, age at
  retirement, and final average annual earnings with an offset for
  the participant's primary Social Security benefit.  The CSW
  System's funding policy is based on actuarially determined
  contributions, taking into account amounts which are deductible
  for income tax purposes and minimum contributions required by
  ERISA. Pension plan assets consist primarily of common stocks and
  short-term and intermediate-term fixed income investments.
  Information about the pension plan, including: (1) pension plan
  net periodic costs and contributions; (2) pension plan
  participation; (3) a reconciliation of the funded status of the
  pension plan to the amounts recognized on the balance sheets; and
  (4) assumptions used in accounting for the pension plan follow.

       In addition to the amounts shown in the above table, the CSW
  System has a non-qualified excess benefit plan.  This plan is
  available to all pension plan participants who are entitled to
  receive a pension benefit from CSW which is in excess of the
  limitations imposed on benefits by the Internal Revenue Code
  through the qualified plan.  CSW's net periodic cost for this non-
  qualified plan for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
  1993 was $2.4 million, $1.8 million and $0.5 million,

       Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
       The CSW System, including each of the Electric Operating
  Companies, adopted SFAS No. 106 effective January 1, 1993.  The
  effect on the CSW System's operating expense in 1993 was an
  increase of $16 million, with the individual Electric Operating
  Companies' effects being approximately $5.9 million, $3.0 million
  and $1.9 million for CPL, SWEPCO and WTU, respectively.  The
  transition obligation is being amortized over twenty years, with
  seventeen years remaining.  Prior to 1993,  these benefits were
  accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Pursuant to an order by
  the Oklahoma Commission, PSO established a regulatory asset of
  approximately $5 million in 1993 for the difference between the
  pay-as-you-go basis and the costs determined under SFAS No. 106.
  PSO is recovering the amortization of this regulatory asset over a
  ten year period.  Information about the non-pension postretirement
  benefit plan, including: (1) net periodic postretirement benefit
  costs; (2) a reconciliation of the funded status of the
  postretirement benefit plan to the amounts recognized on the
  balance sheets; and (3) assumptions used in accounting for the
  postretirement benefit plan follow.

       Effective January 1993, the CSW System's method of providing
  health benefits was modified to include such benefits as a health
  maintenance organization, preferred provider options, managed
  prescription drug and mail-order program and a mental health and
  substance abuse program in addition to the self-insured indemnity
  plans.

       SEEBOARD's Employee Benefits
       The majority of SEEBOARD's employees joined, and received
  pension benefits from a pension plan that is administered for the
  United Kingdom's electricity industry.  The assets of this plan
  are held in a separate trustee administered fund that is
  actuarially valued every three years.  SEEBOARD and its
  participating employees both contribute to the plan for the
  employee's benefit.  Subsequent to July 1, 1995, new employees
  were no longer able to participate in that plan.  Instead, two new
  pension plans were made available to new employees, both of which
  are also separate trustee-administered plans.  At December 31,
  1995, SEEBOARD's pension plan projected benefit obligation,
  reflecting CSW's 76.45% ownership interest in SEEBOARD, is
  approximately $676 million while the fair value of the pension
  plan's assets is approximately $719 million.  The excess of the
  fair value represents a $43 million prepaid pension cost and is
  included in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the consolidated
  balance sheets at December 31, 1995.  Employer provided health
  care benefits are not common in the United Kingdom due to the
  country's national health care system.  Accordingly, SEEBOARD does
  not provide health care benefits to the majority of its employees.


6.JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANT

       The Electric Operating Companies are parties to various
  joint ownership agreements with other non-affiliated entities.
  Such agreements provide for the joint ownership and operation of
  generating stations and related facilities, whereby each
  participant bears its share of the project costs.  At December

<PAGE> 2-56
  31, 1995, the Electric Operating Companies had undivided interests
  in five such generating stations and related facilities as shown
  in the following table.

  * CPL, PSO and WTU have joint ownership agreements with each
    other and other non-affiliated entities.  Such agreements
    provide for the joint ownership and operation of Oklaunion
    Power Station.  Each participant provided financing for its
    share of the project, which was placed in service in December
    1986. CPL's 7.8%, PSO's 15.6% and WTU's 54.7% ownership
    participation represents CSW's 78.1% participation in the
    plant.  The statements of income reflect CPL's, PSO's and WTU's
    respective portions of the operating costs of Oklaunion Power
    Station.  The total investments, including AFUDC, in Oklaunion
    Power Station for CPL, PSO and WTU were $36 million, $80
    million and $280 million, respectively, at December 31, 1995.
    Accumulated depreciation is $9 million, $27 million and $67
    million for CPL, PSO and WTU, respectively.


7.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
  the following fair values of each class of financial instruments
  for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.  The fair
  value does not affect CSW's or any of the Electric Operating
  Companies' liabilities unless the issues are redeemed prior to
  their maturity dates.

       Cash, temporary cash investments, special deposits, accounts
  receivable and short-term debt
       The fair value equals the carrying amount as stated on the
  balance sheets because of the short maturity of those instruments.

       National Grid assets held for sale
       The fair value and the carrying value of  the 32,492,966
  shares of common stock of the National Grid held for sale are both
  approximately $100 million.  The fair value is based on the
  closing market price for National Grid common stock on the London
  Stock Exchange on December 31, 1995 (1.995 pounds per share) and an
  exchange rate of 1.00 pound=$1.55 (the prevailing exchange rate on
  December 31, 1995).

       Long-term debt
       The fair value of CSW's long-term debt is estimated based on
  the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
  current rates offered to CSW for debt of the same remaining
  maturities.

       Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption
       The fair value of the Electric Operating Companies'
  preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption is estimated based
  on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
  current rates offered to CSW for preferred stock with the same or
  similar remaining redemption provision.

       Long-term debt and preferred stock due within 12 months
       The fair value of current maturities of long-term debt and
  preferred stock due within 12 months are estimated based on quoted
  market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
  rates offered for long-term debt or preferred stock with the same
  or similar remaining redemption provisions.

<PAGE> 2-58
  substantially all electric utility plant.  The Operating Companies
  may offer additional first mortgage bonds, MTNs and other
  securities subject to market conditions and other factors.

       CPL
       CPL's $40.9 million Series 1995, GBRA, PCRBs were issued
  with a variable rate computed daily.  The average interest rate
  for 1995 was 4.1%.

       SWEPCO
       SWEPCO's $50.0 million bank loan was issued with a variable
  rate.  The weighted average interest rate for 1995 was 6.3%.

       CSW's year end weighted average cost of long-term debt was
  7.2% for 1995, 7.7% for 1994 and 7.8% for 1993.  For additional
  information about each of the Electric Operating Companies' long
  term debt, see each of their Statements of Capitalization.

       Annual Requirements
       Certain series of outstanding first mortgage bonds have
  annual sinking fund requirements, which are generally 1% of the
  amount of each such series issued.  These requirements may be, and
  generally have been, satisfied by the application of net
  expenditures for bondable property in an amount equal to 166-2/3%
  of the annual requirements.  Certain series of pollution control
  bonds also have sinking fund requirements.  At December 31, 1995,
  the annual sinking fund requirements and annual maturities for
  first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds and SWEPCO's rail
  car capital lease obligations for the next five years are
  presented in the following table.

       Dividends
       The Electric Operating Companies' mortgage indentures, as
  amended and supplemented, contain certain restrictions on the use
  of their retained earnings for cash dividends on their common
  stock.  These restrictions do not limit the ability of CSW to pay
  dividends to its shareholders.  At December 31, 1995,
  approximately $1.5 billion of the subsidiary companies' retained
  earnings were available for payment of cash dividends to CSW.  At
  December 31, 1995, the amount of retained earnings available for
  payment of cash dividends to CSW by the Electric Operating
  Companies was as follows:

  CPL-$744 million  PSO-$150 million  SWEPCO-$302 million  WTU-$126 million

       Reacquired Long-term Debt
       During 1995, 1994 and 1993, the Electric Operating Companies
  reacquired $355 million, $27 million and $987 million of long-term
  debt, respectively, including reacquisition premiums, prior to
  maturity.  The premiums and related reacquisition costs and
  discounts are included in long-term debt on the consolidated
  balance sheets and are being amortized over 5 to 35 years,
  consistent with its expected ratemaking treatment.

       Reference is made to MD&A for further information related to
  long-term debt, including new issues and reacquisitions.

  the current redemption price per share.

       During 1994 and 1993, the Electric Operating Companies
  redeemed $33 million and $17 million, respectively, of preferred
  stock, including redemption premiums, while in 1995, the only
  preferred stock redemption was SWEPCO's $1.2 million annual
  sinking fund requirement.

       CPL
       The dividends on CPL's $160 million auction and money market
  preferred stocks are adjusted every 49 days, based on current
  market rates.  The dividend rates averaged 4.5%, 3.5% and 2.7%
  during 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  CPL retired its
  remaining 10.05% preferred stock during August 1994.

       SWEPCO
       The minimum annual sinking fund requirement for SWEPCO's
  preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption is $1.2 million
  for the years 1996 through 2000.  This sinking fund retires 12,000
  shares annually.

       WTU
       In July 1993, WTU redeemed 100,000 shares of its 7.25%
  Series, $100 par value, Preferred Stock, for $10 million, in
  accordance with mandatory and optional sinking fund provisions.
  The capital required for this transaction was provided by short-


                               CSW
<PAGE> 2-60
  term borrowings from the CSW System money pool and internal
  sources.  In July 1994, WTU redeemed the remaining 47,000 shares
  of its 7.25% Series, $100 par value, Preferred Stock.

       For additional information about each of the Electric
  Operating Companies' preferred stock, see each of their Statements
  of Capitalization.


10.    SHORT-TERM FINANCING

       The CSW System has established a money pool to coordinate
  short-term borrowings by the Electric Operating Companies, Transok
  and CSW Services, which is funded through CSW's issuance of
  commercial paper.  At December 31, 1995, the CSW System had two
  credit facilities in place aggregating $1.2 billion to back up its
  commercial paper program, which had $692 million outstanding at a
  weighted average rate of 5.85%.

       CSW Credit, which does not participate in the money pool,
  issues commercial paper on a stand-alone basis that is secured by
  the assignment of its receivables.  CSW Credit maintains a secured
  revolving credit agreement which aggregated $900 million to back
  up its commercial paper program which, at December 31, 1995, had
  $646 million outstanding at a weighted average rate of 5.83%.


11.    COMMON STOCK

       CSW has reserved 100,000 shares of CSW Common for issuance
  to outside directors pursuant to the directors restricted stock
  plan.  In addition, CSW maintains a long-term incentive plan
  pursuant to which CSW is authorized to issue shares of restricted
  common stock, stock options and/or stock appreciation rights to
  certain eligible employees.  Under the long-term incentive plan,
  approximately 3.8 million shares of CSW Common were available for
  grant as of December 31, 1995 and approximately 1.6 million shares
  were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options which were
  outstanding at December 31, 1995.  In January 1996, the
  compensation committee of the board of directors of CSW authorized
  a restricted stock grant for the executive officers of CSW.  This
  special award was made to reward sustained, long-term corporate
  performance, encourage executive retention and focus on the long-
  term perspective.  This grant vests in 25 percent increments in
  1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000.

       The PowerShare plan is available to all CSW shareholders,
  employees, eligible retirees, utility customers and other
  residents of the four states where the Electric Operating
  Companies operate.  Plan participants are able to make optional
  cash payments and reinvest all or any portion of their dividends
  in additional CSW Common.  In February 1996, CSW filed a
  registration statement with the SEC relating (i) to the issue and
  sale of an additional five million shares of CSW Common through
  the PowerShare plan and (ii) proposed amendments to the plan that
  would, among other things, make the plan available to the
  residents of all fifty states and the District of Columbia.
  During 1995 and 1994, CSW raised approximately $57 million and $50
  million, respectively, in new equity through the PowerShare plan.
  CSW expects to use the proceeds from sales of CSW Common made
  pursuant to the PowerShare plan to reduce short-term and long-term
  debt and for other general corporate purposes.  Information
  concerning new CSW Common equity, primarily through PowerShare,
  issued during 1995 and 1994 is presented in the following table.

  Common in the 1996 Stock Offering and received net proceeds of
  approximately $398 million.  These proceeds were used to repay a
  portion of the indebtedness incurred by CSW under the CSW Credit
  Agreement to fund the acquisition of SEEBOARD.

13.  UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION

       On November 6, 1995, CSW, indirectly through CSW (UK),
  announced its intention to commence the Tender Offer in the United
  Kingdom to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of
  SEEBOARD, a regional electric company based in the United Kingdom,
  for an aggregate adjusted purchase price of approximately $2.12
  billion.

       SEEBOARD's principal business is the distribution and supply
  of electricity in southeast England.  SEEBOARD has its
  headquarters in Crawley, West Sussex.  It has a distribution
  territory that covers approximately 3,000 square miles which
  extends from the outlying areas of London to the English Channel.
  SEEBOARD serves approximately 2 million customers.  Approximately
  80% of SEEBOARD's sales are to residential and commercial
  customers, while the remaining 20% are primarily to industrial
  customers.  For the year ended December 31, 1995, SEEBOARD had
  electricity sales of approximately 18 billion KWHs and, excluding
  exceptional items, net earnings of $118 million on revenues of
  approximately $1.9 billion.  SEEBOARD's results for the calendar
  year ended December 31, 1995 are not indicative of the results
  that will be experienced by SEEBOARD as a subsidiary of CSW due,
  in part, to the debt incurred in connection with the financing of
  the acquisition, the purchase accounting adjustments and the
  accounting adjustments made to adjust SEEBOARD's results for U.S.
  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  SEEBOARD is also
  involved in certain activities other than electricity distribution
  and supply, including electrical contracting and retailing, gas
  supply and electricity generation.  The earnings of SEEBOARD
  presented above have been converted into U. S. dollar amounts for
  illustrative purposes only at an exchange rate of 1.00 pound=$1.58,
  which was the prevailing rate of exchange at the close of business
  on November 3, 1995, the business day prior to the announcement of
  the Tender Offer.  See MD&A for a discussion of the financing of
  the SEEBOARD acquisition.

       The unaudited pro forma information is presented in response
  to applicable accounting rules relating to acquisition
  transactions.  The pro forma information gives effect to the
  acquisition of SEEBOARD accounted for under the purchase method of
  accounting for the twelve months ended December 31, 1995 and the
  twelve months ended December 31, 1994 as if the transaction had
  been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented.

       The unaudited pro forma information is based upon preliminary
  fair value allocations related to the purchase of SEEBOARD.  The
  allocations are subject to revision after more detailed analyses,
  appraisals and evaluations are completed.  The unaudited pro forma
  information has been prepared in accordance with United States
  generally accepted accounting principles.  The pro forma
  information in the following table is presented for illustrative
  purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
  results that would have occurred if the SEEBOARD acquisition had
  taken place at the beginning of the period specified, nor is it
  necessarily indicative of future operating results.  The following
  pro forma information has been prepared reflecting the February
  1996 issuance of CSW Common, and has been converted at an exchange
  rate of 1.00 pound=$1.58 and 1.00 pound=$1.54 for the twelve months ended
  December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Central and South West
Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Central and South West Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiary companies as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and
cash flows, for each of the three years ended December 31, 1995.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Central and South West Corporation and subsidiary companies as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements
of income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three
years ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, Central and South West
Corporation and subsidiary companies changed their methods of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental
Schedule II is presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the
basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial
statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the consolidated financial statements of Central and
South West Corporation and subsidiary companies as well as other
information contained in this Annual Report.  The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and, in
some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates and
judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is
consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.

     The consolidated financial statements have been audited by the
independent accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given
unrestricted access to all financial records and related data,
including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the board of
directors and committees of the board.  CSW and its subsidiaries
believe that representations made to the independent auditors during
their audit were valid and appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit
report is presented elsewhere in this report.

     CSW, together with its subsidiary companies, maintains a system
of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are executed in accordance with management's
authorization, that the consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of CSW and its subsidiaries are properly
safeguarded against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
The system includes a documented organizational structure and
division of responsibility, established policies and procedures
including a policy on ethical standards which provides that the
companies will maintain the highest legal and ethical standards, and
the careful selection, training and development of our employees.

     Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal control system following standards established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board,
operating through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely
of directors who are not officers or employees of CSW or its
subsidiaries, provides oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of
internal controls, no internal control system can provide absolute
assurance that errors will not occur.  However, management strives
to maintain a balance, recognizing that the cost of such a system
should not exceed the benefits derived.

     CSW and its subsidiaries believe that, in all material
respects, its system of internal controls over financial reporting
and over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition functioned effectively as of December 31, 1995.

CENTRAL POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Reference is made to CPL's Financial Statements and related
Notes to Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data.  The
information contained therein should be read in conjunction with,
and is essential in understanding, the following discussion and
analysis.


OVERVIEW

     Net income for common stock was stable in 1995 when compared to
1994 at $192 million, although CPL reported lower electric operating
revenues, Mirror CWIP liability amortization and higher interest
charges offset by lower operating expenses and taxes.  Also
impacting 1995 were the effects of the CPL 1995 Agreement.

     Net income for common stock for 1994 increased 21% to $192
million from $158 million in 1993.  The increase was due primarily
to an increase in base revenue, a decrease in restructuring costs
and a decrease in maintenance expense.  Such increases were
partially offset by the cumulative effect of changes in accounting
principles recorded in 1993.


RESTRUCTURING

     During 1993, CSW announced a restructuring under which the CSW
System restructured the Electric Operating Companies (including CPL)
under a new business unit called CSW Electric and centralized many
common service functions into CSW Services in order to reduce costs
and improve efficiency and productivity.  The restructuring included
restaffing positions throughout the CSW System and a reduction in
the workforce by more than 7% system-wide.  CPL's restructuring
costs, approximately $29 million, were expensed during 1993 and
incurred primarily during 1994.  CPL has realized a number of
benefits from the restructuring, including increased efficiencies
and synergies through the elimination of previously duplicated
functions.


RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

     CPL Rate Review
     On November 6, 1995, CPL filed with the Texas Commission a
request to increase its retail base rates by $71 million and reduce
its annual retail fuel factors by $17 million. The net effect of
these proposals would be an increase of $54 million, or 4.6%, in
total annual retail revenues based on a test year ended June 30,
1995. CPL is not seeking interim rate relief, but will implement
bonded rates in May 1996, the earliest date permitted by law.  CPL
also is seeking to reconcile $229 million of fuel costs incurred
during the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.  CPL's previous
request to reconcile fuel costs from March 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994
in Docket No. 13650 was consolidated with the current rate review.
If the requested increase and other adjustments in rate structure are
approved, CPL has committed not to increase its base rates prior to
January 1, 2001, subject to certain force majeure events.

     CPL is requesting this rate review in large part as a result of
the expiration of the amortization of its Mirror CWIP liability. The
Mirror CWIP liability was amortized to income in declining amounts
over a five-year period from 1991 through 1995 pursuant to rate
settlements reached by CPL in 1990 and 1991. In 1995, Mirror CWIP
provided $41 million in non-cash earnings at CPL. Also included in
the request are proposals by CPL to accelerate recovery of nuclear


                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-71
and regulatory assets as a way to proactively address certain assets
that could possibly be unrecoverable or stranded in a more
competitive electric utility industry.  In a preliminary order issued
December 21, 1995, the Texas Commission expanded the scope of the
rate review to address certain competitive issues facing the electric
utility industry.  The competitive issues to be addressed by CPL in a
supplemental filing due April 1, 1996, are: (i) the calculation of
rates on an unbundled or functional basis (i.e., generation,
transmission and distribution); (ii) the current value of CPL's
generating assets as compared to estimates of the market value of
such assets under alternate future industry structures; (iii) the
application of performance based ratemaking; (iv) potential revisions
in the methodology of reconciling and recovering fuel costs; and (v)
the Texas Commission's authority to introduce competition in the
electric utility industry under existing law.

     On February 13, 1996, intervening parties filed testimony in the
revenue requirements phase of CPL's base rate case.  Among the
parties that filed testimony were the OPUC which recommended a base
rate decrease of approximately $75 million on a total company basis
and the Cities which recommended a base rate reduction of
approximately $52 million on a total company basis.

     On February 20, 1996, the Staff filed testimony recommending an
increase in total company base rates of approximately $30 million.
Certain elements of the Staff's proposal are described below.

     The Staff recommended a return on common stock equity of 11.35%
compared to the 12.25% return on common equity requested by CPL.  The
Staff recommended a disallowance of $16 million in costs billed for
administrative services by CSW Services to CPL on the basis that the
specific benefits to CPL were not clearly identified.  Additionally,
the Staff recommended a $7 million reduction in CPL's current annual
depreciation accrual and a $3 million reduction in CPL's requested
accrual for decommissioning STP.  A comparison of the Staff's
recommendation for a base rate increase, compared to CPL's claimed
revenue deficiency is provided in the CPL RATE REVIEW COMPARISON
table.

                Staff recommended revenue increase (2)    $30

                (1)  The total company rate increase requested
                     by CPL was reduced from $103 million to $78
                     million ($71 million allocated to the Texas
                     retail jurisdiction) in accordance with rate
                     settlements entered into by CPL in 1990 and
                     1991.
                (2)  The Staff recommended that CPL be granted a $23
                     million base rate increase and an annual increase
                     of $7 million in customer service charges.

     The Staff and Cities recently filed testimony on the fuel
portion of the rate case recommending a reduction to CPL's eligible
fuel costs of $16 million and $32 million, respectively.

     After completion of hearings in all phases of the rate case,
which began in late February 1996 and are expected to conclude during
the third quarter of 1996, the ALJs assigned to hear the case will
issue a proposal for decision for consideration by the Texas
Commission. Testimony filed by parties to the rate case, including


                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-72
the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJs or the Texas Commission.
A final decision on the rate request is not anticipated from the
Texas Commission prior to December 1996.

     Management of CPL cannot predict the ultimate outcome of CPL's
rate case, although management believes that the ultimate resolution
will not have a material adverse effect on CPL's results of
operations or financial condition.  However, if CPL ultimately is
unsuccessful in obtaining adequate rate relief, CPL could experience
a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial
condition.

     CPL 1995 Agreement
     On April 5, 1995, CPL reached an agreement in principle with
other parties to pending regulatory proceedings involving base rate,
fuel and prudence issues relating to an outage experienced at STP
during 1993 and 1994.  On May 16, 1995, CPL filed the CPL 1995
Agreement with the Texas Commission.  Pursuant to the CPL 1995
Agreement, base rate refunds, fuel refunds and the reduction of CPL's
fuel factors were implemented on an interim basis during the summer
of 1995.  Under the CPL 1995 Agreement, CPL provided customers a one-
time base rate refund of $50 million.  In addition, CPL refunded
approximately $30 million in over-recovered fuel costs through April
1995.  Furthermore, CPL did not charge customers for $62.25 million
in replacement power costs and related interest primarily associated
with the 1993-1994 STP outage.  The CPL 1995 Agreement did not result
in any ongoing change in base rate levels and provided that there
would be no new rate review requests filed prior to September 28,
1995.  CPL also reduced its fuel factors, effective in July 1995, by
approximately $55 million on an annual basis due to projections of
lower fuel costs.  Hearings on the CPL 1995 Agreement were held on
July 19, 1995, and the final written Texas Commission order approving
the CPL 1995 Agreement was received on October 4, 1995.  See NOTE 2.
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

     See NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS for a
discussion of additional regulatory proceedings.


SOUTH TEXAS PROJECT

     CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which is
located near Bay City, Texas.  In addition, HLP, the Project Manager
of STP, owns 30.8%, San Antonio owns 28.0%, and Austin owns 16.0% of
STP.  STP Unit 1 was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit 2
was placed in service in June 1989.

     From February 1993 until May 1994, STP experienced an
unscheduled outage resulting from mechanical problems.  The outage
resulted in significant rate and regulatory proceedings involving
CPL, including a base rate case and fuel reconciliation proceedings
as previously discussed.  Unit 1 restarted on February 25, 1994 and
reached 100% power on April 8, 1994 and Unit 2 resumed operation on
May 30, 1994 and reached 100% power on June 16, 1994.  During the
last six months of 1994, the STP units operated at capacity factors
of 98.6% for Unit 1 and 99.2% for Unit 2.  For a discussion of
regulatory matters surrounding the STP outage, see RATES AND
REGULATORY MATTERS above and NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS.

     Both STP units were removed from service during 1995 for
scheduled refueling outages.  The fueling outages lasted 41 days for
Unit 1 and 26 days for Unit 2.  For the year 1995, Unit 1 and Unit 2
operated at net capacity factors of 84.9% and 90.6%, respectively.

     For additional information regarding STP and the accounting for
the decommissioning of STP, see NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES and NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY
PROCEEDINGS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Overview
     CPL's need for capital results primarily from its construction
of facilities to provide reliable electric service to its customers.
Accordingly, internally generated funds should meet most of  the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are
not sufficient, CPL's financial condition should allow it access to
the capital markets.

     Construction Expenditures
     CPL maintains a continuing construction program, the nature and
extent of which is based upon current and estimated future demands
upon the system.  Planned construction expenditures for CPL for the
next three years are primarily to improve and expand distribution
facilities and will be funded primarily through internally generated
funds.  These improvements will be required to meet the anticipated
needs of new customers and the growth in the requirements of existing
customers.  Construction expenditures, including AFUDC, for CPL were
approximately $155 million in 1995, $179 million in 1994 and $180
million in 1993.  CPL's estimated total construction expenditures,
including AFUDC, for the years 1996 through 1998 are presented in the
following table.
                   CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES

                          1996    1997    1998   Total
                                    (millions)

          Generation       $17   $  42     $16     $75
          Transmission      14      18      19      51
          Distribution      69      72      74     215
          Fuel              18      11      15      44
          Other             19      14      13      46
                          $137    $157    $137    $431

     The foregoing consists of forward looking information and,
accordingly, actual results may differ materially from such
projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions.
Such assumptions are based on numerous factors, including factors
such as the rate of load growth, escalation of construction costs,
changes in lead times in manufacturing, inflation, the availability
and pricing of alternatives to construction, nuclear, environmental
and other regulation, delays from regulatory hearings, adequacy of
rate relief and the availability of necessary external capital.
Changes in those and other factors could cause CPL to defer or
accelerate construction or to sell or buy more power, which would
affect its cash position, revenues and income to an extent that
cannot now be reliably predicted.

     Although CPL does not believe that it will require substantial
additions of generating capacity through the end of the decade, the
CSW System's internal resource plan presently anticipates that any
additional capacity needs will come from a variety of sources
including projected coal- and lignite-fired generating plants for
which CPL has invested approximately $24 million in prior years for
plant sites, engineering studies and lignite reserves.  Should
future plans exclude these plants for environmental, economical  or
other reasons, CPL would evaluate the probability of recovery of
these investments and may record appropriate reserves.

     Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1995, the capitalization ratios of CPL were
45% common stock equity, 8% preferred stock and 47% long-term debt.
CPL's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.2% at December 31, 1995.
CPL continually monitors the capital markets for opportunities to
lower its cost of capital through refinancing.  CPL is committed to
maintaining financial flexibility through a strong capital structure


                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-74
and favorable securities ratings in order to access the capital
markets opportunistically or when required.  CPL's long-term
financing activity for 1995 is summarized in the following table.

(1)  The balance of proceeds not used to redeem higher cost FMBs
     were used to repay a portion of CPL's short-term borrowings, to
     provide working capital and for other general corporate purposes.
(2)  Collateralized PCRB (secured by a FMB).
(3)  The additional funds required to redeem these issues were
     provided through internal funds and short-term borrowings.

     Shelf Registration Statements
     CPL has $60 million remaining for the issuance of FMBs, and $75
million remaining for the issuance of preferred stock, under shelf
registration statements filed with the SEC in 1993 and 1994,
respectively.  CPL may offer additional FMBs and preferred stock
subject to market conditions and other factors.  The proceeds of any
such offerings will be used principally to redeem higher cost FMBs
and preferred stock in order to lower CPL's cost of capital.

     Short-Term Financing
     CPL, together with other members of CSW System, has established
a CSW System money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings.  These
loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates approximating the
CSW System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  At December 31, 1995
CPL's short-term borrowing limit from the money pool was
approximately $268 million.  During 1995, the annual weighted
average interest rate on CPL's borrowings was 6.1% and the average
amount of CPL's short-term borrowings outstanding was $148 million.
The maximum amount of CPL short-term borrowings outstanding during
1995 was $236 million, which was the amount outstanding at March 2,
1995.

     Internally Generated Funds
     Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  CPL uses
short-term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital requirements
due to the seasonal nature of energy sales.  CPL anticipates that
capital requirements for the period 1996 to 1998 will be met, in
large part, from internal sources.  CPL also anticipates that some
external financing will be required during the period, but the
nature, timing and extent have not yet been determined.  Information
concerning internally generated funds is presented in the following
table.

                                            1995   1994   1993

       Construction Expenditures Provided
         by Internally Generated Funds       66%    65%    52%

     Sales of Accounts Receivable
     CPL sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable, without
recourse, to CSW Credit.  The sales provided CPL with cash
immediately, thereby reducing working capital needs and revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts
receivable sold were $109 million and $85 million, respectively, in
1995, as compared to $123 million and $113 million, respectively, in
1994.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS

     Competition and Industry Challenges
     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting CPL and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic,
political and technological factors.  These factors have resulted in
legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely to result in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in
the future.  As competition in the industry increases, CPL will have
the opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at
risk of losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, CPL
will continue to compete with suppliers of alternative forms of
energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal, some of which may be
cheaper than electricity.  CPL believes that its prices for
electricity and the quality and reliability of its service currently
places it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

     The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy
Policy Act creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding
Company Act and permits utilities, including registered utility
holding companies and non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are
a new category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are
free from most federal and state regulation, including the principal
restrictions of the Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable
broader participation in wholesale power markets by reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act
also allows the FERC, on a case-by-case basis and with certain
restrictions, to order wholesale transmission access and to order
electric utilities to enlarge their transmission systems.  A FERC
order requiring a transmitting utility to provide wholesale
transmission service must include provisions generally that permit
the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services and any
enlargement of the transmission system and associated services.
Wholesale energy markets, including the market for wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment
of the Energy Policy Act.  CPL must compete in the wholesale energy
markets with other public utilities, cogenerators, qualified
facilities, EWGs and others for sales of electric power.  While CPL
believes that the Energy Policy Act will continue to make the
wholesale markets more competitive, CPL is unable to predict the
extent to which the Energy Policy Act will impact its operations.

     On March 29, 1995, consistent with the direction of the Energy
Policy Act, the FERC announced in a NOPR that each public utility
that owns and controls transmission facilities in interstate commerce
must unbundle its services and file open access transmission tariffs
under which each utility will offer comparable open access
transmission services to its transmission customers.  In addition,
the FERC revised its proposed mechanisms by which utilities will be
permitted to recover stranded investment costs expected to be brought
about by the proposed changes.  On August 7, 1995, CSW filed comments
on the proposed approach in the NOPR with the FERC.  Although CSW
supports the concept of comparable open access for the nation's
transmission service, CSW believes that certain changes must be made
in the FERC's proposed approach of implementing the open transmission
system.  First, with respect to the issue of stranded investments,
the FERC proposed that customers who left the utility company pay for
a portion, but not all, of the costs incurred by the owner of
existing facilities that are not utilized as a result of the loss of
such customers. CSW raised concerns about the FERC's proposed
methodology for addressing stranded investment because it did not, in
CSW's view, provide for the fair recovery of the full amount
previously invested.  Second, CSW proposed that the FERC adopt a
"power flow pricing" approach whereby all electric systems that incur
costs because of a transmission transaction are compensated, as
opposed to the traditional "postage stamp" method whereby only the
companies that are directly involved in the actual purchase and sale
of the electricity are compensated or charged.

     On February 9, 1996, CPL filed at the FERC complete sets of open
access transmission tariffs.  These tariffs substantially reflect the
pro forma tariffs attached to the FERC's March 29, 1995 NOPR.  Open


                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-76
access and market pricing should increase marketing opportunities for
CPL, but may also expose it to the risk of loss of load or reduced
revenues due to competition with alternate suppliers.

     Increasing competition in the utility industry brings an
increased need to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail regulatory
environment is beginning to shift from traditional rate base
regulation to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and performance-
based plans encourage efficiencies and increased productivity while
permitting utilities to share in the results.  Retail wheeling, a
major industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel" or move
power from third parties to their own retail customers, is evolving
gradually.  Many states throughout the country currently have
legislation introduced to investigate the issue.

     CPL believes that retail competition would harm the best
interests of CPL's customers and security holders unless CPL
receives fair recovery of the full amounts previously invested to
finance power plants.  These investments, which were reasonably
incurred, were made by CPL to meet its obligation to serve the
public interest, necessity and convenience.  This obligation has
existed for nearly a century and remains in force under current law.
CPL intends to strongly oppose attempts to impose retail competition
without just compensation for the risks and investments CPL
undertook to serve the public's demand for electricity.

     CPL is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on CPL.  As
the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more
competitive, however, the principal factor determining success is
likely to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability,
availability of capacity, and customer service.

     PURA
     Amendments to PURA, the legal foundation of electric regulation
in Texas, became effective on September 1, 1995.  Among other things,
the amendments deregulate the wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT,
permit pricing flexibility for utilities facing competitive
challenges, provide for a market-driven integrated resource planning
process and mandate comparable open access transmission service.

     PURA also requires that the Texas Commission adopt a rule on
comparable open transmission access by March 1, 1996.  In
conjunction with this rulemaking proceeding (Project No. 14045),
Texas Commission Chairman Pat Wood issued a proposal on September 6,
1995, for the purpose of maximizing competition in the ERCOT
wholesale bulk power market.  The proposal calls for the functional
unbundling of integrated utilities where distribution entities could
purchase their power requirements from any generator or set of
generators in ERCOT.  Those generators which are currently regulated
would be deregulated after provisions are in place to recover
stranded costs.  The proposal has been assigned to a separate
proceeding (Project No. 15000).  CPL expects this project to provide
the vehicle for the Texas Commission and other interested parties to
develop positions on industry restructuring before the Texas
Legislature convenes in January 1997.  A schedule has been developed
for this project that includes a series of workshops and technical
conferences during the first half of 1996.  The schedule
contemplates that the Texas Commission will develop legislative
recommendations on restructuring and stranded costs during the
second half of 1996.

     On February 7, 1996, the Texas Commission adopted a rule
governing transmission access and pricing (Project No. 14045).  The
pricing method tentatively adopted by the Texas Commission is a
hybrid combination of an ERCOT-wide postage stamp rate covering 70%
of total ERCOT transmission costs and a distance-sensitive component
referred to as a vector-absolute megawatt mile which recovers the
remaining 30% of ERCOT transmission costs.  Although the open access
tariffs filed with the FERC on February 9, 1996 do not reflect
Project No. 14045 pricing, CPL anticipates filing tariffs with the
FERC that do conform to the Texas Commission's rule in the second
quarter of 1996.

     Regulatory Accounting
     Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS
No. 71, which allows for the recognition and recovery of regulatory
assets, CPL has recognized significant regulatory assets and
liabilities.  Management believes that CPL will continue to meet the
criteria for following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event CPL no
longer meets the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off of
regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.  For additional
information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made to NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

     Consolidated Taxes
     Prior to 1992, the Texas Commission allowed income taxes to be
recovered in rates based on the federal income tax incurred by a
utility as if it were a stand-alone company.  This "stand-alone"
approach treated the regulated activities of a utility as a separate
entity and considered only those revenues and expenses that are
included in the utility's cost of service to calculate the federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.  However, in 1992 the
Texas Commission changed its method of calculating the federal income
tax component of rates to the "actual tax approach."  This approach
reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions which are not
considered for or included in setting rates for the utility.

     On April 13, 1995, the Supreme Court issued a decision which
holds that the Texas Commission is not required to use the tax
benefits associated with the losses of unregulated affiliates to
reduce tax expense in cost of service.  The Supreme Court also ruled
that the Texas Commission cannot include the income tax deductions
taken by the utility for disallowed expenses when determining the
utility's federal income tax liability.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of CPL, like those of other utility systems,
generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject to
environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses
the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.
Legally, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of
a cleanup.  Usually, however, cleanup costs are allocated among
PRPs.

     CPL is subject to various pending claims alleging that it is a
PRP under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and
cleaning up contaminated property.  CPL anticipates that resolution
of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
material adverse effect on CPL's results of operations or financial
condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ from
site to site, factors that are the basis for the expectation for
specific sites include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly
contributed by CPL, the estimated amount of costs allocated to CPL
and the participation of other parties.  See ITEM 1-BUSINESS, NOTE
2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS and NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES for additional discussion regarding
environmental matters.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     SFAS No. 121
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121 to be effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The statement establishes a two-fold test for identification
and quantification of an impaired asset.  The first test in
determining an impairment is to compare the sum of expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) related to an

                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-78
asset to the carrying amount of the asset.  If the sum of expected
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
asset, then an impairment is recognized.  Once an impairment is
identified, the second part of the test is applied to quantify the
amount of the impairment.  The statement lists several alternative
methods of establishing fair market value and quantifying the
impairment.  Cash flows used to measure possible impairment of an
asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets.  For CPL, the lowest independently
identifiable cash flow level used for this analysis is
jurisdictional rates charged to customers.

     CPL will adopt SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.
Under the current regulatory environment, CPL does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 121 to have a significant impact on CPL's
results of operations or financial condition.  However, future
developments in the electric industry and utility regulation could
jeopardize the full recovery of the carrying cost of certain
investments.  Consequently, CPL is monitoring the changing
conditions facing the electric utility industry.

     SFAS No. 123
     SFAS No. 123 was issued in October 1995 with an effective date
for transactions entered into after December 15, 1995.  This
statement requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions where such value
cannot otherwise be determined, but then allows for two alternative
methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current
period.  The alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the
compensation cost, without charging the amount against current
earnings.

     As provided by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, CPL will
continue to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and adopt the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 in 1996.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not
impact CPL's results of operations or financial condition.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Electric Operating Revenues
     Total revenues were $1.1 billion in 1995, a decrease of 12%
when compared to 1994 revenues of $1.2 billion.  The decline was due
primarily to a one time $50 million base rate refund and a $62.3
million disallowance of under-recovered fuel costs resulting from
the CPL 1995 Agreement.  Also contributing to the decrease in
revenue was a $66.6 million decrease in fuel revenue resulting
primarily from lower average unit fuel costs and purchased power as
discussed below and a wholesale fuel revenue refund.  Partially
offsetting the decrease in fuel revenue was a $34.4 million increase
in non-fuel revenue resulting from a 6% increase in KWH sales.  The
increase in sales was attributable to increased usage per customer,
residential and commercial customer growth and a new contract with
an existing wholesale customer.

     Total revenues decreased $5.5 million in 1994 when compared to
1993 revenues.  The 1994 decrease reflects lower fuel-related
revenues of $41.5 million partially offset by higher base revenues
of $35.9 million.  Fuel-related revenues declined as a result of
lower per unit fuel and purchased power costs.  An 8% increase in
KWH sales resulting from an increased number of residential and
commercial customers served as well as warmer spring and summer
weather also contributed to the increase in base revenues.

     Fuel
     Fuel expense decreased $40.5 million, or 12%, during 1995 as
compared to 1994.  The decrease in fuel expense was due primarily to
a 22% decrease in the average unit cost of fuel from $1.75 per Mmbtu
in 1994 to $1.37 per Mmbtu in 1995.  The decrease in the average
unit cost of fuel resulted from the expiration of higher priced gas
contracts that were replaced with lower cost spot market natural

                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-79
gas, the renegotiation of a coal contract and increased usage of
lower unit cost nuclear fuel.  The decrease in the unit cost of fuel
was partially offset by a 13% increase in generation.

     Fuel expense decreased $21.8 million in 1994 when compared to
1993 due primarily to a decrease in the average unit cost of fuel
from $2.17 per Mmbtu in 1993 to $1.75 per Mmbtu in 1994 partially
offset by a 16% increase in generation.  The lower average unit cost
of fuel reflects increased usage of lower unit cost nuclear fuel
since STP Units 1 and 2 restarted and reached 100 percent output
level in April and June of 1994, respectively, and lower unit costs
of gas and coal in 1994.  STP Units 1 and 2 had not operated at full
capacity since February 1993 as discussed previously under SOUTH
TEXAS PROJECT.

     Purchased Power
     Purchased power decreased $22.7 million and $21.7 million
during 1995 and 1994, respectively, when compared to the prior year.
The decrease in 1995 was due primarily to increased generation at
STP, which replaced power that had been purchased during the first
half of 1994 when STP was out of service, and an unscheduled outage
at a fossil-fueled generating plant during the third quarter of
1994.  The decrease of $21.7 million in 1994 as compared to 1993 was
due primarily to the outage at STP which began in February 1993.

     Other Operating
     Other operating expenses decreased $15.8 million, or 7%, during
1995 when compared to 1994.  The decrease was due primarily to a
reduction in employee related costs.  Other operating expenses in
1994 were relatively consistent with 1993 levels.

     Restructuring Charges
     Restructuring charges decreased $20.8 million during 1995 when
compared to 1994.  The decrease was due primarily to the recognition
of a $20.7 million regulatory asset established in accordance with
the CPL 1995 Agreement for previously recorded restructuring
charges.  Restructuring charges in 1993 reflect the original accrual
of $29.4 million.

     Maintenance
     Maintenance expense decreased $5.3 million in 1995 when
compared to 1994 as a result of postponement of previously scheduled
plant maintenance and  savings resulting from cost containment
efforts.  Maintenance expense decreased $12.8 million during 1994 as
compared to 1993 due primarily to lower STP outage-related
maintenance activities.

     Depreciation and Amortization
     Depreciation and amortization increased $8.9 million, or 6%,
during 1995 as compared to 1994 as a result of an increase in
depreciable property and the amortization of regulatory assets
associated with the CPL 1995 Agreement.  Depreciation and
amortization increased in 1994 as compared to 1993 as a result of an
increase in depreciable property and a decline in amortization
credits related to power plant inventory.

     Taxes, Other than Income
     Taxes, other than income decreased $14.5 million during 1995 as
compared to 1994 due primarily to lower ad valorem tax expense
resulting from a true-up of prior year estimates.  The $5.9 million
decrease in 1994 when compared to 1993 was primarily a result of a
franchise tax refund.

      Income Taxes
      Income taxes decreased $59.5 million in 1995 as compared to
1994 due primarily to the reduction of $34.3 million of deferred
income taxes in accordance with the CPL 1995 Agreement, prior year
tax adjustments and lower pre-tax income.  Income taxes increased
$10.2 million in 1994 as compared to 1993 due to higher pre-tax
income.


                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-80
     Other Income and Deductions
     Mirror CWIP liability amortization decreased $27.0 million and
$8.0 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively, when compared to the
prior year.  In accordance with the original liability amortization
schedule agreed upon in the settlement of its rate cases in 1990 and
1991, CPL amortized its Mirror CWIP liability in declining amounts
over the years 1991 through 1995.  The absence of Mirror CWIP
liability amortization in 1996 will have a negative impact on CPL's
net income, although its cash flow will not be impacted.  Other
income was higher in 1995 when compared to 1994 due primarily to the
recognition of factoring income pursuant to the CPL 1995 Agreement.

     Interest Charges
     Interest on long-term debt increased $4.8 million during 1995
as compared to 1994 as a result of increased long-term debt
outstanding.  Interest on short-term debt and other increased $7.6
million during 1995 when compared to 1994 as a result of higher
levels of short-term debt outstanding at higher interest rates and
the recognition of interest expense associated with over-recovered
fuel.

     Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
     In 1993, CPL changed its method of accounting for unbilled
revenues and implemented SFAS No. 112.  These accounting changes had
a cumulative effect of increasing net income by $27.3 million in
1993.

     Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the Consumer Price
Index, have averaged approximately 2.8% during the three years ended
December 31, 1995.  CPL believes that inflation, at this level, does
not materially affect its results of operation or financial
condition.  However, under existing regulatory practice, only the
historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As a
result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant
costs may not be adequate to replace plant in future years.

2.LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

       CPL Rate Review
       On November 6, 1995, CPL filed with the Texas Commission a
  request to increase its retail base rates by $71 million and
  reduce its annual retail fuel factors by $17 million.  The net
  effect of these proposals would be an increase of $54 million, or
  4.6%, in total annual retail revenues based on a test year ended
  June 30, 1995. CPL is not seeking interim rate relief, but will
  implement bonded rates in May 1996, the earliest date permitted by
  law.  CPL also is seeking to reconcile $229 million of fuel costs
  incurred during the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.
  CPL's previous request to reconcile fuel costs from March 1, 1990
  to June 30, 1994 in Docket No. 13650 was consolidated with the
  current rate review.  If the requested increase and other
  adjustments in rate structure are approved, CPL has committed not
  to increase its base rates prior to January 1, 2001, subject to
  certain force majeure events.

       CPL is requesting this rate review in large part as a result
  of the expiration of the amortization of its Mirror CWIP
  liability.  The Mirror CWIP liability was amortized to income in
  declining amounts over a five-year period from 1991 through 1995
  pursuant to rate settlements reached by CPL in 1990 and 1991.  In
  1995, Mirror CWIP provided $41 million in non-cash earnings at
  CPL.  Also included in the request are proposals by CPL to
  accelerate recovery of nuclear and regulatory assets as a way to
  proactively address certain assets that could possibly be
  unrecoverable or stranded in a more competitive electric utility
  industry.  In a preliminary order issued December 21, 1995, the
  Texas Commission expanded the scope of the rate review to address
  certain competitive issues facing the electric utility industry.
  The competitive issues to be addressed by CPL in a supplemental
  filing due April 1, 1996, are: (i) the calculation of rates on an
  unbundled or functional basis (i.e., generation, transmission and
  distribution); (ii) the current value of CPL's generating assets
  as compared to estimates of the market value of such assets under
  alternate future industry structures; (iii) the application of
  performance based ratemaking; (iv) potential revisions in the
  methodology of reconciling and recovering fuel costs; and (v) the
  Texas Commission's authority to introduce competition in the
  electric utility industry under existing law.

       On February 13, 1996, intervening parties filed testimony in
  the revenue requirements phase of CPL's base rate case.  Among the
  parties that filed testimony were the OPUC which recommended a
  base rate decrease of approximately $75 million on a total company
  basis and the Cities which recommended a base rate reduction of
  approximately $52 million on a total company basis.

       On February 20, 1996, the Staff filed testimony recommending
  an increase in total company base rates of approximately $30
  million.  Certain elements of the Staff's proposal are described
  below.

       The Staff recommended a return on common stock equity of
  11.35% compared to the 12.25% return on common equity requested by
  CPL.  The Staff recommended a disallowance of $16 million in costs
  billed for administrative services by CSW Services to CPL on the
  basis that the specific benefits to CPL were not clearly
  identified.  Additionally, the Staff recommended a $7 million
  reduction in CPL's current annual depreciation accrual and a $3
  million reduction in CPL's requested accrual for decommissioning

                                 CPL
<PAGE> 2-88
  STP.  A comparison of the Staff's recommendation for a base rate
  increase, compared to CPL's claimed revenue deficiency is provided
  in the CPL RATE REVIEW COMPARISON table.

            Staff recommended revenue increase (2)      $30

            (1)  The total company rate increase requested by
                 CPL was reduced from $103 million to $78 million
                 ($71 million allocated to the Texas retail
                 jurisdiction) in accordance with rate settlements
                 entered into by CPL in 1990 and 1991.
            (2)  The Staff recommended that CPL be granted a $23
                 million base rate increase and an annual increase
                 of $7 million in customer service charges.

       The Staff and Cities recently filed testimony on the fuel
  portion of the rate case recommending a reduction to CPL's
  eligible fuel costs of $16 million and $32 million, respectively.

       After completion of hearings in all phases of the rate case,
  which began in late February 1996 and are expected to conclude
  during the third quarter of 1996, the ALJs assigned to hear the
  case will issue a proposal for decision for consideration by the
  Texas Commission.  Testimony filed by parties to the rate case,
  including the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJs or the
  Texas Commission.  A final decision on the rate request is not
  anticipated from the Texas Commission prior to December 1996.

       CPL's management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of CPL's
  rate case, although management believes that the ultimate
  resolution will not have a material adverse effect on CPL's
  results of operations or financial condition.  However, if CPL
  ultimately is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate rate relief, CPL
  could experience a material adverse effect on its results of
  operations and financial condition.

       CPL 1995 Agreement
       On April 5, 1995, CPL reached an agreement in principle with
  other parties to pending regulatory proceedings involving base
  rate, fuel and prudence issues relating to an outage experienced
  at STP during 1993 and 1994.  On May 16, 1995, CPL filed the CPL
  1995 Agreement with the Texas Commission.  Pursuant to the CPL
  1995 Agreement, base rate refunds, fuel refunds and the reduction
  of CPL's fuel factors were implemented during the summer of 1995.
  Under the CPL 1995 Agreement, CPL provided customers a one-time
  base rate refund of $50 million.  In addition, CPL refunded
  approximately $30 million in over-recovered fuel costs through
  April 1995.  Furthermore, CPL did not charge customers for $62.25
  million in replacement power costs and related interest primarily
  associated with the 1993-1994 STP outage.  The CPL 1995 Agreement
  did not result in any ongoing change in base rate levels and
  provided that there would be no new rate review requests filed
  prior to September 28, 1995.  CPL also reduced its fuel factors,
  effective in July 1995, by approximately $55 million on an annual
  basis due to projections of lower fuel costs.  Hearings on the CPL
  1995 Agreement were held on July 19, 1995, and the final written
  Texas Commission order approving the CPL 1995 Agreement was
  received on October 4, 1995.  Details of the items in the CPL 1995


                               CPL

  Agreement and the total 1995 earnings impact for CPL, including
  certain accounting provisions, are set forth in the following
  table.

       CPL Deferred Accounting
       CPL was granted deferred accounting treatment for certain
  STP Unit 1 and 2 costs by Texas Commission orders issued in
  October 1990 and December 1990, respectively.  In 1994, the
  Supreme Court sustained deferred accounting as an appropriate
  mechanism for the Texas Commission to use in preserving the
  financial integrity of CPL, but remanded CPL's case to the Court
  of Appeals to consider certain substantial evidence points of
  error not previously decided by the Court of Appeals given its
  prior determinations.  On August 16, 1995, the Court of Appeals
  rendered its opinion in the remand proceeding and affirmed the
  Texas Commission's order in all respects.

       CPL believes that the language of the Supreme Court's
  opinion suggests that the appropriateness of allowing deferred
  accounting may be reviewed under a financial integrity standard in
  the first case in which the deferred STP costs are recovered
  through rates.  If the courts decide that subsequent review under
  the financial integrity standard is required, that review would be
  conducted in a remand of the STP Unit 1 and 2 orders.  Pending the
  ultimate resolution of CPL's deferred accounting issues, CPL is
  unable to predict how its deferred accounting orders will
  ultimately be resolved by the Texas Commission.

       If CPL's deferred accounting matters are not favorably
  resolved, CPL could experience a material adverse effect on its
  results of operations and financial condition.  While CPL's
  management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these
  matters, management believes CPL will receive approval of its
  deferred accounting orders or will be successful in renegotiation
  of its rate orders, so that there will be no material adverse
  effect on CPL's results of operation or financial condition.

       CPL Westinghouse Litigation
       CPL and other owners of STP were plaintiffs in a lawsuit
  filed in October 1990 in the District Court in Matagorda County,
  Texas against Westinghouse, seeking damages and other relief.  The
  suit alleged that Westinghouse supplied STP with defective steam
  generator tubes that are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.
  On December 8, 1995, CPL and the other owners of STP settled the
  lawsuit.  While the court order prohibits disclosure of the terms
  of the settlement, CPL believes the litigation was settled on
  terms that provided satisfactory consideration to CPL and STP and
  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of
  operations or financial condition of CPL.

       CPL Civil Penalties
       In October 1995, the NRC notified HLP of a Notice of
  Violation and proposed penalties totaling $160,000 related to
  events that occurred at STP in May 1992.  The Notice of Violation
  and penalties reflect the NRC's belief that certain STP employees
  were terminated as a result of raising safety concerns with the
  NRC.  The Notice of Violation was the result of a Department of
  Labor decision and order in April 1995 and is awaiting final
  action by the Secretary of Labor.  HLP is not required to reply to
  the NRC's Notice of Violation or pay the penalties pending the

                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-90
  Secretary of Labor's final decision.  The NRC indicated that the
  proposed civil penalties reflect minimum penalties allowed because
  of improvements made to the STP Employee Concerns Program since
  1992.  CPL's share of any penalty that is ultimately paid would be
  approximately 25%, reflecting its ownership interest in STP.

        CPL Industrial Road and Industrial Metals Site
        Three suits naming CPL and others as defendants relating to
  a third-party owned and operated site in Corpus Christi, Texas
  formerly used for commercial reclamation of used electrical
  transformers, lead acid batteries and other scrap metals, are
  currently pending in federal and state court in Corpus Christi,
  Texas.  Plaintiffs' complaints seek damages for alleged property
  damage and health impairment as a result of operations on the site
  and cleanup activities.  Management cannot predict the outcome of
  these suits.  However, management believes that CPL has defenses
  to the plaintiffs' complaints and intends to defend the suits
  vigorously.  Management also believes that the ultimate resolution
  of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on CPL's
  results of operations or financial condition.

       Other
       CPL is party to various other legal claims, actions and
  complaints arising in the normal course of business.  Management
  does not expect disposition of these matters to have a material
  adverse effect on CPL's results of operations or financial
  condition.


3.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

  Construction and Capital Expenditures

       It is estimated that CPL will spend approximately $137
  million, including AFUDC, in construction expenditures during
  1996.  Substantial commitments have been made in connection with
  this capital expenditure program.

  Fuel Commitments

        To supply a portion of the fuel requirements, CPL has
  entered into various commitments for procurement of fuel.

  Other Commitments and Contingencies

       CPL Nuclear Insurance
       In connection with the licensing and operation of STP, the
  owners have purchased the maximum limits of nuclear liability
  insurance, as required by law, and have executed indemnification
  agreements with the NRC in accordance with the financial
  protection requirements of the Price-Anderson Act.

       The Price-Anderson Act, a comprehensive statutory
  arrangement providing limitations on nuclear liability and
  governmental indemnities, is in effect until August 1, 2002.  The
  limit of liability under the Price-Anderson Act for licensees of
  nuclear power plants is $8.92 billion per incident, effective as
  of January 1995.  The owners of STP are insured for their share of
  this liability through a combination of private insurance
  amounting to $200 million and a mandatory industry-wide program
  for self-insurance totaling $8.72 billion.  The maximum amount
  that each licensee may be assessed under the industry-wide program
  of self-insurance following a nuclear incident at an insured
  facility is $75.5 million per reactor, which may be adjusted for
  inflation, plus a five percent charge for legal expenses, but not
  more than $10 million per reactor for each nuclear incident in any
  one year.  CPL and each of the other STP owners are subject to
  such assessments, which CPL and other owners have agreed will be
  allocated on the basis of their respective ownership interests in
  STP.  For purposes of these assessments, STP has two licensed
  reactors.

                               CPL
<PAGE> 2-91

       The owners of STP currently maintain on-site decontamination
  liability and property damage insurance in the amount of $2.75
  billion provided by ANI and NEIL.  Policies of insurance issued by
  ANI and NEIL stipulate that policy proceeds must be used first to
  pay decontamination and cleanup costs before being used to cover
  direct losses to property.  Under project agreements, CPL and the
  other owners of STP will share the total cost of decontamination
  liability and property insurance for STP, including premiums and
  assessments, on a pro rata basis, according to each owner's
  respective ownership interest in STP.

       CPL purchases, for its own account, a NEIL I Business
  Interruption and/or Extra Expense policy.  This insurance will
  reimburse CPL for extra expenses incurred for replacement
  generation or purchased power as the result of a covered accident
  that shuts down production at one or both of the STP Units for
  more than 21 consecutive weeks.  In the event of an outage of STP
  Units 1 and 2 and the outage is the result of the same accident,
  insurance will reimburse CPL up to 80% of the single unit
  recovery.  The maximum amount recoverable for a single unit outage
  is $86.02 million for Unit 1 and $85.96 million for Unit 2.  CPL
  is subject to an additional assessment up to $1.6 million for the
  current policy year in the event that insured losses at a nuclear
  facility covered under the NEIL I policy exceeds the accumulated
  funds available under the policy.

       On August 28, 1994, CPL filed a claim under the NEIL I
  policy relating to the 1993-1994 outage at STP Units 1 and 2.
  NEIL has denied the claim.  CPL management is currently evaluating
  its options regarding this claim, but cannot predict the ultimate
  outcome of this matter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Central Power and
Light Company:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of capitalization of Central Power and Light Company (a Texas
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Central and South West
Corporation)  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of CPL's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Central Power and Light Company  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

     In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, CPL changed its methods of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental
Schedule II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit have
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in
all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the financial statements of Central Power and Light
Company as well as other information contained in this Annual
Report.  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the
best estimates and judgments of management, giving due consideration
to materiality.  Financial information contained elsewhere in this
Annual Report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

     The  financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted
access to all financial records and related data, including minutes
of all meetings of shareholders, the board of directors and
committees of the board.  CPL believes that representations made to
the independent auditors during its audit were valid and
appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit report is presented
elsewhere in this report.

     CPL maintains a system of internal controls to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization, that the financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of CPL are properly safeguarded against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system includes a
documented organizational structure and division of responsibility,
established policies and procedures including a policy on ethical
standards which provides that CPL will maintain the highest legal
and ethical standards, and the careful selection, training and
development of our employees.

     Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal control system following standards established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board,
operating through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely
of directors who are not officers or employees of CPL  provides
oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of
internal controls, no internal control system can provide absolute
assurance that errors will not occur.  However, management strives
to maintain a balance, recognizing that the cost of such a system
should not exceed the benefits derived.

     CPL believes that, in all material respects, its system of
internal controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding of
assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
functioned effectively as of December 31, 1995.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Reference is made to PSO's Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement and Selected
Financial Data.  The information contained therein should be read in
conjunction with, and is essential to understanding, the following
discussion and analysis.


OVERVIEW

     Net income for common stock for 1995 was $81 million,
representing a 20% increase from 1994 net income for common stock of
$67 million.  The increase was due primarily to decreased operating
and maintenance expenses and the sale of a non-utility fiber optic
telecommunication property during 1995.

     Net income for common stock for 1994 was $67 million, a 47%
increase from 1993.  The increase was due primarily to increased
energy sales to retail customers and sales for resale to other
electric utilities due to increased market place demand and the 1993
restructuring charges of $25 million.


RESTRUCTURING

     During 1993, CSW announced a restructuring under which the CSW
System restructured the Electric Operating Companies (including PSO)
under a new business unit called CSW Electric and centralized many
common service functions into CSW Services in order to reduce costs
and improve efficiency and productivity.  The restructuring included
restaffing positions throughout the CSW System and a reduction in
the workforce by more than 7% system-wide.  PSO's restructuring
costs were initially estimated to be $25 million and were expensed
in 1993.  The actual costs of the restructuring, approximately $24
million, were incurred primarily during 1994.  PSO has realized a
number of benefits from the restructuring, including increased
efficiencies and synergies through the elimination of previously
duplicated functions.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Overview
     PSO's need for capital results primarily from the construction
of facilities to provide reliable electric service to its customers.
Accordingly, internally generated funds should meet most of  the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are
not sufficient, PSO's financial condition should allow it access to
the capital markets.

     Construction Expenditures
     PSO maintains a continuing construction program, the nature and
extent of which is based upon current and estimated future demands
upon the system.  Planned construction expenditures for PSO for the
next three years are primarily to improve and expand distribution
facilities and will be funded primarily through internally generated
funds.  These improvements will be required to meet the anticipated
needs of new customers and the growth in the requirements of existing
customers.  Construction expenditures, including AFUDC, for PSO were
approximately $102 million in 1995, $131 million in 1994 and $95
million in 1993.  PSO's estimated total
construction expenditures, including AFUDC, for the years 1996
through 1998 are presented in the following table.


                               PSO

                           $68     $72     $69    $209

     The foregoing consists of forward looking information and,
accordingly, actual results may differ materially from such
projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions.
Such assumptions are based on numerous factors, including factors
such as the rate of load growth, escalation of construction costs,
changes in lead times in manufacturing, inflation, the availability
and pricing of alternatives to construction, environmental and other
regulation, delays from regulatory hearings, adequacy of rate relief
and the availability of necessary external capital.  Changes in
those and other factors could cause PSO to defer or accelerate
construction or to sell or buy more power, which would affect its
cash position, revenues and income to an extent that cannot now be
reliably predicted.

     Although PSO does not believe that it will require substantial
additions of generating capacity through the end of the decade, the
CSW System's internal resource plan presently anticipates that any
additional capacity needs will come from a variety of sources
including projected coal- and lignite-fired generating plants for
which PSO has invested approximately $38 million in prior years for
plant sites, engineering studies and lignite reserves.  Should
future plans exclude these plants for environmental, economical  or
other reasons, PSO would evaluate the probability of recovery of
these investments and may record appropriate reserves.

     Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1995, the capitalization ratios of PSO were
55% common stock equity, 2% preferred stock and 43% long-term debt.
PSO's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.5% at December 31, 1995.
PSO continually monitors the capital markets for opportunities to
lower its cost of capital through refinancing.  PSO continues to be
committed to maintaining financial flexibility by maintaining a
strong capital structure and favorable securities ratings which
should allow funds to be obtained from the capital markets when
required.

     In February 1996, PSO filed a shelf registration statement with
the SEC for the sale of up to $75 million of Senior Notes.  In March
1996, PSO issued $30 million of MTNs, Series A under the shelf
registration statement described in the preceding sentence.  The
proceeds were used to repay a portion of PSO's short-term borrowing
and to reimburse PSO's treasury for the scheduled maturity of $25
million aggregate principal amount of FMBs on March 1, 1996.  PSO
may offer the remaining $45 million of Senior Notes available under
its shelf registration statement from time to time subject to market
conditions and other factors.  The proceeds of any such offering may
be used to redeem FMBs, repay short-term debt or provide working
capital.

     Short-Term Financing
     PSO, together with other members of CSW System, has established
a CSW System money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings.  These
loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates approximating the
CSW System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  At December 31, 1995
PSO's short-term borrowing limit from the money pool was
approximately $93 million.  During 1995, the annual weighted average
interest rate on PSO's borrowings was 6.1% and the average amount of
PSO's short-term borrowings outstanding was $54 million.  The

                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-98
maximum amount of PSO's short-term borrowings outstanding during
1995 was $90 million, which was the amount outstanding at January
25, 1995.

     Internally Generated Funds
     Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  PSO utilizes
short-term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital requirements
due to the seasonal nature of energy sales.  PSO anticipates that
capital requirements for the period 1996 to 1998 will be met, in
large part, from internal sources.  PSO also anticipates that some
external financing will be required during the period, but the
nature, timing and extent have not yet been determined.  Information
concerning internally generated funds is presented in the following
table.

                                           1995   1994  1993

       Construction Expenditures Provided
         by Internally Generated Funds      87%    85%   99%

     Sales of Accounts Receivable
     PSO sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable, without
recourse, to CSW Credit.  The sales provide PSO with cash
immediately, thereby reducing working capital needs and revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts
receivable sold were $80 million and $71 million, respectively, in
1995, as compared to $91 million and $72 million, respectively, in
1994.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS

     Competition and Industry Challenges
     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting PSO and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic,
political and technological factors.  These factors have resulted in
legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely to result in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in
the future.  As competition in the industry increases, PSO will have
the opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at
risk of losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, PSO
will continue to compete with suppliers of alternative forms of
energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal, some of which may be
cheaper than electricity.  PSO believes that its prices for
electricity and the quality and reliability of its service currently
place it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

     The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy
Policy Act creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding
Company Act and permits utilities, including registered utility
holding companies and non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are
a new category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are
free from most federal and state regulation, including the principal
restrictions of the Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable
broader participation in wholesale power markets by reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act
also allows the FERC, on a case-by-case basis and with certain
restrictions, to order wholesale transmission access and to order
electric utilities to enlarge their transmission systems.  A FERC
order requiring a transmitting utility to provide wholesale
transmission service must include provisions generally that permit
the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services and any
enlargement of the transmission system and associated services.
Wholesale energy markets, including the market for wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment
of the Energy Policy Act.  PSO must compete in the wholesale energy
markets with other public utilities, cogenerators, qualified


                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-99
facilities, EWGs and others for sales of electric power.  While PSO
believes that the Energy Policy Act will continue to make the
wholesale markets more competitive, PSO is unable to predict the
extent to which the Energy Policy Act will impact PSO operations.

     On March 29, 1995, consistent with the direction of the Energy
Policy Act, the FERC announced in a NOPR a requirement that each
public utility that owns and controls transmission facilities in
interstate commerce must unbundle its services and file open access
transmission tariffs under which such utility will offer comparable
open access transmission services to its transmission customers.  In
addition, the FERC revised its proposed mechanisms by which utilities
will be permitted to recover stranded investment costs expected to be
brought about by the proposed changes.  On August 7, 1995, CSW filed
comments on the proposed approach in the NOPR with the FERC.
Although CSW supports the concept of comparable open access for the
nation's transmission service, CSW believes that certain changes must
be made in the FERC's proposed approach of implementing the open
transmission system.  First, with respect to the issue of stranded
investments, the FERC proposed that customers who left the utility
company pay for a portion, but not all, of the costs incurred by the
owner of existing facilities that are not utilized as a result of the
loss of such customers.  CSW raised concerns about the FERC's
proposed methodology for addressing stranded investment because it
did not, in CSW's view, provide for the fair recovery of the full
amount previously invested.  Second, CSW proposed that the FERC adopt
a "power flow pricing" approach whereby all electric systems that
incur costs because of a transmission transaction are compensated, as
opposed to the traditional "postage stamp" method whereby only the
companies that are directly involved in the actual purchase and sale
of the electricity are compensated or charged.

     On February 9, 1996, PSO filed at the FERC complete sets of open
access transmission tariffs for the Southwest Power Pool.  These
tariffs substantially reflect the pro forma tariffs attached to the
FERC's March 29, 1995 NOPR.  Open access and market pricing should
increase marketing opportunities for PSO, but may also expose it to
the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues due to competition with
alternate suppliers.

     Increasing competition in the utility industry brings an
increased need to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail regulatory
environment is beginning to shift from traditional rate base
regulation to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and performance-
based plans encourage efficiencies and increased productivity while
permitting utilities to share in the results.  Retail wheeling, a
major industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel" or move
power from third parties to their own retail customers, is evolving
gradually.  Many states throughout the country currently have
legislation introduced to investigate the issue.  In Oklahoma, a
legislative task force is examining state laws affecting retail
electric companies.  Issues being addressed include retail wheeling,
territorial boundaries, taxes and condemnations.

     PSO believes that retail competition would harm the best
interests of PSO's customers and security holders unless PSO
receives fair recovery of the full amounts previously invested to
finance power plants.  These investments, which were reasonably
incurred, were made by PSO to meet its obligation to serve the
public interest, necessity and convenience.  This obligation has
existed for nearly a century and remains in force under current law.
PSO intends to strongly oppose attempts to impose retail competition
without just compensation for the risks and investments PSO
undertook to serve the public's demand for electricity.

     PSO is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on PSO.  As
the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more
competitive, however, the principal factor determining success is
likely to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability,
availability of capacity, and customer service.

     Regulatory Accounting
     Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS
No. 71, which allows for the recognition and recovery of regulatory
assets, PSO has recognized significant regulatory assets and
liabilities.  Management believes that PSO will continue to meet the


                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-100
criteria for following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event PSO no
longer meets the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off of
regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.  For additional
information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made to NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of PSO, like those of other utility systems,
generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject to
environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses
the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.
Legally, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of
a cleanup.  Usually, however, cleanup costs are allocated among
PRPs.

     PSO is subject to various pending claims alleging that it is a
PRP under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and
cleaning up contaminated property.  PSO anticipates that resolution
of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
material adverse effect on PSO's results of operations or financial
condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ from
site to site, factors that are the basis for the expectation for
specific sites include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly
contributed by PSO, the estimated amount of costs allocated to PSO
and the participation of other parties.  See ITEM 1-BUSINESS  and
NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS for additional
discussion regarding environmental matters.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     SFAS No. 121
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121 to be effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The statement establishes a two-fold test for identification
and quantification of an impaired asset.  The first test in
determining an impairment is to compare the sum of expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) related to an
asset to the carrying amount of the asset.  If the sum of expected
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
asset, then an impairment is recognized.  Once an impairment is
identified, the second part of the test is applied to quantify the
amount of the impairment.  The statement lists several alternative
methods of establishing fair market value and quantifying the
impairment.  Cash flows used to measure possible impairment of an
asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets.  For PSO, the lowest independently
identifiable cash flow level used for this analysis is
jurisdictional rates charged to customers.

     PSO will adopt SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.
Under the current regulatory environment, PSO does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 121 to have a significant impact on PSO's
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  However,
future developments in the electric industry and utility regulation
could jeopardize the full recovery of the carrying cost of certain
investments.  Consequently, PSO is monitoring the changing
conditions facing the electric utility industry.

     SFAS No. 123
     SFAS No. 123 was issued in October 1995 with an effective date
for transactions entered into after December 15, 1995.  This
statement requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions where such value
cannot otherwise be determined, but then allows for two alternative


                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-101
methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current
period.  The alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the
compensation cost, without charging the amount against current
earnings.

     As provided by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, PSO will
continue to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and adopt the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 in 1996.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not
impact PSO's consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Electric Operating Revenues
     Electric operating revenues decreased 7% to $690.8 million
during 1995 from $740.5 million during 1994.  The decrease in 1995
was due primarily to decreased fuel recovery and a decrease in
weather-related retail customer demand partially offset by customer
growth.

     Electric operating revenues for 1994 increased 5% to $740.5
million from $707.5 million during 1993.  The increase in 1994
reflected an increase of approximately 8% in KWH sales resulting
from increased sales for resale to other electric utilities due to
increased marketplace demand, partially offset by lower unit fuel
costs as described below.  Additionally, 1994 was affected by
increased fuel revenue as discussed below.

     Fuel
     Fuel expense was $273.5 million during 1995, which represented
a 14% decrease compared to $316.5 million during 1994.  The decrease
was primarily attributable to a reduction in the over-recovery of
fuel costs, as well as a reduction in average fuel costs from $1.96
per Mmbtu in 1994 to $1.73 per Mmbtu in 1995.  The decrease in
average unit fuel costs was attributable to the settlement of
certain coal transportation litigation and a reduction in the spot
market price of natural gas.  The decrease was partially offset by a
3% increase in KWH generation.

     Fuel expense for 1994 increased approximately 6% to $316.5
million in 1994 from $298.9 million in 1993. Fuel expense for 1994
increased primarily as a result of the termination of the FUSER
Program effective October 1993.  See ITEM 1-BUSINESS for additional
information relating to the FUSER program.  In 1994, fuel expense
was also affected by a 17% increase in KWH generation and an over-
recovery of fuel costs from customers, which was previously recorded
as deferred fuel, offset in part by a reduction in average unit fuel
costs. The average unit fuel cost for 1994 was $1.96 per Mmbtu, a
decrease of approximately 18% from 1993 levels.  The decrease in per
unit fuel cost reflects the reversal of prior years accruals for
potential liabilities related to coal transportation, as well as
lower costs for natural gas and coal.

     Purchased Power
     Purchased power expenses decreased approximately 32% to $23.6
million for 1995 from $34.9 million in 1994.  Purchased power
expenses for 1994 increased approximately $2.2 million or 7% when
compared to 1993.  Both 1995 and 1994 were impacted by the 1994
increases in purchases of economy energy.

     Other Operating Expenses
     Other operating expenses decreased 3% to $116.7 million during
1995 from $120.2 million during 1994.  The decrease was due
primarily to a net decrease in customer related expenses, decreased
distribution meter expenses and the realization of savings from cost
containment efforts.  The decreases were offset in part by increases
in employee related costs and additional transmission expenses
associated with the completion and placement in service of a new
HVdc tie in 1995.


                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-102
     Other operating expenses in 1994 were $120.2 million, a
decrease of 5% when compared to other operating expenses of $127.1
million in 1993.  The decrease was due to the 1993 write-off of
approximately $5 million of certain lignite properties and accrued
mine reclamation expenses of approximately $3 million.

    Restructuring Charges
    Restructuring charges reflect the original accrual of $25
million in 1993 which was subsequently reduced by $0.2 million and
$0.5 million in 1994 and 1995, respectively, resulting in total
restructuring costs of $24.3 million.

     Maintenance
     Maintenance expenses in 1995 decreased 21% to $35.4 million
from $44.9 million in 1994 as a result of the 1994 write-off of
certain deferred expenses associated with the Tulsa Power Station.
Also contributing to the decrease was the realization of savings
from cost containment efforts.

     Depreciation and Amortization
     Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.6 million
and $4.0 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively, when compared to
the prior years due primarily to increases in depreciable property.

     Income Taxes
     Income tax expense in 1995 was affected by higher pre-tax
income, offset by prior year tax adjustments.  Income tax expense
increased approximately $15.2 million or 69% in 1994 as compared
to 1993 primarily as a result of increased pre-tax income.

     Other Income and Deductions
     Other income and deductions increased $1.3 million for 1995
when compared to 1994 primarily as a result of a $2.7 million gain
on the sale of non-utility fiber optic telecommunication property,
offset in part by an adjustment to reallocate parent company tax
benefits.

     Interest Charges
     Interest on short-term debt and other for 1995 increased 65% to
$6.4 million from $3.8 million in 1994.  The increase was due
primarily to higher levels of short-term debt outstanding at higher
interest rates.  Interest on long-term debt for 1994 decreased
approximately $1.8 million or 6% as a result of the refinancing in
1993 of higher cost debt.  This decrease was offset in part by
increases in short-term borrowings.

     Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
     PSO implemented a number of accounting changes in 1993.  These
included the adoption of SFAS No. 112 and SFAS No. 109.  PSO also
changed its method of accounting for unbilled revenues.  These
accounting changes had a cumulative effect of increasing net income
approximately $6 million.

     Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the national Consumer
Price Index, have averaged approximately 2.8% during the three years
ended December 31, 1995.  PSO believes that inflation, at this
level, does not materially affect its consolidated results of
operations or financial condition.  However, under existing
regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant is
recoverable from customers.  As a result, cash flows designed to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  See CSW's NOTE 1 on pages 2-32 to 2-37.


2.LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

       PSO Gas Transportation and Fuel Management Fees
       An order issued by the Oklahoma Commission in 1991 required
  that the level of gas transportation and fuel management fees,
  paid to Transok by PSO, permitted for recovery through the fuel
  adjustment clause be reviewed in PSO's 1993 rate proceeding.  This
  portion of the 1993 rate review was subsequently bifurcated.  In
  March 1995, an order was issued by the Oklahoma Commission
  approving an agreement which allows PSO to recover approximately
  $28.4 million of transportation and fuel management fees in base
  rates using 1991 determinants and approximately $1 million through
  the fuel adjustment clause.  The agreement also requires the phase-
  in of competitive bidding of natural gas transportation
  requirements in excess of 165 MMcf/d.

       PSO Gas Purchase Contracts
       PSO has been named defendant in complaints filed in federal
  and state courts of Oklahoma and Texas in 1984 through 1995 by gas
  suppliers alleging claims arising out of certain gas purchase
  contracts.  The plaintiffs seek relief through the filing dates as
  well as attorneys' fees.  In January 1996, complaints representing
  approximately $10 million in claims were settled.  Remaining
  complaints currently total approximately $1 million in claimed
  actual damages.  The settlements did not have a material effect on
  PSO's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
  The remaining suits are in the preliminary stages.  Management
  cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.  However,
  management believes that PSO has defenses to the remaining
  complaints and intends to defend the suits vigorously.  Management
  also believes that the ultimate resolution of the remaining
  complaints will not have a material adverse effect on PSO's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO PCB Cases
       PSO has been named a defendant in complaints filed in
  federal and state courts of Oklahoma in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1993 and
  1996.  The complaints allege, among other things, that some of the
  plaintiffs and the property of other plaintiffs were contaminated
  with PCBs and other toxic by-products following certain incidents,
  including transformer malfunctions, in April 1982, December 1983
  and May 1984.  To date, all complaints, except for claims
  representing approximately $13 million in alleged damages and
  claims filed in February 1996 for additional unspecified actual
  and punitive damages, have been dismissed, certain of which
  resulted from settlements among the parties.  Management believes
  that PSO has defenses to the remaining complaints and intends to
  defend the suits vigorously.  Moreover, management believes that
  the remaining claims are covered under insurance.  Management also
  believes that the ultimate resolution of the remaining complaints
  will not have a material adverse effect on PSO's consolidated
  results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
       In June 1992, PSO filed suit in the United States District
  Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against Burlington
  Northern seeking declaratory relief under a long-term contract for
  the transportation of coal.  In July 1992, Burlington Northern
  asserted counterclaims for unspecified damages against PSO
  alleging that PSO breached the contract.  In December 1993, PSO

                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-110
  amended its suit against Burlington Northern seeking damages and
  declaratory relief under federal and state antitrust laws.  In
  December 1995, PSO and Burlington Northern reached a compromise
  settlement of all outstanding claims and counterclaims, and the
  action was dismissed with prejudice.  The settlement did not have
  a material adverse effect on PSO's consolidated results of
  operations or financial condition.

       PSO Burlington Northern Arbitration
       In May 1994, in an arbitration related to the Burlington
  Northern coal transportation contract described above, an
  arbitration panel made an award in favor of PSO concerning basic
  transportation rates under the coal transportation contract and
  concerning the contract mechanism for adjustment for future
  transportation rates.  This arbitration award was then the subject
  of litigation in the United States District Courts for the
  Northern Districts of Oklahoma and Texas and the United States
  Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  In December 1995, this
  litigation was settled as part of the compromise settlement of the
  related lawsuit described above.  Under the settlement, a $16.4
  million judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Northern
  District of Oklahoma confirming the arbitration award became final
  and was then released and satisfied of record.

       PSO Ash Creek Coal Mine Reclamation
       In August 1994, PSO received approval from the Wyoming
  Department of Environmental Quality to begin reclamation of a coal
  mine in Sheridan, Wyoming, owned by Ash Creek, a wholly owned
  subsidiary of PSO.  Ash Creek recorded a $3 million liability in
  1993 for the estimated reclamation costs and subsequently accrued
  an additional $500,000 in 1995.  Actual reclamation work commenced
  in September 1995, with completion expected in late 1996.
  Surveillance monitoring will continue for ten years after final
  reclamation.  Management believes that ultimate resolution of this
  matter will not have a material adverse effect on PSO's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

       PSO MCPC
       In 1989, PSO entered into certain long-term contracts with
  MCPC, a cogeneration development company located in northeastern
  Oklahoma.  These contracts include: (i) an Interconnection and
  Interchange Agreement providing terms and conditions under which
  MCPC could connect its electric generating facilities to PSO's
  transmission system and providing for future transmission by PSO
  of specified amounts of MCPC's power to an unaffiliated utility;
  (ii) a Stock/Asset Purchase Agreement which allows PSO under
  certain conditions to acquire the stock or assets of MCPC; and
  (iii) an Energy Conversion Agreement which required PSO to deliver
  natural gas to MCPC for conversion to electrical energy to be
  delivered by MCPC to PSO.  Under the Energy Conversion Agreement,
  PSO had the right to dispatch up to 60 MWH per hour of quick-start
  capability.

       In 1993, MCPC filed an application with the Oklahoma
  Commission requesting relief through the modification of the
  existing Energy Conversion Agreement.  An emergency order was
  issued under MCPC's application which increased the payment made
  by PSO to MCPC for energy purchases and decreased the amount of
  firm energy MCPC was required to deliver to PSO.  The emergency
  order was subject to a permanent ruling.

       In July 1993, PSO commenced a lawsuit in the District Court
  of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, seeking a declaratory judgment that PSO
  was entitled to terminate the Energy Conversion Agreement as of
  August 1, 1993, because of a default committed by MCPC.  On March
  31, 1995, PSO, MCPC and the Oklahoma Commission Staff signed a
  joint settlement resolving all issues pursuant to the various
  proceedings before the Oklahoma Commission and the District Court
  of Tulsa County, Oklahoma.  The settlement, among other things,
  eliminated a requirement that MCPC deliver an annual minimum of
  394,200 MWH of Assured Delivery Energy and related provisions
  associated with underdelivery charges.  Most other provisions of
  the agreement between PSO and MCPC were kept intact.  The Oklahoma
  Commission issued an order in May 1995 approving the settlement.
  The settlement is on terms satisfactory to PSO and will not have a


                               PSO
<PAGE> 2-111
  material adverse effect on PSO's consolidated results of
  operations or financial condition.

       Other
       PSO is party to various other legal claims, actions and
  complaints arising in the normal course of business.  Management
  does not expect disposition of these matters to have a material
  adverse effect on PSO's consolidated results of operations or
  financial condition.


3.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

       It is estimated that PSO will spend approximately $68
  million, including AFUDC, in capital expenditures during 1996.
  Substantial commitments have been made in connection with the 1996
  construction program.

       To supply the fuel requirements of its
  generating plants, PSO has entered into various commitments for
  the procurement of fuel.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Public Service Company
of Oklahoma:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and consolidated statements of capitalization of Public Service
Company of Oklahoma (an Oklahoma corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Central and South West Corporation) and subsidiary
company, as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows,
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.
These financial statements are the responsibility of PSO's
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Public Service Company of Oklahoma and subsidiary company as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

     In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, PSO changed its methods of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental
Schedule II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit have
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in
all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the consolidated financial statements of Public
Service Company of Oklahoma and its subsidiary company as well as
other information contained in this Annual Report.  The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and, in
some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates and
judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is
consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.

     The consolidated financial statements have been audited by the
independent accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given
unrestricted access to all financial records and related data,
including minutes of all meetings of shareholders, the board of
directors and committees of the board.  PSO and its subsidiary
believe that representations made to the independent auditors during
their audit were valid and appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit
report is presented elsewhere in this report.

     PSO, together with its subsidiary company, maintains a system
of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are executed in accordance with management's
authorization, that the consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of the companies are properly safeguarded
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system
includes a documented organizational structure and division of
responsibility, established policies and procedures including a
policy on ethical standards which provides that PSO will maintain
the highest legal and ethical standards, and the careful selection,
training and development of our employees.

     Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal control system following standards established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board,
operating through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely
of directors who are not officers or employees of PSO or its
subsidiary, provides oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of
internal controls, no internal control system can provide absolute
assurance that errors will not occur.  However, management strives
to maintain a balance, recognizing that the cost of such a system
should not exceed the benefits derived.

     PSO and its subsidiary believe that, in all material respects,
its system of internal controls over financial reporting and over
safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition functioned effectively as of December 31, 1995.

SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Reference is made to SWEPCO's Financial Statements and related
Notes to Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data.  The
information contained therein should be read in conjunction with, and
is essential in understanding, the following discussion and analysis.


OVERVIEW

     Net income for common stock increased 11% during 1995 to
approximately $113.9 million from approximately $102.4 million in
1994 due primarily to an increase in non-fuel revenue.  The increase
in non-fuel revenue was attributable to a 4% increase in KWH sales
from weather-related demand and customer growth.

     Net income for common stock increased 30% during 1994 to
approximately $102.4 million from approximately $78.5 million in
1993, due primarily to the effects of restructuring costs recorded
during 1993.


RESTRUCTURING

     During 1993, CSW announced a restructuring under which the CSW
System restructured the Electric Operating Companies (including
SWEPCO) under a new business unit called CSW Electric and
centralized many common service functions into CSW Services in order
to reduce costs and improve efficiency and productivity.  The
restructuring included restaffing positions throughout the CSW
System and a reduction in the workforce by more than 7% system-wide.
SWEPCO's restructuring costs were initially estimated to be $25
million and were expensed in 1993.  The actual costs of the
restructuring, approximately $20 million, were incurred primarily
during 1994.  SWEPCO is realizing a number of benefits from the
restructuring, including increased efficiencies and synergies
through the elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This
leads to enhanced communication and efficiency, which SWEPCO
believes should translate into a reduction in the rate of growth in
operating and maintenance costs.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Overview
     SWEPCO's need for capital results primarily from its
construction of facilities to provide reliable electric service to
its customers.  Accordingly, internally generated funds should meet
most of the capital requirements.  However, if internally generated
funds are not sufficient, SWEPCO's financial condition should allow
it access to the capital markets.

     Construction Expenditures
     SWEPCO maintains a continuing construction program, the nature
and extent of which is based upon current and estimated future
demands upon the system.  Planned construction expenditures for
SWEPCO for the next three years are primarily to improve and expand
distribution facilities and will be funded primarily through
internally generated funds.  These improvements will be required to
meet the anticipated needs of new customers and the growth in the
requirements of existing customers.  Construction expenditures,
including AFUDC, for SWEPCO were approximately $115 million in 1995,
$153 million in 1994 and $176 million in 1993.  Included in the 1993
construction expenditures is approximately $35 million in capital
expenditures that were incurred for the acquisition of BREMCO, a

SWEPCO's service territory in Louisiana.  SWEPCO's estimated total
construction expenditures, including AFUDC, for the years 1996
through 1998 are presented in the following table.

     The foregoing consists of forward looking information and,
accordingly, actual results may differ materially from such
projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions.
Such assumptions are based on numerous factors, including factors
such as the rate of load growth, escalation of construction costs,
changes in lead times in manufacturing, inflation, the availability
and pricing of alternatives to construction, environmental and other
regulation, delays from regulatory hearings, adequacy of rate relief
and the availability of necessary external capital.  Changes in
those and other factors could cause SWEPCO to defer or accelerate
construction or to sell or buy more power, which would affect its
cash position, revenues and income to an extent that cannot now be
reliably predicted.

     Although SWEPCO does not believe that it will require
substantial additions of generating capacity through the end of the
decade, the CSW System's internal resource plan presently
anticipates that any additional capacity needs will come from a
variety of sources including projected coal- and lignite-fired
generating plants for which SWEPCO has invested approximately $34
million in prior years for plant sites, engineering studies and
lignite reserves.  Should future plans exclude these plants for
environmental, economical  or other reasons, SWEPCO would evaluate
the probability of recovery of these investments and may record
appropriate reserves.

     Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1995, the capitalization ratios of SWEPCO
were 51% common stock equity, 4% preferred stock and 45% long-term
debt.  SWEPCO's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.5% at December
31, 1995.  SWEPCO continually monitors the capital markets for
opportunities to lower its cost of capital through refinancing.
SWEPCO is committed to maintaining financial flexibility through a
strong capital structure and favorable securities ratings in order to
access the capital markets opportunistically or when required.

     Short-Term Financing
     SWEPCO, together with other members of CSW System, has
established a CSW System money pool to coordinate short-term
borrowings.  These loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates
approximating the CSW System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  At
December 31, 1995 SWEPCO's short-term borrowing limit from the money
pool was approximately $133 million.  During 1995, the annual
weighted average interest rate on SWEPCO's borrowings was 6.0% and
the average amount of SWEPCO short-term borrowings outstanding was
$79 million.  The maximum amount of SWEPCO short-term borrowings
outstanding during 1995 was $115 million, which was the amount
outstanding at February 7, 1995.

     Internally Generated Funds
     Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  SWEPCO
utilizes short-term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital
requirements due to the seasonal nature of energy sales.  SWEPCO
anticipates that capital requirements for the period 1996 to 1998


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-118
will be met, in large part, from internal sources.  SWEPCO also
anticipates that some external financing will be required during the
period, however the nature, timing and extent have not yet been
determined.  Information concerning internally generated funds is
presented in the following table.

                                              1995    1994   1993

     Sales of Accounts Receivable
     SWEPCO sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable,
without recourse, to CSW Credit.  The sales provide SWEPCO with cash
immediately, thereby reducing working capital needs and revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts
receivable sold were $84 million and $72 million, respectively, in
1995, as compared to $69 million and $62 million, respectively, in
1994.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS

     Competition and Industry Challenges
     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting SWEPCO and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic,
political and technological factors.  These factors have resulted in
legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely to result in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in
the future.  As competition in the industry increases, SWEPCO will
have the opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at
risk of losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, SWEPCO
will continue to compete with suppliers of alternative forms of
energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal, some of which may be
cheaper than electricity.  SWEPCO believes that its prices for
electricity and the quality and reliability of its service currently
place it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

     The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy
Policy Act creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding
Company Act and permits utilities, including registered utility
holding companies and non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are
a new category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are
free from most federal and state regulation, including the principal
restrictions of the Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable
broader participation in wholesale power markets by reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act
also allows the FERC, on a case-by-case basis and with certain
restrictions, to order wholesale transmission access and to order
electric utilities to enlarge their transmission systems.  A FERC
order requiring a transmitting utility to provide wholesale
transmission service must include provisions generally that permit
the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services and any
enlargement of the transmission system and associated services.
Wholesale energy markets, including the market for wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment
of the Energy Policy Act.  SWEPCO must compete in the wholesale
energy markets with other public utilities, cogenerators, qualified
facilities, exempt wholesale generators and others for sales of
electric power.  While SWEPCO believes that the Energy Policy Act
will continue to make the wholesale markets more competitive, SWEPCO
is unable to predict the extent to which the Energy Policy Act will
impact SWEPCO operations.

     On March 29, 1995, consistent with the direction of the Energy
Policy Act, the FERC announced in a NOPR that each public utility
that owns and controls transmission facilities in interstate commerce



                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-119
must unbundle its services and file open access transmission tariffs
under which each utility will offer comparable open access
transmission services to its transmission customers.  In addition,
the FERC revised its proposed mechanisms by which utilities will be
permitted to recover stranded investment costs expected to be brought
about by the proposed changes.  On August 7, 1995, CSW filed comments
on the proposed approach in the NOPR with the FERC.  Although CSW
supports the concept of comparable open access for the nation's
transmission service, CSW believes that certain changes must be made
in the FERC's proposed approach of implementing the open transmission
system.  First, with respect to the issue of stranded investments,
the FERC proposed that customers who left the owner company pay for a
portion, but not all, of the costs incurred by the utility of
existing facilities that are not utilized as a result of the loss of
such customers.  CSW raised concerns about the FERC's proposed
methodology for addressing stranded investment because it did not, in
CSW's view, provide for the fair recovery of the full amount
previously invested.  Second, CSW proposed that the FERC adopt a
"power flow pricing" approach whereby all electric systems that incur
costs because of a transmission transaction are compensated, as
opposed to the traditional "postage stamp" method whereby only the
companies that are directly involved in the actual purchase and sale
of the electricity are compensated or charged.

     On February 9, 1996, SWEPCO filed at the FERC complete sets of
open access transmission tariffs.  These tariffs substantially
reflect the pro forma tariffs attached to the FERC's March 29, 1995
NOPR.  Open access and market pricing should increase marketing
opportunities for SWEPCO, but may also expose it to the risk of loss
of load or reduced revenues due to competition with alternate
suppliers.

     Increasing competition in the utility industry brings an
increased need to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail regulatory
environment is beginning to shift from traditional rate base
regulation to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and performance-
based plans encourage efficiencies and increased productivity while
permitting utilities to share in the results.  Retail wheeling, a
major industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel" or move
power from third parties to their own retail customers, is evolving
gradually.  Many states throughout the country currently have
legislation introduced to investigate the issue.

     SWEPCO believes that retail competition would harm the best
interests of SWEPCO's customers and security holders unless SWEPCO
receives fair recovery of the full amounts previously invested to
finance power plants.  These investments, which were reasonably
incurred, were made by SWEPCO to meet its obligation to serve the
public interest, necessity and convenience.  This obligation has
existed for nearly a century and remains in force under current law.
SWEPCO intends to strongly oppose attempts to impose retail
competition without just compensation for the risks and investments
SWEPCO undertook to serve the public's demand for electricity.

     SWEPCO is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on SWEPCO.  As
the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more competitive,
however, the principal factor determining success is likely to be
price, and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability of capacity,
and customer service.

     Cajun Asset Purchase Proposal
     On March 8, 1996, SWEPCO, together with GSU and the members
committee of Cajun (which represents 10 of the 12 Louisiana
distribution cooperatives that are served by Cajun), submitted to
Cajun's court appointed trustee in bankruptcy a joint proposal
pursuant to which SWEPCO would acquire all of Cajun's non-nuclear
assets, including a three-unit coal-fired plant and a two-unit
natural gas-fired plant, and would serve the member co-ops through
new wholesale power-supply agreements.  In addition, the joint
proposal would, if accepted, resolve litigation between GSU and Cajun
related to the River Bend nuclear generating station, which currently
is owned 30% by Cajun and 70% by GSU.  The joint proposal was
submitted in response to a formal bid procedure established by the
trustee. It is currently anticipated that the trustee will select a
lead proposal in early April, and file a plan of reorganization with
the bankruptcy court on or about April 22, 1996.  The timing and


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-120
completion of any transaction would depend, among other things, upon
bankruptcy court approval of a reorganization plan and receipt by
SWEPCO and CSW of all requisite regulatory approvals.  Cajun filed a
petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code on December 21, 1994 and is currently operating under
the supervision of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle
District of Louisiana.

     PURA
     Amendments to PURA, the legal foundation of electric regulation
in Texas, became effective on September 1, 1995.  Among other
things, the amendments permit pricing flexibility for utilities
facing competitive challenges, provide for a market-driven
integrated resource planning process and mandate comparable open
access transmission service.  In addition, one effect of the
amendments is the deregulation of the wholesale bulk power market in
ERCOT.  However, SWEPCO, as a member of the Southwest Power Pool
rather than ERCOT, will not be directly impacted by this.

     Regulatory Accounting
     Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71, which allows for the recognition and recovery of regulatory
assets, SWEPCO has recognized regulatory assets and liabilities.
Management believes that SWEPCO will continue to meet the criteria
for following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event that SWEPCO no
longer meets the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off of
regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.  For additional
information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made to NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

     Consolidated Taxes
     Prior to 1992, the Texas Commission allowed income taxes to be
recovered in rates based on the federal income tax incurred by a
utility as if it were a stand-alone company.  This "stand-alone"
approach treated the regulated activities of a utility as a separate
entity and considered only those revenues and expenses that are
included in the utility's cost of service to calculate the federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.  However, in 1992 the
Texas Commission changed its method of calculating the federal income
tax component of rates to the "actual tax approach."  This approach
reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions which are not
considered for or included in setting rates for the utility.

     On April 13, 1995, the Supreme Court issued a decision which
holds that the Texas Commission is not required to use the tax
benefits associated with the losses of unregulated affiliates to
reduce tax expense in cost of service.  The Supreme Court also ruled
that the Texas Commission cannot include the income tax deductions
taken by the utility for disallowed expenses when determining the
utility's federal income tax liability.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of SWEPCO, like those of other utility systems,
generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject to
environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses
the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.
Legally, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of
a cleanup.  Usually, however, cleanup costs are allocated among
PRPs.

     SWEPCO is subject to various pending claims alleging that it is
a PRP under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and
cleaning up contaminated property.  SWEPCO anticipates that
resolution of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will
not have a material adverse effect on SWEPCO's results of operations


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-121
or financial condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation
differ from site to site, factors that are the basis for the
expectation for specific sites include the volume and/or type of
waste allegedly contributed by SWEPCO, the estimated amount of costs
allocated to SWEPCO and the participation of other parties.  See
ITEM 1-BUSINESS and NOTE 3. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
for additional discussion regarding environmental matters.


NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     SFAS No. 121
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121 to be effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The statement establishes a two-fold test for identification
and quantification of an impaired asset.  The first test in
determining an impairment is to compare the sum of expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) related to an
asset to the carrying amount of the asset.  If the sum of expected
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
asset, then an impairment is recognized.  Once an impairment is
identified, the second part of the test is applied to quantify the
amount of the impairment.  The statement lists several alternative
methods of establishing fair market value and quantifying the
impairment.  Cash flows used to measure possible impairment of an
asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets.  For SWEPCO, the lowest
independently identifiable cash flow level used for this analysis is
jurisdictional rates charged to customers.

     SWEPCO will adopt SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.
Under the current regulatory environment, SWEPCO does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 121 to have a significant impact on SWEPCO's
results of operations or financial condition.  However, future
developments in the electric industry and utility regulation could
jeopardize the full recovery of the carrying cost of certain
investments.  Consequently, SWEPCO is monitoring the changing
conditions facing the electric utility industry.

     SFAS No. 123
     SFAS No. 123 was issued in October 1995 with an effective date
for transactions entered into after December 15, 1995.  This
statement requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions where such value
cannot otherwise be determined, but then allows for two alternative
methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current
period.  The alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the
compensation cost, without charging the amount against current
earnings.

     As provided by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, SWEPCO will
continue to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and adopt the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 in 1996.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not
impact SWEPCO's results of operations or financial condition.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Electric Operating Revenues
     Total electric operating revenues increased $11.4 million, or
1%, to $836.7 million during 1995 due primarily to a $28.3 million
increase in non-fuel revenues.  The increase in non-fuel revenues was
attributable to a 4% increase in retail KWH sales resulting from
weather-related demand and customer growth.  The increase in non-fuel
revenues was offset in part by a $14.8 million decrease in fuel
revenue due to lower average fuel costs as discussed below.


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-122
     Total electric operating revenues decreased $11.9 million, or
1%, during 1994 due primarily to decreased fuel revenues partially
offset by a 3% increase in retail KWH sales due to customer growth
and a 15% increase in lower margin sales for resale.

     Fuel
     Fuel expense was $318.5 million in 1995, a decrease of 5% when
compared to 1994 fuel expense of $336.4 million.  The decrease in
fuel expense was due primarily to an 8% decrease in the average unit
cost of fuel from $1.75 per Mmbtu in 1994 to $1.61 per Mmbtu in 1995,
which was offset in part by a 3% increase in generation.  The
decrease in the per unit cost of fuel resulted from a decrease in the
spot market price of gas.

     Fuel expense decreased approximately $27.2 million or 7% in 1994
when compared to 1993 due primarily to a decrease in the average unit
cost of fuel from $1.94 per Mmbtu in 1993 to $1.75 per Mmbtu in 1994.
The decrease in unit fuel costs was primarily due to coal contract
negotiations and a decrease in the spot market price of gas.

     Purchased Power
     Purchased power expense decreased approximately $1.2 million, or
6%, during 1995 when compared to 1994 due primarily to a 36% decrease
in purchases, partially offset by a firm contract for additional
operating reserves and on peak capacity.  Purchased power increased
from $13.1 million in 1993 to $20.2 million in 1994 due primarily to
a purchased power contract negotiated as a part of the 1993 purchase
of BREMCO.

     Other Operating
     Other operating expenses increased approximately $2.5 million,
or 2%, during 1995 when compared to 1994.  The increase was due
primarily to an increase in transmission expenses associated with the
completion and placement in service of a new HVdc tie in 1995 and an
increase in employee related costs.

     Restructuring Charges
     Restructuring charges reflect the original accrual of $25.2
million in December 1993 which was subsequently reduced by $5.0
million in 1994 and $0.6 million in 1995, resulting in total
restructuring charges of $19.6 million at December 31, 1995.

     Maintenance
     Maintenance expense decreased approximately $7.4 million, or
15%, during 1994 when compared to 1993.  The decrease was due
primarily to decreased maintenance of distribution facilities and
general plant.

     Depreciation and Amortization
     Depreciation and amortization increased $3.4 million and $5.5
million during 1995 and 1994, respectively, when compared to the
prior years.  The increases during both periods were due primarily to
increases in depreciable plant.

     Taxes, Other than Income
     Taxes, other than income, increased approximately $1.6 million,
or 4%, during 1995 when compared to 1994 due primarily to increases
in ad valorem taxes.

     Income Taxes
     Income tax expense decreased approximately $1.0 million in 1995
due primarily to prior year tax adjustments partially offset by
higher pre-tax income.  Income tax expense increased approximately
$12.7 million, or 43%, in 1994 due primarily to an increase in pre-
tax income.


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-123
     Allowance for Equity and Borrowed Funds Used During Construction
     AFUDC increased approximately $3.2 million and $3.5 million
during 1995 and 1994, respectively, when compared to the prior year
due primarily to increased CWIP balances accruing AFUDC.  Also
contributing to the increase in 1995 was a prior period true-up.

     Interest on Long-Term Debt
     Interest expense on long-term debt was comparable in 1995 and
1994, while it increased approximately $2.4 million, or 6%, in 1994
when compared to 1993 due primarily to an increase in average
balances outstanding.

     Interest on Short-Term Debt and Other
     Interest expense on short-term debt and other increased
approximately $3.1 million, or 41%, during 1995 when compared to 1994
due primarily to higher levels of short-term debt outstanding at
higher short-term interest rates.  Interest expense on short-term
debt and other increased approximately $2.7 million in 1994 when
compared to 1993 due primarily to an interest accrual pursuant to the
terms of a settlement agreement approved by the Texas Commission in
connection with SWEPCO's fuel reconciliation and increased interest
expense associated with short-term debt.

     Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
     Accounting changes in 1993 included the adoption of SFAS 112.
SWEPCO also changed its method of accounting for unbilled revenues.
These accounting changes had a cumulative effect of increasing net
income by $3.4 million.

     Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the national Consumer
Price Index, have averaged approximately 2.8% for the three-year
period ending December 31, 1995.  SWEPCO believes that inflation at
this level does not materially affect SWEPCO's results of operations
or financial condition.  Under existing regulatory practice, however,
only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As
a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant
costs may not be adequate to replace plant in future years.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  See CSW's NOTE 1 on pages 2-32 to 2-37.


2.LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

       SWEPCO Fuel Factor Proceedings
       On October 6, 1995, SWEPCO filed a petition, designated as
  Docket No. 14819, with the Texas Commission to revise its fixed
  fuel factors for the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs.
  SWEPCO was experiencing an over-recovery of fuel costs based on
  application of its then current factors which became effective in
  July 1994.  The original filing with the Texas Commission proposed
  decreasing SWEPCO's fixed fuel factors and refunding to customers
  $7.1 million of cumulative over-recoveries for the period January
  1994 to June 1995.  SWEPCO subsequently revised its petition to
  the Texas Commission, updating the cumulative fuel over-recovery
  to $10.4 million through September 1995.  On December 20, 1995,
  the Texas Commission issued an order approving SWEPCO's revised
  fixed fuel factors and authorizing the refund of $10.8 million,
  including interest, to customers primarily as billing credits on
  January 1996 monthly bills.

       SWEPCO Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
       On January 20, 1995, a state district court in Bowie County,
  Texas, entered judgment in favor of SWEPCO against Burlington
  Northern in a lawsuit regarding rates charged under two rail
  transportation contracts for delivery of coal to SWEPCO's Welsh
  and Flint Creek power plants.  The court awarded SWEPCO
  approximately $72 million covering damages for the period from
  April 27, 1989 through September 26, 1994, post-judgment interest
  and attorneys' fees and granted certain declaratory relief
  requested by SWEPCO.  Burlington Northern appealed the state
  district court's judgment to the Texarkana, Texas Court of
  Appeals.  The appeal is now pending.

       Other
       SWEPCO is party to various other legal claims, actions and
  complaints arising in the normal course of business.  Management
  does not expect disposition of these matters to have a material
  adverse effect on SWEPCO's results of operations or financial
  condition.


3.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

  Construction and Capital Expenditures

       It is estimated that SWEPCO will spend approximately $98
  million, including AFUDC, in construction expenditures during
  1996.  Substantial commitments have been made in connection with
  this capital expenditure program.

  Fuel Commitments

       To supply a portion of the fuel requirements, SWEPCO has
  entered into various commitments for procurement of fuel.


                               SWEPCO
<PAGE> 2-131
       SWEPCO Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant
       In connection with the South Hallsville lignite mining
  contract for its Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant, SWEPCO has agreed,
  under certain conditions, to assume the obligations of the mining
  contractor.  As of December 31, 1995, the maximum amount SWEPCO
  would have to assume was $71.9 million.  The maximum amount may
  vary as the mining contractor's need for funds fluctuates.  The
  contractor's actual obligation outstanding at December 31, 1995
  was $58.7 million.

       SWEPCO South Hallsville Lignite Mine
       As part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas
  Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining at the South
  Hallsville lignite mine, SWEPCO has agreed to provide bond
  guarantees on mine reclamation in the amount of $70 million.
  Since SWEPCO uses self-bonding, the guarantee provides for SWEPCO
  to commit to use its resources to complete the reclamation in the
  event the work is not completed by the third party miner.  The
  current cost to reclaim the mine is estimated to be approximately
  $25 million.

  Other Commitments and Contingencies

       SWEPCO Rental and Lease Commitments
       SWEPCO has entered into various financing arrangements
  primarily with respect to coal transportation and related
  equipment, which are treated as operating leases for rate-making
  purposes.  At December 31, 1995, leased assets of $46 million, net
  of accumulated amortization of $33.7 million, were included in
  electric fixed assets on the balance sheet and at December 31,
  1994, leased assets were $46 million, net of accumulated
  amortization of $30.1 million.  Total charges to SWEPCO's
  operating expenses for expenses associated with these financing
  arrangements were $6.3 million, $6.8 million and $7.1 million for
  the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

       SWEPCO Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
       In 1994, SWEPCO was notified by Mississippi Power that it may
  be a PRP at a MGP site in Biloxi, Mississippi, formerly owned and
  operated by a predecessor of SWEPCO.  SWEPCO worked with
  Mississippi Power to investigate the extent of contamination at
  this site.  The MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan and,
  in January 1995, SWEPCO and Mississippi Power initiated sampling
  pursuant to that work plan.  Contamination at the site was
  identified as a result of the investigation of property and
  adjacent properties.  Soil and grounds water test results were
  sent to the MDEQ for review and comment.  The test results
  confirmed the contamination on the property and indicated the
  possibility of contamination of an adjacent property.  A risk
  assessment has been performed to assist SWEPCO and Mississippi
  Power in determining remediation alternatives.  A final range of
  cleanup costs has not been determined, but based on preliminary
  estimates, SWEPCO has accrued approximately $2 million for its
  portion of the cleanup of this site.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Southwestern Electric
Power Company:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of capitalization of Southwestern Electric Power Company (a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Central and South West
Corporation)  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of SWEPCO's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Southwestern Electric Power Company  as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, SWEPCO changed its method of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental Schedule
II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the
basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit have been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the financial statements of Southwestern Electric
Power Company as well as other information contained in this Annual
Report.  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates
and judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

     The  financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted
access to all financial records and related data, including minutes
of all meetings of shareholders, the board of directors and
committees of the board.  SWEPCO believes that representations made
to the independent auditors during its audit were valid and
appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit report is presented
elsewhere in this report.

     SWEPCO maintains a system of internal controls to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization, that the financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of the companies are properly safeguarded against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system includes a
documented organizational structure and division of responsibility,
established policies and procedures including a policy on ethical
standards which provides that SWEPCO will maintain the highest legal
and ethical standards, and the careful selection, training and
development of our employees.

     Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal control system following standards established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who are not officers or employees of SWEPCO provides oversight to the
financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls, no internal control system can provide absolute assurance
that errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a balance, recognizing that the cost of such a system should not
exceed the benefits derived.

     SWEPCO  believes that, in all material respects, its system of
internal controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding of
assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
functioned effectively as of December 31, 1995.

<PAGE> 2-137
WEST TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

      Reference  is made to WTU's Financial Statements  and  related
Notes  to  Financial  Statements and Selected Financial  Data.   The
information  contained therein should be read in  conjunction  with,
and  is  essential  to understanding, the following  discussion  and
analysis.


OVERVIEW

     Net income for common stock was $34 million in 1995, which
represented a 7% decrease when compared to 1994.  The decrease was
due primarily to increased depreciation, a prior year non-operating
tax adjustment, and an increase in interest charges on long-term
debt.  These effects were partially offset by decreases in other
operating, maintenance, and federal income tax expenses.

     Net income for common stock was $37 million in 1994, a 26%
increase when compared to 1993.  This increase was due primarily to
an increase in retail base revenues and other income and a decrease
in restructuring charges.


RESTRUCTURING

     During 1993, CSW announced a restructuring under which the CSW
System restructured the Electric Operating Companies (including WTU)
under a new business unit called CSW Electric and centralized many
common service functions into CSW Services in order to reduce costs
and improve efficiency and productivity.  The restructuring included
restaffing positions throughout the CSW System and a reduction in
the workforce by more than 7% system-wide. WTU's restructuring costs
were initially estimated to be $15 million and were expensed in
1993.  The actual costs of the restructuring, approximately $13
million, including AFUDC, were incurred primarily during 1994.  WTU
has realized a number of benefits from the restructuring, including
increased efficiencies and synergies through the elimination of
previously duplicated functions.


RATES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

     WTU Stipulation and Agreement
     WTU has been the subject of several pending regulatory matters,
including the following:  (i) a retail rate proceeding and fuel
reconciliation before the Texas Commission in Docket No. 13369; (ii)
Writ of Error to the Supreme Court - review of WTU's 1987 Texas rate
case in Docket No. 7510; and (iii)  the Texas Commission's proceeding
on remand in Docket No. 13949 regarding deferred accounting treatment
for Oklaunion Power Station Unit No. 1 originally authorized in the
Texas Commission's order in Docket No. 7289.

     On September 22, 1995, WTU, along with other major parties to
the above described matters, filed with the Texas Commission a joint
stipulation and agreement to resolve all of these matters.  The WTU
Stipulation and Agreement is a unified package that included: (i) a
retail base rate reduction of approximately $13.5 million annually
starting with WTU's October 1995 revenue month billing cycle; (ii) a
$21 million retail refund which was not attributed to any specific
cause but was inclusive of all claims related to the three above
described litigation and regulatory matters and included the effect
of the rate reduction retroactive to October 1, 1994; (iii) a
reduction of reduced fixed fuel factors by approximately 2%; (iv)
various rate and accounting treatments including a reasonable return



                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-138
on equity for retail operations of 11.375%; and (v) a retail base
rate freeze until October 1, 1998, subject to certain force majeure
provisions.

     On November 9, 1995, the Texas Commission rendered a final order
that implemented the joint stipulation and agreement.  The WTU
Stipulation and Agreement is expected to impact WTU's results of
operations for the next several years, reducing annual earnings by
approximately $8 million beginning in 1996.  The WTU Stipulation and
Agreement also eliminated several significant risks that have been
the subject of regulatory proceedings relating to deferred accounting
plant costs and rates and will enable WTU's rates to remain at
competitive levels for the foreseeable future.  See NOTE 2.
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

     See NOTE 2. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS for
information regarding other regulatory matters.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Overview
     WTU's need for capital results primarily from the construction
of facilities to provide reliable electric service to its customers.
Accordingly, internally generated funds should meet most of the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are
not sufficient, WTU's financial condition and credit rating should
allow it access to the capital markets.

     Construction Expenditures
     WTU maintains a continuing construction program, the nature and
extent of which is based upon current and estimated future demands
upon the system.  Planned construction expenditures for WTU for the
next three years are primarily to improve and expand distribution
facilities and will be funded primarily through internally generated
funds.  These improvements will be required to meet the anticipated
needs of new customers and the growth in the requirements of existing
customers.  Construction expenditures, including AFUDC, for WTU were
approximately $45 million in 1995, $42 million in 1994 and $37
million in 1993.  WTU's estimated total construction expenditures,
including AFUDC, for the years 1996 through 1998 are presented in the

     The foregoing consists of forward looking information and,
accordingly, actual results may differ materially from such
projected information due to changes in the underlying assumptions.
Such assumptions are based on numerous factors, including factors
such as the rate of load growth, escalation of construction costs,
changes in lead times in manufacturing, inflation, the availability
and pricing of alternatives to construction, environmental and other
regulation, delays from regulatory hearings, adequacy of rate relief
and the availability of necessary external capital.  Changes in
those and other factors could cause WTU to defer or accelerate
construction or to sell or buy more power, which would affect its
cash position, revenues and income to an extent that cannot now be
reliably predicted.


                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-139
     Although WTU does not believe that it will require substantial
additions of generating capacity through the end of the decade, the
CSW System's internal resource plan presently anticipates that any
additional capacity needs will come from a variety of sources
including projected coal- and lignite-fired generating plants for
which WTU has invested approximately $15 million in prior years for
plant sites, engineering studies and lignite reserves.  Should
future plans exclude these plants for environmental, economical  or
other reasons, WTU would evaluate the probability of recovery of
these investments and may record appropriate reserves.

     Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1995, the capitalization ratios of WTU were
49% common stock equity, 1% preferred stock and 50% long-term debt.
WTU's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.8% at December 31, 1995.
WTU is committed to maintaining financial flexibility through a
strong capital structure and favorable securities ratings in order to
access the capital markets opportunistically or when required.  WTU's
long-term financing activity for 1995 is summarized in the following
table.

               ISSUED                                 REACQUIRED

FMB (2)        80.0   6 3/8%   2005     FMB           $53.3   9 1/4%   2019

(1)  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of WTU's short-term
     borrowings and to reimburse WTU's treasury for the reacquisition of
     FMBs.
(2)  The balance of proceeds not used to redeem higher cost FMBs
     were used to repay a portion of WTU's short-term borrowings.

     Short-Term Financing
     WTU, together with other members of the CSW System, has
established a CSW System money pool to coordinate short-term
borrowings.  These loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates
approximating the CSW System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  At
December 31, 1995 WTU's short-term borrowing limit from the money
pool was approximately $58 million.  During 1995, the annual
weighted average interest rate on WTU borrowings was 6.1% and  the
average amount of WTU short-term borrowings outstanding was $20
million.  The maximum amount of WTU short-term borrowings
outstanding during 1995 was $50 million, which was the amount
outstanding at February 3, 1995.

     Internally Generated Funds
     Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  WTU uses
short-term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital requirements
due to the seasonal nature of energy sales.  During 1993 and 1994,
WTU experienced several non-recurring transactions that resulted in
negative internally generated funds in 1994, including the
refinancing of Series G and Series H FMBs with Series S FMBs which
occurred between December 1993 and February 1994.  This refinancing
caused an abnormally high accounts payable balance to affiliates at
December 31, 1993 which was subsequently reduced by the issuance of
Series S FMBs in February 1994, resulting in the appearance of a
large out flow of cash from operating funds.  WTU anticipates that
capital requirements for the period 1996 to 1998 may be met, in
large part, from internal sources.  WTU also expects that some
external financings will be required during the period, but the
nature, timing and extent have not yet been determined.  Information
concerning internally generated funds is presented in the following
table.

     Sales of Accounts Receivable
     WTU sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable, without
recourse, to CSW Credit.  The sales provide WTU with cash
immediately, thereby reducing working capital needs and revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts
receivable sold were $33 million and $28 million, respectively, in
1995, as compared to $35 million and $18 million, respectively, in
1994.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS

     Competition and Industry Challenges
     Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting WTU and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic,
political and technological factors.  These factors have resulted in
legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely to result in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in
the future.  As competition in the industry increases, WTU will have
the opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at
risk of losing customers to other competitors.  Additionally, WTU
will continue to compete with suppliers of alternative forms of
energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal, some of which may be
cheaper than electricity.  WTU believes that its prices for
electricity and the quality and reliability of its service currently
place it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

     The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy
Policy Act creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding
Company Act and permits utilities, including registered utility
holding companies and non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are
a new category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are
free from most federal and state regulation, including the principal
restrictions of the Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable
broader participation in wholesale power markets by reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act
also allows the FERC, on a case-by-case basis and with certain
restrictions, to order wholesale transmission access and to order
electric utilities to enlarge their transmission systems.  A FERC
order requiring a transmitting utility to provide wholesale
transmission service must include provisions generally that permit
the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the costs
incurred in connection with the transmission services and any
enlargement of the transmission system and associated services.
Wholesale energy markets, including the market for wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment
of the Energy Policy Act.  WTU must compete in the wholesale energy
markets with other public utilities, cogenerators, qualified
facilities, EWGs and others for sales of electric power.  While WTU
believes that the Energy Policy Act will continue to make the
wholesale markets more competitive, WTU is unable to predict the
extent to which the Energy Policy Act will impact WTU operations.

     On March 29, 1995, consistent with the direction of the Energy
Policy Act, the FERC announced in a NOPR that each public utility
that owns and controls transmission facilities in interstate commerce
must unbundle its services and file open access transmission tariffs
under which each utility will offer comparable open access
transmission services to its transmission customers.  In addition,
the FERC revised its proposed mechanisms by which utilities will be
permitted to recover stranded investment costs expected to be brought
about by the proposed changes.  On August 7, 1995, CSW filed comments
on the proposed approach in the NOPR with the FERC.  Although CSW
supports the concept of comparable open access for the nation's
transmission service, CSW believes that certain changes must be made
in the FERC's proposed approach of implementing the open transmission
system.  First, with respect to the issue of stranded investments,
the FERC proposed that customers who left the utility company pay for
a portion, but not all, of the costs incurred by the owner of
existing facilities that are not utilized as a result of the loss of
such customers. CSW raised concerns about the FERC's proposed
methodology for addressing stranded investment because it did not, in
CSW's view, provide for the fair recovery of the full amount
previously invested.  Second, CSW proposed that the FERC adopt a


                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-141
"power flow pricing" approach whereby all electric systems that incur
costs because of a transmission transaction are compensated, as
opposed to the traditional "postage stamp" method whereby only the
companies that are directly involved in the actual purchase and sale
of the electricity are compensated or charged.

     On February 9, 1996, WTU filed at the FERC complete sets of open
access transmission tariffs.  These tariffs substantially reflect the
pro forma tariffs attached to the FERC's March 29, 1995 NOPR.  Open
access and market pricing should increase marketing opportunities for
WTU, but may also expose them to the risk of loss of load or reduced
revenues due to competition with alternate suppliers.

     Increasing competition in the utility industry brings an
increased need to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail regulatory
environment is beginning to shift from traditional rate base
regulation to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and performance-
based plans encourage efficiencies and increased productivity while
permitting utilities to share in the results.  Retail wheeling, a
major industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel" or move
power from third parties to their own retail customers, is evolving
gradually.  Many states throughout the country currently have
legislation introduced to investigate the issue.

     WTU believes that retail competition would harm the best
interests of WTU's customers and security holders unless WTU
receives fair recovery of the full amounts previously invested to
finance power plants.  These investments, which were reasonably
incurred, were made by WTU to meet its obligation to serve the
public interest, necessity and convenience.  This obligation has
existed for nearly a century and remains in force under current law.
WTU intends to strongly oppose attempts to impose retail competition
without just compensation for the risks and investments WTU
undertook to serve the public's demand for electricity.

     WTU is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or impact of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on WTU.  As
the wholesale and retail electricity markets become more
competitive, however, the principal factor determining success is
likely to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability,
availability of capacity, and customer service.

     PURA
     Amendments to PURA, the legal foundation of electric regulation
in Texas, became effective on September 1, 1995.  Among other things,
the amendments deregulate the wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT,
permit pricing flexibility for utilities facing competitive
challenges, provide for a market-driven integrated resource planning
process and mandate comparable open access transmission service.

     PURA also requires that the Texas Commission adopt a rule on
comparable open transmission access by March 1, 1996.  In
conjunction with this rulemaking proceeding (Project No. 14045),
Texas Commission Chairman Pat Wood issued a proposal on September 6,
1995, for the purpose of maximizing competition in the ERCOT
wholesale bulk power market.  The proposal calls for the functional
unbundling of integrated utilities where distribution entities could
purchase their power requirements from any generator or set of
generators in ERCOT.  Those generators which are currently regulated
would be deregulated after provisions are in place to recover
stranded costs.  The proposal has been assigned to a separate
proceeding (Project No. 15000).  CSW expects this project to provide
the vehicle for the Texas Commission and other interested parties to
develop positions on industry restructuring before the Texas
Legislature convenes in January 1997.  The schedule for Project No.
15000 contemplates that the Texas Commission will develop
legislative recommendations on restructuring and stranded costs
during the second half of 1996 and a schedule has been developed for
this project that includes a series of workshops and technical
conferences during the first half of 1996.

     On February 7, 1996, the Texas Commission adopted a rule
governing transmission access and pricing (Project No. 14045).  The
pricing method tentatively adopted by the Texas Commission is a
hybrid combination of an ERCOT-wide postage stamp rate covering 70%

                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-142
of total ERCOT transmission costs and a distance-sensitive component
referred to as a vector-absolute megawatt mile which recovers the
remaining 30% of ERCOT transmission costs.  Although the open access
tariffs filed with the FERC on February 9, 1996 do not reflect
Project No. 14045 pricing, WTU anticipates filing tariffs with the
FERC that do conform to the Texas Commission's rule in the second
quarter of 1996.

     Regulatory Accounting
     Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS
No. 71, which allows for the recognition and recovery of regulatory
assets, WTU has recognized significant regulatory assets and
liabilities.  Management believes that WTU will continue to meet the
criteria for following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event WTU no
longer meets the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off of
regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.  For additional
information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made to NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

     Consolidated Taxes
     Prior to 1992, the Texas Commission allowed income taxes to be
recovered in rates based on the federal income tax incurred by a
utility as if it were a stand-alone company.  This "stand-alone"
approach treated the regulated activities of a utility as a separate
entity and considered only those revenues and expenses that are
included in the utility's cost of service to calculate the federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.  However, in 1992 the
Texas Commission changed its method of calculating the federal income
tax component of rates to the "actual tax approach."  This approach
reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions which are not
considered for or included in setting rates for the utility.

     On April 13, 1995, the Supreme Court issued a decision which
holds that the Texas Commission is not required to use the tax
benefits associated with the losses of unregulated affiliates to
reduce tax expense in cost of service.  The Supreme Court also ruled
that the Texas Commission cannot include the income tax deductions
taken by the utility for disallowed expenses when determining the
utility's federal income tax liability.


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The operations of WTU, like those of other utility systems,
generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject to
environmental laws.  CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses
the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of
fault or the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include
owners and operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or
generators of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar laws.
Legally, any one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of
a cleanup.  Usually, however, cleanup costs are allocated among
PRPs.

     WTU is subject to various pending claims alleging that it is a
PRP under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and
cleaning up contaminated property.  WTU anticipates that resolution
of these claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ from
site to site, factors that are the basis for the expectation for
specific sites include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly
contributed by WTU, the estimated amount of costs allocated to WTU
and the participation of other parties.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     SFAS No. 121
     In March 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 121 to be effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1995.  The statement establishes a two-fold test for identification
and quantification of an impaired asset.  The first test in
determining an impairment is to compare the sum of expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) related to an
asset to the carrying amount of the asset.  If the sum of expected
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the
asset, then an impairment is recognized.  Once an impairment is
identified, the second part of the test is applied to quantify the
amount of the impairment.  The statement lists several alternative
methods of establishing fair market value and quantifying the
impairment.  Cash flows used to measure possible impairment of an
asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets.  For WTU, the lowest independently
identifiable cash flow level used for this analysis is
jurisdictional rates charged to customers.

     WTU will adopt SFAS No. 121 in the first quarter of 1996.
Under the current regulatory environment, WTU does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 121 to have a significant impact on WTU's
results of operations or financial condition.  However, future
developments in the electric industry and utility regulation could
jeopardize the full recovery of the carrying cost of certain
investments.  Consequently, WTU is monitoring the changing
conditions facing the electric utility industry.

     SFAS No. 123
     SFAS No. 123 was issued in October 1995 with an effective date
for transactions entered into after December 15, 1995.  This
statement requires the use of an option pricing model to calculate
the value of stock-based compensation transactions where such value
cannot otherwise be determined, but then allows for two alternative
methods of reporting the transactions.  One method recognizes this
value as a cost of compensation and as an expense for the current
period.  The alternative method permits footnote disclosure of the
compensation cost, without charging the amount against current
earnings.

     As provided by the provisions of SFAS No. 123, WTU will
continue to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and adopt the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 in 1996.  Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123 will not
impact WTU's results of operations or financial condition.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Electric Operating Revenues
     Electric operating revenues decreased approximately $23.2
million and $2.5 million in 1995 and 1994, respectively, when
compared to the prior year.  The decrease in 1995 was attributable
primarily to a one-time $21 million base rate refund made pursuant
to the WTU Stipulation and Agreement.  Also contributing to such
decrease were reductions in retail base rates made in accordance
with the WTU Stipulation and Agreement and decreases in transmission
equalization revenues and other miscellaneous non-KWH related
revenues.  These decreases were partially offset by increases in
sales to a major new wholesale customer.

     The 1994 decrease in electric operating revenues was due
primarily to a reduction in lower margin off-system sales of $8
million resulting from decreased market place demand, and was
partially offset by higher on-system revenues of $6.5 million
attributable to a 3% increase in retail KWH sales.  Also
contributing to the 1994 decrease was an interim rate reduction of
approximately $5.7 million on an annual basis effective October 1,
1994.



                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-144
     Fuel
     Fuel expenses were $123.7 million in 1995, which represented a
decrease of 6% when compared to 1994 fuel expenses of $131.3
million.  The decrease was primarily attributable to a 3% decrease
in average unit fuel costs from $1.88 per Mmbtu in 1994 to $1.83 per
Mmbtu in 1995 due largely to lower spot gas market prices brought
about by weak demand and excess gas storage.  Also contributing to
the decreased fuel expense was increased plant efficiencies in 1995
which resulted in less fuel required per MWH generated.

     In 1994, fuel expenses decreased approximately $3.8 million or
3% when compared to 1993.  The 1994 decrease in fuel expenses was
primarily attributable to a 2% decrease in average unit fuel costs
from $1.91 per Mmbtu in 1993 to $1.88 per Mmbtu in 1994 and a 2%
decrease in generation.

     Purchased Power Expenses
     Purchased power expenses increased approximately $5.9 million
during 1995 when compared with 1994, but decreased approximately
$2.3 million in 1994 when compared to 1993.  The 1995 increase was
primarily attributable to additional energy purchases made to serve
the increased load resulting from the addition of a wholesale
customer and increased economy purchases.  The decrease in 1994
resulted from a decrease in economy purchases.

     Other Operating
     Other operating expenses decreased approximately $2.6 million
during 1995 when compared to 1994, but increased in 1994 when
compared to 1993 by $4.9 million.  The decrease in 1995 was
primarily due to the realization of savings resulting from cost
containment efforts and decreased environmental expenditures.
Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in transmission
expenses associated with the completion and placement in service of
a new HVdc tie in 1995, increased employee related costs and
increased telecommunications expenses.

     The 1994 increase in operating expenses reflects a
reimbursement in 1993 for the settlement of a dispute relating to a
coal supply contract which lowered expenses in 1993.  Higher outside
services for fuel related issues and other employee related expenses
also contributed to the increase.

     Restructuring
     Restructuring charges reflect the original accrual of $15.2
million in 1993, which was subsequently adjusted by $2 million in
1994 and $0.4 million in 1995, and the recording of a $13.2 million
regulatory asset during 1995 in accordance with the WTU Stipulation
and Agreement for previously recorded costs associated with the
restructuring.

     Maintenance
     Maintenance expense in 1995 decreased from 1994 by
approximately $1 million or 7% due primarily to decreased production
maintenance resulting from non-recurring plant overhauls in 1994 and
savings resulting from cost containment efforts.  Maintenance
expense in 1994 increased over 1993 by approximately $1.7 million or
13% due primarily to increased production maintenance of boiler and
electric plant.

     Depreciation and Amortization
     Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately
$1.7 million and $1.2 million during 1995 and 1994, respectively,
when compared to prior years due primarily to increases in
depreciable property.

     Income Taxes
     Income taxes decreased approximately $12.4 million or 69% in
1995 when compared with 1994 due primarily to a reduction of $6.9
million of deferred income taxes in accordance with the WTU
Stipulation and Agreement and lower pre-tax income.  The increase of
approximately $4.3 million or 32% in 1994 when compared with 1993
was due to higher pre-tax income.



                               WTU
<PAGE> 2-145
     Other Income and Deductions
     Other income decreased approximately $4.7 million in 1995 due
primarily to an adjustment to reallocate parent company tax
benefits.  Other income increased approximately $2.3 million in 1994
when compared to 1993 as a result of tax benefits received under
WTU's tax sharing agreement with CSW.

     Interest on Long-Term Debt
     Interest on long-term debt increased approximately $2.9 million
in 1995 when compared to the prior year as a result of higher levels
of long-term debt outstanding.  Interest on long-term debt decreased
approximately $0.7 million in 1994 when compared to the prior year
due to WTU's refinancing of higher cost debt with lower cost debt
and decreased average balances outstanding.

     Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
     In 1993, WTU changed its method of accounting for unbilled
revenue and implemented SFAS No. 112.  These accounting changes had
a cumulative effect of increasing net income by $3.8 million.

     Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the national Consumer
Price Index, have averaged approximately 2.8% for the three-year
period ending December 31, 1995.  WTU believes that inflation, at
this level, does not materially affect its results of operations or
financial condition.  However, under existing regulatory practice,
only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As
a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical
plant costs may not be adequate to replace plant in future years.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  See CSW's NOTE 1 on pages 2-32 to 2-37.


2.LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

       WTU Stipulation and Agreement
       WTU has been the subject of several pending regulatory
  matters, including the following: (i) a retail rate proceeding and
  fuel reconciliation before the Texas Commission in Docket No.
  13369; (ii) Writ of Error to the Supreme Court - review of WTU's
  1987 Texas rate case in Docket No. 7510; and (iii)  the Texas
  Commission's proceeding on remand in Docket No. 13949 regarding
  deferred accounting treatment for Oklaunion Power Station Unit No.
  1 originally authorized in the Texas Commission's Docket No. 7289.

       On September 22, 1995, WTU, along with other major parties
  to the above described matters, filed with the Texas Commission a
  joint stipulation and agreement to resolve all of these matters.
  The WTU Stipulation and Agreement is a unified package that
  included: (i) a retail base rate reduction of approximately $13.5
  million annually starting with WTU's October 1995 revenue month
  billing cycle; (ii) a $21 million retail refund which was not
  attributed to any specific cause but was inclusive of all claims
  related to the three above described litigation and regulatory
  matters and included the effect of the rate reduction to October
  1, 1994; (iii) a reduction of fixed fuel factors by approximately
  2%; (iv) various rate and accounting treatments including a
  reasonable return on equity for retail operations of 11.375%; and
  (v) a retail base rate freeze until October 1, 1998, subject to
  certain force majeure provisions.

       On November 9, 1995, the Texas Commission rendered a final
  order that implemented the joint stipulation and agreement, ending
  the rate proceeding and fuel reconciliation in Docket No. 13369
  and the remand, designated Docket No. 13949, to the Texas
  Commission by the Supreme Court for the deferred accounting
  treatment of Oklaunion Power Station Unit No. 1 originally
  authorized by the Texas Commission in Docket No. 7289.  The final
  order also set into motion the actions required to seek a remand
  of the appeal of Docket No. 7510 to the Texas Commission to
  implement a final order consistent with the WTU Stipulation and
  Agreement.

       On December 8, 1995, all parties to the appeals filed a
  joint motion with the Supreme Court and, on December 22, 1995, the
  Supreme Court approved the joint motion to withdraw and dismissed
  the case.  The case will now go back to the Court of Appeals so
  that it can be remanded back to the Texas Commission.  The date of
  this remand and final action by the Texas Commission is not known.

       The WTU Stipulation and Agreement is expected to impact
  WTU's results of operations for the next several years, reducing
  annual earnings by approximately $8 million beginning in 1996.
  Details of the items with significant earnings impact for 1995 and
  1996, including certain accounting treatments, are set forth in
  the following table.

       The WTU Stipulation and Agreement also eliminated several
  significant risks that have been the subject of regulatory
  proceedings relating to deferred accounting and rates and will
  enable WTU's rates to remain at competitive levels for the
  foreseeable future.

       Other
       WTU is party to various other legal claims, actions and
  complaints arising in the normal course of business.  Management
  does not expect disposition of these matters to have a material
  adverse effect on WTU's results of operations or financial
  condition.


3.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

  Construction and Capital Expenditures

       It is estimated that WTU will spend approximately $42
  million, including AFUDC, in construction expenditures during
  1996.  Substantial commitments have been made in connection with
  this capital expenditure program.

  Fuel Commitments

       WTU has entered into various commitments for the procurement
  of fuel.

       WTU Pipeline Leases
       WTU has a sale/leaseback agreement with Transok, an
  affiliated company, for full capacity use of a natural gas
  pipeline to WTU's Ft. Phantom generating plant.  The lease
  agreement also provides for full capacity use of Transok's natural
  gas pipelines serving WTU's San Angelo, Oak Creek and Rio Pecos
  generating plants.  The initial terms of the agreement entered
  into in 1992 are for twelve years with renewable options
  thereafter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of West Texas Utilities
Company:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of capitalization of West Texas Utilities Company (a Texas
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Central and South West
Corporation)  as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of WTU's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
West Texas Utilities Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

     In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, WTU changed its methods of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

     Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the financial statements taken as a whole.  The supplemental
Schedule II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit have
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state in
all material respects the financial data required to be set forth
therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

     Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and
objectivity of the financial statements of West Texas Utilities
Company as well as other information contained in this Annual
Report.  The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the
best estimates and judgments of management, giving due consideration
to materiality.  Financial information contained elsewhere in this
Annual Report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

     The  financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given unrestricted
access to all financial records and related data, including minutes
of all meetings of shareholders, the board of directors and
committees of the board.  WTU believes that representations made to
the independent auditors during their audit were valid and
appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit report is presented
elsewhere in this report.

     WTU maintains a system of internal controls to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization, that the financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of the companies are properly safeguarded
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system
includes a documented organizational structure and division of
responsibility, established policies and procedures including a
policy on ethical standards which provides that WTU will maintain
the highest legal and ethical standards, and the careful selection,
training and development of our employees.

     Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal control system following standards established by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board,
operating through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely
of directors who are not officers or employees of WTU provides
oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of
internal controls, no internal control system can provide absolute
assurance that errors will not occur.  However, management strives
to maintain a balance, recognizing that the cost of such a system
should not exceed the benefits derived.

     WTU  believes that, in all material respects, its system of
internal controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding of
assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
functioned effectively as of December 31, 1995.

     Grants of restricted stock are administered by the Executive
     Compensation Committee of CSW's Board of Directors, which has the
     authority to determine the individuals to whom and the terms upon
     which restricted stock grants, including the number of underlying
     shares, shall be made.  The awards reflected in this column all
     have four-year vesting periods with 20% of the stock vesting on
     the first, second and third anniversary dates of the award and
     40% vesting on the fourth such anniversary date.  Upon vesting,
     shares of CSW Common are re-issued without restrictions.  The
     individuals receive dividends and may vote shares of restricted
     stock, even before they are vested.  The amount reported in the
     table represents the market value of the shares at the date of
     grant.  As of the end of 1995, the aggregate restricted stock
     holdings of each of the Named Executive Officers are presented in

     Payouts of the awards are contingent upon CSW achieving a
specified level of total stockholder return, relative to a peer
group of utility companies, for the three-year period, or cycle, and
exceeding a certain defined minimum threshold.  Total stockholder
return is calculated by dividing (i) the sum of (a) the cumulative
amount of dividends per share for the three-year period, assuming
full dividend reinvestment, and (b) the change in share price over
the three-year period, by (ii) the share price at the beginning of
the three-year period.  If CSW's total stockholder return for a
cycle falls in one of the top three quartiles of similarly-
calculated total stockholder returns achieved at companies in the
peer group of utility companies, CSW will make a payout to
participants for the three-year cycle then ending.  First, second
and third quartile performance will result in payouts of 150
percent, 100 percent and 50 percent of target, respectively.
Performance in the fourth quartile yields no payout under the LTIP.
If the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated during the
performance period for any reason other than death, total and
permanent disability or retirement, then the award is canceled.  In
March 1995, the committee reviewed total stockholder return results
and because they were below the threshold for a payout, no awards
were granted.  The Executive Compensation Committee is scheduled to
evaluate the 1993 to 1995 cycle performance under the LTIP in March
1996.

     The LTIP contains a provision accelerating awards upon a change
in control of CSW.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if a
change in control of CSW occurs (i) all options and SARs become
fully exercisable and (ii) all restrictions, terms and conditions

applicable to all restricted stock are deemed lapsed and satisfied
and all performance units are deemed to have been fully earned, as
of the date of the change in control.  Awards which have been
outstanding for less than six months prior to the date the change in
control occurs are not subject to acceleration upon the occurrence
of a change in control.  The LTIP also contains provisions designed
to prevent circumvention of the above acceleration provisions
through coerced termination of an employee prior to a change in
control.

     Executive officers are eligible to participate in the tax-
qualified CSW Pension Plan like other employees of the registrants.
Certain executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers,
are also eligible to participate in the SERP, a non-qualified ERISA
excess benefit plan.  Such pension benefits depend upon years of
credited service, age at retirement and amount of covered
compensation earned by a participant.  The annual normal retirement
benefits payable under the pension and the SERP are based on 1.67
percent of "Average Compensation" times the number of years of
credited service (reduced by (i) no more than 50 percent of a
participant's age 62 or later Social Security benefit and (ii)
certain other offset benefits).

     "Average Compensation" is the covered compensation for the
plans and equals the average annual compensation, reported as salary
in the Summary Compensation Table, during the 36 consecutive months
of highest pay during the 120 months prior to retirement.  The
combined benefit levels in the table above, which include both the
pension and SERP benefits, are based on retirement at age 65, the
years of credited service shown, continued existence of the plans
without substantial change and payment in the form of a single life
annuity.

     Respective years of credited service and ages, as of December
31, 1995, for the Named Executive Officers are presented in the
following table.

either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the
Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to
the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market Quote
Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction
for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower
shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance
of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e).
In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money
Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal
amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted.
The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or
in part; provided that:


<PAGE> 21
       (i)    the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market
  Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in
  the related Money Market Quote Request;


       (ii)   the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing
   must be $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000;

       (iii)   acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
   ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as
   the case may be, for the applicable Interest
            Period; and

        (iv)   the Borrower may not accept any offer that is
   described in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply
   with the requirements of this Agreement.

       (g)    Allocation by Agent.  If offers are made by two or
more Banks with the same Money Market Margins or Money
Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater
aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of
which such offers are accepted for the related Interest
Period, the principal amount of Money Market Loans in
respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated
by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in
multiples of $1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate)
in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such
offers.  Determinations by the Agent of the amounts of Money
Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

SECTION 2.5.   Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.  (a)  Upon
receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's
share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of
Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

       (b)    Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
date of each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein
shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in Federal
or other funds immediately available in New York City, to
the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.1.  Unless
the Agent determines that any applicable condition specified
in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Agent will make the
funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower
at the Agent's aforesaid address.

<PAGE> 22

       (c)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will
not make available to the Agent such Bank's share of such
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing
in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and
to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such
share available to the Agent, such Bank and, to the extent
such Bank has failed to do so within three Domestic
Business Days of demand therefor by the Agent, the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount (together with interest thereon),
for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum
equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the
interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.8 and
(ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If
such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's
Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.  If the Borrower shall repay to the Agent such
corresponding amount, such Bank's Loan included in such
Borrowing shall be deemed not to have been made.  This
subsection (c) shall not limit any right of the Borrower
pursuant to Section 8.6.

SECTION 2.6. Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank shall be
evidenced by a single Note payable to the order of such Bank
for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in an
amount equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
such Bank's Loans.  Prior to the syndication referred to in
Section 5.13, the Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by
the Note issued to such Bank under the Original Credit
Agreement.

       (b)    Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the
Agent, request that its Loans of a particular type be
evidenced by a separate Note in an amount equal to the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such
Note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto
with appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it
evidences solely Loans of the relevant type.  Each reference
in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be deemed
to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the
context may require.


<PAGE> 23

       (c)    Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to
Section 3.1(a), the Agent shall forward such Note to such
Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date, amount and type of
each Loan made by it and the date and amount of each payment
of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and
may, if such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer
or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the schedule forming
a part thereof appropriate notations to evidence the
foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then
outstanding; provided that the failure of any Bank to make
any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes.
Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower
so to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of
its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when
required.

SECTION 2.7.   Maturity of Loans.  (a)  Each Committed Loan
shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due
and payable, together with accrued interest thereon, on the
Termination Date.

       (b) Each Money Market Loan included in any Money
Market Borrowing shall mature, and the principal amount
thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

SECTION 2.8.    Interest Rates.  (a)  Each Base Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until
it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
for such day.  Such interest shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Date and, with respect to the
principal amount of any Base Rate Loan converted to a
CD Loan or a Euro-Dollar Loan, on each date a Base Rate Loan
is so converted.  Any overdue principal of or interest on
any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand,
for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum
of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans
for such day.

       (b)    Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day during each Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the
sum of the CD Margin for such day plus the Adjusted CD Rate
applicable to such Interest Period; provided that if any
CD Loan shall, as a result of clause (2)(b) of the
definition of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of
less than 30 days, such CD Loan shall bear interest during
such Interest Period at the rate applicable to Base Rate

<PAGE> 24

Loans during such period.  Such interest shall be payable
for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if
such Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of
90 days after the first day thereof.  Any overdue principal
of or interest on any CD Loan shall bear interest, payable
on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the rate applicable
to Base Rate Loans for such day and (ii) the sum of the
CD Margin plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such Loan
at the date such payment was due.

       The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest
Period means a rate per annum determined pursuant to the
following formula:

                [ CDBR       ]*
       ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
                [ 1.00 - DRP ]

       ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
       CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
        DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
         AR  =  Assessment Rate

  __________
  *  The amount in brackets being rounded upward, if
  necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%

       The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period
is the rate of interest determined by the Agent to be the
average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher
1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid at
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as
practicable) on the first day of such Interest Period by two
or more New York certificate of deposit dealers of
recognized standing for the purchase at face value from each
CD Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an
amount comparable to the principal amount of the CD Loan of
such CD Reference Bank to which such Interest Period applies
and having a maturity comparable to such Interest Period.

       "Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on
such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining
the maximum reserve requirement (including without
limitation any basic, supplemental or emergency reserves)
for a member bank of the Federal Reserve System in New York
City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in respect

<PAGE> 25

of new non-personal time deposits in dollars in New York
City having a maturity comparable to the related Interest
Period and in an amount of $100,000 or more.  The Adjusted
CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve
Percentage.

       "Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual
assessment rate in effect on such day which is payable by a
member of the Bank Insurance Fund classified as adequately
capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within
the meaning of 12 C.F.R.  327.4(a) (or any successor
provision) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or
any successor) for such Corporation's (or such successor's)
insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the
United States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted
automatically on and as of the effective date of any change
in the Assessment Rate.

       (c)    Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day during
each Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus
the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such
Interest Period.  Such interest shall be payable for each
Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such
Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of
three months after the first day thereof.

       The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective
rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered to
each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London
interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time)
two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such
Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the
principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar
Reference Bank to which such Interest Period is to apply and
for a period of time comparable to such Interest Period.

       (d)    Any overdue principal of or interest on any
Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the higher
of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin for such
day plus the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by dividing
(x) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next
higher 1/16 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at

<PAGE> 26
which one day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more
than three Euro-Dollar Business Days, then for such other
period of time not longer than three months as the Agent may
select) deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal
to such overdue payment due to each of the Euro-Dollar
Reference Banks are offered to such Euro-Dollar Reference
Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable
period determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage (or, if the circumstances
described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 8.1 shall exist,
at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day) and (ii) the sum
of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus the
London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Loan at the
date such payment was due.

       (e)    Subject to Section 8.1, each Money Market LIBOR Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a
rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank
Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in
accordance with Section 2.8(c) as if the related Money
Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed Euro-Dollar
Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by
the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.4.
Each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the
Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such
Loan in accordance with Section 2.4.  Such interest shall be
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof
and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at
intervals of three months after the first day thereof.  Any
overdue principal of or interest on any Money Market Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the
Base Rate for such day.

       (f)    The Agent shall determine each interest rate
applicable to the Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give
prompt notice to the Borrower and the participating Banks of
each rate of interest so determined, and its determination
thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

       (g)    Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to
furnish quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this
Section.  If any Reference Bank does not furnish a timely
quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant interest
rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished

<PAGE> 27
by the remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such
quotations is available on a timely basis, the provisions of
Section 8.1 shall apply.

SECTION 2.9.   Fees.  (a)  Commitment Fee.  The Borrower shall
pay to the Agent for the account of the Banks ratably a
commitment fee of 0.30% per annum on the daily aggregate
amount of the undrawn Commitments during Stage 1.

       (b)    Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent
for the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at the
Facility Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with the
Pricing Schedule) on the daily aggregate amount of the
Commitments, whether used or unused, during Stage 2 (or, if
the Commitments shall have terminated in their entirety
during Stage 2, on the daily aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Loans).

       (c)    Accrued fees under this Section shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Date and on the date
of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if
later, the date the Loans shall be repaid in their
entirety).

SECTION 2.10.   Optional Termination or Reduction of
Commitments.  During the Revolving Credit Period, the
Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days'
notice to the Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any
time, if no Loans are outstanding at such time or (ii)
ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of
$25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, the
aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans.

SECTION 2.11.   Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a)  The
Loans included in each Committed Borrowing shall bear
interest initially at the type of rate specified by the
Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Borrowing.
Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to
change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each
Group of Loans (subject in each case to the provisions of
Article 8), as follows:


       (i)    if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may
  elect to convert such Loans to CD Loans as of any Domestic
  Business Day or to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar
  Business Day;

       (ii)   if such Loans are CD Loans, the Borrower may elect to
  convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans

<PAGE> 28
  or elect to continue such Loans as CD Loans for an
  additional Interest Period, subject to Section 2.15 in the
  case of any such conversion or continuation effective on any
  day other than the last day of the then current Interest
  Period applicable to such Loans; and

       (iii)       if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the
  Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans
  or CD Loans or elect to continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar
  Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to
  Section 2.15 in the case of any such conversion or
  continuation effective on any day other than the last day of
  the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a
"Notice of Interest Rate Election") to the Agent not later
than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the third
Euro-Dollar Business Day before the conversion or
continuation selected in such notice is to be effective
(unless the relevant Loans are to be converted to Domestic
Loans of the other type or are CD Rate Loans to be continued
as CD Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period, in which
case such notice shall be delivered to the Agent not later
than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Domestic
Business Day before such conversion or continuation is to be
effective).  A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it
so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; provided
that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans
comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to which such
Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does
not apply, are each $25,000,000 (or, if such remaining
portion is comprised of Base Rate Loans, $10,000,000) or any
larger multiple of $1,000,000.

       (b)    Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:

       (i)    the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such
  notice applies;

       (ii)   the date on which the conversion or continuation
  selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall
  comply with the applicable clause of subsection (a) above;

       (iii)       if the Loans comprising such Group are to be
  converted, the new type of Loans and, if the Loans being

<PAGE> 29
  converted are to be Fixed Rate Loans, the duration of the
  next succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; and

       (iv)   if such Loans are to be continued as CD Loans or
  Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, the
  duration of such additional Interest Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate
Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition
of Interest Period.

       (c)    Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election
from the Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, the
Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents
thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by
the Borrower.

       (d)    An election by the Borrower to change or continue the
rate of interest applicable to any Group of Loans pursuant
to this Section shall not constitute a "Borrowing" subject
to the provisions of Section 3.2.

SECTION 2.12.  Scheduled Termination of Commitments.  The
Commitments shall terminate on the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.13.   Optional Prepayments.  (a)  Subject in the
case of any Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section 2.15, the
Borrower may, upon at least one Domestic Business Day's
notice to the Agent, prepay any Group of Domestic Loans (or
any Money Market Borrowing bearing interest at the Base Rate
pursuant to Section 8.1) or upon at least three Euro-Dollar
Business Days' notice to the Agent, prepay any Group of Euro-
Dollar Loans, in each case in whole at any time, or from
time to time in part in amounts aggregating $25,000,000 or
any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying the principal
amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon
to the date of prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment
shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the Banks
included in such Group.

       (b)    Except as provided in subsection (a) above, the
Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of the principal
amount of any Money Market Loan prior to the maturity
thereof without the prior written consent of the Bank making
such Loan.

       (c)    Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to
this Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of
the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share (if

<PAGE> 30
any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not thereafter
be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.14.   General Provisions as to Payments.  (a)  The
Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder, not later than
2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
City, to the Agent at its address referred to in
Section 9.1.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each
Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the
Agent for the account of the Banks.  Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Domestic Loans or of fees
shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans or Money
Market LIBOR Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day
unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another
calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Money Market Absolute Rate Loans shall be due on a day which
is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar
Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is
extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon
shall be payable for such extended time.

       (b)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to
the Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to
the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent that
the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.15.   Funding Losses.  If the Borrower makes any
payment of principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan or
any Fixed Rate Loan is converted (pursuant to Article 2, 6

<PAGE> 31
or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an
applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 2.8(d), or if
the Borrower fails to borrow, convert or prepay any Fixed
Rate Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in
accordance with Section 2.5(a), 2.11(c) or 2.13(c) the
Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after
demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or
by an existing or prospective Participant in the related
Loan), including (without limitation) any loss incurred in
obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third
parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after
any such payment or conversion or failure to borrow, convert
or prepay, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to
the Borrower a certificate as to the amount of such loss or
expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.16.    Computation of Interest and Fees.  Interest
based on the Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and
paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).  All other interest
and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

SECTION 2.17.   Regulation D Compensation.  For so long as any
Bank maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities"
(or any other category of liabilities which includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-
Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of
credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United
States office of such Bank to United States residents), and
as a result the cost to such Bank (or its Euro-Dollar
Lending Office) of making or maintaining its Euro-Dollar
Loans is increased, then such Bank may require the Borrower
to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on
the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the related
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum up to but
not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus the Euro-
Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate.  Any Bank wishing to require payment
of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower
and the Agent, in which case such additional interest on the
Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank
at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each
Interest Period commencing at least four Euro-Dollar
Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall

<PAGE> 31
furnish to the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar
Business Days prior to each date on which interest is
payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans an officer's certificate
setting forth the amount to which such Bank is then entitled
under this Section (which shall be consistent with such
Bank's good faith estimate of the level at which the related
reserves are maintained by it).

       "Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day
that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect
on such day, as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for determining
the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the
Federal Reserve System in New York City with deposits
exceeding five billion dollars in respect of "Eurocurrency
liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any
category of extensions of credit or other assets which
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to
United States residents).

                          ARTICLE 4

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


       The Borrower represents and warrants that:

SECTION 4.1.  Corporate Existence and Power.  The Borrower
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and
has all corporate powers and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to
carry on its business as now conducted.


<PAGE> 35
SECTION 4.2.    Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No
Contravention.  The execution, delivery and performance by
the Borrower of this Agreement and the Notes are within the
corporate powers of the Borrower, have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or
in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency
or official, except for the order of the Commission
contemplated by the definition of SEC Authorization Date,
which, as of the date of each Borrowing, has been obtained
and is in full force and effect with respect to the
Borrowings to be made on such date, and do not contravene,
or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable
law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement or instrument
governing Debt of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
of any material agreement, judgment, injunction, order,
decree or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any material asset of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.3.    Binding Effect.  This Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and each Note,
when executed and delivered in accordance with this
Agreement, will constitute a valid and binding obligation of
the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and except as the enforceability of the Agreement and the
Notes is subject to the application of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the
possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive
relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

SECTION 4.4.  Financial Information.  (a)  The consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the
fiscal year then ended, reported on by Arthur Andersen LLP
and set forth in the Borrower's 1994 Form 10-K, a copy of
which has been delivered to each of the Banks, fairly
present, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, the consolidated financial position of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for such fiscal year.


<PAGE> 36
       (b)    The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of
September 30, 1995 and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for the nine months then
ended, set forth in the Borrower's Latest Form 10-Q, a copy
of which has been delivered to each of the Banks, fairly
present, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with the financial
statements referred to in subsection (a) of this Section,
the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such
three-month period (subject to normal year-end adjustments).

       (c)    Since September 30, 1995 there has been no material
adverse change in the business, financial position or
results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.

SECTION 4.5.   Litigation. (a)  Except for the matters
disclosed in the Borrower's 1994 Form 10-K, the Borrower's
Latest Form 10-Q and the Borrower's current report on Form 8-
K dated September 6, 1995 (the "Disclosed Matters"), there
is no action, suit or proceeding pending against, or to the
knowledge of the Borrower threatened against or affecting,
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official in
which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
decision which could materially adversely affect the
business, consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner
draws into question the validity of this Agreement or the
Notes.

       (b)    Since the date of the latest filing with the
Commission referred to in Section 4.5(a), there has been no
development in the Disclosed Matters which is likely to
materially and adversely affect the ability of the Borrower
to perform its obligation under this Agreement and the
Notes.

SECTION 4.6.  Compliance with ERISA.  Each member of the
ERISA Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum
funding standards of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code
with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all
material respects with the presently applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code with respect to each
Plan.  No member of the ERISA Group has (i) sought a waiver
of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the

<PAGE> 37
Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to
make any contribution or payment to any Plan or
Multiemployer Plan or in respect of any Benefit Arrangement,
or made any amendment to any Plan or Benefit Arrangement,
which has resulted or could result in the imposition of a
Lien or the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA
or the Internal Revenue Code or (iii) incurred any liability
under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC
for premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA.

SECTION 4.7.   Environmental Matters.  In the ordinary
course of its business, the Borrower conducts an ongoing
review of the effect of Environmental Laws on the business,
operations and properties of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, in the course of which it identifies and
evaluates liabilities and costs arising under or imposed by
Environmental Laws (including, without limitation, any
capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up or
closure of properties presently or previously owned, any
capital or operating expenditures required to achieve or
maintain compliance with environmental protection standards
imposed by Environmental Law, any related constraints on
operating activities, including any periodic or permanent
shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or
change in the nature of operations conducted thereat, any
costs or liabilities in connection with off-site disposal of
wastes or Hazardous Substances, and any actual or potential
liabilities to third parties, including employees).  On the
basis of this review, the Borrower has no reason to conclude
that such liabilities and costs arising under, including the
costs of compliance with, Environmental Laws, are likely to
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Borrower and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.

SECTION 4.8.       Taxes.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries
have filed all United States Federal income tax returns and
all other material tax returns which are required to be
filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, other than taxes which are not
delinquent, and other than those contested in good faith and
for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of taxes or other
governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower,
adequate.


<PAGE> 38
SECTION 4.9.       Subsidiaries.  Each of the Borrower's
corporate Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers
and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as
now conducted.

SECTION 4.10.      Full Disclosure.  All information (taken as a
whole) heretofore furnished in writing by the Borrower to
the Agent or any Bank for purposes of or in connection with
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby is,
and all such information hereafter furnished by the Borrower
to the Agent or any Bank (including, without limitation, all
information used in the preparation of, or which forms part
of, the Confidential Information Memorandum) will be, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, true and accurate in all material
respects on the date as of which such information is stated
or certified.  The Borrower has disclosed, either in reports
on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K (or their equivalents)
filed with the Commission or otherwise in writing to the
Banks, any and all facts known to the Borrower which
materially and adversely affect or may affect (to the extent
the Borrower can now reasonably foresee), the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Borrower
and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the
ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under
this Agreement.

SECTION 4.11.      No Defaults.  On the Effective Date, no
Default or Event of Default exists under this Agreement.


                      ARTICLE 5

                      COVENANTS

  taking or proposes to take with respect thereto;

       (d)    promptly upon the mailing thereof to the shareholders
  of the Borrower generally, copies of all financial
  statements, reports and proxy statements so mailed;

  Borrower shall have filed with the Commission;

       (f)    if and when any member of the ERISA Group (i) gives
  notice to the PBGC of any "reportable event" (as defined in
  Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Plan which might
  constitute grounds for a termination of such Plan under
  Title IV of ERISA, or knows that the plan administrator of
  any Plan has given notice of any such reportable event, a

  PBGC; (ii) receives notice of complete or partial withdrawal
  liability under Section 4201, 4203 or 4204 of ERISA or

  and other information filed with the PBGC; (vi) gives notice

  ERISA, a copy of such notice; or (vii) fails to make any
  payment or contribution to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or

  makes any amendment to any Plan which has resulted or which
  may reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a
  lien or the posting of a bond or other security under
  Section 401(a)(29) or 412(n) of the Internal Revenue Code,
  or Section 302(f) or 307 of ERISA, a certificate of the

  regarding the financial position or business of the Borrower
  and its Subsidiaries as the Agent, at the request of any
  Bank, may reasonably request.

SECTION 5.2.    Payment of Obligations.  The Borrower will pay
and discharge, and will cause each Subsidiary to pay and

       (b)    The Borrower will, and will cause each of its

sound and responsible insurance companies, insurance on all
their respective properties in at least such amounts,
against at least such risks and with no greater than such
risk retention as are customarily maintained, insured
against or retained, as the case may be, in the same general
area by companies of established repute engaged in the same
or a similar business; and will furnish to the Agent, upon
reasonable request from the Agent, information presented in
reasonable detail as to the insurance so carried.

SECTION 5.4.    Conduct of Business and Maintenance of

surviving such consolidation or merger is a Subsidiary and

shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) the transfer of
assets, rights, privileges, licenses, franchises or
businesses from one Subsidiary to another Subsidiary or

comply, and cause each Subsidiary to comply, in all material
respects with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules,
regulations, and requirements of governmental authorities

transfer or otherwise dispose of any assets, tangible or
intangible, to, or participate in, or effect, any
transaction with, any Affiliate except on an arms-length
basis on terms at least as favorable to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary than could have been obtained from a third party
who was not an Affiliate; provided that the foregoing
provisions of this Section shall not prohibit any such
Person from declaring or paying any lawful dividend or other
payment ratably in respect of all of its capital stock of
the relevant class so long as, after giving effect thereto,

  fail generally to pay its debts as they become due, or shall
  take any corporate action to authorize any of the foregoing;

       (g)    an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be
  commenced against the Borrower or any Subsidiary seeking
  liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to
  it or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other
  similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the
  appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
  other similar official of it or any substantial part of its
  property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding
  shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of
  60 days; or an order for relief shall be entered against the
  Borrower or any Subsidiary under the federal bankruptcy laws
  as now or hereafter in effect;

       (h)    any member of the ERISA Group shall fail to pay when

  Material Plan shall be filed under Title IV of ERISA by any
  member of the ERISA Group, any plan administrator or any
  combination of the foregoing; or the PBGC shall institute
  proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate, to impose
  liability (other than for premiums under Section 4007 of
  ERISA) in respect of, or to cause a trustee to be appointed
  to administer any Material Plan; or a condition shall exist
  by reason of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a
  decree adjudicating that any Material Plan must be
  terminated; or there shall occur a complete or partial
  withdrawal from, or a default, within the meaning of
  Section 4219(c)(5) of ERISA, with respect to, one or more
  Multiemployer Plans which could cause one or more members of
  the ERISA Group to incur a current payment obligation in
  excess of $25,000,000;


<PAGE> 47
       (i)    judgments or orders for the payment of money in
  excess of $25,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower
  or any Subsidiary and such judgments or orders shall
  continue unsatisfied and unstayed for a period of 30 days;
  or

       (j)    any person or group of persons (within the meaning of
  Section 13 or 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
  amended) shall have acquired beneficial ownership (within
  the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Commission
  under said Act) of 30% or more of the outstanding shares of
  common stock of the Borrower; or, during any period of 12
  consecutive calendar months, individuals (i) who were

                        THE AGENT


SECTION 7.1.    Appointment and Authorization.  Each Bank
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 7.2.     Agent and Affiliates.  Union Bank of
Switzerland shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from
exercising the same as though it were not the Agent, and
Union Bank of Switzerland and its affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not the Agent.

SECTION 7.3.     Action by Agent.  The obligations of the
Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent
shall not be required to take any action with respect to any
Default, except as expressly provided in Article 6.

SECTION 7.4.      Consultation with Experts.  The Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 7.5.      Liability of Agent.  Neither the Agent nor
any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the

the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Neither the Agent nor any of its affiliates nor
any of their respective directors, officers, agents or

warranty or representation made in connection with this
Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance
or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the
Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified

upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other
writing (which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile
transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be
genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.6.     Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, ratably in
accordance with its Commitment or, if the Commitments have
terminated, the outstanding principal amount of its Loans,
indemnify the Agent, its affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense
(including counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand,
action, loss or liability (except such as result from such
indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that
such indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees
hereunder.

SECTION 7.7.      Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent,
any Arranger or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.
Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, any Arranger or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under
this Agreement.

SECTION 7.8.      Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any
time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent subject to the approval
of the Borrower.  If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed and approved, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives
notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall
be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of

<PAGE> 50
the United States and having a combined capital and surplus
of at least $500,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and

obligations hereunder.  After any retiring Agent's

                       ARTICLE 8

                  CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


SECTION 8.1.      Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate
or Unfair.  If on or prior to the first day of any Interest
Period for any CD Loan, Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market
LIBOR Loan:

       (a)    the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that
  deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not
  being offered to the Reference Banks in the relevant market
  for such Interest Period, or

       (b)    in the case of CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, Banks
  having 50% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the
  affected Loans advise the Agent that the Adjusted CD Rate or
  the London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as
  determined by the Agent will not, together with any
  increased costs reimbursable by the Borrower hereunder,
  adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of
  funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
  be, for such Interest Period,


<PAGE> 51
  the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower
and the Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower
that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer
exist, (i)   the obligations of the Banks to make CD Loans or Euro-
Dollar Loans, as the case may be, or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or into CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans,
as the case may be, shall be suspended and (ii) each
outstanding CD Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, as the case may be,
shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.  Unless
the Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Domestic
Business Days before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing
for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given
that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such Fixed
Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if
such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR Borrowing,
the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall
bear interest for each day from and including the first day
to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day.


SECTION 8.2.    Illegality.  If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or
its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund
its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the
Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank
notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or to
convert outstanding Loans into Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be
suspended.  Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant
to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different
Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Bank.  If such notice is given, each Euro-Dollar Loan of
such Bank then outstanding shall be converted to a Base Rate
Loan either (a) on the last day of the then current Interest


<PAGE> 52
Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loan if such Bank may
lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day
or (b) immediately if such Bank shall determine that it may
not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such
day.

SECTION 8.3.     Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (a)  If on
or after (x) the Effective Date, in the case of any
Committed Loan or any obligation to make Committed Loans or
(y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case
of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable
law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable
law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but
excluding (i) with respect to any CD Loan any such
requirement included in an applicable Domestic Reserve
Percentage and (ii) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any
such requirement for which such Bank is entitled to
compensation for the relevant Interest Period under
Section 2.17), special deposit, insurance assessment
(excluding, with respect to any CD Loan, any such
requirement reflected in an applicable Assessment Rate) or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or
its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United States
market for certificates of deposit or the London interbank
market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans,
its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
such Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or
maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its
Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank
to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by such
Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to
such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

       (b)    If any Bank shall have determined that, after the
date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or

<PAGE> 53
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any
such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
or comparable agency has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its
Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its
Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change,
request or directive (taking into consideration its policies
with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within
15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the
Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its
Parent) for such reduction.

       (c)    Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the
Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
will not, in the sole judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.  A certificate of any Bank
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth
the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In
determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 8.3, the
Borrower shall only be obligated to compensate any Bank for
any amount arising or accruing during (i) any time or period
commencing not more than 90 days prior to the date on which
such Bank notifies the Agent and the Borrower that it
proposes to demand such compensation and identifies to the
Agent and the Borrower the statute, regulation or other
basis upon which the claimed compensation is or will be
based and (ii) any time or period during which, because of
the retroactive application of such statute, regulation or
other such basis, such Bank did not know that such amount
would arise or accrue.

SECTION 8.4.      Taxes.  (a)  For the purposes of this
Section 8.4, the following terms have the following
meanings:

<PAGE> 54
"Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings
with respect to any payment by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or under any Note, and all penalties and interest
with respect thereto, excluding (i)   in the case of each Bank and
the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes
imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its
principal executive office is located, in which its
Applicable Lending Office is located or in which it would be
subject to tax due to some connection other than that
created by this Agreement and (ii) in the case of each Bank,
any United States withholding tax imposed on such payments
but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United
States withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a
party to this Agreement.

       "Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, or
similar charges or levies and all penalties and interest
with respect thereto, which arise from the making of any
payment pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from
the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any Note.

       (b)    Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the
account of any Bank or the Agent hereunder or under any Note
shall be made without deduction for any Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required by
law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such
payments, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) such Bank or the Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law and
(iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address
referred to in Section 9.1, the original or a certified copy
of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

       (c)    The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes on
amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Bank or the
Agent (as the case may be).  This indemnification shall be
paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Agent (as the
case may be) makes appropriate demand therefor.

<PAGE> 55
       (d)    Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each
Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to
the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each
other Bank, and from time to time thereafter if requested in
writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Bank
remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower
and the Agent with Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or
4224, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is
entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party which exempts the Bank from United
States withholding tax or reduces the rate of withholding
tax on payments of interest for the account of such Bank or
certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this
Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States.

       (e)    For any period with respect to which a Bank has
failed to provide the Borrower or the Agent with the
appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.4(d) (unless such
failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation
occurring subsequent to the date on which such form
originally was required to be provided), such Bank shall not
be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.4(b) or (c)
with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided
that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to
a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder,
the Borrower shall take such steps (at the expense of such
Bank) as such Bank shall reasonably request to assist such
Bank to recover such Taxes.

       (f)    If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts
to or for the account of any Bank pursuant to this Section,
then such Bank will change the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Bank,
such change (i) will eliminate or reduce any such additional
payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank in its sole judgment.

SECTION 8.5.    Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed
Rate Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make, or
convert outstanding Loans to, Euro-Dollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 8.2 or (ii) any Bank has
demanded compensation under Section 8.3 or 8.4 with respect
to its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall,
by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to
such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the

<PAGE> 56
provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then,
unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for
compensation no longer exist:

       (a)    all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank
  as (or continued as or converted into) CD Loans or
  Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall instead be Base
  Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
  contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the
  other Banks); and

       (b)    after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as
  the case may be, has been repaid (or converted to a Base
  Rate Loan), all payments of principal which would otherwise
  be applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied
  to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

If such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such notice no longer apply, the principal
amount of each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a
CD Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, as the case may be, on the
first day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable
to the related CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans of the other
Banks.

SECTION 8.6.     Replacement of Bank.

       (a)    In the event that:


              (i)    any Bank requests compensation pursuant to
              Section 8.3 or 8.4 hereof;

              (ii)   the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans
              or to continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans into, Euro-
              Dollar Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 8.2
              hereof;

              (iii)   any Bank becomes insolvent or fails to make any
              Committed Loan in response to a timely Notice of Committed
              Borrowing where the Required Banks have made the respective
              Committed Loans to be made by them in response to such
              notice; or

              (iv)   any Bank fails or refuses to agree to a request by
              the Borrower to amend or waive, or to grant any consent
              under, any provision of the Agreement under circumstances
              when such amendment, waiver or consent has been approved by

<PAGE> 57
              the Required Banks, such amendment, waiver or consent
              requires the approval of all of the Banks to be effective
              and such failure or refusal is evidenced by (x) written
              objection by such Bank to any such request made to it by the
              Agent in writing describing such amendment, waiver or
              requested consent in principle, (y) failure by such Bank to
              respond in writing to any such request so made to it on or
              before the 15th Domestic Business Day after it receives such
              request, or (z) failure by such Bank to execute and deliver
              definitive documentation furnished to it by the Agent to
              effectuate any such amendment, waiver or consent on or
              before the 15th Domestic Business Day after it receives such
              documentation;

         then, so long as such condition exists, the Borrower
may either:

                     (1)  designate another financial
            institution (such financial institution being
            herein called a "Replacement Bank") acceptable
            to the Agent (which acceptance will not be
            unreasonably withheld) and which is not an
            Affiliate of the Borrower, to assume such
            Bank's Commitment hereunder and to purchase the
            Loans of such Bank and such Bank's rights under
            this Agreement and the Note held by such Bank,
            all without recourse to or representation or
            warranty by, or expense to such Bank, for a
            purchase price equal to the outstanding
            principal amount of the Loans payable to such
            Bank plus any accrued but unpaid interest on
            such Loans and accrued but unpaid fees owing to
            such Bank plus any amounts payable to such Bank
            under Section 2.15 hereof calculated as if such
            purchase constituted a prepayment of Loans plus
            any other amounts payable to such Bank under
            this Agreement, and upon such assumption,
            purchase and substitution, and subject to the
            execution and delivery to the Agent by the
            Replacement Bank of documentation satisfactory
            to the Agent (pursuant to which such
            Replacement Bank shall assume the obligations
            of such original Bank under this Agreement),
            the Replacement Bank shall succeed to the
            rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder;
            or

            (2)  with the prior written consent of
            the Required Banks, pay to such Bank the
            outstanding principal amount of the Loans
            payable to such Bank plus any accrued but
            unpaid interest on such Loans and accrued but
            unpaid fees owing to such Bank plus any amounts
            payable to such Bank under Section 2.15 hereof
            calculated as if such purchase constituted a
            prepayment of Loans.  In the event that the
            Borrower exercises its rights under the
            preceding sentence, the Bank against which such
            rights are exercised shall no longer be a party
            hereto or have any rights or obligations
            hereunder;

            provided that the obligations of the
            Borrower to such Bank under Article 8 and
            Section 9.3 hereof with respect to events
            occurring or obligations arising before or as a
            result of such replacement shall survive such
            exercise.

       (b)    If the Borrower exercises its rights under clause (2)
       of Section 8.6(a) hereof, the Borrower may, not later than
       180 days after such exercise, designate a Replacement Bank
       acceptable to the Agent (which acceptance will not be
       unreasonably withheld) and which is not an Affiliate of the
       Borrower, to assume a Commitment or, if the Commitments have
       terminated, to make a Loan or Loans hereunder in an amount
       not greater than the Commitment or Loans, as the case may
       be, of the Bank against which such rights were exercised
       and, subject to the execution and delivery to the Agent by
       the Replacement Bank of documentation satisfactory to the
       Agent the Replacement Bank shall become party to this
       Agreement as a Bank.


                            ARTICLE 9

                          MISCELLANEOUS


SECTION 9.1.     Notices.  All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing
(including bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or
similar writing) and shall be given to such party:  (a) in
the case of the Borrower or the Agent, at its address,
facsimile number or telex number set forth on the signature
pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Bank, at its address,

<PAGE> 59
facsimile number or telex number set forth in its
Administrative Questionnaire or (c) in the case of any
party, such other address, facsimile number or telex number
as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by
notice to the Agent and the Borrower.  Each such notice,
request or other communication shall be effective (i) if
given by telex, when such telex is transmitted to the telex
number specified in this Section and the appropriate
answerback is received, (ii) if given by facsimile
transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number
specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is
received, (iii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such
communication is deposited in the mails with first-class
postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iv) if given by
any other means, when delivered at the address specified in
this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under
Article 2 or Article 8 shall not be effective until
received.

SECTION 9.2.      No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the Agent
or any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights
and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

SECTION 9.3.      Expenses; Indemnification.  (a)  The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Agent and each Arranger, including reasonable fees and
disbursements of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, special counsel
for the Agent and the Arrangers, in connection with the
preparation of the Original Credit Agreement and this
Agreement, the syndication contemplated by Section 5.13, any
waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any
Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs,
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent
and each Bank, including (without duplication) the
reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel and the
allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with such
Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and
other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.

       (b)    The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each
Bank, their respective affiliates and the respective
directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing
(each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
costs and expenses of any kind, including, without


<PAGE> 60
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be
designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating
to the Commitments, the Loans or any actual or proposed use
of proceeds of Loans hereunder; provided that no Indemnitee
shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such
Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 9.4.    Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank agrees that if
it shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim
or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of principal and interest due with respect
to any Note held by it which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate
amount of principal and interest due with respect to any
Note held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and
such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so
that all such payments of principal and interest with
respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by
the Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this
Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any
right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply
the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of
indebtedness of the Borrower other than its indebtedness
hereunder.  The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it
may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder
of a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights
of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to
such participation as fully as if such holder of a
participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.

SECTION 9.5.    Amendments and Waivers.  Any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by
the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or
duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent);
provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless
signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the
Commitment of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the
Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any
additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate
of interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder,
(iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal
of or interest on any Loan, or any fees hereunder or for the

<PAGE> 61
scheduled termination of any Commitment or (iv) change the
percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks, which
shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any
action under this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.6.     Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of all Banks.

       (b)    Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks
or other institutions (each a "Participant") participating
interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Loans.  In
the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating
interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the
Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible
for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the
Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement
pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating
interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole
right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that such
participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not
agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this
Agreement described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of
Section 9.5 without the consent of the Participant.  The
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the
benefits of Article 8 with respect to its participating
interest.  An assignment or other transfer which is not
permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given
effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of
a participating interest granted in accordance with this
subsection (b).

       (c)    Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks
or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a
proportionate part (equivalent to an initial Commitment of
not less than $15,000,000) of all, of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, and such
Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations, pursuant
to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially

<PAGE> 62
the form of Exhibit G hereto executed by such Assignee and
such transferor Bank, with (and subject to) the subscribed
consent of the Borrower and the Agent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld; provided that if an Assignee is an
affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately
prior to such assignment, no such consent shall be required;
and provided further that such assignment may, but need not,
include rights of the transferor Bank in respect of
outstanding Money Market Loans.  Upon execution and delivery
of such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such
transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price
agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such
Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption,
and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no
further consent or action by any party shall be required.
Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this
subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the
Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if
required, a new Note is issued to the Assignee.  In
connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank
shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing
such assignment in the amount of $2,500.  If the Assignee is
not incorporated under the laws of the United States, it
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as
to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 8.4.

      (d)    Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank.  No such assignment shall release the
transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

       (e)    No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any
Bank's rights shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.3 or 8.4 than such Bank would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the rights
transferred, unless such transfer is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the
provisions of Section 8.2, 8.3 or 8.4 requiring such Bank to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office under
certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances
giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

SECTION 9.7.     Collateral.  Each of the Banks represents to
the Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith
is not relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined in


<PAGE> 63
Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or maintenance
of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.8.    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.
This Agreement and each Note shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York.  The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York and of any New York State
court sitting in New York City for purposes of all legal
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.  The Borrower
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a
court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such
a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 9.9.     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes
any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  This
Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Agent
of counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto
(or, in the case of any party as to which an executed
counterpart shall not have been received, receipt by the
Agent in form satisfactory to it constituting delivery of
telegraphic, telex, facsimile or other written confirmation
from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof by such
party).

SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE BORROWER,
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

       IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused
this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
authorized officers as of the day and year first above
written.

                   VINSON & ELKINS L.L.P.


                                ________________,  199_


To the Banks and the Agent
  Referred to Below
c/o Union Bank of Switzerland
  as Agent
299 Park Avenue
New York, New York  10017

Dear Sirs:

       We have acted as special counsel to Central and South
West Corporation (the "Borrower") in connection with the
Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of
November 6, 1995, as amended and restated as of January 18,
1996, between the Borrower, the banks listed on the
signature pages thereof and Union Bank of Switzerland, as
Agent.  Except as otherwise provided herein, terms defined
in the Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein.
This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
of the Credit Agreement.

       In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have
examined the following agreements, instruments and other
documents:

                (a)  the Credit Agreement;

                (b)  the promissory notes executed and
            delivered by the Borrower under the Original
            Credit Agreement (the "Notes"); and

                (c)  such records of the Borrower and such
            other documents as we have deemed necessary as
            a basis for the opinions expressed below.

<PAGE> 2

       In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness
of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity with
authentic original documents of all documents submitted to
us as copies.  When relevant facts were not independently
established, we have relied upon statements of governmental
officials and upon representations made in or pursuant to
the Credit Agreement and certificates of appropriate
representatives of the Borrower.

       In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have
assumed, with respect to all of the documents referred to in
this opinion letter, that (except, to the extent set forth
in the opinions expressed below, as to the Borrower):

                 (i)     such documents have been
                         duly authorized by, have been duly
                         executed and delivered by, and constitute
                         legal, valid and binding and enforceable
                         obligations of, all of the parties to such
                         documents;

                 (ii)    all signatories to such documents have been
                         duly authorized; and

                (iii)    all of the parties to such documents are duly
                         organized and validly existing and have the
                         power and authority (corporate or other) to
                         execute, deliver and perform such documents.

       Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject
also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, and
having considered such questions of law as we have deemed
necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we
are of the opinion that:

       1.  The Borrower is a corporation validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1994 (the "10-K").

       2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the
borrowings by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, are



<PAGE> 3
within the corporate powers of the Borrower, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Borrower and require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority or
agency of the United States of America or the State of New
York, except for the order of the Commission adopted
pursuant to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
as amended (the "Act") (Release No. 35-26156; International
Series Release No. 743; 70-8423) as amended by order of the
Commission (Release No. 35-26383) (jointly called the
"Order") which has been obtained and is in full force and
effect, and do not contravene, or constitute a default
under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower
or of any agreement or instrument governing Material Debt of
the Borrower or of any material agreement, judgment,
injunction, order, decree or other material instrument
binding upon the Borrower or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower.

       3.  The Credit Agreement and the Notes constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower,
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective
terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
or affecting the rights of creditors generally and except as
the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the Notes is
subject to the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the possible
unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality,
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

       The foregoing opinions are subject to the following
comments and qualifications:

      (A)  The enforceability of Section 9.3 of the Credit
  Agreement may be limited by laws limiting the
  enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a
  party, or requiring indemnification of a party for,
  liability for its own action or inaction to the extent
  the action or inaction involves gross negligence,
  recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct.

<PAGE> 4
      (B)  The enforceability of provisions in the Credit
  Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or
  modified except in writing may be limited under certain
  circumstances.

      (C)  We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of
  the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Bank is located
  (other than the State of New York) that limit the
  interest, fees or other charges such Bank may impose
  and (ii) the second sentence of Section 9.8 of the Credit
  Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the
  subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District
  Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate
  any controversy related to any of the Credit Documents.

      (D)  We express no opinion as to the enforceability
  of the following provisions set forth in the Credit
  Agreement:

            (i)   provisions purporting to
                  waive rights to notice, jury trial, or
                  other rights or benefits that cannot be
                  waived under applicable law;

            (ii)  provisions providing that
                  remedies are cumulative; and

           (iii)  provisions that decisions by a party are conclusive.

      (E)  With respect to our opinions expressed in
  paragraph 2 above, we have not undertaken any special
  examination of the files of the Borrower or any public
  records of judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees
  applicable to the Borrower.  We have, with your
  permission, limited our review of (i) material agreements
  and material instruments to those agreements and
  instruments listed as material in the exhibit index in
  the 10-K and (ii) any Material Debt of the Borrower,
  judgments, injunctions, orders and decrees binding on the
  Borrower to those identified as such in the Certificate
  of an officer of the Borrower attached hereto.  We
  express no opinion as to compliance with accounting or
  financial covenants or requirements contained in any of

<PAGE> 5
  the aforesaid orders, decrees, Material Debt, material
  agreements or instruments.

      (F)  In connection with the opinions expressed in
  paragraph 2 above, we note that the authority under the
  Order for recourse borrowings and investment by the
  Borrower and its subsidiaries in exempt wholesale
  generators (as defined in Section 32(e) of the Act) and
  foreign utility companies (as defined in Section 33(a) of
  the Act) is limited to 50% of the Borrower's
  "consolidated retained earnings" as determined in
  accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(ii).

       The foregoing opinions are limited to matters
involving the federal laws of the United States, the
Delaware General Corporation Law and the law of the State of
New York, and we do not express any opinion as to the laws
of any other jurisdiction.

       At the request of our client, this opinion letter is,
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of the Credit Agreement, provided
to you by us in our capacity as counsel to the Borrower and
may not be relied upon by any other Person (except that any
Person that becomes a party to the Credit Agreement as a
Bank after the date hereof may rely upon this opinion as if
it were addressed to such Person as of the date hereof) or
for any purpose other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement without,
in each instance, our prior written consent.

                      Very truly yours,

                         Arrangers




                         OPINION OF
                  CRAVATH, SWAINE & MOORE





                                        ______________, 1995



             Central and South West Corporation
                $850,000,000 Credit Agreement
          dated as of November 6, 1995, as amended
             and restated as of January 18, 1996


   Ladies and Gentlemen:

           We have acted as special counsel to Union
  Bank of Switzerland, in its capacity as administrative
  agent (the "Agent"), and Citibank, N.A., Credit Suisse
  and Union Bank of Switzerland, in their respective
  capacities as Arrangers, in connection with the
  preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit
  Agreement dated as of November 6, 1995, as amended and
  restated as of January 18, 1996 (the "Credit
  Agreement"), among Central and South West Corporation
  (the "Borrower"), the Banks named therein (the "Banks")
  and the Agent.  In that connection, we have examined
  executed counterpart copies of the Credit Agreement and
  executed copies of the Notes issued under the Original
  Credit Agreement (as defined in the Credit Agreement).

           In rendering our opinion, we have with your
  consent assumed (i) the due authorization, execution
  and delivery of the Credit Agreement by each party
  thereto and (ii) the authenticity of all documents
  submitted to us as originals and the conformity to
  original documents of all documents submitted to us as
  copies.

<PAGE> 2

           Based upon the foregoing, we are of opinion
  that the Credit Agreement and the Notes constitute the
  legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower,
  enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with
  their respective terms, subject to applicable
  bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
  reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
  creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
  and to general equitable principles (including, without
  limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness,
  good faith and fair dealing), regardless of whether
  such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
  equity or at law.  In addition, (i) we note that
  insofar as provisions contained in the Credit Agreement
  provide for indemnification, the enforcement thereof
  may be limited by public policy considerations, (ii) we
  express no opinion as to the last sentence of
  Section 9.4 of the Credit Agreement and (iii) we
  express no opinion as to the effect of the law of any
  jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein
  any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the
  Credit Agreement or any Note may be sought that limits
  rates of interest legally chargeable or collectable.

           We are admitted to practice only in the State
  of New York and express no opinion as to matters
  governed by any laws other than the laws of the State
  of New York and the Federal laws of the United States
  of America.  This opinion is being delivered to you
  pursuant to Section 3.1(b) of the Credit Agreement, and
  may not be relied upon by any other person without our
  prior written consent, except that any person that
  becomes a party to the Credit Agreement as a Bank after
  the date hereof may rely upon this opinion as if it
  were addressed to such person as of the date hereof.


  Very truly yours,

                      ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT




     AGREEMENT dated as of _________, 19__ among <NAME OF
ASSIGNOR> (the "Assignor"), <NAME OF ASSIGNEE> (the
"Assignee"), CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEST CORPORATION (the
"Borrower") and UNION BANK OF SWITZERLAND, as Agent (the
"Agent").

     WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the
"Agreement") relates to the Credit Agreement dated as of
November 6, 1995, as amended and restated as of January 18,
1996, among the Borrower, the Assignor and the other Banks
party thereto, as Banks, and the Agent (the "Credit
Agreement");

     WHEREAS, as provided under the Credit Agreement, the
Assignor has a Commitment to make Loans to the Borrower in
an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
exceed $__________;

     WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by the
Assignor under the Credit Agreement in the aggregate
principal amount of $__________ are outstanding at the date
hereof; and

     WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the
Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit
Agreement in respect of a portion of its Commitment
thereunder in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned
Amount"), together with a corresponding portion of its
Committed Loans, and the Assignee proposes to accept
assignment of such rights and assume the corresponding
obligations from the Assignor on such terms;

<PAGE> 2
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

     Section 1.  Definitions.  All capitalized terms not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
set forth in the Credit Agreement.

     Section 2.  Assignment.  The Assignor hereby assigns
and sells to the Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor
under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned
Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment from
the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the
Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the extent of the
Assigned Amount, including the purchase from the Assignor of
the corresponding portion of the principal amount of the
Committed Loans made by the Assignor outstanding at the date
hereof.  Upon the execution and delivery hereof by the
Assignor, the Assignee, [the Borrower and the Agent] and the
payment of the amounts specified in Section 3 required to be
paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee shall, as of the
date hereof, succeed to the rights and be obligated to
perform the obligations of a Bank under the Credit Agreement
with a Commitment in an amount equal to the Assigned Amount,
and (ii) the Commitment of the Assignor shall, as of the
date hereof, be reduced by a like amount and the Assignor
released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement to
the extent such obligations have been assumed by the
Assignee.  The assignment provided for herein shall be
without recourse to the Assignor.

     Section 3.  Payments.  As consideration for the
assignment and sale contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the
Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the date hereof in
Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between them.(1)
It is understood that commitment and/or facility fees accrued
to the date hereof are for the account of the Assignor and

- ----------------
  (1) Amount should combine principal together with accrued
interest and breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the
Assignee, net of any portion of any upfront fee to be paid
by the Assignor to the Assignee.  It may be preferable in an
appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by
formula rather than as a fixed sum.

<PAGE> 3


such fees accruing from and including the date hereof are
for the account of the Assignee.  Each of the Assignor and
the Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount
under the Credit Agreement which is for the account of the
other party hereto, it shall receive the same for the
account of such other party to the extent of such other
party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same to
such other party.

     [Section 4.  Consent of the Borrower and the Agent.
This Agreement is conditioned upon the consent of the
Borrower and the Agent pursuant to Section 9.6(c) of the
Credit Agreement.  The execution of this Agreement by the
Borrower and the Agent is evidence of this consent.
Pursuant to Section 9.6(c), the Borrower agrees to execute
and deliver a Note payable to the order of the Assignee to
evidence the assignment and assumption provided for herein.]

     Section 5.  Non-Reliance on Assignor.  The Assignor
makes no representation or warranty in connection with, and
shall have no responsibility with respect to, the solvency,
financial condition, or statements of the Borrower, or the
validity and enforceability of the obligations of the
Borrower in respect of the Credit Agreement or any Note.
The Assignee acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance on the Assignor, and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement and will continue to be responsible for making its
own independent appraisal of the business, affairs and
financial condition of the Borrower.

     Section 6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York.

     Section 7.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this
Agreement to be executed and delivered by their duly
authorized officers as of the date first above written.

<PAGE> 22
2.3  Nature of the Banks' rights and obligations hereunder

(a)  Banks'  Commitments:  No Bank is obliged to  participate  in
     the making of any Utilisation (i) in the case of a Tranche 1
     Advance,  in  an  amount  exceeding its  undrawn  Tranche  1
     Commitment, (ii) in the case of a Tranche 2 Advance,  in  an
     amount exceeding its undrawn Tranche 2 Commitment, and (iii)
     in  the  case of a Tranche 3 Utilisation, if to do so  would
     cause the aggregate of the amounts of (A) its participations
     in  the Tranche 3 Advances outstanding under this Agreement,
     and  (B) the Outstanding Liability Amounts in respect of all
     outstanding  Bills  accepted by such  Bank,  to  exceed  its
     Tranche 3 Commitment.

(b)  Obligations  several:  The obligations of  each  Bank  under
     this  Agreement are several.  The failure of a Bank to carry
     out  its  obligations under this Agreement shall not relieve
     any  other  party  of  its  obligations  under  any  Finance
     Document.   No Bank shall be responsible for the obligations
     of any other Bank under this Agreement.

(c)  Agents not responsible:  The Facility Agent and the Security
     Agent, in their capacities as such, shall not be responsible
     for the non-performance by any Bank of its obligations under
     this Agreement.

(d)  Rights  several:   The obligations of each  Obligor  to  the
     Finance Parties under the Finance Documents are owed to each
     of  them  as  separate  and independent  obligations.   Each
     Finance  Party  may,  except  as  otherwise  stated  herein,
     separately  enforce its rights hereunder without joining  in
     any other Finance Party.

2.4  Nature of Borrowers' rights and obligations hereunder

(a)  Rights  and  Obligations: The obligations of  the  Borrowers
     under  this Agreement in their capacities as such  shall  be
     separate and independent and not joint and several, and  the
     Company and not the other Borrowers shall be liable for:-

     (i)  payment of all amounts becoming due under Clause 15  to
          the  extent  that  such amounts are  not  referable  to
          Utilisations   made  by  or  to  monies   received   or
          receivable  from  a  particular  Borrower  or  are  not
          otherwise  in  the reasonable opinion of  the  Facility
          Agent referable to a particular Borrower; and

     (ii) payment  of  all amounts due under Clause  24,  to  the
          extent  that in the reasonable opinion of the  Facility
          Agent  such  amounts are not referable to a  particular
          Borrower.

(b)  Facility Agent's determination: The written determination of
     the  Facility  Agent acting reasonably with  regard  to  any
     matter  which,  according  to  Clause  2.4(a),  is   to   be
     determined  according  to its reasonable  opinion  shall  be
     conclusive  save in the case of manifest error.   No  person
     shall have any recourse to the Facility Agent in relation to
     any  such determination if it proves to be the case that its
     opinion   was  incorrect  unless  the  Facility  Agent   was
     negligent or fraudulent in making any such determination.

(c)  Company as Obligors' Agent: Any and each Obligor (other than
     the  Company)  by  and upon its execution  of  an  Accession
     Agreement,  irrevocably appoints the Company to act  on  its
     behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance Documents and
     irrevocably authorises the Company on its behalf to give all
     notices and instructions (including Requests) to execute  on
     its   behalf  any  Accession  Agreement  and  to  make  such
     agreements  capable of being given or made by  such  Obligor

<PAGE> 23
     notwithstanding  that they may affect such Obligor,  without
     further reference to or the consent of such Obligor and such
     Obligor shall be bound thereby as though such Obligor itself
     had  given such notices and instructions (including, without
     limitation,   any  Requests)  or  executed  or   made   such
     agreements.

(d)  Company's  acts  binding:  Every act,  omission,  agreement,
     undertaking,   settlement,   waiver,   notice    or    other
     communication  given  or  made by  the  Company  under  this
     Agreement, or in connection with this Agreement (whether  or
     not  known to any other Obligor and whether occurring before
     or  after  such other Obligor became an Obligor  under  this
     Agreement)  shall  be binding for all purposes  on  all  the
     Obligors as if the Obligors had expressly concurred with the
     same.   In the event of any conflict between any notices  or
     other  communications of the Company and any other  Obligor,
     those of the Company shall prevail.

2.5  Issues Relative to the Offer

(a)  Each  of the Facility Agent and the Banks acknowledges  that
     issues ("Issues") involving the possibility of amendment  to
     the  Offer or waiver of or determination of satisfaction (or
     otherwise) as to conditions to the Offer are likely to arise
     which  will require to be determined at short notice if  the
     efficient conduct of the Offer is not to be impeded.

(b)  Each of the Company, Bidco, the Facility Agent and the Banks
     acknowledges  that,  depending on the  Issue  involved,  the
     agreement  of  the Banks or Majority Banks may  be  required
     before an Issue can be addressed in the manner in which  the
     Company or Bidco wishes to address it whilst complying  with
     the  provisions of Clause 21.10 and other provisions of this
     Agreement.

(c)  The  Facility Agent has identified to the Company and  Bidco
     the  names  and contact details of certain persons  to  whom
     Issues should be referred for the purpose of initiating  the
     process  by  which  any agreement of the Banks  or  Majority
     Banks  required in relation thereto may be sought.  Each  of
     the Banks has identified to the Facility Agent the names and
     contact  details  of certain persons to  whom  the  Facility
     Agent  should  in turn refer such Issues for a determination
     as  to whether such Bank will give or withhold its agreement
     where  the  agreement  of the Banks  or  Majority  Banks  is
     required.

(d)  The  Facility Agent undertakes to the Company and Bidco that
     it   will  use  its  reasonable  endeavours  to  ensure  the
     availability of appropriate personnel at all times  to  deal
     promptly  on  its behalf with any referral to  the  Facility
     Agent  and the Banks of any Issues in relation to which  any
     agreement  of  the Banks or Majority Banks is  required  and
     with  the obtaining of the decision of the Banks or Majority
     Banks  (as  appropriate) as to whether or not to  give  such
     agreement, and that it will use its reasonable endeavours to
     ensure  that  each request for any such agreement  is  dealt
     with  and  responded to by it and the Banks within the  time
     horizon communicated to it by the Company or Bidco.

(e)  Each  Bank undertakes to each of the Facility Agent and  the
     Company    and  Bidco  that  it  will  use  its   reasonable
     endeavours   to  ensure  the  availability  of   appropriate
     personnel  at all times to deal promptly on its behalf  with
     any  referral  to it by the Facility Agent of any  Issue  in
     relation  to which its agreement is requested in order  that
     its  decision  as  to  whether  to  give  or  withhold  such
     agreement  may  be  communicated promptly  to  the  Facility
     Agent,  and  that it will use its reasonable  endeavours  to
     ensure that each such request is dealt with and responded to
     within  the time horizon communicated to it by the  Facility
     Agent.

<PAGE> 24
(f)  In  addition to the undertakings of the Facility  Agent  and
     the  Banks  contained in paragraphs (d) and (e)  above,  the
     Facility  Agent and each Bank acknowledges that  (i)  during
     the final phase of the Offer period and when notified by the
     Company or Bidco, authorised Bank personnel will have to  be
     available  on a 24 hour basis to consider Issues,  and  (ii)
     failure by any Bank to give a prompt response in relation to
     any  Issue  during  such final phase  could  jeopardise  the
     success of the Offer.  Accordingly each Bank agrees that (so
     far  as practicable, and taking into account the materiality
     of  any  particular Issue) it will establish an  appropriate
     internal  approval process to enable it to  provide  such  a
     response.

3.   PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITY

          any  of the purposes described in paragraph (ii) above,
          and   (C)  other  general  corporate  purposes  of  the
          Borrowers  and their Subsidiaries permitted  under  the
          terms  of this Agreement, provided always that no  more

          day  as Tranche 3 Utilisations where the proceeds  have
          been  applied directly or indirectly towards  financing

          or (C) of paragraph (i) above.

(b)  Each   Borrower  undertakes  that  the  proceeds   of   each
     Utilisation  by  it  shall be used  only  for  the  purposes
     permitted for such Utilisations by Clause 3.1, and  that  no
     Utilisation  in  any event shall be used in  any  way  which
     would  be  illegal under, or would cause the  invalidity  or
     unenforceability (in each case in whole or in part)  of  any
     Finance  Document  under,  any  applicable  law  (including,
     without limitation, section 151 of the Companies Act 1985).

3.2  Responsibility

     Without   prejudice  to  the  foregoing  and  the  remaining
     provisions  of  this Agreement, none of the Finance  Parties
     shall  be  bound to enquire as to the use or application  of
     the  proceeds of any Utilisation, nor shall any of  them  be
     responsible  for  or for the consequences  of  such  use  or
     application.

     or  liability  was  incurred directly as  a  result  of  the
     Facility  Agent failing to take reasonable care to safeguard
     the Bills.

     Each  Bank will arrange for each Bill accepted by it  to  be
     discounted on its behalf by a bank carrying on a  bona  fide
     banking  business  or  a person bona fide  carrying  on  the
     business of a discount house, in the United Kingdom in  each
     case  (which  may  include  the Bank  discounting  the  Bill
     itself).

6.11 Information relating to Bills

     Each Borrower, promptly on request by a Finance Party, shall
     supply  to  the  Facility Agent for that Finance  Party  any
     information  relating to any Bill (including the  underlying
     trade  transaction for that Bill) as that Finance Party  may

     England  or  any other fiscal or monetary authority  in  the
     United Kingdom.

6.12 Eligible Bills

     Each  Borrower shall ensure that each Bill drawn by  it  and
     accepted by a Bank is, assuming that the relevant Bank is  a
     bank  whose  acceptances are then being treated as  eligible
     acceptances   by   the   Bank  of  England,   eligible   for
     rediscounting at the Bank of England.

(a)  If  any  Borrower shall prepay any Bill pursuant to  any  of
     Clauses 9.2, 13.6, 14.5, 15.2 or 16 by providing cash  cover
     therefor,  the amount to be so provided shall  be  the  face
     amount  of that Bill discounted on the basis of such  normal
     commercial  rates prevailing at the time of  prepayment  for
     Sterling deposits of an amount equal to such face amount for
     the  period from the date of prepayment to the Maturity Date
     of  such Bill as the Facility Agent (after consultation with
     the   Company  and  the  relevant  Bank)  shall   reasonably
     determine.

(b)  If  any Borrower shall be required to provide cash cover for
     any  Bill  pursuant to Clause 23.2(e), the amount to  be  so
     provided and deposited with the Facility Agent shall be  the
     face  amount of such Bill, and the Facility Agent,  promptly
     upon  receipt, shall in turn deposit an amount equal to  the
     amount  so  received by it for the period from the  date  of
     payment  to  the  Maturity Date for such Bill  at  the  then
     prevailing market rates for like deposits.  Upon receipt  of
     interest  on such deposit, the Facility Agent shall  pay  an
     amount equal thereto to the Company (after deduction of  any
     applicable  tax)  by  way  of interest  on  the  cash  cover
     deposited  with it, unless a Default is then  continuing  in
     which  event such amount shall be applied in payment of  any
     overdue  amount  or,  if  none,  added  to  the  cash  cover
     deposited with the Facility Agent.

     of  each Bill on its Maturity Date to the Facility Agent for
     the Bank which accepted such Bill, provided always that each
     Bill then outstanding shall be repaid in full on the Tranche
     2/3 Repayment Date.

9.   PREPAYMENT

9.1  Prohibition

     No  Borrower  may prepay all or any part of any  Utilisation
     except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

9.2  Voluntary Prepayment

(a)  Subject  to Clause 9.2(b), the Company, on giving  not  less
     than  three  Business  Days' prior  written  notice  to  the
     Facility Agent (which shall promptly give notice of the same
     to  the  Banks) specifying, inter alia, the amount and  date
     for  prepayment  and identifying the Utilisation  concerned,
     may  procure that any Utilisation is prepaid at any time  in
     whole  or  in  part by the Borrower by which  it  was  made,
     provided  that any prepayment shall be (if in part)  in  the
     case  of  a Tranche 1 Advance or a Tranche 2 Advance  of  an
     amount  which is at least 10,000,000 pounds or, in  the case
     of a Tranche 3 Utilisation, of an amount which  is a minimum
     (and, if more, a whole multiple) of 1,000,000 pounds.

(b)  Any  such  prepayment and any prepayment pursuant to  Clause
     9.3 shall be applied pro rata against the participations  of
     the Banks in the Utilisation prepaid.

<PAGE> 33
9.3  Mandatory Prepayment

     The Company and Bidco shall procure that the Net Proceeds of
     sales  of  Grid  Shares by any member of the  Group  to  any
     person who is not a member of the Group shall be applied  in
     or  towards prepayment of Tranche 1 Advances promptly  after
     receipt of such Net Proceeds by the relevant member  of  the
     Group,  provided that such Net Proceeds may be deposited  in
     an  interest  bearing account with the Facility  Agent  with
     irrevocable  instructions being given to the Facility  Agent
     in  a form satisfactory to it to apply such Net Proceeds  on
     the next Interest Date(s) relative to the Tranche 1 Advances
     in  or  towards  prepayment of the Tranche 1 Advances.   For
     this purpose "Net Proceeds" means the consideration received
     by  any  member  or members of the Group in respect  of  the
     disposal  from  the  Group to any third party  of  the  Grid
     Shares concerned, after deduction of all amounts for  or  on
     account  of  Taxes applicable to, or to any gain  (including
     any deemed gain) resulting from, the disposal and all costs,
     fees, expenses and the like properly incurred by members  of
     the Group in arranging and effecting that disposal.

9.4  Bills

(a)  If  and  to  the  extent that any prepayment  of  Tranche  3
     Utilisations made or required to be made under any provision
     of  this  Agreement could be satisfied by  a  prepayment  of
     Tranche  3   Advances, then Tranche 3 Advances  rather  than
     Bills shall be prepaid.

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, Clauses 1.2(m) and 6.13 describe
     the manner in which a Utilisation by Bill may be prepaid for
     the purposes of this Agreement, and any prepayment of such a
     Utilisation shall be effected in that manner.

9.5  General provisions relating to prepayment

(a)  Any notice of prepayment given under this Agreement shall be
     irrevocable, and the Company or the Borrower named  in  such
     notice  shall  be bound to prepay (or, in the  case  of  the
     Company,  to  procure  prepayment) in accordance  with  such
     notice.

(b)  Amounts  repaid  and prepaid in respect  of  any  Tranche  1
     Advance  or  Tranche 2 Advance under any provision  of  this
     Agreement may not be reborrowed hereunder.

(c)  Amounts repaid or prepaid pursuant to Clause 8.3 or  9.2  in
     respect  of Tranche 3 Utilisations may, prior to the Tranche
     2/3  Repayment  Date  but  subject  to  the  terms  of  this
     Agreement,  be  redrawn  as  Tranche  3  Utilisations.   Any
     amounts   repaid  or  prepaid  in  respect  of   Tranche   3
     Utilisations under any other provision of this Agreement may
     not be redrawn.

(d)  Any  prepayment of any Advance under any provision  of  this
     Agreement  shall be made together with interest  accrued  on
     the amount prepaid, but (subject to clause 24.2(c)), without
     premium or penalty.

10.  INTEREST PERIODS

10.1 Selection and agreement

     The  relevant  Borrower shall give notice  to  the  Facility
     Agent  not later than 10.00 a.m. on the second Business  Day
     prior  to the commencement of each (or the) Interest  Period
     relative  to  any Advance made hereunder (or in the  Request
     therefor  in the case of the first Interest Period  relative
     to  any  Tranche  1  Advance or Tranche  2  Advance  or  the
     Interest  Period  in  the  case of any  Tranche  3  Advance)

<PAGE> 34
     specifying  the duration of such Interest Period,  which  in
     the case of any Tranche 1 Advance or Tranche 2 Advance shall
     be  of  one,  three or six months and in  the  case  of  any
     Tranche  3   Advance  shall be of one,  two,  three  or  six
     months, or in each case such other duration as may be agreed
     by  the Facility Agent after consultation with the Reference
     Banks  or  as  may  be  required in  order  to  comply  with
     Clause  10.3  (provided that if such duration  is  over  six
     months  then  the  Facility Agent may only  agree  with  the
     unanimous  consent  of  the  Banks  participating  in   such
     Advance).   If  the relevant Borrower fails to  specify  the
     duration  of an Interest Period for any Advance the duration
     of  that  Interest Period shall be three months  subject  as
     otherwise  required  in  order  to  comply  with  any  other
     provision of this Agreement.

10.2 Splitting

     The  relevant Borrower may, in any notice given pursuant  to
     Clause 10.1 (or in any Request therefor) split any Tranche 1
     Advance  or  Tranche 2 Advance into any number  of  separate
     Tranche 1 Advances or Tranche 2 Advances, respectively (each
     having   an   Interest  Period  of  a  different   duration,
     separately  designated in such notice or Request),  provided
     that  each such separate Advance must be of a minimum amount
     of 100,000,000 pounds.  Each Advance resulting from any such
     splitting  shall continue as a separate Advance  unless  and
     until  consolidated  with another Advance  having  the  same
     Tranche designation.

10.3 Restrictions on selection

(a)  Each  Borrower  shall use its reasonable endeavours  (i)  to
     ensure  the  selection  by it of the  duration  of  Interest
     Periods  pursuant  to  Clause 10.1 so  that  the  Tranche  1
     Repayment Date will also be an Interest Date relative to all
     outstanding  Tranche  1 Advances and that  the  Tranche  2/3
     Repayment Date will also be an Interest Date relative to all
     outstanding  Tranche  2  Advances and  Tranche  3  Advances,
     (ii)  in  relation to the Tranche 1 Advances and  Tranche  2
     Advances,  to ensure the selection by it of the duration  of
     Interest  Periods pursuant to Clause 10.1 so that Tranche  1
     Advances   and   Tranche  2  Advances  are  aggregated   and
     consolidated pursuant to Clause 10.4 into Tranche 1 Advances
     and  Tranche  2  Advances  respectively  of  not  less  than
     100,000,000 pounds each and (iii) to select the duration  of
     Interest  Periods pursuant to Clause 10.1 so  as  to  ensure
     that no Advance shall have an Interest Period expiring after
     the Repayment Date relative thereto.

(b)  If  it appears to the Facility Agent in good faith that  the
     requirements of paragraph (a) above will not  be  met  by  a
     Borrower's  selection of any Interest Period,  the  Facility
     Agent,  on  behalf  of  and  after  consultation  with  that
     Borrower, may select a different duration for such  Interest
     Period  (which  shall  prevail over that  selected  by  that
     Borrower)  in  order  to  facilitate  the  meeting  of  such
     requirements.

10.4 Duration and Consolidation

(a)  The  first (or the) Interest Period relative to each Advance
     shall  commence on its Utilisation Date and end on the  last
     day  of  the  period selected or provided for in  accordance
     with  this  Clause.   Any  subsequent  Interest  Periods  in
     relation  to a Tranche 1 Advance or Tranche 2 Advance  shall
     commence on the expiry of the immediately preceding Interest
     Period  relating  thereto and end on the  last  day  of  the
     period  so  selected or provided therefor.  If any  Interest
     Period for any Advance would otherwise end on a day which is
     not  a  Business Day, such Interest Period shall end instead
     on the next Business Day.

<PAGE> 35
(b)  If  any Interest Period relating to any Tranche 1 or Tranche
     2   Advance   expires  on  an  Interest  Date  relative   to
     (respectively)  another  Tranche  1  Advance  or  Tranche  2
     Advance  (as the case may be), then, with effect  from  such
     Interest Date, such Tranche 1 Advances or Tranche 2 Advances
     (as  the  case  may be), subject to Clauses 10.1,  10.2  and
     10.3,   shall  be  aggregated  and  consolidated   to   form
     (respectively)  a  single Tranche 1  Advance  or  Tranche  2
     Advance.

10.5 Notification

     The  Facility Agent will notify the relevant Banks  and  the
     Company  and  (if  different) the relevant Borrower  of  the
     duration  of  each Interest Period relating to each  Advance
     promptly after ascertaining the same.

11.  INTEREST

11.1 Rate

     The rate of interest applicable to each Advance for each (or
     the)  Interest Period relative to it shall be the  rate  per
     annum  determined by the Facility Agent to be the  aggregate
     of:-

     (a)  the Margin;

     (b)  LIBOR  relative  to  such  Advance  for  such  Interest
          Period; and

     (c)  the  Additional Cost, if any, relative to such  Advance
          from time to time during such Interest Period.

11.2 Due dates

     Save  as otherwise provided herein, interest accrued on each
     Advance  for each Interest Period relative thereto shall  be
     paid  by the Borrower in respect of such Advance in Sterling
     in  arrear on the last day of such Interest Period and also,
     in  the  case of an Interest Period of a duration  exceeding
     six  months, on the last day of each consecutive  period  of
     six months from the first day of such Interest Period.

11.3 Default interest

     If  any Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it  under
     this  Agreement on the due date therefor, such  Obligor,  on
     demand  by  the Facility Agent from time to time, shall  pay
     interest  on such overdue amount (including overdue  default
     interest)  in the currency in which such overdue  amount  is
     for  the time being denominated from the due date up to  the
     date of actual payment, both before and after judgement,  at
     a  rate determined by the Facility Agent to be one per cent.
     (1%)  per  annum above that which would be payable  if  such
     overdue amount constituted, during the period of non-payment
     thereof,  an  Advance  made  to such  Obligor  in  the  same
     currency  as  the  overdue  amount for  successive  Interest
     Periods  of  such  duration of up to  three  months  as  the
     Facility Agent, after consultation with the Company  to  the
     extent practicable in the circumstances, may designate  from
     time to time.  Such rate shall be determined or redetermined
     on  the first Business Day of each such Interest Period.  In
     calculating  the  amount of default interest  due  from  the
     Guarantor  in  respect of any overdue amount  due  from  any
     Borrower,  the amount of default interest accrued  due  from
     such  Borrower  and the amount of overdue  default  interest
     accrued due from the Guarantor shall not be double counted.

<PAGE> 36
11.4 Bank basis

     Interest  shall accrue from day to day, and be  computed  on
     the  basis  of a year of 365 days for the actual  number  of
     days elapsed.

11.5 Determination conclusive; notification

     Each  determination of a rate of interest  by  the  Facility
     Agent under this Agreement shall, in the absence of manifest
     error,  be conclusive and shall be promptly notified to  the
     Company, the relevant Borrower and the Banks.

12.  PAYMENTS

12.1 Funds, place and currency

     Unless  otherwise  agreed between the  Banks,  the  Facility
     Agent  and  the  Company, all payments to  be  made  to  the
     Facility Agent by any Obligor under any Finance Document  or
     by  any  Bank under this Agreement shall be made on the  due
     date  to  the  Facility Agent at The Royal Bank of  Scotland
     plc,  sort  code  16-00-34,  for credit  to  Account  Number
     10000643 or to such other account at such bank or office  as
     the  Facility Agent shall designate by not less  than  three
     Business  Days' notice to the Company or such Bank  (as  the
     case may be).

12.2 Application

     Each  payment received by the Facility Agent for the account
     of another person pursuant to Clause 12.1 shall:-

     (a)  in  the  case of a payment received for the account  of
          any  Borrower, be made available by the Facility  Agent
          to that Borrower by application, on the date and in the
          funds of receipt:-

          (i)  first,  in or towards payment of any amounts  then
               due  and  payable  (and unpaid) by  that  Borrower
               under this Agreement; and

          (ii) second,  in  payment  to  such  account  as   that
               Borrower  shall have properly designated  for  the
               purpose  in  the relevant Request or otherwise  in
               writing; and

     (b)  in  the case of any other payment, be made available by
          the  Facility Agent to the person for whose account the
          payment  was received (in the case of a Bank,  for  the
          account of its Facility Office) on the date and in  the
          currency  and funds of receipt to such account  of  the
          person  with the office or bank in the country  of  the
          currency concerned as that person shall have previously
          notified to the Facility Agent for the purposes of this
          Agreement.

     The  Facility Agent (or the Security Agent in  the  case  of
     monies  received  pursuant to the Security Documents)  shall
     promptly distribute monies received for the account  of  the
     Banks   among  the  Banks  pro  rata  to  their   respective
     entitlements  and  in  the funds and  currency  of  receipt,
     provided that the Facility Agent or Security Agent  (as  the
     case  may  be) may deduct therefrom any amount  due  to  the
     Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 12.4 or 30.2.

<PAGE> 37
12.3 Currency

     Any  amount  payable under this Agreement, unless  otherwise
     provided, shall be payable in Sterling.

12.4 Recovery of payments

     Unless the Facility Agent shall have received notice from  a
     Bank or a Borrower not later than 11.00 a.m. on the Business
     Day  prior  to the date upon which such Bank or  a  Borrower
     (the  "Party  Liable") is to pay an amount to  the  Facility
     Agent  for transfer to any Borrower or any Bank respectively
     (the  "Payee") that the Party Liable does not intend to make
     that amount available to the Facility Agent on the due date,
     the Facility Agent may assume that the Party Liable has paid
     that amount to the Facility Agent on that date in accordance
     with this Agreement.  In reliance upon that assumption,  the
     Facility  Agent  may  (but shall not  be  obliged  to)  make
     available  to  the Payee(s) a corresponding  sum.   If  that
     amount  is  not  in fact so made available to  the  Facility
     Agent, the Payee(s) shall forthwith on demand repay that sum
     to  the  Facility Agent together with interest on  such  sum
     until  its  repayment at a rate determined by  the  Facility
     Agent  to  reflect  its  cost of funds  incurred  in  making
     available  the  corresponding amount to that  Payee(s)  (any
     such  determination  to  be conclusive  in  the  absence  of
     manifest error).  The Facility Agent may make a demand on  a
     Borrower  as  Payee  only  if and to  the  extent  that  the
     Facility  Agent has demanded the appropriate funds from  the
     relevant  Bank and those funds have not been  paid  by  that
     Bank  forthwith  after the demand.  The provisions  of  this
     Clause  are  without  prejudice to any rights  the  Facility
     Agent and the Payee may have against the Party Liable.

12.5 Non-Business Days

     Whenever any payment under any Finance Document shall become
     due  on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date  for
     that  payment  shall be extended to the next  Business  Day.
     During any such extension of the due date for payment of any
     principal,  interest shall be payable on such  principal  at
     the rate payable on the original due date.

12.6 Appropriations

     Other  than  in  the case of prepayment to a  specific  Bank
     permitted by the terms of this Agreement, in the case  of  a
     partial  payment by any Obligor of amounts due  and  payable
     under  any Finance Document, the Facility Agent or,  as  the
     case may be, the Security Agent may appropriate such payment
     towards  such of the amounts due and payable by such Obligor
     under  this Agreement as the Facility Agent or, as the  case
     may  be,  the  Security Agent may with the approval  of  the
     Majority Banks decide (subject to the requirement that  such
     payment  shall  be appropriated first towards those  overdue
     amounts  which attract the higher Margin), and each part  of
     any  payment so appropriated towards a particular amount due
     and  payable under any Finance Document shall be treated  as
     received by the Facility Agent or, as the case may  be,  the
     Security  Agent for the account of the Banks  to  whom  such
     particular  amount  is due, in each case  pro  rata  to  the
     respective  amounts thereof due to each of  them  from  such
     Obligor.    Any   such  appropriation  shall  override   any
     appropriation made by any Obligor.

<PAGE> 38
12.7 Certifications

     Save  as  otherwise  provided herein, any  certification  or
     determination  of  a  rate  or amount  or  other  matter  as
     referred to herein and made by the Facility Agent or a Bank,
     as  the  case may be, shall be prima facie evidence  of  the
     same.

13.  TAXES

13.1 Applicable Taxes

     As  used  in  this Agreement, "Applicable Taxes"  means  all
     Taxes  imposed  by  or  in  the jurisdiction  in  which  the
     relevant Obligor is resident or any other country through or
     out  of  which  the  relevant payment  is  made  or  by  any
     federation or organisation of which that country  may  be  a
     member  or  by  or  through any taxation authority  of  that
     country,  federation or organisation on any payment  by  any
     Obligor or any Finance Party to any Finance Party, under any
     Finance  Document, other than Taxes imposed on that  payment
     which  would  not have been imposed on that payment  if  the
     Finance Party to which or for whose account that payment was
     made was a Recognised Bank.


13.2 No Set-Off or Deductions

     All  payments  to be made by any Obligor under  any  of  the
     Finance Documents shall be made:-

     (a)  without set-off or counterclaim; and

     (b)  free  and clear of all and without deduction for or  on
          account  of any Applicable Taxes, except to the  extent
          that  such Obligor is compelled by law to make  payment
          subject to the Applicable Taxes.

13.3 Gross-up

     If  any Applicable Taxes or amounts in respect thereof  must
     be deducted from any payment by an Obligor under any Finance
     Document  or  any  other deductions must be  made  from  any
     amounts  paid  by  any  Obligor (or from  any  corresponding
     payment  by  any  Finance Party to any other  Finance  Party
     under or pursuant to the terms of any Finance Document),  or
     any  such  payment shall otherwise be required  to  be  made
     subject  to any Applicable Tax, such Obligor shall pay  such
     additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure  that  each
     Finance Party receives a net amount after deduction for  and
     payment  of  all Applicable Taxes equal to the  full  amount
     which  it  would  have received had payment  not  been  made
     subject  to  the  Applicable  Tax.   All  Applicable   Taxes
     required  to  be  deducted from any payment by  any  Obligor
     under  any Finance Document shall be deducted and paid  when
     due by such Obligor to the applicable Tax authorities.  Each
     Finance Party shall notify each Obligor through the Facility
     Agent  of the application of this Clause 13.3 to any payment
     then  due  or to become due to it under any Finance Document
     promptly upon its becoming aware of the same.

13.4 Tax Receipts

     As  soon as reasonably practicable after each payment by any
     Obligor of any Applicable Tax (or any Tax which would be  an
     Applicable   Tax  save  for  the  exceptions  contained   in
     Clauses  13.1(a)  or (b)) on any payment  by  it  under  any
     Finance Document, such Obligor shall deliver to the Facility

<PAGE> 39
     Agent for the relevant payee Finance Party or other party to
     this Agreement evidence reasonably satisfactory to the payee
     (including copies of relevant Tax receipts received by  such
     Obligor,   which  such  Obligor  shall  use  its  reasonable
     endeavours  to obtain) that the relevant Tax has  been  duly
     remitted to the appropriate authority.

13.5 Tax Saving

(a)  In   the  event  that,  following  the  imposition  of   any
     Applicable  Tax  on  any  payment by  any  Obligor  (or  any
     corresponding  payment by any Finance  Party  to  any  other
     Finance Party under this Agreement) in consequence of  which
     such  Obligor  is  required under Clause 13.3  to  pay  such
     Applicable Tax or to pay any additional amount in respect of
     it, any Finance Party shall in its sole opinion and based on
     its  own  interpretation of any relevant laws or regulations
     (but  acting in good faith) receive or be granted  a  credit
     against or remission for or deduction from or in respect  of
     any  Applicable Tax payable by it, or shall obtain any other
     relief  in  respect  of Applicable Tax  on  its  profits  or
     income, which in such Finance Party's opinion in good  faith
     is  both  reasonably  identifiable and  quantifiable  by  it
     without  requiring  such Finance Party or  its  professional
     advisers  to  expend a material amount of time  or  incur  a
     material cost in so identifying or quantifying (any  of  the
     foregoing,  to  the  extent so reasonably  identifiable  and
     quantifiable, being referred to as a "saving"), such Finance
     Party  shall,  to  the  extent that it  can  do  so  without
     prejudice  to  the  retention of  the  relevant  saving  and
     subject to such Obligor's obligation to repay the amount  to
     such  Finance  Party if the relevant saving is  subsequently
     disallowed  or  cancelled  (which repayment  shall  be  made
     promptly on receipt of notice by such Finance Party of  such
     disallowance   or  cancellation),  reimburse  such   Obligor
     promptly after receipt of such saving by such Finance  Party
     with  such  amount as such Finance Party shall in  its  sole
     opinion but in good faith have concluded to be the amount or
     value of the relevant saving.

(b)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall interfere with the
     right  of  any  Finance Party to arrange its Tax  and  other
     affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit and, in particular,
     no  Finance  Party  shall be under any obligation  to  claim
     relief  from  Tax  on  its corporate profits,  or  from  any
     similar Tax liability, in respect of the Applicable Tax,  or
     to  claim  relief in priority to any other claims,  reliefs,
     credits or deductions available to it or to disclose details
     of  its Tax affairs.  No Finance Party shall be required  to
     disclose  any  confidential  information  relating  to   the
     organisation of its affairs.

(c)  Each Finance Party will notify the relevant Obligor promptly
     of  the  receipt by such Finance Party of any saving and  of
     such  Finance Party's opinion as to the amount or  value  of
     that saving.

13.6 Right to Prepay

     In  the event that any such Applicable Tax is required to be
     deducted from any payment to be made by any Borrower to  any
     Finance  Party under this Agreement (or on any corresponding
     payment  by  the  Finance Party to any other  Finance  Party
     under  this Agreement) and, in consequence, any Borrower  is
     or  would be obliged under Clause 13.3 to pay any additional
     amounts  to  such Finance Party in respect of the Applicable
     Tax,  such Borrower may prepay the whole (but not  part)  of
     the   then  outstanding  amount  of  such  Finance   Party's
     participation in the Utilisations made by it, together  with
     all   interest   and   other  charges   accrued   on   those
     participations and all other amounts payable to such Finance
     Party  under the Finance Documents, on giving not less  than

<PAGE> 40
     ten  Business  Days' prior written notice  to  such  Finance
     Party (through the Facility Agent).

13.7 Recognised Bank

     Each  Finance  Party confirms to the Company that  it  is  a
     Recognised Bank and agrees to notify the Company promptly if
     it becomes aware that (a) it is no longer a Recognised Bank,
     or (b) Clause 13.3 may for any other reason apply in respect
     of  payments  made to it or to the Facility  Agent  for  its
     account.

14.  MARKET DISRUPTION

14.1 Disruption events

     If,  in relation to any Advance or proposed Advance and  any
     (or the) Interest Period relative thereto:-

     (a)  no  (or  where  there is more than one Reference  Bank,
          only  one) Reference Bank supplies an interest rate  to
          the  Facility  Agent as required by the  definition  of
          LIBOR  after  the Facility Agent has requested  such  a
          rate from the Reference Banks; or

     (b)  the  Facility  Agent  shall have received  notification
          from  a  Bank  or  Banks whose participations  in  such
          Advance  constitute at least fifty per cent.  (50%)  by
          value  of  such Advance that by reason of circumstances
          affecting the London Interbank Market:

          (i)  deposits in Sterling for the same period  as  such
               Interest  Period will not be readily available  to
               them  in the London Interbank Market in sufficient
               amounts in the ordinary course of business to fund
               their  respective participations in  such  Advance
               for such Interest Period; or

          (ii) whilst such deposits are so available, the cost of
               such  deposits  exceeds  LIBOR  as  determined  in
               relation to such Advance for such Interest Period,

     the  Facility  Agent shall promptly give written  notice  of
     such determination or notification to the relevant Borrower,
     the Company (if different) and each of the Banks.

14.2 Effect

     The  giving of any notice by the Facility Agent pursuant  to
     Clause 14.1(a) or 14.1(b) shall not relieve any Bank of  any
     obligation  it may have under this Agreement to advance,  on
     the  relative  Utilisation Date, its  participation  in  any
     Advance (including any Advance for which a Request was given
     prior to such notice by the Facility Agent).

14.3 Negotiation and Substitute Basis

     During  the period of 15 days after the giving of any notice
     by  the Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 14.1, the Facility
     Agent (in consultation with the Banks) shall negotiate  with
     the  relevant Borrower and the Company in good faith with  a
     view   to   ascertaining  whether  a  substitute  basis   (a
     "Substitute Basis") may be agreed for the making of  further
     Advances and/or the maintaining of any existing Advances  to
     which  such  notice by the Facility Agent  related  for  the
     current  Interest Period relative to those Advances.   If  a
     Substitute  Basis is agreed by all the Banks,  the  relevant

<PAGE> 41
     Borrower  and the Company it shall apply in accordance  with
     its  terms  from  the commencement of such Interest  Period.
     The  Facility Agent shall not agree any Substitute Basis  on
     behalf of any Bank without the prior consent of that Bank.

14.4 Cost of Funds

     If  a  Substitute  Basis is not so agreed  by  the  relevant
     Borrower,  the Company and all the Banks by the end  of  the
     15  day  period,  each  Bank's participation  in  each  then
     existing  Advance to which the notice by the Facility  Agent
     related  shall  bear  interest during the  current  Interest
     Period  relative thereto at the rate certified by such  Bank
     to  be  its  cost  of  funds (from such sources  as  it  may
     reasonably select out of those sources then available to it)
     for  such Interest Period in relation to such Advance,  plus
     the applicable Margin.

14.5 Right to Prepay

     Where Clause 14.4 applies the relevant Borrower, upon giving
     not  less  than  five  Business Days' prior  written  notice
     (through  the Facility Agent) to any Bank , may  prepay  the
     whole  (but not part) of the participation of that  Bank  in
     all  (but  not some only of) the existing Advances to  which
     the  notice  by  the  Facility  Agent  related  and,  if  so
     specified in the notice, in all (but not some only  of)  the
     other  outstanding  Utilisations of that Borrower,  together
     with  all  interest accrued on those Advances and all  other
     amounts payable under this Agreement in connection with  the
     Utilisations prepaid.

14.6 Review of Substitute Basis

     So  long as any Substitute Basis is in force or Clause  14.4
     shall  apply in relation to any Advance, the Facility Agent,
     in  consultation with the relevant Borrower, the Company and
     each  Reference Bank shall from time to time, but  not  less
     often  than monthly, review whether or not the circumstances
     referred  to  in Clause 14.1 still prevail with  a  view  to
     returning  to  the  normal  interest  provisions   of   this
     Agreement.

14.7 Bills

(a)  If, in relation to any Bills:

     (i)  the  Facility Agent determines that adequate  and  fair
          means  do  not  exist for ascertaining  the  applicable
          EBDR; or

     (ii) the  Facility  Agent determines that the Bills  do  not
          comply   with   the  then  current  Bank   of   England
          regulations for Sterling bankers' acceptances (save  in
          consequence  of the Bank on which they  are  drawn  not
          being  a  bank  whose  acceptances  are  eligible   for
          discounting  at  the Bank of England according  to  the
          Bank of England's eligibility criteria in force at  the
          date hereof),

     the  Agent  shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower  and
     each of the Banks of that fact and that this Clause 14.7  is
     in operation.

(b)  After any notification under paragraph (a) above:

     (i)  the relevant Bills shall not be accepted;


<PAGE> 42
     (ii) in  the  case of sub-paragraph (a)(i) above, no further
          Requests  for  Utilisations by  way  of  Bills  may  be
          delivered until the Facility Agent notifies the Company
          that it is once again able to determine EBDR; and

     (iii) any Request given by or on behalf of any Borrower
          pursuant  to clause 6.1 prior to such notification  for
          Bills  not yet accepted shall be treated as if it  were
          instead  a  request  for an Advance  made  pursuant  to
          clause  5.1 specifying an Interest Period of one  month
          (provided  that  period  does  not  extend  beyond  the
          Tranche  3 Availability Period) of an amount  equal  to
          the  principal amount of the requested Bills,  provided
          that  for the purposes of Clause 11.1 (Interest  Rate),
          if  necessary, LIBOR may be determined by the  Facility
          Agent   at   or  about  1.00  p.m.  on  the  applicable
          Utilisation Date.

15.  INCREASED COSTS

15.1 Increased Costs

     Subject to Clause 15.3, if the result of:-

     (a)  any change after the date hereof in or the introduction
          after the date hereof of, or any change after the  date
          hereof   in   the  interpretation,  administration   or
          application  by  any  competent  court,  authority   or
          organisation in the relevant jurisdiction of, any  law,
          regulation or treaty or in or of any official directive
          or   official  request  from,  or  the  rules  of,  any
          governmental, fiscal, monetary or regulatory (including
          self-regulatory)  authority,  organisation  or   agency
          (whether  or  not having the force of law but,  if  not
          having  the  force of law, being a regulation,  treaty,
          official  directive, official request or rule which  it
          is  the  practice of banks in the relevant jurisdiction
          to  comply  with) after the date hereof  which  affects
          banks or financial institutions of the same type as any
          Finance Party in that jurisdiction; or

     (b)  compliance by any Finance Party (or any Holding Company
          of   such  Finance  Party)  with  any  such  change  or
          introduction;

     including,  in each case without limitation, those  relating
     to   Taxation,  reserves,  special  deposit,   cash   ratio,
     liquidity or capital adequacy requirements or other forms of
     banking, fiscal, monetary or regulatory controls, is that:-

     (i)  any  Finance  Party  (or any Holding  Company  of  such
          Finance Party) incurs an increased cost as a result  of
          its  (or  such  Finance Party's) having  entered  into,
          and/or performing and/or maintaining and/or funding its
          (or   such  Finance  Party's)  obligations  under,  any
          Finance Document; or

     (ii) any  Finance  Party  (or any Holding  Company  of  such
          Finance  Party)  incurs an increased  cost  in  making,
          funding or maintaining all or any advances comprised in
          a  class  of  advances  or  acceptances  formed  by  or
          including  its  (or such Finance Party's) participation
          in  some or all of the Utilisations made or to be  made
          under this Agreement; or

     (iii) any  amount receivable by any Finance Party under
          any  Finance  Document is reduced (save to  the  extent
          matched  by  a  reduction in the cost of providing  the
          Facilities)  or  the effective rate of  return  to  any

<PAGE> 43
          Finance  Party (or any Holding Company of such  Finance
          Party)  under any Finance Document or on its  (or  such
          Holding Company's) capital employed for the purposes of
          this Agreement is reduced; or

     (iv) any Bank (or any Holding Company of such Finance Party)
          makes  any  payment  or forgoes any interest  or  other
          return  on  or  calculated by reference to  any  amount
          received or receivable by it (or by such Bank) from any
          Obligor or the Facility Agent or the Security Agent  or
          any other Bank under any Finance Document;

     and   such   increased  cost  (or  the  relevant  proportion
     thereof),  reduction,  payment, forgone  interest  or  other
     return is not compensated for by any other provision of this
     Agreement  (including, without limitation, by any Additional
     Cost  payable pursuant to Clause 11.1(c)), then and in  each
     such case:-

     (A)  such Finance Party shall notify the Company through the
          Facility  Agent in writing of that event promptly  upon
          its   becoming   aware  of  the  event  including,   in
          reasonable detail, particulars of the event;

     (B)  subject as provided below and to Clause 2.4(a),  within
          five  Business  Days  after  receipt  by  any  Borrower
          (directly  or through the Company) of a written  demand
          from  time  to time by such Finance Party  through  the
          Facility  Agent  accompanied by a certificate  of  such
          Finance  Party  specifying the amount  of  compensation
          claimed  and setting out the calculation of the  amount
          in  reasonable detail, such Borrower shall pay  to  the
          Facility  Agent for the account of such  Finance  Party
          (or,  as  the  case  may be, Holding  Company  of  such
          Finance  Party)  such amount as shall  compensate  such
          Finance  Party  (or  such  Holding  Company)  for  such
          increased  cost (or, in the case of (i) or (ii)  above,
          the  portion  of such increased cost as is attributable
          to  its  making, funding or maintaining Advances and/or
          accepting   and   paying  Bills  or   maintaining   its
          obligation,  if  any,  to participate  in  Utilisations
          under  this  Agreement), reduction, payment or  forgone
          interest or other return.  Nothing in this Clause shall
          oblige  any  Finance Party (or any Holding  Company  of
          such  Finance  Party)  or the  Facility  Agent  or  the
          Security Agent to disclose any confidential information
          relating   to   the   organisation  of   its   affairs.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim  by  any  Bank
          pursuant  to this Clause 15.1 in respect of any  period
          more than 90 days before such Bank gave notice pursuant
          to  paragraph (A) above of the relevant event shall  be
          disallowed.

15.2 Right to Prepay

     Where Clause 15.1 applies the relevant Borrower, upon giving
     not  less  than five Business Days' notice to  that  Finance
     Party  (being  a Bank) may prepay the whole  (but  not  part
     only) of that Finance Party's participation in all (and  not
     some  only  of) the outstanding Advances and Bills  made  or
     issued to or for the account of that Borrower, together with
     all interest and other charges on or in respect thereof, and
     all  other amounts payable by it under the Finance Documents
     to  such Finance Party, provided always that any such notice
     by   such  Borrower  is  given  whilst  circumstances  exist
     entitling  such  Finance Party to claim  compensation  under
     this Clause 15.

<PAGE> 44
15.3 Exceptions

     Clause  15.1 shall not apply so as to oblige the Company  or
     any  other  Borrower  to compensate any  Finance  Party  for
     Applicable  Taxes  (to  the extent that  the  provisions  of
     Clause  13.3  fully and effectively compensate therefor)  or
     for  any  Taxes which would have been Applicable Taxes  save
     only  for  any  failure  by the relevant  Finance  Party  to
     satisfy  the  exception to Clause 13.1 or for any  increased
     cost,  reduction,  payment  or  forgone  interest  or  other
     return:-

     (a)  resulting from any change in or the introduction of, or
          any change in the interpretation or application of, any
          law,  regulation, treaty, directive, request  or  rules
          relating to, or any change in the rate of, Taxation  on
          the  overall  net income of such Bank  imposed  in  the
          jurisdiction  in  which such Finance Party's  principal
          office  for the time being is situate or on the overall
          net  income  of  such Finance Party's  Facility  Office
          imposed  in  the jurisdiction in which that  office  is
          situate; or

     (b)  resulting  from  the implementation by  the  applicable
          authorities having jurisdiction over such Finance Party
          and/or  its Facility Office of the matters set  out  in
          the   statement  of  the  Basle  Committee  on  Banking
          Regulation  and Supervisory Practices dated July,  1988
          and  entitled  "International  Convergence  of  Capital
          Measurement and Capital Standards", to the  extent,  at
          the  rates and according to the timetable provided  for
          therein; or

     (c)  attributable to such Finance Party after  the  date  of
          this Agreement entering into a commitment to lend to  a
          third  party  which is, at the time that commitment  is
          entered into, in breach of any law, regulation, treaty,
          directive,   request  or  rule  relating   thereto   as
          aforesaid.

16.  ILLEGALITY

     If  any  change after the date hereof in or the introduction
     after  the  date  hereof of any law, regulation,  treaty  or
     (whether  or not having the force of law but, if not  having
     the force of law, being one with which it is the practice of
     banks  in  the  relevant jurisdiction  to  comply)  official
     directive  or rule of any governmental, fiscal, monetary  or
     regulatory    (including    self   regulatory)    authority,
     organisation   or  agency,  having  jurisdiction   (together
     "Laws"),  or  any  change  after  the  date  hereof  in  the
     interpretation, administration or application of Laws  by  a
     competent  court or the relevant authority, organisation  or
     agency  or  compliance by any Finance Party  with  any  such
     change  or introduction of Laws or change in interpretation,
     administration  or application of Laws, shall  make  it  (or
     make  it  apparent that it is) unlawful or a breach of  Laws
     for  any Finance Party to make available or fund or maintain
     the  Utilisations or any part of the Utilisations under this
     Agreement or to give effect to its obligations and  exercise
     its  rights as contemplated by this Agreement, that  Finance
     Party  may,  by  notice to the Obligors' Agent  through  the
     Facility  Agent,  declare that to the  extent  necessary  to
     avoid  any such illegality or breach of Laws its obligations
     to  the  Company and the other Borrowers under  the  Finance
     Documents shall be terminated forthwith or, if later, on the
     latest  date to which the obligations may remain  in  effect
     without  causing the Finance Party to be in breach of  Laws,
     whereupon:-

     (a)  Prepay: each Borrower will forthwith, or by such  later
          date as shall be immediately prior to the illegality or
          breach  in question taking effect, prepay such part  of
          such  Finance Party's participation in the Utilisations
          made  by  such Borrower together with all interest  and
          other  charges  accrued thereon  to  the  date  of  the
          prepayment  and  all  other  amounts  payable  to  such

<PAGE> 45
          Finance  Party under the Finance Documents as shall  be
          necessary  to  avoid any such illegality or  breach  by
          such Finance Party of any Laws; and

     (b)  Commitments:  to the extent necessary to avoid any such
          illegality  or  breach  of Laws  such  Finance  Party's
          Commitments shall be cancelled and reduced to nil.

17.  MITIGATION

17.1 Mitigation

     If circumstances arise in respect of any Finance Party which
     would,  or  upon the giving of notice would, result  in  the
     operation of Clause 13, 14, 15 or 16 to the detriment of any
     Borrower:-

     (a)  such  Finance Party shall promptly upon becoming  aware
          of  the  same notify the Company and, upon the  written
          request  of such Borrower, shall enter into discussions
          with  the  Company and such Borrower  with  a  view  to
          determining  what mitigating action might be  taken  by
          such   Finance  Party,  including  discussion  of   the
          possibility  of  a  change in its  Facility  Office  or
          transfer of its participation in the Facilities and its
          Commitments to another bank; and

     (b)  at  the request of the Company, the Facility Agent will
          enter into discussions with the Company with a view  to
          determining  what mitigating action might be  taken  by
          the  Facility  Agent with respect to the administration
          of this Agreement by the Facility Agent;

     Without limiting or reducing the obligations of the Obligors
     (or  any  of  them)  under Clauses 13, 14,  15  or  16,  the
     relevant  Finance Party, shall upon the written  request  of
     the  Company take such reasonable steps as may be  practical
     and  open  to it to mitigate or remove the effects  of  such
     circumstances including, without limitation, a change in its
     Facility  Office  or  transfer of its participation  in  the
     Facilities   and  its  Commitments  to  another   bank   (or
     termination  of  its  Commitments  and  prepayment  of   its
     participation   in   the  Utilisations  coupled   with   the
     assumption  by  another  bank of a  like  participation  and
     Commitment)  reasonably acceptable to or  nominated  by  the
     relevant  Borrower and the Company or the  restructuring  of
     its  participation in this Agreement in a  manner which will
     avoid  the circumstances in question and on terms acceptable
     to  the  Facility Agent, such Finance Party and the relevant
     Borrower  and  the Company, provided that  nothing  in  this
     Clause shall oblige any Finance Party or the Facility  Agent
     to  take  any  such step if, in the opinion of such  Finance
     Party or the Facility Agent (such opinion being conclusive),
     as  the  case  may  be,  any such step might  reasonably  be
     expected  to  have  an  adverse effect  upon  its  business,
     operations or financial condition or the management  of  its
     Tax  affairs  or its return in relation to its participation
     in  the Utilisations or cause it to incur any material costs
     or expenses.

17.2 Costs and Expenses

     Any  costs  and expenses reasonably incurred by any  Finance
     Party  pursuant  to  this Clause 17 shall  be  paid  by  the
     relevant  Borrowers within five Business Days after  receipt
     of  a  written  demand  specifying the  same  in  reasonable
     detail.

18.  GUARANTEE

18.1 Guarantee

     In  consideration of the Finance Parties entering into  this
     Agreement  and/or becoming party to this Agreement  pursuant
     to   a   Substitution   Certificate  or   otherwise   and/or

          and  not merely as surety (or similar in any applicable
          jurisdiction), prompt performance by each other Obligor
          of  all  its  payment  obligations  under  the  Finance
          Documents and the payment of all sums payable now or in
          the  future to such Finance Party by each other Obligor
          under or in connection with the Finance Documents  when
          and as the same shall become due;

     (b)  undertakes  with  each  Finance  Party  that,  if   and
          whenever any other Obligor does not pay any amount when
          due  from  it  under or in connection with any  Finance
          Document, such Guarantor will on demand pay such amount
          as if such Guarantor instead of such other Obligor were
          expressed  to  be  the primary obligor,  together  with
          interest on that sum at the rate per annum from time to
          time payable by that other Obligor on that sum from the
          date  when  that sum becomes payable by such  Guarantor
          under this Agreement until payment of that sum in full;
          and

     (c)  indemnifies  each Finance Party on demand  against  any
          loss  or  liability  suffered by it under  any  Finance
          Document  as  a result of any obligation guaranteed  by
          such Guarantor being or becoming unenforceable, invalid
          or illegal.

18.2 Continuing Guarantee

     This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall extend to
     the ultimate balance of all sums payable by the Obligors  or
     any of them under the Finance Documents.

18.3 Reinstatement

     Where  any  discharge (whether in respect of the obligations
     of  any  Obligor,  any  security  for  such  obligations  or
     otherwise) is made in whole or in part or any arrangement is
     made  on  the  faith  of  any  payment,  security  or  other
     disposition   which  is  avoided  or  must  be   repaid   on
     insolvency, administration, liquidation or otherwise without
     limitation,  the  liability  of each  Guarantor  under  this
     guarantee  shall  continue as if  there  had  been  no  such
     discharge  or  arrangement.  Each  Finance  Party  shall  be
     entitled  to concede or compromise any claim that  any  such
     payment,   security  or  other  disposition  is  liable   to
     avoidance or repayment.

18.4 Waiver of Defences

     Except  to  the  extent that such Guarantor is  specifically
     released  in  writing  or its obligations  are  specifically
     waived in a Waiver Letter, the obligations of each Guarantor
     under   this  Agreement  shall  not  be  affected   by   any
     circumstance, act, omission, matter or thing which  but  for
     this   provision  might  operate  to  release  or  otherwise
     exonerate  such Guarantor from its obligations hereunder  in
     whole  or in part, including without limitation and  whether
     or not known to any Obligor or any Finance Party:-

<PAGE> 47
     (a)  any   time,   indulgence  or  waiver  granted   to   or
          composition with any other Obligor or any other person;
          or

     (b)  the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or
          release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect or take up
          or  enforce any rights or remedies against any security
          or  any  other Obligor or any other person or any  non-
          presentment or non-observance of any formality or other
          requirements  in  respect of  any  instruments  or  any
          failure to obtain the full value of any security; or

     (c)  any  legal limitation, disability, incapacity, lack  of
          power,   authority   or  legal   personality   of,   or
          dissolution or change in the members or status  of,  or
          other circumstance relating to any other Obligor or any
          other person; or

     (d)  any  variation (however fundamental and whether or  not
          involving  any increase in the liability of  any  other
          Obligor  thereunder)  or  replacement  of  any  Finance
          Document  or any other document or security  (including
          without limitation any Substitute Basis agreed pursuant
          to  Clause  14 and any agreement contemplated  by  this
          Agreement) so that references to such Finance  Document
          or  other document or security in this guarantee  shall
          include each such variation or replacement; or

     (e)  any   unenforceability,   illegality,   invalidity   or
          frustration of any obligations of any other Obligor  or
          any  other  person under any Finance  Document  or  any
          other document or security, or any failure of any other
          Obligor or proposed Additional Obligor to become  bound
          by  the  terms of any other Finance Document,  in  each
          case whether through any want of power or authority  or
          otherwise; or

     (f)  any postponement, discharge, reduction, non-provability
          or  other similar circumstance affecting any obligation
          of any other Obligor under a Finance Document resulting
          from   any   insolvency,  liquidation  or   dissolution
          proceedings or from any law, regulation or order,

     to  the intent that such Guarantor's obligations under  this
     Agreement  shall remain in full force and this guarantee  be
     construed accordingly as if there were no such circumstance,
     act, omission, matter or thing.

18.5 Immediate Recourse

     Each  Guarantor  waives  any right  it  may  have  of  first
     requiring  any Finance Party to proceed against  or  enforce
     any  other  rights or security of or claim payment  from  or
     file  any  proof or claim in any insolvency, administration,
     winding  up, bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings  relating
     to,  any  other Obligor or any other person before  claiming
     from such Guarantor under this Agreement.

18.6 Preservation of Rights

     Until all amounts which may be or become payable by any  and
     all  Obligors  under  or  in  connection  with  the  Finance
     Documents have been irrevocably paid and discharged in  full
     (whether by any Borrower or Guarantor or otherwise), after a
     claim  has been made pursuant to this guarantee each Finance
     Party may:-

<PAGE> 48
     (a)  refrain  from applying or enforcing any other security,
          monies  or  rights  held or received  by  such  Finance
          Party, as the case may be, in respect of (or capable of
          being applied in respect of) such amounts or apply  and
          enforce  the  same  in such manner and  order  as  such
          Finance Party sees fit (whether against such amounts or
          otherwise)  and no Guarantor shall be entitled  to  the
          benefit of the same; and

     (b)  hold  in  a  suspense account (with  liability  to  pay
          interest on the monies held therein at the rate payable
          to  its  corporate customers for deposits in  the  same
          currency on like terms and in like amounts) any  monies
          received  from  any  Guarantor or  on  account  of  any
          Guarantor's liability under this Agreement.

18.7 Non-competition

     Until all amounts which may be or become payable by any  and
     all  Obligors  under  or  in  connection  with  the  Finance
     Documents have been irrevocably paid in full (whether by any
     Borrower  or  Guarantor or otherwise), no  Guarantor  shall,
     after  a  claim  has  been  made  on  it  pursuant  to  this
     guarantee:-

     (a)  be  subrogated to any rights, security or monies  held,
          received  or  receivable by any  Finance  Party  or  be
          entitled  to any right of contribution or indemnity  in
          respect  of  any  payment made or  monies  received  on
          account  of  any Obligor's liability under any  Finance
          Document  and, to the extent that any Guarantor  is  so
          subrogated  or  entitled by law, such Guarantor  hereby
          (to  the  fullest extent permitted by law)  waives  and
          agrees not to exercise those rights or security or that
          right of contribution or indemnity;

     (b)  be  entitled  or  claim to rank as a  creditor  in  the
          insolvency,  administration, winding-up, bankruptcy  or
          liquidation  of  any  Obligor in competition  with  any
          Finance Party unless otherwise required by the Facility
          Agent or by law (in which case the proceeds, if any, of
          any  claim in respect of any rights, security or monies
          of  any  Finance  Party  to which  such  Guarantor  was
          subrogated, filed by such Guarantor with a receiver  or
          other  similar official, will be paid by such Guarantor
          to  the Facility Agent to be applied in accordance with
          the provisions of the Finance Documents); or

     (c)  be  entitled to receive, claim or have the  benefit  of
          any  payment,  distribution  or  security  from  or  on
          account of any Obligor or exercise any right of set-off
          as  against any Obligor (and, without prejudice to  the
          foregoing,  each Guarantor shall forthwith pay  to  the
          Facility Agent for the Finance Parties an amount  equal
          to  any  such  set-off  in fact  exercised  by  it  and
          forthwith pay or transfer, as the case may be,  to  the
          Finance  Parties  any such payment or  distribution  or
          benefit of security in fact received by it).

18.8 Additional Security

     This guarantee shall be in addition to and shall not in  any
     way  be prejudiced by any other security (including, without
     limitation, the Security Documents) now or hereafter held by
     any  Finance  Party  as security for  or  capable  of  being
     applied against the obligations of any Obligor.

18.9 Certificate

     A  certificate  of the Facility Agent as to any  amount  due
     from any Borrower under this Agreement shall, in the absence
     of manifest error, be prima facie evidence of such amount as
     against each Guarantor.

<PAGE> 49
19.  ADDITIONAL BORROWERS

(a)  If any Subsidiary of the Company wishes to become a Borrower
     under this Agreement it and the Company shall each so notify
     the Facility Agent (which shall in turn notify the Banks and
     the Security Agent).

(b)  If  all  the Banks confirm to the Facility Agent in  writing
     that   they  are  in  principle  prepared  to  accept   that
     Subsidiary (and the Banks hereby so confirm with respect  to
     the  Target  once  the  Offer has become  or  been  declared
     unconditional in all respects and the Target  has  become  a
     Subsidiary of the Company) as a Borrower hereunder  (subject
     to  such limitations as they may advise in the case  of  any
     Subsidiary other than the Target), the Facility Agent  shall
     so  notify  the Banks and shall prepare and deliver  to  the
     Company an Accession Agreement (appropriately completed  and
     subject to such limitations as are imposed).

(c)  Upon   receipt  by  the  Facility  Agent  of  the  Accession
     Agreement,  signed on behalf of the Company for  itself  and
     the  existing  Obligors,  and  by  the  proposed  Additional
     Borrower,  the  Facility Agent shall execute  the  same  for
     itself  and on behalf of the Finance Parties and  the  Banks
     and  shall  as promptly as practicable give notice  of  such
     execution  to all of the parties to the Accession Agreement.
     Upon execution of such Accession Agreement as aforesaid,  it
     shall  take effect in accordance with, but subject  to,  the
     terms hereof and thereof.


20.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

20.1 Representations and Warranties

     Each  Obligor (or in the case of Clause 20.1(l), the Company
     and  Bidco  only) represents and warrants  to  each  of  the
     Finance Parties that:-

     (a)  Status:   It is (and each of its Principal Subsidiaries
          is)  a  company, duly incorporated and validly existing
          under  the  laws of the place of its incorporation  and
          has  the power to own its property and assets and carry
          on  its  business  as  it  is now  being  and  will  be
          conducted.  No Event of Default falling within  any  of
          paragraphs  (f)  to (l) inclusive of  Clause  23.1  has
          occurred  with  respect to it or any of  its  Principal
          Subsidiaries or any of its (or their) assets.

     (b)  Powers  and authority:  It has the power to enter  into
          and   perform  the  Finance  Documents  and  any  other
          Transaction  Documents to which it is a party  and  the
          transactions to be implemented pursuant thereto and has
          taken all necessary action to authorise the entry  into
          and performance of those documents and transactions.

     (c)  Legal  validity:   Subject to  the  Reservations,  this
          Agreement   constitutes,  and  any   and   each   other
          Transaction  Document to which it is or will  become  a
          party  (when  executed by it or  on  its  behalf)  will
          constitute,  its  legal, valid and binding  obligations
          and  (without limiting the generality of the foregoing)
          any  Security  Document to which it is a party  creates
          the  security  interests  which that Security  Document
          purports  to create or, as the case may be,  accurately
          evidences  a  security interest which has been  validly
          created (except that no warranty is given as to whether
          any  such security interest is fixed or floating).   To
          the  best  of its knowledge and belief after reasonable
          enquiry all such Transaction Documents (other than  the
          Finance  Documents)  have  been  duly  authorised   and
          approved  by  the other parties thereto and constitute,
          subject  to  the  Reservations, the  legal,  valid  and
          binding obligations of those parties.

<PAGE> 50
     (d)  Non-conflict:  The entry into and performance by it  of
          this  Agreement  and  any  and each  other  Transaction
          Document to which it is a party and the transactions to
          be  implemented pursuant to those documents do not  and
          will not conflict with:

          (i)  any  law or regulation or any official or judicial
               order  applicable  to it or  any  Licence  or  any
               Licence Undertaking,

          (ii) its   memorandum   or  articles  of   association,
               statutes,  by-laws  or  other  constitutional   or
               governing  documents  or any  of  its  resolutions
               (having current effect), or

          (iii) any  agreement or instrument to which it  or
               any  Subsidiary  of  it is a  party  or  which  is
               binding upon any of them or on its assets or those
               of any such Subsidiary in such a manner or to such
               an  extent as to have a Material Adverse Effect or
               in  a  manner or to an extent which is  reasonably
               likely to result in any material liability on  the
               part  of  any of the Finance Parties to any  third
               party by reason of any such conflict, nor will  it
               result  in  the  creation  or  imposition  of  any
               Encumbrance on any of its assets or those  of  any
               Principal  Subsidiary (save, in the  case  of  the
               Company  and  Bidco,  for any Encumbrance  created
               pursuant to the Security Documents).

     (e)  No  Default:  (i) No Event of Default has occurred  and
          is  continuing which has not been waived, and  (ii)  no
          event has occurred and is continuing which has not been
          waived  and which constitutes or which, with the giving
          of  notice, expiry of any cure period, determination of
          materiality  or satisfaction of any other condition  in
          each  case  provided  for  in  any  such  agreement  or
          document  (other  than  the  mere  occurrence  of  such
          event),  is reasonably likely to constitute  a  default
          under  or in respect of any other agreement or document
          to  which it or any Subsidiary of it is a party in such
          a  manner  or to such an extent as to have  a  Material
          Adverse Effect.

     (f)  Consents:    Any  and  all  authorisations,  approvals,
          consents,  licences, exemptions, filings, registrations
          and  other matters required on the part of any  Obligor
          or  the Target pursuant to any law or the terms of  the
          Licence   or  any  Licence  Undertaking   for   or   in
          consequence  of  (i) the Offer, and/or (ii)  the  entry
          into  and  performance by it of and/or the validity  of
          any  of  the  Finance  Documents  and  the  Transaction
          Documents to which it is a party or the transactions to
          be   implemented  pursuant  thereto  and/or  (iii)  the
          continued carrying on of the business of the Target and
          the Group in the ordinary course, have been obtained or
          effected or will be obtained or effected prior  to  the
          date  required by law to the extent that failure to  do
          so  would have a Material Adverse Effect, save (in  the
          case  of (ii)) for the filing in the United Kingdom  of
          the  prescribed  particulars of the Security  Documents
          pursuant  to Section 395 of the Companies Act 1985  (as
          amended),  the  registration of the  transfers  of  the
          shares  which  are the subject of mortgages  and  other
          Encumbrances  created  by the  Security  Documents  and
          other filings and registrations necessary in connection
          with the enforcement of the Security Documents.

     (g)  Accounts:

          (i)  Its   Accounts  most  recently  delivered  to  the
               Facility  Agent  under Clause  21.2(a)  have  been
               prepared,  save  as  disclosed  in  notes  to   or
               accompanying  those Accounts, in  accordance  with

<PAGE> 51
               the  provisions of Clause 21.2(d) and (in the case
               of  audited  annual Accounts) present a  true  and
               fair   view  of  or  (in  the  case  of  unaudited
               Accounts)  fairly present its and (if consolidated
               Accounts) its Subsidiaries' financial position  as
               at  the  Accounting Date to which  the  same  were
               prepared  and/or (as appropriate) the  results  of
               operations  and  (in the case of annual  Accounts)
               changes   in   financial   position   during   the
               Accounting   Period   ending   on   the   relevant
               Accounting Date, subject, in the case of quarterly
               and   monthly   Accounts,  to  normal   year   end
               adjustments and to the lack of notes thereto.

          (ii) Each  of  the  information, reports and  documents
               delivered  to  the  Facility  Agent  under  Clause
               21.2(b)  was  true and accurate  in  all  material
               respects  as of the date thereof and did not  omit
               any  material information required to be  included
               therein.

     (h)  Litigation:     No    litigation,    arbitration     or
          administrative    or    regulatory    proceedings    or
          investigations  for which process or initiation  claims
          have  been served on it or any of its Subsidiaries and,
          to   its   knowledge,   no   litigation,   arbitration,
          administrative or regulatory proceedings  involving  it
          or  any  of its Subsidiaries are pending or threatened,
          which  are reasonably likely to be determined adversely
          to it or to such Subsidiary, and which, if so adversely
          determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (i)  Tax liabilities:  No claims are being or are reasonably
          likely  to  be  asserted  against  it  or  any  of  its
          Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes which are reasonably
          likely  to  be determined adversely to it  or  to  such
          Subsidiary and which, if so adversely determined, would
          have  a  Material Adverse Effect.  It and each  of  its
          Subsidiaries is not materially overdue in the filing of
          any Tax returns required to be filed and it and any  of
          its Subsidiaries has paid all Taxes shown to be due  on
          any  Tax returns required to be filed by it or  on  any
          assessments  made  against it  (other  than  any  being
          contested  in  good  faith by  appropriate  process  in
          respect   of   which   adequate  reserves   are   being
          maintained)  non-payment, or a claim  for  payment,  of
          which  would in each such case have a Material  Adverse
          Effect.

     (j)  Encumbrances:  No Encumbrance exists over its or any of
          its Subsidiaries' assets which would cause a breach  of
          Clause 21.3(a) of this Agreement.

     (k)  Information   Memorandum:   (This  representation   and
          warranty is given only upon issue and approval  by  the
          Company in writing of an Information Memorandum.)   All
          material   factual   information   contained   in   the
          Information  Memorandum was true (or, in  the  case  of
          information  provided  by any  person  other  than  the
          Company or Bidco its or their advisors, was true to the
          best  of  its  knowledge  and belief  in  all  material
          respects at the date (if any) ascribed thereto  in  the
          Information Memorandum or (if none) at the date of  the
          relevant component of the Information Memorandum.   Any
          and  all  expressions of opinion or intention  and  any
          forecasts  and projections contained in the Information
          Memorandum were arrived at after careful consideration,
          were fair and were based on reasonable grounds, and the
          Information  Memorandum, taken as a whole,  as  of  its
          date was not misleading in any material respect and did
          not  omit  to  disclose any matter failure to  disclose
          which   would   result  in  any  material   information
          contained   in   the   Information   Memorandum   being
          misleading  in any material respect in the  context  of
          this Agreement.

     (l)  Acquired  Assets:  All of the Shares which are acquired
          by  it pursuant to the Offer will be beneficially owned
          by  Bidco  and  Bidco will be entitled  forthwith  (but
          subject  to registration in the shareholders'  register
          of  the  Target of the transfer of those Shares,  which
          registration  will be completed as soon  as  reasonably
          practicable)  to become the legal registered  owner  of
          such  Shares  free  from all Encumbrances,  claims  and
          competing   interests  whatsoever  save  as   expressly
          permitted or created under this Agreement and the other
          Finance Documents.

     (m)  Ownership  of assets:  Save to the extent  disposed  of
          without  breaching  the terms of  any  of  the  Finance
          Documents,  it  and each of its Subsidiaries  has  good
          title to or valid leases or licences of or is otherwise
          entitled  to use all material assets necessary properly
          to conduct its business the absence of which would have
          a Material Adverse Effect.

     (n)  Documents:

          (i)  The  documents delivered to the Facility Agent  by
               or on behalf of any Obligor pursuant to Clause 4.1
               and  any  other provision of the Finance Documents
               were  genuine  and in the case of copy  documents,
               were  true,  complete and accurate copies  in  all
               material respects, of originals which had not been
               amended, varied, supplemented or superseded in any
               way which would be likely to affect materially and
               adversely  the  interests of the Banks  under  the
               Finance  Documents, save as consented to  pursuant
               to a Waiver Letter.

          (ii) The Press Release and Offer Document and any other
               documents relating to the Offer furnished  to  the
               Facility Agent, contain all the material terms  of
               the  Offer.  The Offer Document corresponds to the
               terms   of  the  Press  Release  in  all  material
               respects.   The  Articles of  Association  of  the
               Company,  the   Subscription  Agreement  and   the
               Intercreditor Agreement contain all  the  material
               terms  of the agreements and arrangements  between
               CSW and the Company (and between CSW and any other
               member of the Group) relating to the Company.

     (o)  Environmental Matters:

          (i)  It  and its Subsidiaries have obtained any and all
               requisite Environmental Licences required for  the
               carrying on of its business as currently conducted
               and  have  at  all times complied in all  material
               respects with (A) the terms and conditions of such
               Environmental   Licences   and   (B)   all   other
               applicable  Environmental Law which in each  case,
               if  not  complied  with,  would  have  a  Material
               Adverse Effect, and there are to its knowledge  no
               circumstances which may prevent or interfere  with
               such compliance in the future;

          (ii) so  far  as  it  is aware (after due  enquiry)  no
               Dangerous  Substance has been used,  disposed  of,
               generated, stored, transported, dumped,  released,
               deposited, buried or emitted at, on, from or under
               any  site  or  premises  (whether  or  not  owned,
               leased,  occupied or controlled by any Obligor  or
               any  of its Subsidiaries and including any offsite
               waste management or disposal location utilised  by
               any   Obligor   or   any   such   Subsidiary)   in
               circumstances where this would be likely to result

<PAGE> 53
               in  the  imposition of a liability on any  Obligor
               which would have a Material Adverse Effect;

          (iii) so  far  as it is aware (after due  enquiry)
               there  is  no  Environmental  Claim  (whether   in
               respect of any site previously or currently  owned
               or   occupied  by  any  member  of  the  Group  or
               otherwise) pending or threatened, and there are no
               past   or  present  acts,  omissions,  events   or
               circumstances  that would be likely  to  form  the
               basis  of  any  Environmental  Claim  (whether  in
               respect of any site previously or currently  owned
               or   occupied  by  any  member  of  the  Group  or
               otherwise),  against that Obligor  which  in  each
               case is reasonably likely to be determined against
               that Obligor and which if so decided would have  a
               Material Adverse Effect.

     (p)  The  Company:  At the first Utilisation Date,  save  as
          arises  under  the  Transaction  Documents  and/or   in
          consequence of acceptances of the Offer and  save  also
          for  Offer Costs, neither the Company nor Bidco had any
          material commitments or indebtedness.

     (q)  Licence:

          (i)  The  Licence  is in full force and  effect,  there
               exist  no  material breaches of the terms  of  the
               Licence or any Licence Undertakings and there  are
               no  circumstances in existence which would entitle
               the Director General or the Secretary of State  to
               seek to revoke the Licence;

          (ii) There  are  no  Licence Undertakings,  other  than
               those  copies of which have been delivered to  the
               Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 4.1.

20.2 Repetition

     The  representations and warranties set out in  Clause  20.1
     shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the making

     hereof  and be deemed to be repeated on the date of delivery
     of  each Request hereunder and on each Utilisation Date  and
     on  each  Interest  Date, with reference to  the  facts  and
     circumstances then subsisting, as if made at each such time,
     provided that:

          Clause 20.1(k) shall be made only on the date of  issue
          and  approval by the Company or Bidco in writing of any
          Information Memorandum; and

     (b)  the  representations and warranties set out in  Clauses
          20.1 (e), (h), (i), (l), (n)(ii), (p) and (q) shall not
          be repeated after the first Utilisation Date.

          alleged liability in excess of 10,000,000 pounds or its
          equivalent  in other currencies or which  involves  the
          Director  General, the Secretary of State, any  Licence
          held  by  any  member  of  the  Group  or  any  Licence
          Undertaking;

          any  Accounts, forecasts, projections or other material
          provided  by  any  Obligor hereunder) as  the  Facility
          Agent  or the Majority Banks through the Facility Agent
          may reasonably request from time to time;

          the  Facility Agent in reasonable detail of any matters
          (whether  occurring  prior to  or  after  the  date  of
          approval and issue of the Information Memorandum) which
          cause  the  Information Memorandum  when  read  without

          of the Facility Agent.

<PAGE> 57
(d)  Accounting  Standards:  The Company  will  ensure  that  all
     Accounts shall be prepared in accordance with the Applicable
     Accounting  Principles and (except in  the  case  of  annual

     in  substantially the same format and with substantially the
     same  headings and other characterisations as  in  the  Base
     Financial  Statements, or shall indicate in notes  to  or  a
     letter  accompanying  such Accounts any material  departures
     from   the  Applicable  Accounting  Principles  and/or  such
     format, headings and characterisations..

(e)  Accounts  Letter:  Where any Accounts have been prepared  in
     any  respect so as to depart materially from the  Applicable
     Accounting  Principles  and/or  the  format,  headings   and

     Financial  Statement, the Company shall provide  or  procure
     that  there  is  provided to the Facility  Agent  a  written
     explanation of such departure which the Facility Agent shall
     forward to the Banks.  If the Majority Banks and the Company
     agree,  such  departure shall become part of the  Applicable
     Accounting  Principles.   If  the  Majority  Banks  and  the
     Company  do  not so agree, such departure shall  not  become
     part  of  the  Applicable  Accounting  Principles  and   the
     Majority Banks may require that the Company furnish  to  the
     Facility Agent for the Banks a statement that such departure
     has  not  altered any of the numerical information  required
     for  the  purpose of establishing whether or not the Company
     is  in compliance with its obligations under Clause 22.1  or
     (if  it  has) setting out the effects of such alteration  in
     reasonable detail.

21.3 Security Value

          security provided for thereby; and/or

     (ii) to  carry on its business as it is being conducted from

          any  such authorisation, approval, consent, licence  or

     Licence  and  shall not consent, without the  prior  written
     consent  of  the  Majority Banks, to any revocation  of  its
     Licence or to any material modification to the terms thereof
     if  such  modification,  in the reasonable  opinion  of  the
     Majority  Banks, would have (whether immediately or  in  the
     course  of time prior to the Tranche 2/3 Repayment  Date)  a
     Material Adverse Effect.

(m)  Licence  Undertakings:  The Company and Bidco  will  consult

     CSW  or  the Target may be required to give to the  Director
     General  or  the Secretary of State in connection  with  the
     Offer  and will not give and will procure that such  Holding

               (iii) and otherwise than as permitted pursuant  to
               Clause 21.10(b) or (c)) anything which would cause
               the Panel to regard any material term or condition
               of  the Offer as having been waived, withdrawn  or
               (in  the  case  of  the  Judgment  Conditions  (as

               Appendix 1 to the  Press Release;

          (F)  take or permit to be taken any step as a result of
               which  the offer price stated in the Offer is,  or
               may  be required to be, increased beyond the level
               agreed  between Bidco and the Banks from  time  to
               time;

          (G)  issue  any press release or other publicity  which
               makes  reference to the Facilities or to  some  or
               all of the Finance Parties unless the publicity is
               required by law or by the Code (in which case  the
               Company  or Bidco shall notify the Facility  Agent
               and  the Banks thereof as soon as practicable upon
               becoming aware of the requirement).

     (ii) in all material respects relevant in the context of the
          Offer,  it  will comply with the Code (subject  to  any
          waivers  granted by the Panel), the Financial  Services
          Act   1986,  the  Companies  Act  1985  and  all  other
          applicable statutes, laws and regulations.

     (iii) it will keep the Facility Agent informed as to the
          status of and progress with respect to the Offer and in
          particular  will  from time to time and  promptly  upon
          request,  give  to  the Facility Agent  for  the  Banks
          reasonable  details  as to (A)  the  current  level  of
          acceptances  of the Offer, and (B) such  other  matters
          relevant  to  the  Offer  as  the  Facility  Agent  may
          reasonably  request.  The Company or  Bidco  will  also
          promptly deliver to the Facility Agent a copy of  every
          certificate delivered by the receiving agents to  Bidco
          and/or its advisers pursuant to the Code.

(b)  (i)  If Bidco is not aware and has not been informed by
          a  Finance Party in writing of a circumstance or  event
          which is or could reasonably be construed to be covered
          by  a material term or condition to the Offer which, if
          not  waived,  would  entitle Bidco  (with  the  Panel's
          consent,  if  needed)  to lapse the  Offer,  Bidco,  by
          waiving,  withdrawing or agreeing or  deciding  not  to
          enforce that term or condition shall not breach  Clause
          21.10(a)(i)(C), provided that in any case involving the
          following conditions (as set out in Appendix 1  to  the
          Press   Release)  Bidco  has  first  taken  the  action
          provided for below:

<PAGE> 67
          (A)  in  the case of conditions (D) and (E), Bidco  has
               made  enquiry of the Director General  as  to  the
               subject  matter thereof, has requested  an  urgent
               response  and  has allowed a reasonable  time  for
               that response to be given;

          (B)  in  the case of conditions (F) and (G), Bidco  has
               sought  and received appropriate advice  from  its
               legal  advisers to the effect that such  condition
               has been satisfied in all material respects in  so
               far   as   requirements  under  English  law   are
               concerned;

          (C)  in the case of conditions (E), (F), (H), (I), (J),
               (K),  (L) and (M) where (but only where) the Offer
               is  at  the relevant time recommended by the Board
               of Directors of the Target, Bidco has made enquiry
               of  the  Board  of Directors of the Target  as  to
               whether there were in existence any  circumstances
               or  have occurred any events which would cause any
               such  condition  not to be met, has  requested  an
               urgent response and has allowed a reasonable  time
               for that response to be given;

          (D)  In  the case of conditions (B) and (C),: no action
               shall   be  required  for  the  purpose  of   this
               paragraph (b)(i).

     (ii) If Bidco becomes aware (whether through notice from any
          Finance Party or otherwise) of a circumstance or  event
          which is or could reasonably be construed to be covered
          by a condition of the Offer which, if not waived, would
          entitle Bidco (with the Panel's consent, if needed)  to
          lapse  the Offer, Bidco shall notify the Facility Agent
          and the following shall apply:

          (A)  if  Bidco  wishes to waive, withdraw or  agree  or
               decide  not  to  enforce  the  condition  and  the
               Majority Banks agree, Bidco may do so;

          (B)  if  the  Majority Banks do not so agree and  state
               that  in their opinion such circumstance or  event
               would  materially and adversely affect the ability
               of  Bidco  to comply with its material obligations
               under  the  Finance Documents, Bidco will  request
               the  Panel to agree that the Offer may lapse as  a
               result of non-satisfaction of that condition or of
               the  conditions as to acceptances (as set  out  in
               paragraph  A  of Appendix 1 to the Press  Release)
               and  that  such lapsing will not give  rise  to  a
               breach  of  the Code.  If the Panel  does  not  so
               agree,   then  Bidco  may,  without   the   Banks'
               agreement, waive, withdraw or agree or decide  not
               to enforce such condition.

(c) (i)   In relation to each of conditions (B) and (C) (as
          set  out Appendix 1 to the Press Release), Bidco  shall
          disclose  to the Facility Agent any and all  conditions
          attaching to, respectively, the announcement by the  UK
          Office  of Fair Trading (in the case of condition  (B))
          or  the indication by the Director General (in the case
          of condition (C).

     (ii) In  relation  to condition (D) Bidco shall disclose  to
          the  Facility  Agent the terms of all undertakings  and
          assurances  sought by the Director General as  referred
          to therein and proposed to be given.

     (iii) In relation to conditions (H), (I), (J), (K), (L)
          and (M), if Bidco becomes aware (whether through notice
          from  any Finance Party or otherwise) of a circumstance
          or  event which is or could reasonably be construed  to

<PAGE> 68
          be covered by such condition (ignoring for this purpose
          the  last  sentence of paragraph (d) below)  and  which
          could  reasonably be expected materially and  adversely
          to  affect  the  ability of Bidco to  comply  with  its
          material obligations under the Finance Documents, Bidco
          shall notify the Facility Agent.

     (iv) In  relation  to each Judgment Condition,  Bidco  shall
          give  advance  notice  to the  Facility  Agent  of  its
          intention to be satisfied with respect to that Judgment
          Condition,  and (where paragraphs (i),  (ii)  or  (iii)
          have   application   in  relation  to   such   Judgment
          Condition)  of  the reasons for such  intention  to  be
          satisfied;

     (v)  If, in relation to a Judgment Condition, Bidco notifies
          the  Facility  Agent of its intention to  be  satisfied
          with  respect  to  that  Judgment  Condition,  and  the
          Majority  Banks do not promptly notify  Bidco  that  it
          should  not  be  so  satisfied  on  grounds  that   the
          circumstances (which shall be specified in such notice)
          in  relation to that Judgment Condition are such as  in
          their  opinion materially and adversely to  affect  the
          ability   of   Bidco  to  comply  with   its   material
          obligations  under  the Finance  Documents,  Bidco  may
          declare  or accept or treat as satisfied such  Judgment
          Condition.  If the Majority Banks do so notify Bidco as
          aforesaid, the Majority Banks may then request Bidco to
          (and  Bidco  in  such circumstances will)  request  the
          Panel to agree that the Offer may lapse as a result  of
          non-satisfaction of that Judgment Condition or  of  the
          conditions as to acceptances (as set out in paragraph A
          of  Appendix  1  to the Press Release)  and  that  such
          lapsing will not give rise to a breach of the Code.  If
          the  Panel  does not so agree, then Bidco may,  without
          the  Banks'  agreement, be and  declare  itself  to  be
          satisfied as to such Judgment Condition.

(d)  As  used  in this Clause 21.10 "Judgment Condition" means  a
     material  term  or condition of the Offer  which  refers  to
     Bidco being satisfied, or making a determination, as to  any
     matter.   For  the purposes of this Clause  21.10,  each  of
     conditions  (H),  (I), (J), (K), (L)  and  (M)  as  set  out
     Appendix 1 to the Press Release shall be deemed to include a
     requirement  that Bidco be satisfied as to the existence  or
     non-existence  (as  the  case may be)  of  circumstances  or
     events which would cause such condition to be met or not  to
     be met (as the case may be).

     (a)  Non-payment: any Obligor does not pay on the  due  date
          any amount payable by it under any Finance Document  at
          the  place, in the currency and in the funds  expressed

          five days of the due date; or

     (b)  Breach of Obligation:

          (i)  any Obligor fails to comply with any provision  of
               Clause 22 (Financial Undertakings); or

          (ii) any   Obligor  fails  to  comply  with  any  other
               provision  of  this  Agreement  (irrespective   of
               whether  or  not  such  provision  is  valid   and
               enforceable against such Obligor) and/or any other
               provision  of any other Finance Document  and,  if
               such  failure is in the reasonable opinion of  the
               Majority  Banks  capable  of  remedy  within  such
               period,  such Obligor shall have failed to  remedy
               such  failure within 21 days after the earlier  of

<PAGE> 70
               the   relevant  Obligor  becoming  aware  of  such
               default  and  receipt by the relevant  Obligor  of
               written  notice from the Facility  Agent  to  such
               Obligor requiring the failure to be remedied; or

          (iii) any  Obligor  shall do  any  of  the  things
               prohibited  in  Clauses  21.6(a)  (Dividends)   or
               21.6(c)  (Share  Capital), or any  of  the  things
               prohibited   in   Clause  21.9(g)  (Constitutional
               Documents)  shall be done to or  by  any  Obligor,
               whether  or not (having regarding to the  rule  in
               Russell  v.  Northern Bank Development Corporation
               Limited  &  Ors.) such undertaking is  enforceable
               against that Obligor, and the thing, if remediable
               in  the  reasonable opinion of the Majority Banks,
               shall  not have been remedied within 21 days after
               the earlier of the relevant Obligor becoming aware
               thereof  and  receipt by the relevant Obligors  of
               written  notice from the Facility  Agent  to  such
               Obligor requiring the thing to be remedied; or

          behalf  of  any Obligor or other member  of  the  Group
          under  or  in connection with any Finance Document,  is
          incorrect  or  misleading in any respect which  in  the
          reasonable  opinion of the Majority Banks  is  material
          when made or deemed to be made or repeated by reference
          to  the facts and circumstances then subsisting and, if
          the circumstances causing such misrepresentation are in
          the reasonable opinion of the Majority Banks capable of
          remedy  within  such  period, such Obligor  shall  have
          failed  to  remedy such circumstances  within  21  days
          after  the  earlier  of the relevant  Obligor  becoming
          aware  of  such  misrepresentation and receipt  by  the
          relevant  Obligor of written notice from  the  Facility
          Agent  to  such  Obligor  requiring  the  circumstances
          causing such misrepresentation to be remedied; or

     (d)  Invalidity: any of the Finance Documents shall cease to
          be  in full force and effect in any material respect or
          shall  cease to (or be alleged by any Obligor  not  to)
          constitute  the legal, valid and binding obligation  of
          any Obligor party to it or, in the case of any Security
          Document, fail to (or be alleged by any Obligor not to)
          provide  effective security in favour of  the  Security
          Agent and the Banks over the assets over which security
          is  intended to be given by that Security Document,  in
          each  case  in  a  manner and to an  extent  reasonably
          considered  by  the  Majority Banks  to  be  materially
          adverse to the interests of the Banks under the Finance
          Documents  or it shall be unlawful for any  Obligor  to
          perform  any of its material obligations under  any  of
          the Finance Documents, provided that where the relevant
          Finance  Documents are re-executed in the same form  in
          all  material  respects and none of  the  circumstances
          described in this paragraph apply in respect  of  those
          Finance  Documents as so re-executed and the  interests
          of  the  Banks  under  the Finance  Documents  are  not
          continuing to be materially and adversely affected as a
          result  of  any  of the foregoing circumstances  having
          occurred,  the  relevant Event of  Default  under  this
          paragraph shall be treated as having been cured; or

               of  demand facilities, within 3 Business  Days  of
               their due date) (whether falling due by demand, at
               scheduled  maturity or otherwise)  or  within  any
               applicable  grace  period  provided  for  in   the
               original document evidencing or constituting those
               Borrowings; or

          (iii) (if funds aggregating 25,000,000 pounds  (or  the
               equivalent   thereof  in  other  currencies)   are
               outstanding in respect thereof) any commitment for

               surrender; or

          (ii) modified  in  any manner which in  the  reasonable

          (iii) the Intercreditor Agreement is not or ceases
               to  be  binding  on  or  enforceable  against  any
               creditor  for any Subordinated Debt by  reason  of
               any  act  or  omission  by  the  Company  or  such
               creditor;

          and  in each such case in the reasonable opinion of the
          Majority  Banks  the interests of the Banks  under  the
          Finance  Documents or any of them shall  be  materially
          prejudiced thereby.

          until all the Shares have been acquired pursuant to the
          Offer  and/or the procedure set out in Section  428  et
          seq.  Companies Act, 1985 or the Offer Termination Date
          has occurred this power shall not be exercised so as to
          result in (i) the maximum aggregate amount from time to
          time  remaining to be paid (on the assumption that  all
          outstanding  Shares  will  be  acquired)  to  accepting
          shareholders pursuant to the Offer and/or  pursuant  to
          procedures  implemented  or  to  be  implemented  under
          Section  428 et seq. Companies Act 1985, less (ii)  the
          amount   (if   any)  by  which  the  aggregate   amount
          subscribed  to  the Company by CSW in  cash  for  share
          capital and Subordinated Debt from time to time exceeds
          the  amount  which has actually been paid to  accepting
          shareholders pursuant to the Offer from time  to  time,
          exceeding  (iii) the amount of the undrawn  Commitments
          the  proceeds  of  drawings of  which  are  capable  in
          accordance with Clause 3.1 of being applied in  payment
          to accepting shareholders in the Target pursuant to the
          Offer; and/or

     (c)  declare that some or all of the Utilisations to some or
          all  of  the  Borrowers (as specified in such  notice),
          together  with  all  interest,  commissions  and  other
          charges accrued with respect to those Utilisations  and
          all  other  amounts  payable by  some  or  all  of  the
          Borrowers (as specified in such notice) or any of  them
          under  the  Finance Documents from time to time,  shall
          thenceforth  be repayable on demand being made  by  the
          Facility  Agent  (and in the event of any  such  demand
          those  Utilisations,  such  interest,  commissions  and
          other   charges  and  such  other  amounts   shall   be
          immediately due and payable); and/or

     (d)  declare some or all of the Utilisations by some or  all
          of   the   Borrowers  (as  specified  in  such  notice)
          immediately  due  and repayable, whereupon  they  shall
          become   immediately  due  for  payment  or   repayment
          together  with  all  interest,  commissions  and  other

<PAGE> 75
          charges   accrued  on  those  with  respect  to   those
          Utilisations  and  all other amounts payable  by  those
          Borrowers under the Finance Documents; and/or

     (e)  declare  that  some  or  all  of  the  Borrowers  shall
          forthwith  pay or procure the payment to  the  Facility
          Agent  of  a  sufficient sum to cover  the  Outstanding
          Liability  Amounts under outstanding Bills constituting
          Utilisations by those Borrowers (as specified  in  such
          notice),  whereupon  the same shall become  immediately
          due  and payable and, once paid, shall be held  by  the
          Facility  Agent  in  an interest  bearing  account  for
          application in reimbursing the Banks, as the  case  may
          be, forthwith for all payments made or to be made under
          such outstanding Bills, provided that any sum remaining
          after settling such payments shall be applied first  in
          settlement of any other amounts then due and payable to
          any  Facility Agent and/or the Banks under the  Finance
          Documents and, subject to that, any balances  shall  be
          promptly  repaid  to  the relevant Borrowers  or  other
          person entitled to the balance.

23.3 Clean up Period

     If  during the period of three months from the Unconditional
     Date   any  event  or  circumstance  which  (but  for   this
     Clause  23.3)  would  constitute a Default  (the  "Potential
     Event  of Default") shall exist which consists of, or  is  a
     direct  consequence  of  any  event  or  circumstance  which
     occurred   in  relation  to  the  Target  or  any   of   its
     Subsidiaries  (or  its or any of their business,  assets  or
     liabilities) on or before the Unconditional Date,  then  the
     following shall apply:

     (a)  the  Company  or Bidco or the Target shall  notify  the
          Facility  Agent  of  that fact by  fax  promptly  after
          becoming aware thereof, giving a reasonable description
          of:

          (i)  the Potential Event of Default and its causes; and

          (ii) the  remedial action in relation to that Potential
               Event  of  Default which the Company and/or  Bidco
               and/or the Target propose to take;

     (b)  that Potential Event of Default shall not constitute  a
          Default, and the Facility Agent shall not with  respect
          to  that  Potential  Event of  Default  (but,  for  the
          avoidance of doubt, not so as to restrict the  Facility
          Agent's rights to take such action with respect to  any
          other  Event of Default which is not a Potential  Event
          of  Default) be entitled to take any of the actions set
          out  in Clause 23.2, until (assuming that the Potential
          Event of Default is then continuing) the earlier of:

          (i)  the  date  three  months after  the  Unconditional
               Date; or

          (ii) the  Facility Agent confirming in writing  to  the
               Company  and Bidco that in the reasonable  opinion
               of the Facility Agent it is likely that a Material
               Adverse  Effect  would result from such  Potential
               Event  of  Default or from the effects thereof  or
               from  the continued inaction by the Facility Agent
               as  regards  the  exercise of  rights  under  this
               Agreement; or

          (iii) a Material Adverse Effect actually occurring.

     Provided that (A) the foregoing shall not apply with respect
     to any Potential Event of Default under any of the following
     Clauses  23.1(a),  (b)(i) (insofar as it relates  to  Clause
     22.1(b)), (b)(iii), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), (n), (p),  (q),

<PAGE> 76
     (r) or (s), in each case irrespective of whether or not that
     Potential  Event of Default occurred in consequence  of  any
     event   or   circumstance   which   occurred   before    the
     Unconditional Date, and (B) any Potential Event  of  Default
     shall nevertheless constitute a Default for the purposes  of
     Clause  4.3, save (in the case only of a Potential Event  of
     Default  consisting of a Default arising under  Clause  23.1
     (b)(ii),  (c)  or  (e))  where it  is  demonstrated  to  the
     reasonable  satisfaction  of the Majority  Banks  that  such
     Potential  Event  of Default is likely to  be  cured  within
     three  months  after  the  Unconditional  Date  without  any
     Material  Adverse  Effect  occurring,  and  (C)  where   the
     Potential  Event of Default consists of a breach  of  Clause
     22.1(a),  the date referred to in paragraph (i) above  shall
     be  taken  as  the earlier of the date when the Company  has
     issued   further   share   capital   or   incurred   further
     Subordinated  Debt as referred to in Clause  21.6(d)(i)  and
     the  expiry of the period referred to in the first lines  of
     Clause 21.6(d).

24.  INDEMNITIES

24.1 Currency Indemnity

(a)  If  any amount payable by any Obligor under or in connection
     with  any Finance Document is received by any Finance  Party
     in  a  currency  (the "Payment Currency")  other  than  that
     agreed  to  be  payable  under that  Finance  Document  (the
     "Agreed Currency"), whether as a result of any judgement  or
     order  or  the  enforcement of the same, the liquidation  of
     such  Obligor  or  otherwise  and  the  amount  produced  by
     converting the Payment Currency so received into the  Agreed
     Currency at market rates prevailing at or about the time  of
     receipt  of the Payment Currency is less than the amount  of
     the  Agreed  Currency due under that Finance Document,  then
     the   Obligors  shall,  as  an  independent  and  additional
     obligation, indemnify each Finance Party for the  deficiency
     and any loss sustained as a result.

(b)  The   above   indemnities  shall  constitute  separate   and
     independent obligations of each of the Obligors  from  their
     other  obligations  under the Finance  Documents  and  shall
     apply  irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Finance
     Party.   The   Obligors  shall pay the reasonable  costs  of
     making  any  conversion  from the Payment  Currency  to  the
     Agreed Currency.

(c)  Each   Obligor  waives  any  right  it  may  have   in   any
     jurisdiction  to pay any amount under this  Agreement  in  a
     currency  other  than that in which it is  expressed  to  be
     payable under that Finance Document.

24.2 Other indemnities

     The  Obligors shall indemnify each Finance Party against any
     losses (excluding loss of the applicable Margin save in  the
     case  of  paragraphs (a) and (b) below), charges or expenses
     which  such  Finance  Party  may  sustain  or  incur  as   a
     consequence of:-

     (a)  the occurrence of any Default; or

     (b)  the operation of Clause 23.2; or

     (c)  any repayment or prepayment of an Advance or payment of
          an  overdue  amount being made otherwise  than  on  its
          Interest Date; or

<PAGE> 77
     (d)  (other  than by reason of default by any Finance Party)
          any  Utilisation not being made (or not being  made  in
          full)  to  any Borrower after a Request has been  given
          pursuant to Clause 5 or Clause 6 (as the case may be),

     including but not limited to any losses, charges or expenses
     on  account of funds acquired, contracted for or utilised to
     fund  any  amount payable under this Agreement,  any  amount
     repaid  or prepaid or any Utilisation (as the case may  be).
     A  certificate of such Finance Party as to the amount of any
     such  loss or expense shall be prima facie evidence  in  the
     absence of manifest error.

24.3 Indemnity Relating to Facilities

(a)  The  Company agrees to indemnify each Finance Party and each
     of   their  respective  directors,  officers  and  employees
     against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs  and
     expenses (including legal fees) which may be incurred by  or
     asserted  against  such Finance Party  or  their  respective
     directors,  officers  and employees in  connection  with  or
     arising  out of any such proceedings, actions or enquiry  by
     any   regulatory  authority  of  a  type  referred   to   in
     Clause  23.1(o)  (ignoring the provision as  to  materiality
     contained  therein) or any litigation or  other  proceedings
     connected with the Offer.  It is agreed that:

     (i)  Each   Finance  Party  shall  notify  the  Company   in
          reasonable detail of any potential claim by it  or  its
          directors,  officers or employees on the Company  under
          this  Clause 24.3 promptly upon its becoming  aware  of
          that potential claim; and

     (ii) If  the Company wishes any Finance Party to enter  into
          any  negotiations  with a view  to  settlement  of  any
          dispute with any third party likely to give rise to any
          claims,  damages,  liability, costs  and  expenses  for
          which  a  claim  may be made under this  Agreement,  it
          shall  notify  that  Finance Party  accordingly,  which
          Finance Party will then enter into such negotiations in
          good  faith on a without prejudice basis but shall  not
          be bound so to settle; and

     (iii) Any payments required to be made by reason of this
          indemnity  shall  be in addition to any  other  amounts
          provided for in this Agreement or agreed to be paid  in
          respect of the Facilities.

(b)  Each  Finance Party shall give promptly to the Company  such
     details  and  copies  of legal opinions and  process  served
     concerning (or concerning the circumstances giving rise  to)
     any  claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses  which
     may  form  the  basis  of any claim by  it  on  the  Company
     hereunder, as the Company may reasonably request.

(c)  At  the  request  of the Company, from time  to  time,  each
     Finance  Party will discuss with the Company and  will  give
     careful  consideration in good faith to  the  views  of  the
     Company  concerning the appointment of professional advisers
     in  connection  with any such claims, damages,  liabilities,
     costs and expenses (and in connection with the circumstances
     giving rise thereto and any proceedings current, pending  or
     threatened  relating  thereto)  and  the  conduct   of   any
     proceedings, and will use reasonable endeavours  to  procure
     that  (once appointed) all professional advisers acting  for
     it  in  relation  thereto shall do likewise and  that  where
     possible  and  where such Finance Party does not  reasonably
     consider  that  it  is  against such  Finance  Party's  best
     interest,  one  firm  of  professional  advisers   only   is
     appointed to represent all of the Finance Parties.

<PAGE> 78
(d)  Notwithstanding   the   foregoing   provisions    of    this
     Clause  24.3, no Finance Party shall be required to disclose
     to  the  Company or any other Obligor any matter with regard
     to  which  it  is  under  a  duty  of  non-disclosure.   All
     information  which  may be disclosed by  any  Finance  Party
     pursuant to this Clause 24.3 shall be disclosed on the  same
     conditions  as  to  confidentiality,  as  are  set  out   in
     Clause 32.

25.  AGENTS, ARRANGERS AND BANKS

25.1 Appointment

     Each  Bank  hereby  appoints  the  Facility  Agent  and  the
     Security  Agent  to  act  as its agent  hereunder  and  with
     respect  to the Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises
     the Facility Agent on such Bank's behalf to:

     (a)  enter   into   any  Accession  Agreement  or   Security
          Agreement  (whereupon and by which act such Bank  shall
          become bound thereby); and

     (b)  perform such duties and exercise such rights and powers
          under   the   Finance  Documents  as  are  specifically
          delegated to such Agent by the terms thereof,  together
          with   such   rights  and  powers  as  are   reasonably
          incidental thereto.

     Each Agent shall have only those duties and powers which are
     expressly specified in the Finance Documents.  Each  Agent's
     duties under the Finance Documents each are intended  to  be
     of a mechanical and administrative nature.

25.2 Majority Banks' Directions

     In  the exercise of any right or power granted and as to any
     matter  not expressly provided for by the Finance Documents,
     each Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions  of
     the  Majority  Banks or as this Agreement  may  require  and
     shall be fully protected in so doing.  Any such instructions
     shall be binding on all the Banks.  Subject to Clauses  25.7
     and  25.16,  in the absence of any such instructions  and/or
     any  relevant requirement contained in any Finance Document,
     each  Agent  may act or refrain from acting with respect  to
     such  right or power and as to any such matter as  it  shall
     see fit.

25.3 Relationship

(a)  The relationship between each Bank and each Agent is that of
     principal and agent.  Nothing herein (other than in relation
     to the Security Agent and the Security Documents as to which
     the  Security Agent shall be a trustee for the Banks)  shall
     constitute  the  Facility Agent a  trustee  or  (save,  with
     regard  to any Bank, as necessarily results from its  agency
     relationship  with that Bank) fiduciary for  any  Bank,  any
     Obligor or any other person.

(b)  No  Agent  shall be liable to any Obligor for any breach  by
     any  Bank of this Agreement or be liable to any Bank for any
     breach by any Obligor of any Finance Document.

<PAGE> 79
25.4 Delegation

     Without  prejudice to its obligations hereunder, each  Agent
     may  act  under the Finance Documents through its  personnel
     and  through agents selected by it with reasonable care (who
     shall be entitled to the same protections as those given  to
     the Agents under this Clause 25).

25.5 Documentation

     Neither  any Agent or any of the Arrangers nor  any  of  its
     officers,  employees or agents shall be responsible  to  any
     Bank or to each other for:-

     (a)  the execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
          sufficiency  of  any  Finance  Document  or  any  other
          document in connection therewith; or

     (b)  the collectibility of amounts payable thereunder; or

     (c)  the  accuracy  of  any statements (whether  written  or
          oral)  made  in  or  in  connection  with  any  Finance
          Document or other document in connection therewith.

25.6 Default

     No Agent shall be required to ascertain or inquire as to the
     performance or observance by any Obligor of the terms of any
     Finance   Document  or  any  other  document  in  connection
     therewith.   No Agent shall be deemed to have  knowledge  of
     the occurrence of any Default unless that Agent has received
     notice  from  a  party hereto describing  such  Default  and
     stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".   If  any
     Agent  receives such a notice of default or officers of  any
     Agent  engaged in the performance of that Agent's  functions
     under   the  Finance  Documents  otherwise  acquire   actual
     knowledge that a Default has occurred, that Agent shall give
     notice thereof promptly to the Banks.  Each Agent shall take
     or  refrain  from  taking such action with respect  to  such
     Default as shall be directed by the Majority Banks, provided
     that  nothing  herein contained shall oblige  any  Agent  to
     institute any legal action or proceedings on behalf  of  any
     Bank.   Until any Agent shall have received such directions,
     it  may  (but shall not be obliged to) take or refrain  from
     taking such action with respect to such Default as it  shall
     see fit.

25.7 Exoneration

     Neither  Agent nor any of its officers, employees or  agents
     shall  be liable to any Bank for any action taken or omitted
     under  or  in  connection with any Finance  Document  unless
     caused by its or their negligence or wilful misconduct.

25.8 Reliance

     Each  Agent  may  rely  on  any  communication  or  document
     reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and  may
     rely on any statement made by a director or employee of  any
     person regarding any matters which may reasonably be assumed
     to  be  within his knowledge or within his power to  verify.
     Each  Agent may engage, pay for and rely on legal  or  other
     professional advisers selected by it and shall be  protected
     in so relying.

<PAGE> 80
25.9 Credit approval

     Each  of the Banks severally represents and warrants to each
     Agent  and  each of the Arrangers that it has made  its  own
     independent  investigation and assessment of  the  financial
     condition  and  affairs of each Obligor  and  their  related
     entities  and other parties considered by it to be  relevant
     in  connection with its participation in this Agreement  and
     has not relied exclusively on any information, including the
     Information Memorandum provided to such Bank by any Agent or
     any  Arranger in connection herewith.  Each Bank represents,
     warrants and undertakes to each Agent and each Arranger that
     it  shall continue to make its own independent appraisal  of
     the  creditworthiness  of  the Obligors  and  other  parties
     considered  by  it  to  be relevant in connection  with  the
     Finance  Documents  and  their related  entities  while  any
     amount is or may be outstanding under the Finance Documents.

25.10     Information

(a)  The  Facility Agent shall promptly furnish each Bank with  a
     copy of any documents received by it under Clause 21.2.   If
     so  requested by any Bank, the Facility Agent shall  furnish
     to  such Bank (at the expense of the Company) a copy of  any
     of  the documents listed in Schedule G delivered on or prior
     to Closing.

(b)  The  Facility Agent shall, without any liability on its part
     in  the event of any failure to do so except in the case  of
     its  negligence or wilful default, send to the Banks (at the
     expense  of the Company) any document (or a summary  of  the
     material  details of such document) received by it from  any
     Obligor  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  which  contains  any
     information  which  the Facility Agent considers  to  be  of
     direct  and material interest and significance to the  Banks
     and  their  interests  under this Agreement  and  which  can
     lawfully  be  distributed  by  the  Facility  Agent  without
     incurring any liability to any person whatsoever.

(c)  Save  as  provided in paragraph (a) above neither Agent  nor
     any  Arranger shall have any duty either initially or  on  a
     continuing  basis  to provide any Bank with  any  credit  or
     other information with respect to the financial condition or
     affairs  of  any  Obligor or any of their  related  entities
     whether  coming into its possession or that of  any  related
     entities  of the Facility Agent or any Arranger  before  the
     entry into of this Agreement or at any time thereafter.

(d)  Unless  specifically requested to do so by a  Bank,  neither
     Agent  shall  have any duty to request any  certificates  or
     other  documents from any Obligor under any of  the  Finance
     Documents.

(e)  No  Agent  need  disclose any information  relating  to  any
     Obligor or any of their related entities or any other person
     if  such disclosure would or might in the reasonable opinion
     of  the  Facility Agent constitute a breach of  any  law  or
     regulation  or be otherwise actionable at the  suit  of  any
     person.

25.11     The Facility Agent and the Arrangers individually

(a)  Each Agent and each Arranger shall have the same rights  and
     powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same
     as though it were not the Facility Agent or an Arranger.

(b)  Each  Agent and each Arranger may accept deposits from, lend
     money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
     advisory  or other business whatsoever with any Obligor  and
     their  related  entities  and accept  and  retain  any  fees
     payable by any Obligors or any related entities for its  own
<PAGE> 81
     account  in  connection  herewith and/or  therewith  without
     liability to account therefor to any Bank or any Arranger.

25.12     Indemnity

     Each  Bank agrees to indemnify each Agent on demand (to  the
     extent  not reimbursed by any Obligor and without  prejudice
     to  the liability of any Obligor under any Finance Document)
     for  any  and  all liabilities, losses, damages,  penalties,
     actions, judgements, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
     kind  whatsoever  which may be imposed on,  incurred  by  or
     asserted  against  such  Agent in any  way  relating  to  or
     arising  out  of  its acting as an Agent under  any  of  the
     Finance Documents or performing its duties thereunder or any
     action  taken or omitted by any Agent thereunder (including,
     without limitation, the charges and expenses referred to  in
     Clause 26.5 and all stamp Taxes on or in connection with any
     of the Finance Documents but excluding payment of its agency
     fee  pursuant  to Clause 26.3 and the normal  administrative
     costs  and  expenses  incidental to the performance  of  its
     agency  duties  hereunder save to the  extent  increased  in
     consequence  of  a Default).  Such indemnification  by  each
     Bank  shall be pro rata to its Commitments.  Notwithstanding
     the  foregoing, no Bank shall be liable for any  portion  of
     the  foregoing  resulting  from any  Agent's  negligence  or
     wilful misconduct.

25.13     Legal restrictions

     Each  Agent may refrain from doing anything which  would  or
     might  in its reasonable opinion (a) be contrary to the  law
     of  any  applicable jurisdiction or any applicable  official
     directive  or  regulation or (b) render  it  liable  to  any
     person,  and may do anything which in its reasonable opinion
     (acting  on  legal advice) is necessary to comply  with  any
     such law or directive.

25.14     Resignation

     Each  Agent may (after consultation with the Company) resign
     by  giving  notice thereof to the Banks and the Company  and
     may  be removed by the Majority Banks giving notice to  that
     effect  to  such Agent and the Company.  In that  event  the
     Majority  Banks, with the consent of the Company  where  the
     relevant  Agent  has so resigned (such  consent  not  to  be
     unreasonably  withheld or delayed and the Company  shall  be
     deemed to have consented if it has not given notice refusing
     consent  within 14 days of any request for consent)  and  in
     any  event after consultation with the Company to the extent
     practicable, may appoint a successor for the relevant  Agent
     which   shall   be   a   reputable  and  experienced   bank,
     incorporated  in  or having a branch in England  and  acting
     through such branch.  If the Majority Banks have not, within
     30  days  after  such notice of resignation or  removal,  so
     appointed  a successor Agent which shall have accepted  such
     appointment, the retiring Agent, after consultation with the
     Company,  shall have the right to appoint a successor  Agent
     which shall be a reputable and experienced Bank incorporated
     or  having  a  branch  in England and  acting  through  such
     branch.   The  resignation or removal of the retiring  Agent
     and the appointment of any successor Agent or Security Agent
     shall  both  become  effective upon the  successor  Facility
     Agent or Security Agent notifying all the parties hereto  in
     writing  that  it  accepts such appointment,  whereupon  the
     successor Facility Agent or Security Agent shall succeed  to
     the  position  of  the retiring Facility Agent  or  Security
     Agent and the terms "Facility Agent" and "Security Agent" in
     all  of  the Finance Documents shall include such  successor
     Agent  where appropriate.  This Clause 25 shall continue  to
     benefit  a retiring Agent in respect of any action taken  or
     omitted by it hereunder while it was an Agent.
<PAGE> 82
25.15     Assignments

     Each  Agent may treat each Bank named as a party  hereto  as
     continuing  to  be  such a party, as  entitled  to  payments
     hereunder  and  as  acting hereunder  through  its  Facility
     Office  until it has received notice from such Bank  to  the
     contrary.

25.16     Amendments

(a)  If  authorised by the Majority Banks, the Facility Agent  or
     (in  the case of the Security Documents) the Security  Agent
     may  (except where any other authority is required  for  the
     same  by  the  express provisions of this  Agreement)  grant
     waivers  or consents or (with the agreement of the  Company)
     vary  the terms of the Finance Documents.  Any such  waiver,
     consent  or  variation so authorised  and  effected  by  the
     Facility  Agent  or, as the case may be, the Security  Agent
     shall be binding on all the Banks and the Facility Agent or,
     as  the  case may be, the Security Agent shall be  under  no
     liability whatsoever in respect of any such waiver,  consent
     or  variation, provided always that, except with  the  prior
     written consent of all the Banks and the Company, nothing in
     this Clause 25.16(a) shall authorise:-

     (i)  the extension of any Availability Period; or

     (ii) any variation of the definition of "Majority Banks"  in
          Clause 1.1; or

     (iii) any  extension of the date for, or alteration  in
          the amount or currency of, or waiver of any payment  of
          principal,  interest, Margin, fee,  commission  or  any
          other   amount  payable  under  any  of   the   Finance
          Documents; or

     (iv) any change to any Bank's Commitment; or

     (v)  any  variation of Clauses 12.2, 13, 30.2,  32  or  this
          Clause 25.16; or

     (vi) any  variation  of any provision wherein  (before  such
          variation) it is provided that certain things  may  not
          be  done  without or may be done with  the  consent  or
          approval of all the Banks.

(b)  If  authorised by the Majority Banks, the Security Agent may
     grant any waiver or consent in relation to, or variation  of
     the  material provisions of, any Security Document (but not,
     for  the avoidance of doubt, so as to release any security).
     Subject  as  otherwise provided for in this  Agreement,  any
     release  of  the security provided by any Security  Document
     over  the Shares  requires the consent of all the Banks,.

25.17     Security Agent as Trustee

(a)  The  Security Agent in its capacity as Trustee or  otherwise
     shall not be liable for any failure, omission, or defect  in
     perfecting the security constituted by any Security Document
     or   any   security   created  thereby  including,   without
     limitation,  any failure to register the same in  accordance
     with the provisions of any of the documents of title of  the
     relevant Obligor to any of the property thereby charged.
<PAGE> 83
(b)  The  Security Agent in its capacity as Trustee or  otherwise
     may  accept  without enquiry such title as any  Obligor  may
     have  to the property over which security is intended to  be
     created by any Security Document.

(c)  Save where the Security Agent holds a legal mortgage over or
     over  an  interest in, real property or shares, the Security
     Agent  in its capacity as Trustee or otherwise shall not  be
     under  any  obligation  to hold any  title  deeds,  Security
     Documents  or  any  other documents in connection  with  the
     property charged by any Security Document or any other  such
     security  in  its  own possession or to take  any  steps  to
     protect or preserve the same.  The Security Agent may permit
     the  relevant  Obligor to retain all such  title  deeds  and
     other documents in its possession.

(d)  Save  as  otherwise provided in the Security Documents,  all
     moneys  which  under the trusts herein or therein  contained
     are  received  by  the Security Agent  in  its  capacity  as
     Trustee or otherwise may be invested in the name of or under
     the  control of the Security Agent in any investment for the
     time  being authorised by English law for the investment  by
     trustees  of  trust money or in any other investments  which
     may  be  selected by the Security Agent with the consent  of
     the Majority Banks.  Additionally, the same may be placed on
     deposit  in the name of or under the control of the Security
     Agent at such bank or institution (including any Agent)  and
     upon  such terms as the Security Agent may think  fit.   Any
     and  all such monies and all interest thereon shall be  paid
     over  to  the  Facility Agent forthwith upon demand  by  the
     Facility Agent.

(e)  Each  Bank  hereby  confirms its  approval  of  the  Finance
     Documents and any security created or to be created pursuant
     thereto  and  hereby authorises, empowers  and  directs  the
     Security  Agent (by itself or by such person(s)  as  it  may
     nominate) to execute and enforce the same as trustee  or  as
     otherwise  provided  (and whether or not  expressly  in  the
     Banks' names) on its behalf.

     which  may  be executed at any time after the date  of  this
     Agreement), together in all cases with all value  added  and

     transferee  at  the  same  time as  the  rights  under  this

     wishes  to transfer all or any part of its rights,  benefits
     and/or  obligations under the Finance Documents  to  another
     bank   (the   "New   Bank")  then,  as  an  alternative   to
     Clause 29.3, provided that the New Bank is then a Recognised
     Bank and that if it is a bank having its principal place  of
     business  in the U.S.A. it is a bank as defined  in  section
     3(a)(6)  of the Securities Exchange Act 1934 of the  U.S.A.,

     in  respect thereof involving the New Bank in respect of all
     of  its  rights, benefits and/or obligations by the delivery
     to  the  Facility  Agent and acceptance  by  it  of  a  duly
     completed certificate executed by the Existing Bank and  the
     New  Bank  in  substantially  the  form  of  Schedule  D  (a
     "Substitution Certificate").

(b)  Upon  delivery  to  the Facility Agent of  any  Substitution
     Certificate and acceptance of the same by the Facility Agent
     (which   delivery   and  acceptance   shall   be   evidenced
     exclusively and conclusively by the Agent's countersignature

          relevant   part   of  the  Existing   Bank's   relevant
          Commitment  and/or relevant Advances (all as  specified
          in  the  schedule  to  such Substitution  Certificate),
          shall be terminated and each shall be released from all
          further  obligations  to the other  under  the  Finance
          Documents  with respect to the same, (all  such  rights
          and  obligations to be so terminated or released  being

          Facility  Agent)  the  other  parties  to  the  Finance
          Documents shall each acquire rights against each  other
          and  assume obligations towards each other which differ
          from   the  Discharged  Rights  and  Obligations   only
          (subject  as  provided in Clause 29.7) insofar  as  the
          Obligors,  the  New  Bank and such other  parties  have
          assumed  and/or  acquired the  same  in  place  of  the
          Obligors,  the  Existing Bank and  such  other  parties
          respectively;

     (iii) the  Facility Agent, the Security Agent, the  New
          Bank  and the other Banks as well as the other  parties
          to  the Finance Documents shall acquire the same rights
          and  assume the same obligations between themselves  as
          they  would have acquired and assumed had such New Bank
          been an original party to this Agreement as a Bank with
          the  Discharged  Rights  and  Obligations  acquired  or
          assumed  by  it  in  consequence of  such  Substitution
          Certificate;

     (iv) the  New  Bank  shall become by the  execution  by  the
          Facility  Agent of such Substitution Certificate  bound
          by  the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement as  if  it
          were an original party thereto as a Senior Creditor and
          shall  acquire  the  same rights and  assume  the  same
          obligations   towards   the  other   parties   to   the
          Intercreditor Agreement as would have been acquired and
          assumed had the New Bank been an original party to  the

     (v)  a   proportion  of  the  Existing  Bank's  rights   and
          obligations  under all of the Finance Documents,  equal

          this  Agreement  being assumed by the New  Bank,  shall
          automatically and simultaneously be assumed by the  New
          Bank.

(c)  Discharged  Rights and Obligations shall  not  include,  and
     there  shall be no termination or release pursuant  to  this
     Clause  29.4 of, any rights or obligations arising  pursuant
     to Clauses 13 or 15.1 in respect of the period or in respect
     of  payments made hereunder during the period prior  to  the
     effective date of the relevant Substitution Certificate  (as
     stated in that certificate).

(d)  Each  Obligor,  the  Banks  and the  Security  Agent  hereby
     irrevocably  appoint  the  Facility  Agent  to  receive  and
     countersign  each Substitution Certificate as agent  on  its
     behalf  and,  to  the  extent relevant,  the  provisions  of
     Clause 25 shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to  such
     appointment.  The Facility Agent shall be entitled (but  not
     obliged)  to  decline  to  accept  and/or  countersign   any
     proposed Substitution Certificate entered into in breach  of
     Clause 29.9.

(e)  The New Bank party to any Substitution Certificate shall pay
     to  the Facility Agent an administration fee of 500 pounds on
     or before the effective date for that Substitution Certificate
     (as specified therein).

<PAGE> 88
(f)  Without  prejudice to any provision of Clause 25,  each  New
     Bank  shall, by its execution of a Substitution Certificate,
     accept  that  neither  the  Existing  Bank  party  to   that
     certificate  nor  the Facility Agent, the other  Banks,  the
     Arrangers  or  the Security Agent is in any way  responsible
     for  or  makes any representation or warranty as to (i)  the
     accuracy and/or completeness of any information supplied  to
     such  New  Bank  in  connection with the Finance  Documents,
     (ii)  the  creditworthiness, condition, affairs,  status  or
     nature  of the Obligors or the observance by any of them  of
     any   of  their  obligations  under  any  Finance  Document,
     (iii)  the  legality, validity, effectiveness,  adequacy  or
     enforceability  of  any Finance Document  or  (iv)  the  tax
     status  of any payments to be made to or for the account  of
     such  New Bank by any Obligors or the Facility Agent or  the
     Security Agent under any Finance Document and save,  in  the
     case  of  the  Facility  Agent or  the  Security  Agent,  as
     otherwise  expressly provided herein, none of  such  parties
     shall be or be deemed to be the agent or trustee of such New
     Bank in connection with this Agreement.

(g)  Each  New  Bank  shall, by its execution of  a  Substitution
     Certificate,  be  taken to confirm that it  is  a  financial
     institution   whose  ordinary  business   is   or   includes
     participation in syndicated facilities of this type and that
     it has made its own independent investigation and assessment
     of  the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor  and
     their related entities and other parties considered by it to
     be  relevant  in connection with its participation  in  this
     Agreement  and has not relied exclusively on any information
     provided to it by the Existing Bank or the Facility Agent or
     the  Security Agent or the Arrangers in connection with  any
     Finance  Document.   No  other party shall  be  required  to
     investigate the truth or otherwise of such confirmation  and
     all  parties  to this Agreement shall be entitled  fully  to
     rely   on  that  confirmation  for  the  purposes  of   this
     Agreement.

(h)  The  Facility  Agent  shall  be  entitled  to  rely  on  any
     Substitution  Certificate delivered to it  pursuant  to  the
     provisions  of this Agreement which is complete and  regular
     on its face as regards its contents and appears to be signed
     on  behalf  of the Existing Bank and the New Bank  named  as
     party  to this Agreement, and the Facility Agent shall  have
     no liability or responsibility to any party as a consequence
     of  placing  reliance on and acting in accordance  with  and
     counter-signing that Substitution Certificate.

(i)  The  Facility Agent shall notify the Company promptly of the
     receipt and execution on its behalf by the Facility Agent of
     any Substitution Certificate and shall deliver a copy of  it
     to the Company.

29.5 Reference Banks

     The  Facility Agent may (subject to the Company  giving  its
     consent   thereto,  such  consent  not  to  be  unreasonably
     withheld) nominate additional Banks or Affiliates thereof to
     become  Reference  Banks and such Banks or Affiliates  shall
     become Reference Banks upon their indicating to the Facility
     Agent  that they are prepared to act as such.  The  Facility
     Agent will give the Company written notice of such Banks  or
     Affiliates  having  become  Reference  Banks  as   soon   as
     practical thereafter.  If a Reference Bank (or the  Bank  of
     which  a Reference Bank is an Affiliate, in the case of  any
     Reference  Bank  which is not itself a Bank)  transfers  the
     whole of its rights and obligations under this Agreement  as
     a Bank or ceases to be one of the Banks, the Facility Agent,
     subject to agreement by the Company (such agreement  not  to
     be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed) will appoint  another
     Bank to replace such Bank or Affiliate as a Reference Bank.

<PAGE> 89
29.6 Change of Facility Office

     Each  Bank  shall participate in this Agreement through  its
     Facility  Office(s),  but any Bank may change  its  Facility
     Office with respect to any Utilisation from time to time, on
     giving not less than four Business Days' prior notice to the
     Facility Agent, to any other location in the United Kingdom.

29.7 Increased Costs and Illegality

(a)  Subject  as  provided  in  paragraph  (b)  below,   if   any
     assignment, transfer or substitution of or with  respect  to
     all or any part of the rights or obligations of a Bank under
     this Agreement pursuant to Clause 29.3 or 29.4 or any change
     in  Facility  Office pursuant to Clause 29.6 is  made  which
     results  (or would but for this Clause result) at  the  time
     thereof  in  amounts becoming payable under  Clauses  13  or
     15.1, then the assignee, transferee, New Bank or Bank acting
     through its new Facility Office shall be entitled to receive
     such   amounts  only  to  the  extent  that  the   assignor,
     transferor,  Existing  Bank  or  Bank  acting  through   its
     original  Facility Office would have been  so  entitled  had
     there  been  no  such assignment, transfer, substitution  or
     change  in  Facility Office.  No such assignment,  transfer,
     substitution or change in Facility Office shall be  made  if
     the  assignee, transferee or substitute or such Bank (in the
     case  of  a  change  in Facility Office) would  be  entitled
     immediately afterwards to give notice under Clause 16.

(b)  The  provisions of the first sentence of paragraph (a) above
     shall  not apply in relation to any assignment, transfer  or
     substitution of or with respect to the rights or obligations
     of the Original Banks, provided that the same is effected by
     the  Original Banks within six months from the date of  this
     Agreement.

     However,  the Original Banks will use reasonable  endeavours
     (to  the  extent not materially prejudicial to their ability
     successfully to syndicate the Facilities within  six  months
     of  the  Unconditional Date) to avoid making any assignment,
     transfer  or  substitution to or in favour of any  assignee,
     transferee or New Bank having an entitlement at the time  of
     such  assignment,  transfer or novation to  receive  amounts
     payable  under  Clauses 15 or 16.1 in amounts  greater  than
     would  have been payable by the Obligors hereunder  at  that
     time  in  the  absence  of  such  assignment,  transfer   or
     substitution.

29.8 Sub-participations

     Any  Bank  shall be entitled freely to enter into  any  sub-
     participation  or  other arrangement with  any  third  party
     relating to the Finance Documents which does not transfer to
     that  third  party  any  obligation  and/or  any  legal   or
     equitable  interest in any of the rights arising under  this
     Agreement.

29.9 Timing

     Each Bank undertakes to the Facility Agent that it will  not
     effect  any  assignment or transfer pursuant to Clause  29.3
     and   will  not  enter  into  any  Substitution  Certificate
     pursuant  to  Clause  29.4 on or within five  Business  Days
     before the due date for any payment to be made under any  of
     the  Finance  Documents where it would have  the  effect  of
     altering the amount to be paid by the Facility Agent to such
     Bank consequent on the receipt by the Facility Agent of such
     payment under the Finance Documents.

<PAGE> 90
29.10 Restriction

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  in  this
     Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Banks  in
     any particular case, each Bank may only effect an assignment
     or transfer of, or substitution with respect to, outstanding
     Utilisations   and/or  Commitments  where  the   assignment,
     transfer  or  substitution relates to  all  Utilisations  in
     which it participates and/or all its Commitments pro rata as
     between such Utilisations and/or such Commitments.

30.  SET-OFF AND REDISTRIBUTION

30.1 Set-off

     Each  Bank may (but shall not be obliged to) set off against
     any  obligation of any Obligor due and payable by it  to  or
     for  the  account of such Bank under this Agreement and  not
     paid  on  the due date any moneys held by such Bank for  the
     account  of such Obligor at any office of such Bank anywhere
     and  in any currency, whether or not matured.  Such Bank may
     effect  such  currency  exchanges  as  are  appropriate   to
     implement  the  set-off  and  any  usual  charges  and   all
     applicable  Taxes  in  relation to such  currency  exchanges
     shall  be paid by such Obligor.  Any Bank which has set  off
     shall  give  prompt  notice of that  fact  to  the  relevant
     Obligor.

30.2 Redistribution

(a)  If at any time the proportion which any Bank (the "receiving
     Bank")  has  received or recovered (whether  by  set-off  or
     otherwise)  on account of any sum due from any  Borrower  or
     any Guarantor under this Agreement is greater (the amount of
     the  excess being herein referred to as the "excess amount")
     than  the  proportion  received or  recovered  by  the  Bank
     receiving or recovering the smallest proportion (which shall
     include  a nil receipt) in relation to the sum then  due  to
     the latter Bank from the relevant Borrower or the Guarantors
     under this Agreement, then the receiving Bank shall promptly
     notify the Facility Agent thereof and:-

     (i)  the  receiving  Bank shall promptly and  in  any  event
          within  ten  days of receipt or recovery of the  excess
          amount pay to the Facility Agent an amount equal to the
          excess amount;

     (ii) the  excess amount shall be treated as having been paid
          to  or  recovered by the receiving Bank for the account
          of  the  Facility  Agent for payment to  the  Banks  as
          provided  in paragraph (iii) below, and the obligations
          of  the  relevant  Borrower and the Guarantors  to  the
          receiving  Bank shall only be reduced or discharged  by
          the  receipt or recovery by the receiving Bank of  such
          excess  amount  to  the extent of the receiving  Bank's
          entitlement  to payment by the Facility Agent  pursuant
          to paragraph (iii) below; and

     (iii) the  parties to this Agreement shall  treat  such
          payment  as  if  it  were  a payment  by  the  relevant
          Borrower  or  the Guarantors to the Facility  Agent  on
          account  of a sum owed to the Banks and shall  pay  the
          same  to  the Banks (including the receiving Bank)  pro
          rata to their respective entitlements in such sum;

     provided   that  where  a  receiving  Bank  is  subsequently
     required  to  repay  to any Obligor any amount  received  or
     recovered  by it and dealt with under paragraphs  (i),  (ii)
     and  (iii)  above,  each Bank shall promptly  repay  to  the
     Facility  Agent for the receiving Bank the portion  of  such
     amount distributed to it, together with interest on it at  a

<PAGE> 91
     rate  sufficient  to reimburse the receiving  Bank  for  any
     interest  which it has been required to pay to such  Obligor
     in respect of such portion of such amount.

(b)  Where  a  receiving  Bank  has recovered  any  amount  as  a
     consequence  of  the  satisfaction  or  enforcement   of   a
     judgement  obtained in any legal action  or  proceedings  to
     which it is a party, this Clause 30.2 shall not apply so  as
     to  benefit any other Bank which (being entitled so  to  do)
     did  not  join  with the receiving Bank in  such  action  or
     proceedings,  unless the receiving Bank did not  give  prior
     notice  of its involvement in such action or proceedings  to
     the Facility Agent for disclosure to the other Banks.

(c)   Each Bank shall promptly give notice to the Facility  Agent
      of:-

     (i)  the  institution  by such Bank of any legal  action  or
          proceedings under this Agreement or in connection  with
          this Agreement prior to such institution; and

     (ii) the  receipt  or recovery by such Bank  of  any  amount
          received or recovered by it otherwise than through  the
          Facility Agent.

     Upon receipt of any such notice, the Facility Agent will  as
     soon as practicable thereafter notify all the other Banks.

30.3 Loss Sharing

     Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this Clause
     30,  if  it transpires for any reason that after enforcement
     in  full of the Finance Documents any of the liabilities  of
     any  of  the  Obligors  under the Finance  Documents  remain
     undischarged and for any reason any resulting losses are not
     being  borne by the Banks pro rata to the amount which their
     respective  aggregate Commitments bore to the  aggregate  of
     all  the  Commitments  on the date on which  an  Enforcement
     Event occurred, the Banks shall make such payments inter  se
     as  shall  be  required  to ensure that  after  taking  into
     account such payments such losses are borne by the Banks pro
     rata.   For  this  purpose, "Enforcement  Event"  means  the
     Facility  Agent  first exercising any of  its  rights  under
     Clause  23.2(b), (d) or (e) or, having exercised its  rights
     under  Clause 23.2(c), first making demand with  respect  to
     some  or  all of the Advances.  Any assignment, transfer  or
     substitution  by  a  Bank pursuant  to  Clause  29  (whether
     occurring  before or after an Enforcement Event) shall  also
     be  effective  to assign, transfer or effect a  substitution
     pursuant to that Clause with respect to the rights  of  such
     Bank under this Clause 30.3.

31.  GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

31.1 Governing Law

     This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by  and  construed  in
     accordance with English law.

31.2 Courts of England

     hereby irrevocably agrees that the High Courts of Justice in
     London, and all appellate courts therefrom have jurisdiction
     to  settle  any  disputes  which may  arise  out  of  or  in
     connection  with any of the Finance Documents and  that  any
     suit,  action  or  proceedings (together  "Proceedings")  in
     connection with any Finance Document may be brought  in  the
     High  Courts  of Justice in London and all appellate  courts
<PAGE> 92
     therefrom and accordingly submits to the jurisdiction of the
     High  Courts  of Justice in London and all appellate  courts
     therefrom.

(b)  Each  Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  agrees
     that  nothing  in any of the Finance Documents shall  affect
     the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.

31.3 No limitation

     Nothing  in this Clause 31 shall limit the right of  any  of
     the  Finance Parties to take Proceedings against any Obligor
     in  any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the
     taking  of Proceedings in one or more jurisdiction  preclude
     the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction, whether
     concurrently or not.

32.  CONFIDENTIALITY

     Each  Finance  Party  hereby severally  undertakes  to  each
     Obligor that it will keep confidential and that it will  not
     make  use  of  for  any  purposes (otherwise  than  for  the
     purposes of the Finance Documents and otherwise than in  the
     context  of an addition to its general experience, knowledge
     or  expertise),  any of the Transaction Documents  or  other
     documents  relating  to  this  Agreement  and  all  of   the
     information distributed on behalf of the Obligors or any  of
     them  during syndication or contained in, received under  or
     obtained  in  the  course  of discussions  relating  to  the
     Information  Memorandum  and/or the  Transaction  Documents,
     other than any such document or information which has become
     generally available to banks through no breach by it of this
     Clause,  provided that each Finance Party shall be  entitled
     to make disclosure of the same:-

     (a)  to  its  auditors, accountants, legal counsel  and  tax
          advisers   and  to  any  other  professional   advisers
          appointed  to act in connection with the administration
          of  the  Finance  Documents or the enforcement  of,  or
          realisation of any security provided under, any of  the
          Finance Documents;

     (b)  (whether  or  not  the  relevant assignment,  transfer,
          substitution, sub-participation or other arrangement is
          made)   to   any   proposed  assignee,  transferee   or
          substitute  of, or proposed party to any proposed  sub-
          participation   (or   party   to   any   actual    sub-
          participation)  or  other arrangement  with,  any  Bank
          permitted  pursuant  to this Agreement,  provided  that
          before  any  such disclosure such assignee, transferee,
          substitute or other party expressly undertakes  to  the
          Company  and the Facility Agent in writing to be  bound
          by   this  Clause  32  irrespective  of  whether   such
          assignment, transfer, substitution or other arrangement
          shall proceed;

     (c)  to any other third party where the relevant Obligor has
          previously  agreed  in writing that disclosure  may  be
          made to that third party;

     (d)  to   any  banking  or  other  regulatory  or  examining
          authorities  (whether governmental or otherwise)  where
          such disclosure is requested by them;

     (e)  pursuant  to  subpoena or other legal  process,  or  in
          connection with any action, suit or proceeding relating
          to any of the Finance Documents;

     (f)   pursuant to any law or regulation having the force  of
     law; and

<PAGE> 93
     (g)  to CSW and to any member of the Group.

     The  provisions  of  this  Clause  32  shall  supersede  any
     undertakings  with  respect  to  confidentiality  previously
     given by any Finance Party in favour of any Obligor.

33.  MISCELLANEOUS

33.1 Severability

(a)  If  any  provision of any Finance Document is prohibited  or
     unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction,  such  prohibition  or
     unenforceability   shall   not  invalidate   the   remaining
     provisions  of such Finance Document or affect the  validity
     or   enforceability   of  such  provision   in   any   other
     jurisdiction.

(b)  If   any   of  the  undertakings  given  in  Clause  21.6(a)
     (Dividends),  21.6(c) (Share Capital and Subordinated  Debt)
     or  21.9(g)  (Constitutional Documents) are not  enforceable
     against any Obligor the obligation on each other Obligor  to
     procure  compliance  with  such  undertaking  shall   remain
     enforceable.

33.2 Certifications

     Where any person gives any certificates on behalf of any  of
     the  parties  to  the  Finance  Documents  pursuant  to  any
     provision   hereof  and  such  certificate  proves   to   be
     incorrect, the individual shall incur no personal  liability
     in  consequence of such certificate being so incorrect  save
     where  such  individual  acted fraudulently,  recklessly  or
     negligently  in giving such certificate (in which  case  any
     liability   of  such  individual  shall  be  determined   in
     accordance with applicable law).

33.3 Accounts as Evidence

     Accounts  maintained by the Facility Agent or each  Bank  in
     connection herewith shall constitute prima facie evidence of
     sums owing to such Bank under this Agreement.

                           SCHEDULE E

                 CALCULATION OF ADDITIONAL COST


(1)  The  Additional Cost relative to each Advance where (and  to
     the  extent  that) Banks making such Advance are subject  to
     the  Mandatory  Liquid Asset requirements  of  the  Bank  of
     England, will be, subject as hereinafter provided,  for  the
     Interest Period relating to such Advance (or, if longer than
     three  months, for each consecutive period of  three  months
     within  such  Interest Period and for any  balance  of  such
     Interest  Period) (which Interest Period if not longer  than
     three  months and each other such period is herein  referred
     to  as  a  "Relevant Period") the percentage  rate  (or  the
     arithmetic  average of the percentage rates where  there  is
     more than one Reference Bank supplying the same) supplied by
     the  Reference Banks (or such of them as supply  it  to  the
     Facility Agent) arrived at by applying the following formula
     in relation to each Reference Bank:-

     Additional Cost = BY + L(Y-X) + S(Y-Z) % per annum
                         100-(B + S)

     Where:-

     B   =     The  percentage  of  such  Reference  Bank's
               eligible liabilities then required to be held on a
               non-interest-bearing deposit account with the Bank
               of England pursuant to the cash ratio requirements
               of the Bank of England.

     Y   =     The  rate at which Sterling deposits  in  an
               amount approximately equal to the principal amount
               of such Advance are offered by such Reference Bank
               to leading banks in the London Interbank Market at
               or  about  11.00  a.m.  on  the  Utilisation  Date
               relative to such Advance (or the first day of  the
               relevant  Interest Period) for a period comparable
               to   the  Relevant  Period  in  relation  to  such
               Advance.

     L =       The   average   percentage   of   eligible
               liabilities which the Bank of England from time to
               time  requires each Reference Bank to maintain  as
               secured  money with members of the London Discount
               Market  Association and/or as secured  call  money
               with  those  money  brokers and gilt-edged  market
               makers recognised by the Bank of England.

     X =       The  rate at which secured Sterling deposits
               in  an amount approximately equal to the principal
               amount  of  such  Advance may be  placed  by  such
               Reference Bank with members of the London Discount
               Market  Association and/or as secured  call  money
               with money brokers and gilt-edged market makers at
               or  about 11.00 a.m. on such Utilisation Date  (or
               the first day of the relevant Interest Period) for
               a  period  comparable to the  Relevant  Period  in
               relation to such Advance.

     S =       The  percentage  of  such  Reference  Bank's
               eligible liabilities then required to be placed as
               a special deposit with the Bank of England.

<PAGE> 105
     Z =       The  percentage  interest  rate  per  annum
               allowed   by  the  Bank  of  England  on   special
               deposits.

     For  the  purposes of this paragraph "eligible  liabilities"
     and  "special deposits" shall bear the meanings ascribed  to
     them from time to time by the Bank of England.

(2)  In the application of the above formula, B, Y, L, X, S and Z
     will  be  included  in the formula as  figures  and  not  as
     percentages,  e.g.  if B = 0.5% and Y  =  15%,  BY  will  be
     calculated as 0.5 x 15 and not as 0.5% x 15%.

(3)  The  Additional  Cost  computed by  the  Facility  Agent  in
     accordance  with this schedule shall be rounded  upward,  if
     necessary, to four decimal places.

(4)  The  calculation in respect of the Additional Cost for  each
     Advance denominated in Sterling will be made by the Facility
     Agent on the first day of each Relevant Period.

(5)  Calculations will be made on the basis of a year of 365 days
     and the actual number of days elapsed.

(6)  If  no  Reference Bank furnishes the appropriate information
     for the purposes of this Schedule, the Additional Cost shall
     be  determined  by the Facility Agent on the basis  of  such
     other information and quotations as the Facility Agent shall
     reasonably determine to be appropriate.

(7)  In  the  event  of a change in circumstances (including  the
     imposition    of   alternative   or   additional    official
     requirements, excluding capital adequacy requirements) which
     renders  the  above formula inappropriate in the  reasonable
     opinion  of  the  Facility Agent, the Facility  Agent  shall
     promptly notify the Company and the Banks thereof and (after
     consultation with the Reference Banks and the Company) shall
     notify  the  Borrowers of the manner in which the Additional
     Cost  shall thereafter be determined (which manner shall  be
     determined  in  a  bona  fide  manner  and  provide  a  fair
     assessment of the Additional Cost) and the Obligors and  the
     Banks shall be bound thereby.
