PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

GENERAL
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      CSW,  incorporated under the laws of Delaware  in  1925,  is  a
registered holding company under the Holding Company Act and owns all
of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Operating Companies,
CSWS,  CSW  Credit, CSWE, CSWI and CSW Communications.  In  addition,
CSW  owns  80%  of  the  outstanding shares of common  stock  of  CSW
Leasing.    The  corporate  predecessors  of  CSW  and  the  Electric
Operating Companies date back to the 19th century.

      The  Electric Operating Companies are public utility  companies
engaged  in  generating, purchasing, transmitting,  distributing  and
selling   electricity.    The  Electric  Operating   Companies   were
incorporated as follows:

                               State of
Registrant                  Incorporation                   Year

CPL                             Texas                       1945
PSO                            Oklahoma                     1913
SWEPCO                         Delaware                     1912
WTU                             Texas                       1927

     CPL and WTU operate in portions of south and central west Texas,
respectively.   PSO operates in portions of eastern and  southwestern
Oklahoma,  and  SWEPCO  operates in portions of  northeastern  Texas,
northwestern   Louisiana  and  western  Arkansas.   Transok   is   an
intrastate  natural gas gathering, transmission, processing,  storage
and  marketing company which transports for and sells natural gas  to
the  Electric  Operating  Companies,  principally  PSO,  as  well  as
processing,  transporting and selling natural gas  to  and  for  non-
affiliates.  CSWS performs, at cost, various accounting, engineering,
tax,   legal,  financial,  electronic  data  processing,  centralized
economic dispatching of electric power and other services for the CSW
System.   CSW  Credit purchases accounts receivable of the  Operating
Companies and unaffiliated electric and gas utilities.  CSWE and CSWI
pursue  cogeneration  projects and other energy ventures  within  the
United  States  and  internationally.   CSW  Communications  provides
communication services to the Operating Companies and non-affiliates.
CSW Leasing invests in leveraged leases.

CPL
      The  economic  base  of  the service territory  served  by  CPL
includes   manufacturing,   metal   refining,   petroleum   products,
agriculture and tourism.  In 1994, industrial customers accounted for
approximately 22% of CPL's total operating revenues.  Contracts  with
substantially  all industrial customers provide for both  demand  and
energy  charges.  Demand charges continue under such  contracts  even
during  periods  of reduced industrial activity, thus mitigating  the
effect of reduced activity on operating income.

PSO
      The  economic  base  of the territory served  by  PSO  includes
mining,  petroleum  products, manufacturing  and  agriculture,  which
provides  a  balanced  economy.   The  principal  industries  in  the
territory include natural gas and oil production, oil refining, steel
processing,  maintenance of aircraft, the manufacture  of  paper  and
timber products, glass, chemicals, cement and aircraft components.

<PAGE> 1-8
SWEPCO
      The  economic  base of the service territory served  by  SWEPCO
includes  chemical processing, petroleum refining  and  oil  and  gas
extraction.   The primary metals and paper processing industries  add
balance to SWEPCO's industrial base.

WTU
       The   economic  base  of  the  territory  served  by  WTU   is
predominantly  agricultural, producing cattle, sheep, goats,  cotton,
wool,  mohair  and feed crops.  Significant gains have been  made  in
economic  diversification  through value added  processing  of  these
products.   The  natural  resources of  the  territory  include  oil,
natural   gas,   sulfur,   gypsum  and  ceramic   clays.    Important
manufacturing and processing plants served by WTU produce cotton seed
products, oil products, electronic equipment, precision and  consumer
metal  products,  meat products and gypsum products.   The  territory
also  includes several military installations and state  correctional
institutions.

<PAGE> 1-9
      The  relative contributions of the CSW System companies to  the
aggregate  operating revenues, operating income and  net  income  for
common  stock differ from year to year due to variations in  weather,
fuel  costs reflected in charges to customers, timing and  amount  of
rate  changes  and  other  factors,  including  changes  in  business
conditions  and  the  results of non-utility  businesses.   In  1994,
approximately 62% of the CSW System's electric revenues  were  earned
in Texas, 24% in Oklahoma, 8% in Louisiana and 6% in Arkansas.

Restructuring
      In  November  1993, CSW undertook a restructuring  designed  to
consolidate  and  restructure its operations in  order  to  meet  the
challenges  of the changing electric utility industry and to  compete
effectively  in the years ahead.  The restructuring is a response  to
two  major factors, (i) a reduction in the rate of growth in the  use
of  electricity  and (ii) increasing competition among  suppliers  of
electricity  as a result of the Energy Policy Act.  As  a  result  of
these  changes, CSW believes that the electric utility industry faces
changes  in  the  way  all  electric  utilities  do  business.    The
underlying  goal  of  the  restructuring is to  enable  the  Electric
Operating  Companies to focus on and be accountable for  serving  the
customer.

      In  general,  the restructuring is designed to consolidate  and
centralize  in  CSWS  certain  functions  which  had  been  performed
separately  by  CSW's  Electric Operating Companies.   In  part,  the
restructuring  shifts certain management functions  relating  to  the
operation of power plants, certain engineering activities and certain
administrative  and  support functions from  the  Electric  Operating
Companies  to  CSWS, thereby reducing costs and freeing the  Electric
Operating  Companies  to  focus on customer  service,  marketing  and
economic  development.  The restructuring is intended to  standardize
certain  practices  throughout  the  CSW  System  and  to  streamline
management.

      To  delineate lines more clearly at the holding company  level,
the restructuring aligns CSW management into two principal units, CSW
Electric, covering the CSW System's electric utility operations,  and
CSW  Enterprises, covering CSW's other businesses, including Transok,
CSWE, CSWI, CSW Communications, and the mergers and acquisitions  and
strategic planning departments.  CSW Electric and CSW Enterprises are
functional business designations only, not new subsidiaries.

       CSW  expects  to  realize  a  number  of  benefits  from   the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased  efficiencies and synergies have been, and are expected  to
continue   to  be,  realized  with  the  elimination  of   previously
duplicated  functions.   This  leads to  enhanced  communication  and
efficiency,  which should translate into a reduction in the  rate  of
growth  in  O&M  costs and thereby reduce the need  for  future  rate
increases.

      See  ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS - Restructuring  for  further
discussion about the restructuring.

New Business Opportunities
CSW
      CSW  continues to consider new business opportunities to expand
and enhance its core electric utility business, and to expand its non-
utility  business.  CSW's investment strategy with  respect  to  non-
utility businesses is to invest in businesses that are related to the
expertise  utilized  in  the core electric utility  business.   CSW's
principal non-utility businesses are Transok and CSWE.  During  1994,
CSW  formed  a  new  corporation, CSWI, to pursue  independent  power
initiatives  abroad.  In addition, CSW is considering investments  in
telecommunications, environmental and energy services.  During  1994,
CSW formed CSW Communications to provide a communications network for
the  CSW  System  as  well as third-parties.   CSW  expects  to  make
additional  investments in non-regulated business during  1995.   For
additional information, see NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS below.

Proposed Acquisition of El Paso
CSW
      In  May  1993, CSW entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant  to
which  El  Paso  would  emerge  from  bankruptcy  as  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary   of  CSW.   El  Paso  is  an  electric  utility   company
headquartered  in  El  Paso,  Texas,  engaged  principally   in   the
generation  and distribution of electricity to approximately  262,000
retail customers in west Texas and southern New Mexico.  El Paso also
sells  electricity under contract to wholesale customers in a  number
of  locations including southern California and Mexico.  El Paso  had
filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code on January 8, 1992.

      On July 30, 1993, El Paso filed the Modified Plan and a related
proposed  form of Disclosure Statement providing for the  acquisition
of  El  Paso  by  CSW.  On November 15, 1993, all voting  classes  of
creditors  and shareholders of El Paso voted to approve the  Modified
Plan.   On  December  8,  1993, the Bankruptcy  Court  confirmed  the
Modified Plan.

      Under  the  Modified Plan, the total value of  CSW's  offer  to
acquire  El  Paso is approximately $2.2 billion.  The  Modified  Plan
generally provides for El Paso creditors and shareholders to  receive
shares  of CSW Common, cash and/or securities of El Paso, or to  have
their  claims cured and reinstated.  The Modified Plan also  provides
for  claims  of secured creditors generally to be paid in  full  with
debt  securities of reorganized El Paso, and for unsecured  creditors
to  receive a combination of debt securities of reorganized  El  Paso
and  CSW Common equal to 95.5 percent of their claims, and for  small
trade  creditors  to be paid in full with cash.   The  Modified  Plan
provides  for  El Paso's preferred shareholders to receive  preferred
shares  of reorganized El Paso, or cash, and for options to  purchase
El   Paso  Common  to  be  converted  into  options  to  purchase   a
proportionate  number  of  shares of CSW Common.   In  addition,  the
Modified  Plan provides for certain creditor classes of  El  Paso  to
accrue  interest  on  their  claims and to receive  periodic  interim
distributions  of  such interest through the Effective  Date  or  the
withdrawal  or  revocation of the Modified Plan, subject  to  certain
conditions and limitations set forth in the Modified Plan.  To  date,
all such accrued interest payments to creditors have been made by  El
Paso  on a timely basis.  If, under certain circumstances, the Merger
is  not consummated, the Merger Agreement provides for CSW to pay  El
Paso  for a portion of such interim interest payments paid or accrued
prior  to  the  termination  of  the Merger  Agreement.   The  Merger
Agreement  also  provides for CSW to pay for a portion  of  fees  and
expenses, including legal expenses of certain El Paso creditors under
such  circumstances.  CSW's potential exposure  as  of  December  31,
1994,  is  estimated to be approximately $17.5 million; however,  the
actual  amount, if any, that CSW may be required to pay  pursuant  to
these  provisions  depends  on a number of contingencies  and  cannot
presently be predicted.

      The  Merger is subject to numerous conditions set forth in  the
Merger  Agreement, including but not limited to (i)  the  receipt  of
final  orders  with respect to all required regulatory  approvals  on
terms  that would not cause a regulatory material adverse  effect  as
defined in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the receipt of all third  party
consents, (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect or facts  or
circumstances  that  could reasonably be  expected  to  result  in  a
material  adverse effect on El Paso or the business prospects  of  El
Paso,  (iv)  transfer to El Paso of good and marketable title  to  El
Paso's share of Palo Verde, (v) performance by El Paso, CSW and CSW's
acquisition  subsidiary, CSW Sub, Inc., in all material  respects  of
all  covenants  contained  in  the  Merger  Agreement  and  (vi)  the
occurrence  of the Effective Date under the Modified Plan.   Required
regulatory  approvals  and  filings in  connection  with  the  Merger
include approvals of the FERC, the SEC, the Texas Commission, the New
Mexico  Commission,  the  NRC, and filings  with  the  Department  of
Justice  and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

      See  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, NOTE
11  for CSW, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, for a discussion
of regulatory approval process relating to El Paso.

      CSW continues to use its best efforts to consummate the Merger.
At  the  same  time, however, CSW continues to monitor  contingencies
which  may preclude the consummation of the Merger, including without

<PAGE> 1-11
limitation  the potential loss of significant portions of  El  Paso's
service area and significant El Paso customers, including Las  Cruces
and  two  military installations, Holloman Air Force Base  and  White
Sands Missile Range, regulatory risks principally related to approval
of  the Merger and El Paso's request for a rate increase in Texas  as
well  as  the effects of the conditions imposed by federal  or  state
regulatory agencies on the approval of the Merger and operating risks
associated with the ownership of an interest in Palo Verde.

     Based upon El Paso's written response to the concerns identified
in  a  September 12 letter from CSW to El Paso and the failure of  El
Paso to resolve the contingencies set forth above, CSW cannot predict
whether, or if so when, the Merger will be consummated.  In the event
that  the  proposed Merger is not consummated, there may  be  ensuing
litigation  between  El Paso and CSW or among  other  parties  to  El
Paso's bankruptcy proceedings and either or both of El Paso and CSW.

      See  CSW's  ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF
FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Proposed Acquisition
of  El Paso, and CSW's ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA   -  NOTE  11,  Commitments  and  Contingent  Liabilities,   for
additional information related to the proposed El Paso merger.

Competition
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry are
impacting the CSW System and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition facing electric utilities is driven by complex  economic,
political and technological factors.  These factors have resulted  in
legislative and regulatory initiatives that are likely to  result  in
even  greater competition at both the wholesale and retail levels  in
the  future.  As competition in the industry increases, the  Electric
Operating  Companies  will  have the  opportunity  to  seek  out  new
customers  and  at  the same time be at risk of losing  customers  to
competitors.   The  Electric Operating Companies believe  that  their
prices  for  electricity  and the quality and  reliability  of  their
service currently place them in a position to compete effectively  in
the marketplace.

      The Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters  the  way  in  which electric utilities compete.   The  Energy
Policy  Act  creates  exemptions from regulation  under  the  Holding
Company  Act  for  EWGs  and permits utilities, including  registered
holding  companies and non-utilities, to form EWGs.  EWGs are  a  new
category of non-utility wholesale power producers that are free  from
most   federal   and  state  regulation,  including   the   principal
restrictions  of  the Holding Company Act.  These  provisions  enable
broader   participation  in  wholesale  power  markets  by   reducing
regulatory hurdles to such participation.  The Energy Policy Act also
allows   the   FERC,  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  with   certain
restrictions,  to order wholesale transmission access  and  to  order
electric  utilities to enlarge their transmission  systems.   A  FERC
order   requiring   a  transmitting  utility  to  provide   wholesale
transmission  service must include provisions generally  that  permit
(i)  the utility to recover from the FERC applicant all of the  costs
incurred  in connection with the transmission services and  (ii)  any
enlargement  of  the  transmission system  and  associated  services.
While  CSW believes that the Energy Policy Act will continue to  make
the  wholesale markets more competitive, CSW is unable to predict the
extent  to  which  the  Energy  Policy Act  will  impact  CSW  System
operations.

      Wholesale  energy markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric  power, have been extremely competitive since the  enactment
of  the  Energy Policy Act.  The Electric Operating Companies compete
in   the  wholesale  energy  markets  with  other  public  utilities,
cogenerators,  qualified facilities, exempt wholesale generators  and
others for sales of electric power.

      CSW  is  unable to predict the ultimate outcome  or  impact  of
competitive  forces  on  the electric utility  industry  or  the  CSW
System.  As the wholesale and retail electricity markets become  more
competitive,  however,  the principal factor determining  success  is
likely to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability
of capacity, and customer service.

<PAGE> 1-12
CSW, CPL, SWEPCO and WTU
      PURA is the legal foundation for electric utility regulation in
Texas.  PURA will expire on September 1, 1995, in accordance with the
sunset  policy of the Texas Legislature, which applies to  all  state
agencies,  unless the Texas Legislature reenacts PURA in its  current
form  or in modified form.  Several proposals have been made to amend
PURA   which,   among  other  things,  provide  for  a  market-driven
integrated   resource  planning  process,  pricing  flexibility   for
utilities faced with competitive challenges, incentive regulation and
deregulation  of the wholesale bulk power market in  ERCOT.   CSW  is
unable  to  predict the ultimate outcome of the 1995 session  of  the
Texas  Legislature and in particular whether amendments to PURA  will
be adopted.

      In  Texas,  electric service areas are approved  by  the  Texas
Commission.  A given tract in a utility's overall service area may be
singly  certificated  to  a  utility, to  one  of  several  competing
electric  cooperatives or to one of the competing municipal  electric
systems  or,  it  may  be  dually  or triply  certificated  to  these
entities.  These certificated areas have changed only slightly  since
the formation of the Texas Commission in 1976.

CSW and CPL
      CPL  is  generally  singly certificated to  serve  inside  most
municipalities,  and  cooperatives are singly certificated  to  serve
much  of  the  rural  areas.  The suburban areas  are  mostly  dually
certificated.  Since 1990, in dually certificated areas, CPL's  rates
have been higher than some competitors for some customers, especially
small  commercial and industrial customers.  However,  most  business
has  been retained and some new business acquired, primarily  because
of  service  reliability and other customer service advantages.   The
availability  of  low cost natural gas and other  alternative  fuels,
including  those  used in cogeneration facilities, have  resulted  in
some  losses  of  sales.   Although  there  have  been  some  losses,
electricity  is  still the fuel of choice for most  air  conditioning
installations.  Renewable energy such as solar and wind is not now  a
feasible economic choice for customers of CPL in most instances.  CPL
believes  that its rates, the quality and reliability of its  service
and  the relatively inelastic demand for electricity for certain  end
uses  should  allow  it  to  continue to compete  in  current  retail

facing the utility industry.

REGULATION AND RATES

Regulation
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The  CSW System is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC under
the Holding Company Act with respect to the issuance, acquisition and
sale of securities, the acquisition and sale of certain assets or any
interest  in any business and accounting practices and other matters.
The  Holding  Company  Act  generally  limits  the  operations  of  a
registered  holding  company to a single  integrated  public  utility
system,  plus such additional businesses as are functionally  related
to such system.

      The Electric Operating Companies have been classified as public
utilities  under the Federal Power Act and accordingly the  FERC  has
jurisdiction   in  certain  respects  over  their  electric   utility
facilities  and  operations, wholesale rates, and  in  certain  other
matters.

     The Electric Operating Companies are subject to the jurisdiction
of  various  state  commissions  as  to  rates,  accounting  matters,
standards  of  service  and, in some cases, issuance  of  securities,
certification  of facilities and extensions and division  of  service
territory.

<PAGE> 1-13
CPL, SWEPCO and WTU
       The   Texas   Commission  has  jurisdiction   over   accounts,
certification of utility service territory, sales of certain  utility
property,  mergers  and  certain other matters.   Neither  the  Texas
Commission  nor  the governing bodies of incorporated  municipalities
have jurisdiction over the issuance of securities.

CPL
      Ownership  of an interest in a nuclear generating unit  exposes
CPL  and  indirectly  CSW  to  regulation  not  common  to  a  fossil
generating unit.  Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the  Energy
Reorganization   Act  of  1974,  operation  of  nuclear   plants   is
intensively  regulated by the NRC, which has broad  power  to  impose
licensing and safety-related requirements.  Along with other  federal
and state agencies, the NRC also has extensive regulations pertaining
to  the  environmental aspects of nuclear reactors.  The NRC has  the
authority to impose fines and/or shut down a unit until compliance is
achieved,  depending  upon its assessment  of  the  severity  of  the
situation.

      For  a  discussion  of NRC regulation and other  considerations
arising from the ownership of nuclear assets, see NUCLEAR-STP, below.

Other
      See  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS below, for information  relating  to
environmental regulation.

Rates
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
     The retail rates of the Electric Operating Companies are subject
to regulation by the state utility commissions in the states in which
they operate.

CPL, SWEPCO and WTU
     The Texas Commission has original jurisdiction over retail rates
in  the  unincorporated  areas of Texas.   The  governing  bodies  of
incorporated  municipalities have original  jurisdiction  over  rates
within their incorporated limits.  Municipalities may elect, and some
have elected, to surrender this jurisdiction to the Texas Commission.
The  Texas  Commission has appellate jurisdiction over rates  set  by
incorporated municipalities.

PSO
      PSO  is  subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Commission
with   respect  to  retail  prices,  accounts,  issuance  of  certain
securities and certain other matters.

      Pursuant  to  authority  granted  under  RESCTA,  the  Oklahoma
Commission  established  service territorial  boundary  maps  in  all
unincorporated  areas  for  all regulated retail  electric  suppliers
serving  Oklahoma.   In  accordance with RESCTA,  a  retail  electric
supplier  may  not extend retail electric service into the  certified
territory of another supplier, except to serve its own facilities  or
to  serve  a  new customer with an initial full load of 1,000  KW  or
more.   RESCTA provides that when any territory certified to a retail
electric  supplier  or suppliers is annexed and becomes  part  of  an
incorporated city or town, the certification becomes null  and  void.
However,  once established in the annexed territory, a  supplier  may
generally continue to serve within the annexed area.

SWEPCO
      In  Arkansas,  SWEPCO  is subject to the  jurisdiction  of  the
Arkansas Commission as to rates, accounts, standards of service, sale
or acquisition of certain utility property and issuance of securities
by  liens on property located in that state.  In Louisiana, SWEPCO is
subject to the jurisdiction of the Louisiana Commission as to  rates,
accounts  and  standards of service, but not as to  the  issuance  of
securities.   In  Oklahoma, SWEPCO is subject to the jurisdiction  of
the  Oklahoma  Commission  only as to the issuance  of  evidences  of
indebtedness secured by liens on property located in that state.

<PAGE> 1-14
      SWEPCO  has agreements, which have been approved by  the  FERC,
with  all of its wholesale customers under which rates are based upon
an  agreed  cost  of  service  formula.   These  rates  are  adjusted
periodically to reflect the actual cost of providing service.  All of
SWEPCO's contracts with its wholesale customers contain FERC approved
fuel-adjustment provisions that permit it to pass actual  fuel  costs
through to its customers.

Fuel Recovery in Texas
CSW, CPL,  SWEPCO and WTU
      Electric utilities in Texas, including CPL, SWEPCO and WTU, are
not  allowed to make automatic adjustments to recover changes in fuel
costs  from  retail customers.  A utility is allowed to  recover  its
known  or  reasonably  predictable fuel costs through  a  fixed  fuel
factor.   The  Texas  Commission established procedures  that  became
effective  on  May  1,  1993,  subject to certain  transition  rules,
whereby  each utility under its jurisdiction may petition  to  revise
its  fuel  factor every six months according to a specified schedule.
Fuel  factors may also be revised in the case of emergencies or in  a
general  rate  proceeding.  Under the revised procedures,  a  utility
will  remain  subject to the prior rules until after its  first  fuel
reconciliation,  or  in  some instances, a  general  rate  proceeding
including a fuel reconciliation.  To date, the new fuel rule has  not
significantly  changed  the manner in which  the  Electric  Operating
Companies  recover retail fuel costs in Texas.  Fuel factors  are  in
the  nature  of  temporary  rates and  the  utility's  collection  of
revenues by such factors is subject to adjustments at the time  of  a
fuel  reconciliation.  Under the procedures, at the  utility's  semi-
annual  adjustment date, a utility will be required to  petition  the
Texas  Commission  for a surcharge or to make a refund  when  it  has
materially under- or over-collected its fuel costs and projects  that
it  will  continue  to  materially under- or over-collect.   Material
under-  or  over-collections including interest are defined  as  four
percent  of the most recent Texas Commission adopted annual estimated
fuel  cost  for the utility.  A utility does not have to  revise  its
fuel  factor  when  requesting a surcharge  or  refund.   An  interim
emergency  fuel  factor order must be issued by the Texas  Commission
within  30  days after such petition is filed by the utility.   Final
reconciliation  of  fuel  costs  is  made  through  a  reconciliation
proceeding, which may contain a maximum of three years and a  minimum
of  one  year of reconcilable data, and must be filed with the  Texas
Commission no later than six months after the end of the period to be
reconciled.  In addition, a utility must include a reconciliation  of
fuel  costs  in any general rate proceeding regardless  of  the  time
since  its last fuel reconciliation proceeding.  Any fuel costs  that
are  determined unreasonably incurred in a reconciliation  proceeding
are not recoverable from retail customers.

Fuel Recovery in Oklahoma
CSW and PSO
     All KWH sales to PSO's retail customers for 1994 were made under
rates  which  include  a fuel cost adjustment  clause.  Oklahoma  law
requires  that  an examination of PSO's retail fuel  cost  adjustment
clause  be performed annually by the Oklahoma Commission.   The  fuel
cost  adjustment  is  computed for each month on  the  basis  of  the
average  cost  of  fuel consumed in the month.   The  amount  of  any
difference in such cost over or under a base rate is applied on a KWH
basis  and  reflected in adjustments to customers' bills  during  the
second  month  subsequent  to  the  month  in  which  the  difference
occurred.

      The  FUSER  program  for  qualified commercial  and  industrial
customers  and  the  CSF program, for qualified wholesale  customers,
were developed to allow program participants to purchase natural  gas
directly from suppliers, at negotiated prices, to be delivered to and
burned  in PSO's gas-fired power plants, resulting in reduced  prices
because of the low cost spot gas fuel provided.  Under these programs
participants  could deliver sufficient quantities of natural  gas  to
meet 70% of their generation requirements with the remaining 30%  met
with PSO-supplied coal.  The FUSER and CSF programs resulted in lower
electric costs to all classes of PSO's customers.  The FUSER  program
was  canceled effective October 1, 1993 because changing  market  and
supply  conditions eliminated the economic viability of the  program.
The  CSF  program remains in place although no customers participated
in the program during 1994.

<PAGE> 1-15
Fuel Recovery in Louisiana and Arkansas
CSW and SWEPCO
      SWEPCO's  retail  rates currently in effect  in  Louisiana  are
adjusted  based on SWEPCO's cost of fuel in accordance  with  a  fuel
cost  adjustment which is applied to each billing month based on  the
second previous month's average cost of fuel.  Provision for any over-
or  under-recovery of fuel costs is allowed under an  automatic  fuel
clause.

      Under  SWEPCO's fuel adjustment rider currently  in  effect  in
Arkansas, the fuel cost adjustment is applied for each billing  month
on  a  basis which permits SWEPCO to recover the level of  fuel  cost
experienced two months earlier.

Fuel Recovery from Wholesale Customers
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      All  of the Electric Operating Companies' contracts with  their
wholesale  customers contain FERC approved fuel-adjustment provisions
for recovery of fuel costs.

Other
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      In  the  event  that the Electric Operating  Companies  do  not
recover all of their fuel costs under the procedures described above,
such  event  could have a material adverse effect on  the  companies'
results of operations and financial condition.

      See  ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS for CSW, CPL, PSO,  SWEPCO  and
WTU,  and ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA -  NOTE

Litigation  and Regulatory Proceedings, for further information  with
respect  to  rate  proceedings including CPL's  rate  case  and  fuel
reconciliation  proceedings, PSO's rate  proceedings,  SWEPCO's  fuel
reconciliation   proceedings,   WTU's   rate   matters    and    fuel
reconciliation and CPL's and WTU's deferred accounting matters.

NUCLEAR - STP
CSW and CPL
      CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which  is
located near Bay City, Texas.  In addition, HLP, the Project Manager,
owns  30.8%; San Antonio owns 28.0%; and Austin owns 16.0%.  STP Unit
1  was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit 2 was placed  in
service in June 1989.

STP Outage
     From February 1993 until May 1994 STP experienced an unscheduled
outage   which  has  resulted  in  significant  rate  and  regulatory
proceedings involving CPL.

Nuclear Decommissioning
     At the end of STP's service life, decommissioning is expected to
be accomplished using the decontamination method, which is one of the
techniques   acceptable   to  the  NRC.   Using   this   method   the
decontamination activities occur as soon as possible after the end of
plant operations.  Contaminated equipment is cleaned or removed to  a
permanent disposal location and the site is generally returned to its
pre-plant state.

      CPL's  decommissioning  costs are  accrued  and  funded  to  an
external trust over the expected service life of the STP units.   The
existing NRC operating licenses will allow the operation of STP  Unit
1  until 2027, and Unit 2 until 2028.  The accrual is an annual level
cost  based  on  the  estimated  future  cost  to  decommission  STP,
including escalations for expected inflation to the expected time  of
decommissioning and is net of expected earnings on the trust fund.

<PAGE> 1-16
Deferred Accounting
      CPL  was granted deferred accounting for STP Unit 1 and 2 costs
by  Texas Commission orders.  These orders allowed CPL to defer post-
in-service  operating  and  maintenance costs,  including  taxes  and
depreciation, and carrying costs until these costs were reflected  in
retail  rates.  Deferred accounting had an immediate positive  effect
on  net  income  in  the years allowed, but cash  earnings  were  not
increased until rates went into effect reflecting STP in service.

Facilities Notes
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
(a)Some  plants  have the capability of burning oil  in  combination
   with  gas.  Use of oil in facilities primarily designed  to  burn
   gas  results in increased maintenance expense and a reduction  of
   approximately from 5% to 15% in capability.  PSO and WTU have  25

Plants and Properties
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      All  of  the generating plants described above are located  on
land owned by the Electric Operating Companies or jointly with other
participants  in  the  case of jointly owned plants.   The  Electric
Operating   Companies'   electric  transmission   and   distribution
facilities  are mostly located over or under highways,  streets  and
other  public places or property owned by others, for which permits,
grants,   easements  or  licenses  (which  the  Electric   Operating
Companies  believe  to be satisfactory, but without  examination  of
underlying  land  titles) have been obtained.  The principal  plants
and  properties of the Electric Operating Companies are  subject  to
the  liens of the first mortgage indentures under which the Electric
Operating Companies' bonds are issued.

Power Purchases and Sales
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      Various municipalities, electric cooperatives and public  power
authorities  are  served  by the Electric Operating  Companies.   The
Electric  Operating  Companies exchange  power  on  an  emergency  or
economy  basis with various neighboring systems and engage in economy
interchanges with each other. In addition, they contract with certain
suppliers for the purchase or sale of power on a unit capacity basis.

CSW and SWEPCO
      As  part of the negotiations to acquire BREMCO, SWEPCO  entered
into  a  long-term  purchased  power contract  with  Cajun,  BREMCO's
previous full-requirements wholesale supplier.  The contract  covered
the  purchase of energy at a fixed price for 1993 and 1994,  and  the
purchase  of  capacity and energy in subsequent years.  SWEPCO  is  a
member  of  the  Southwest Power Pool and the Western  Systems  Power
Pool.

<PAGE> 1-21
CSW, SWEPCO and WTU
      On  April 4, 1994, the FERC issued an order pursuant to Section
211  of  the Federal Power Act forcing a regional utility to transmit
power  to  Tex-La on behalf of WTU.  The order was one of  the  first
issued  by  FERC under that provision, which was added by the  Energy
Policy  Act  to increase competition in wholesale power markets.   On
December  1,  1994,  the FERC issued an order  requiring  a  regional
utility  to  provide this transmission service at a  cost  which  was
acceptable  to  Tex-La.   The  FERC also ordered  the  same  regional
utility to enter into an interconnection and remote control area load
agreement  with WTU within 30 days.  This agreement was  executed  on
January  3,  1995.  On January 5, 1995, WTU began selling  92  MW  of
power  and  energy  to  Tex-La.  Tex-La has  a  peak  requirement  of
approximately  120 MWs.  WTU will serve Tex-La until  facilities  are
completed  to  connect Tex-La to SWEPCO, at which  time  SWEPCO  will
provide 85 MW and WTU will retain 35 MW of the Tex-La electric load.

CSW and PSO
     In 1989, PSO entered into certain long-term contracts with MCPC,
a  cogeneration development company located in northeastern Oklahoma.
These  contracts  include  (i)  an  Interconnection  and  Interchange
Agreement providing terms and conditions under which MCPC can connect
its  electric generating facilities to PSO's transmission system  and
providing  for  future  transmission by PSO of specified  amounts  of
MCPC's  power to an unaffiliated utility, (ii) a Stock/Asset Purchase
Agreement  which allows PSO under certain conditions to  acquire  the
stock  or  assets  of MCPC, and (iii) an Energy Conversion  Agreement
which  requires PSO to deliver natural gas to MCPC for conversion  to
electrical  energy to be delivered by MCPC to PSO.  Under the  Energy
Conversion  Agreement, MCPC is required to deliver at  least  394,200
MWH  per  year  of  firm energy to PSO.  PSO also has  the  right  to
dispatch up to 60 MWH per hour of quick-start capability.

      PSO  and  MCPC  filed  a joint application  with  the  Oklahoma
Commission  seeking  approval of a September  1992  Letter  Agreement
between  PSO  and  MCPC  which provided for  MCPC  granting  two-year
extensions to the Interconnection and Interchange Agreement  and  the
Energy Conversion Agreement in exchange for PSO not requiring payment
by  MCPC of certain debt and charges related to the Energy Conversion
Agreement.  The Oklahoma Commission Staff subsequently filed its  own
application seeking a review and evaluation of the current  value  to
PSO  of  the  Energy  Conversion  Agreement.   MCPC  also  filed   an
application with the Oklahoma Commission requesting additional relief
through   the   modification  of  the  existing   Energy   Conversion
Agreement.   An  emergency order was issued under MCPC's  application
which  increased the payment made by PSO to MCPC for energy purchases
and  decreased the amount of firm energy MCPC is required to  deliver
to  PSO.  The emergency order is subject to a permanent ruling.   The
application  filed by the Oklahoma Commission Staff was  subsequently
withdrawn.  In December 1993, PSO filed an application with an ALJ to
dismiss  the  case filed by MCPC based on a recent  ruling  from  the
Oklahoma  Supreme Court.  PSO's application to dismiss was denied  by
the  ALJ  and was appealed to the Oklahoma Commission.  PSO's  appeal
was   subsequently   denied.   The  joint  application   and   MCPC's
application are expected to be heard by the second quarter of 1995.

      In July 1993, PSO commenced a lawsuit in the District Court  of
Tulsa  County, Oklahoma, seeking a declaratory judgment that  PSO  is
entitled to terminate the Energy Conversion Agreement as of August 1,
1993, because of a default committed by MCPC.  In November 1993,  the
Court  granted judgment in favor of MCPC on grounds that the Oklahoma
Commission had exclusive jurisdiction of the case and also  that  PSO
had  contractually waived its cause of action.  PSO has appealed  the
Court's  ruling  to  the Oklahoma Supreme Court, where  the  case  is
pending.

SWEPCO
      SWEPCO furnishes energy at wholesale to two municipalities  and
also   supplies  electric  energy  at  wholesale  to  eight  electric
cooperatives  operating  in its territory through  NTEC,  Tex-La  and
Rayburn Country.  SWEPCO also sells power to AECC and Cajun on an as-
available basis.

<PAGE> 1-22
WTU
     WTU provides wholesale electricity to four electric cooperatives
and one municipality for all their electric energy requirements.  WTU
also  provides  wholesale power to eight other electric cooperatives,
one  other municipal customer and one investor owned electric utility
company.   WTU's  contractual  obligations  with  thirteen   of   its
wholesale customers require a five year notice of termination,  while
one wholesale customer has a three year notice period and another has
a fifteen year obligation.

System Interconnections
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The  CSW  System operates on an interstate basis to  facilitate
exchanges of power.  PSO and WTU are interconnected through  the  200
MW  North HVdc Tie.  In August 1992, SWEPCO and CPL entered  into  an
agreement with HLP and TU to construct and operate an East Texas HVdc
transmission interconnection which will facilitate exchanges of power
for  the CSW System.  This interconnection will consist of a back-to-
back  HVdc converter station and 16 miles of 345 KV transmission line
connecting transmission substations at SWEPCO's Welsh Power Plant and
TU's  Monticello  Power Plant.  In March 1993, an application  for  a
Certificate  of  Convenience  and  Necessity  for  the   transmission
interconnection was approved by the Texas Commission.   This  600  MW
project is scheduled to be completed in mid-1995.

      CPL  and WTU are members of ERCOT, which also includes TU, HLP,
Texas  Municipal  Power  Agency, Texas Municipal  Power  Pool,  Lower
Colorado  River  Authority, the municipal  systems  of  San  Antonio,
Austin   and  Brownsville,  the  South  Texas  and  Medina   Electric
Cooperatives,   and   several   other  interconnected   systems   and
cooperatives.  The ERCOT members interchange power and  energy  on  a
firm, economy and emergency basis.

Seasonality
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
     Sales of electricity by the Electric Operating Companies tend to
increase during warmer summer months and, to a lesser extent,  cooler
winter  months,  because of higher demand for power for  cooling  and
heating purposes.

Franchises
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The  Electric  Operating Companies hold franchises  to  provide
electric  service in various municipalities in their  service  areas.
These   franchises  have  varying  provisions  and  expiration  dates
including,  in  some cases, termination and buy-out provisions.   CSW
considers the Electric Operating Companies' franchises to be adequate
for the conduct of their business.

Employees
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
     At December 31, 1994, CSW had 8,055 employees, as follows:

         CSWS                     1,070
         CPL                      1,933

<PAGE> 1-23
      Approximately 600 employees at PSO and 700 employees at  SWEPCO
are  covered  under collective bargaining agreements with  the  IBEW.
CSW  implemented  a restructuring plan in 1994 which  resulted  in  a
reduction of approximately 7% of the CSW System work force.

      Information in the foregoing tables is subject to change as  a
result  of  change  in  the  underlying  assumptions  from  numerous
factors,   including  the  rate  of  load  growth,   escalation   of
construction   costs,  changes  in  lead  times  in   manufacturing,
inflation,   the   availability  and  pricing  of  alternatives   to
construction,  and  nuclear,  environmental  and  other  regulation,
delays from regulatory hearings, the adequacy of rate relief and the

<PAGE> 1-30
availability  of necessary external capital.  Changes in  these  and
other factors could cause each respective Electric Operating Company
to  defer  or accelerate construction or to sell or buy more  power,
which  would  affect its cash position, revenues and  income  to  an
extent that cannot now be reliably predicted.

      In  addition,  increasing competition in the electric  utility
industry  may  have an impact on the construction  programs  of  the
Electric Operating Companies.  Traditionally, the Electric Operating
Companies  have made investments in their utility systems,  filed  a
rate  case  to seek recovery of their operating and other costs  and
sought  to  earn  a  rate of return on their assets  in  rate  base.
Competition in the utility industry, however, is likely to  lead  to
an  increasing need to stabilize or reduce rates.  At the same time,
the  retail  regulatory  environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from
traditional  rate base regulation to incentive and performance-based
regulation which are intended to encourage efficiency and  increased
productivity in lieu of traditional ratemaking formulas.   In  light
of   the   trend  toward  competition  and  away  from   traditional
ratemaking, the CSW System will periodically reevaluate its  capital
spending policies and generally seek to fund only those construction
projects  and  investments  that  management  believes  will   offer
satisfactory  returns in the current environment.   Consistent  with
this  strategy,  the  CSW  System is  likely  to  continue  to  make
additional investments in non-utility businesses.

      CSW continues to study ways to reduce or meet future increases
in  customer demand, including demand-side management programs,  new
and  efficient electric technologies, construction of various  types
and  sizes of generation facilities, increasing the availability  or
efficiency  of existing generation facilities, reducing transmission
and   distribution  losses,  and  where  feasible  and   economical,
acquisition  of  reliable long-term capacity from  other  suppliers.
The  public utility commissions in some of the jurisdictions  served
by  the  Electric Operating Companies may consider on a case-by-case
basis   mechanisms  to  permit  recovery  of  costs  of  demand-side
management  programs  and  a return on the related  investment  from
ratepayers.

      The  CSW  System facilities plan indicates that CSW  will  not
require substantial additions of generating capacity until the  year
2001 or beyond.

      See ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  -  Liquidity  and   Capital
Resources,  Capital Expenditures for each registrant, for additional
information with respect to construction expenditures and financing.

Natural Gas
CSW
      The  Electric  Operating Companies purchase their  gas  from  a
number   of   suppliers  operating  in  and  around   their   service
territories.   In  1994, approximately 48% of the Electric  Operating
Companies'  total  gas purchases were made under long-term  contracts
and  approximately  52%  came  from  short-term  contracts  and  spot
purchases.

CSW and CPL
     CPL's eight gas-fired electric generating plants are supplied by
a   portfolio  of  long-term  and  short-term  natural  gas  purchase
agreements   through   multiple   natural   gas   pipeline   systems.
Approximately  68%  of  CPL's total gas  requirements  in  1994  were
purchased  under  long-term arrangements representing  both  purchase
obligations  and discretionary purchases, with the balance  of  CPL's
requirements  being acquired under short-term arrangements  from  the
spot  market.   CPL's principal gas supplies for 1994  were  provided

<PAGE> 1-32
under  agreements  with  Corpus Christi  Gas  Marketing,  L.P.,  Onyx
Pipeline  Company,  Enron  Corporation, or  their  affiliates.   They
supplied approximately 25%, 13% and 10%, respectively, of CPL's total
natural gas purchases.

CSW and PSO
      PSO  engages  in  a program to maintain adequate  gas  supplies
necessary  for operation.  Natural gas for generation is provided  by
purchases  under  a  number of long-term and spot  market  contracts.
Approximately 60% of PSO's natural gas requirements were provided for
under  firm contracts.  Transok acts as an administrator with respect
to  purchases of natural gas supplies.  Gas is transported by Transok
to PSO facilities under agreements pursuant to which PSO pays Transok
for actual costs incurred in providing the services as determined  on
an  allocated  cost of service basis, including a rate of  return  on
equity  applicable between affiliates as specified  by  the  Oklahoma
Commission in PSO's most recent Oklahoma price review.  See  ITEM  8.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - CSW's NOTE 10 and PSO's
NOTE   8,   Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for   further
information with respect to such agreements between PSO and Transok.

CSW and SWEPCO
      In  1994,  SWEPCO  purchased approximately  99.5%  of  its  gas
requirements pursuant to spot purchase contracts with no  take-or-pay
obligations.   The  remaining 0.5% of SWEPCO's 1994 gas  requirements
came  from  a long-term take-or-pay contract which was terminated  in
January  1994.   SWEPCO  plans to continue to enter  into  short-term
contracts with various suppliers to provide gas for peaking purposes.

CSW and WTU
      WTU  has  gas  purchase contracts with several suppliers.   The
largest  long-term  contract,  which  is  with  Lone  Star,  provided
approximately 13% of WTU's total gas requirements in 1994.  Lone Star
is  obligated, except during curtailments, to have gas available  for
125%  of the estimated annual fuel requirements of each plant served,
provided  the  total  of  all plants does  not  exceed  110%  of  the
estimated  annual  fuel requirement.  The Lone Star  contract,  which
expires in 2000, allows WTU considerable flexibility to purchase  gas
from  other  sources.   Utilizing  this  flexibility  in  1994,   WTU
purchased  approximately  68% of its gas  requirements  on  the  spot
market  from  many different suppliers.  The remaining 19%  of  WTU's
1994  gas  requirements came from supplemental  firm  contracts  with
several suppliers.  The contracts with suppliers vary in their terms,
but generally provide for periodic or other price adjustments.

Coal and Lignite
CSW
      The Electric Operating Companies purchase coal from a number of
suppliers.   In  1994,  approximately 82% of the  Electric  Operating
Companies'  total  coal  purchases  were  supplied  under   long-term
contract with the balance procured on the spot market.  The coal  for
the  CSW System plants comes primarily from Wyoming or Colorado mines
which  are  located  between  1,000 and 1,500  rail  miles  from  the
generating plants.

Proposed Railroad Merger
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      In  October 1994, Burlington Northern Railroad Company and  the
Atchison,  Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company filed  an  application
with  the  Interstate Commerce Commission to merge the two railroads.
These  railroads  currently  compete  for  a  portion  of  the   coal
transportation traffic to CPL's Coleto Creek power plant.  Because of
the  potential elimination of such competition and other factors, CPL
and  the other Electric Operating Companies may be adversely affected
by  this merger, if approved, unless conditions mitigating the impact
are included in the merger.

Oklaunion
CSW, CPL, PSO and WTU
      The jointly-owned Oklaunion plant is supplied coal under a coal
supply  contract  with  Exxon expiring in 2006.   This  contract  was
amended  and  restated in December 1993 as part of  a  settlement  of
litigation  with Exxon.  In November 1994, Caballo Coal  Company,  an

<PAGE> 1-33
affiliate of Peabody Holding Company, Inc., purchased Exxon's Rawhide
and  Caballo  mines in Wyoming, the sources of the Exxon  coal.   The
long-term coal supply contract has subsequently been transferred from
Exxon to Caballo Coal Company.

      Approximately 67% of the total 1994 Oklaunion coal requirements
for  CPL,  70% for PSO and 71% for WTU were supplied under the  Exxon
contract with the balance procured on the spot market.

     CPL's share of the year-end 1994 coal inventory at Oklaunion was
approximately 46,000 tons, representing approximately 60 days supply.
PSO's share was approximately 95,000 tons, representing approximately
21   days  supply.   WTU's  share  was  approximately  250,000  tons,
representing approximately 55 days supply.

       All   coal   used  at  the  Oklaunion  plant  is   transported
approximately  1,100  miles to the plant by the  Burlington  Northern
Railroad Company pursuant to a coal transportation contract which  is
projected to expire during late 1995.  The coal is transported  under
this  contract  in Burlington Northern supplied rail cars.   WTU  has
instituted  a  rate proceeding at the Interstate Commerce  Commission
requesting a reasonable rate for rail transportation of coal  to  the
Oklaunion plant, pursuant to filed tariffs, after expiration  of  the
Burlington Northern contract.

Coleto Creek
CSW and CPL
      At  Coleto Creek, the long-term agreement expiring in 1999 with
Colowyo   Coal  Company  provided  approximately  60%  of  the   coal
requirements  of the plant for 1994.  CPL's purchase  obligation  set
forth  in  the  Colowyo agreement for 1995 and through  1999  is  for
approximately 25% of Coleto Creek's requirements.  The coal is  mined
in northwestern Colorado and is transported approximately 1,400 miles
under  long-term  rail agreements with Denver &  Rio  Grande  Western
Railroad  Company, the Burlington Northern Railroad Company  and  the
Southern   Pacific   Transportation   Company.    Southern    Pacific
Transportation Company is currently the only rail carrier with access
to  the  Coleto  Creek  plant.   The  balance  of  the  Coleto  Creek
requirements  are currently being procured on the spot  market.   CPL
owns  sufficient railcars for operation of three unit trains and  has
negotiated contracts with the rail carriers involved which have  been
filed   with   the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission.    CPL's   rail
transportation contracts for Coleto Creek expire December  31,  1995.
CPL has instituted a proceeding at the Interstate Commerce Commission
requesting  a  reasonable rate for the 16 mile movement  from  Coleto
Creek  to  Victoria, Texas, a destination served by Missouri  Pacific
Railroad  Company.  After 1995, CPL intends to utilize coal from  the
Powder River Basin of Wyoming for a portion of the Coleto Creek plant
requirements and intends to negotiate rail transportation  agreements
for  such coal.  At year-end 1994, CPL had approximately 290,000 tons
of  coal in inventory at Coleto Creek, representing approximately  43
days supply.

Northeastern Station
CSW and PSO
      PSO  has  a  contract with Kerr-McGee Coal  Corporation,  which
substantially  covers the coal supply for PSO's Northeastern  Station
coal  units through at least 2007, with approximately 11% of the 1994
requirements purchased on the spot market.  Coal delivery is by  unit
trains  from  mines  located  in the Gillette,  Wyoming  vicinity,  a
distance  of  about 1,100 rail miles from Northeastern Station.   PSO
owns  sufficient  rail  cars and spares for  operation  of  six  unit
trains.  Coal is transported to Northeastern Station pursuant to long-
term  contracts  with  Burlington Northern and the  Missouri  Pacific
Railroad  Company which have been filed with the Interstate  Commerce
Commission.  In some years, including 1994, a portion of the coal has
been   transported  pursuant  to  short-term  contracts  with   other
carriers.   Burlington Northern has disputed PSO's right to transport
coal  at Northeastern Station utilizing other carriers.  This dispute
is  the  subject  of  pending  litigation.   See  ITEM  8.  FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  AND  SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - CSW NOTE  10  and  PSO  NOTE  8,

<PAGE> 1-34
Litigation  and  Regulatory Proceedings for further  discussion.   At
year-end  1994,  PSO  had  approximately  529,000  tons  of  coal  in
inventory at Northeastern representing approximately 50 days supply.

CSW and SWEPCO
     The long-term supply for SWEPCO's Welsh plant and its 50 percent-
owned Flint Creek plant is provided under a contract with AMAX.   The
current  contract,  executed  in  December  1993,  replaced  a  prior
contract  between the parties as part of a settlement  of  litigation
concerning the prior contract.  The settlement has resulted in  lower
fuel costs to the Welsh and Flint Creek plants.  Approximately 99% of
the  total  1994 Flint Creek coal requirements and 94% of  the  total
1994  Welsh  coal requirements were supplied under the AMAX  contract
with the balance purchased on the spot market.

      Coal under the AMAX contract is mined near Gillette, Wyoming, a
distance of about 1,500 and 1,100 miles, respectively, from the Welsh
and  Flint Creek plants.  This coal is delivered to the plants  under
rail transportation contracts with Burlington Northern and the Kansas
City  Southern Railroad Company.  These contracts will expire between
2001  and  2007.   SWEPCO  owns  or  leases  under  long-term  leases
sufficient  cars  and  spares for operation of  twelve  unit  trains.
SWEPCO  has  supplemented its railcar fleet from time  to  time  with
short-term leases.  At December 31, 1994, SWEPCO had coal inventories
of  1,199,000 tons at Welsh representing 53 days supply  and  552,000
tons at Flint Creek representing 80 days supply.

      SWEPCO  has  acquired lignite leases covering an  aggregate  of
about  27,000  acres  near the Henry W. Pirkey power  plant.   Sabine
Mining  Company is the contract miner of these reserves.  At December
31,  1994,  322,000 tons of lignite were in inventory  at  the  plant
representing 33 days supply.

      Another  25,000 acres are jointly leased in equal  portions  by
SWEPCO  and  CLECO  in the Dolet Hills area of Louisiana  near  Dolet
Hills  Power  Plant.  The Dolet Hills Mining Venture is the  contract
miner  for these reserves.  At December 31, 1994, SWEPCO had  240,000
tons  of  lignite  in  inventory at the plant  representing  58  days
supply.

      In  the opinion of the management of SWEPCO, the acreage  under
lease  in  these  areas  contains sufficient reserves  to  cover  the
anticipated  lignite requirements for the estimated useful  lives  of
the lignite-fired plants.

Nuclear Fuel
CSW and CPL
      The  supply  of fuel for STP involves a complex process.   This
process   includes  the  acquisition  of  uranium  concentrate,   the
conversion  of  uranium  concentrate  to  uranium  hexafluoride,  the
enrichment  of  uranium  hexafluoride in the  isotope  U235  and  the
fabrication  of the enriched uranium into fuel rods and incorporation
of fuel rods into fuel assemblies.  The fuel assemblies are the final
product loaded into the reactor core.  The time associated with  this
process  requires  fuel decisions be made years  in  advance  of  the
actual  need  to refuel the reactor.  Fuel requirements for  STP  are
being   handled  by  the  STP  Management  Committee,  comprised   of
representatives of all participants in STP.

       Outages  are  necessary  approximately  every  18  months  for
refueling.  Because STP's fuel costs are significantly lower than any
of  the other CPL units, CPL's average fuel costs are expected to  be
higher whenever an STP unit is down for refueling or maintenance.

      CPL  and the other STP participants have entered into contracts
with   suppliers  for  uranium  concentrate  and  conversion  service
sufficient  for the operation of both STP units through 1996.   Also,
flexible  uranium concentrate and uranium hexafluoride contracts  are
in  place to provide approximately 50% of the uranium needed for  STP
from 1997 to 2000.  Enrichment contracts have been secured for a  30-
year  period  from  the  initial operation  of  each  unit  with  the
exception  of the period from October of 2000 to September  of  2002.
The  STP  participants canceled the enrichment requirements for  such
period  under  a  ten  year  no  cost termination  provision  in  the

<PAGE> 1-35
enrichment contract.  The STP participants believe that other, lower-
cost options will be available in the future.  Also, fuel fabrication
services have been contracted for operation through 2005 for  Unit  1
and  2006  for Unit 2.  Although CPL and the other STP owners  cannot
predict the availability of uranium and related services, CPL and the
other STP owners do not currently expect to have difficulty obtaining
uranium and related services required for the remaining years of  STP
operations.

      The  Energy  Policy Act has provisions for the  recovery  of  a
portion  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  decommissioning   and
decontamination  of  the  gaseous  diffusion  plants  used   in   the
enrichment process.  These costs are being recovered on the basis  of
enrichment  services purchased by utilities from  the  DOE  prior  to
October  of  1992.   The  total annual assessment  for  all  domestic
utilities  is  limited to $150 million per federal  fiscal  year  and
assessable  for  15 years.  The STP assessment will be  approximately
$2.0 million each year with CPL's share being 25.2% of the annual STP
assessment.

      The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires  the
DOE to develop a permanent high level waste disposal facility for the
storage  of  spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  The DOE recently  announced
that  the  permanent facility will not be available until 2010.   The
DOE will be taking possession of all spent fuel generated at STP as a
result of a contract CPL and other STP participants have entered into
with the DOE.  STP has on-site storage facilities with the capability
to  store all the spent nuclear fuel generated by the STP units  over
their  life.   Therefore,  the DOE delay in  providing  the  disposal
facility  will  not  impact the operation of the  STP  units.   Under
provisions  of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1992, a  one-mill  per
KWH  assessment  on  electricity  generated  and  sold  from  nuclear
reactors funds the DOE waste disposal program.

     Risks of substantial liability could arise from the operation of
STP  and  from  the use, handling, disposal and possible  radioactive
emissions associated with nuclear fuel.  While CPL carries insurance,
the  availability,  amount and coverage thereof is  limited  and  may
become  more limited in the future.  The available insurance may  not
cover  all  types  or  amounts  of  loss  or  expense  which  may  be
experienced in connection with the ownership of STP.

      See  ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Fuel and Purchased  Power  for
information relating to coal contract litigation.

Governmental Regulation
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The  price and availability of each of the foregoing fuel types
are  significantly affected by governmental regulation. Any inability
in  the  future  to  obtain  adequate fuel supplies  or  adoption  of
additional regulatory measures restricting the use of such fuels  for
the  generation of electricity might affect the CSW System's  ability
to economically meet the needs of its customers and could require the
Electric  Operating  Companies to supplement  or  replace,  prior  to
normal  retirement, existing generating capability with  units  using
other  fuels.  This would be impossible to accomplish quickly,  would
require  substantial  additional expenditures  for  construction  and
could  have a significant adverse effect on CSW's and/or the Electric
Operating Companies' financial condition and results of operations.

Future Cost of Fuel
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
The registrants are unable to predict the future cost of fuel.

      See  ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Rates and Regulatory  Matters
for each registrant, for further information concerning fuel costs.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The Operating Companies and CSWE are subject to regulation with
respect to air and water quality and solid waste standards and  other
environmental   matters   by  various  federal,   state   and   local
authorities. These authorities have continuing jurisdiction  in  most
cases  to require modifications  in the Electric Operating Companies'
facilities  and  operations.  Changes in  environmental  statutes  or
regulations  could  require  substantial additional  expenditures  to
modify  the  Electric Operating Companies' facilities and  operations
and  could  have  a  significant adverse effect  on  CSW's  and  each
Electric  Operating  Companies' results of operations  and  financial
condition.   Violations of environmental statutes or regulations  can
result in fines and other costs.

Air Quality
Clean Air Act Amendments
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      Air  quality standards and emission limitations are subject  to
the  jurisdiction of state regulatory authorities in  each  state  in
which  the  CSW  System  operates, with oversight  by  the  EPA.   In
accordance  with regulations of these state authorities, permits  are
required  for all generating units on which construction is commenced
or  which are substantially modified after the effective date of  the
applicable regulations.  None of the Electric Operating Companies has
received  notice from any federal or state government agency alleging
that  it currently is subject to an enforcement action for a material
violation  of  existing  federal or state air  quality  and  emission
regulations.

      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the  year 2000, the Electric Operating Companies will be required  to
hold  allowances  in order to emit sulfur dioxide.   The  EPA  issues
allowances to owners of existing generating units based on historical
operating  conditions.  Based on the CSW System facilities plan,  CSW
believes  that  the  Electric  Operating  Companies'  allowances  are
adequate  to  meet  their needs at least through  2008.   Public  and
private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.  CSW
and  the Electric Operating Companies presently have no intention  of
engaging  in  trading of allowances, but may seek to  do  so  in  the
future  if  market  conditions  warrant  and  appropriate  regulatory
approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.

      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and require government studies  to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission regulations, and the air toxics study, will have on CSW  and
the Electric Operating Companies cannot be determined at this time.

      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  CSW
expects   to  spend  $4  million  for  annual  testing  of,  software
modifications  to, and maintenance of continuous emission  monitoring
equipment from 1995 through 1997.

<PAGE> 1-38
CSW, CPL and WTU
      Air  quality standards and emission limitations are subject  to
the  jurisdiction  of  the  TNRCC, with oversight  by  the  EPA.   In
accordance  with regulations of the TNRCC, permits are  required  for
all  generating units on which construction is commenced or which are
substantially  modified after the effective date  of  the  applicable
regulations.  CPL and WTU have not received notice from  any  federal
or  state government agency alleging that they currently are  subject
to an enforcement action for a material violation of existing federal
or state air quality and emission regulations.

CSW and CPL
      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  CPL
expects  to  spend approximately $1.3 million for annual testing  of,
software  modifications  to, and maintenance of  continuous  emission
monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

CSW and PSO
      Air  quality standards and emission limitations are subject  to
the  jurisdiction of ODEQ, with oversight by the EPA.  In  accordance
with  regulations  of ODEQ, permits are required for  all  generating
units  on  which construction is commenced or which are substantially
modified after the effective date of the applicable regulations.  PSO
has  not received notice from any federal or state government  agency
alleging that it currently is subject to an enforcement action for  a
material  violation  of  existing federal or state  air  quality  and
emission  regulations.  As a result of requirements  imposed  by  the
Clean  Air  Act, PSO expects to spend approximately $1.3 million  for
annual  testing  of,  software modifications to, and  maintenance  of
continuous emission monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

CSW and SWEPCO
      Air  quality standards and emission limitations are subject  to
the  jurisdiction of the ADPCE in Arkansas, the LDEQ in Louisiana and
the  TNRCC  in Texas, with oversight by the EPA.  In accordance  with
regulations  of the ADPCE, LDEQ and TNRCC, permits are  required  for
all  generating units on which construction is commenced or which are
substantially  modified after the effective date  of  the  applicable
regulations.   SWEPCO  has not received notice from  any  federal  or
state  government agency alleging that it currently is subject to  an
enforcement  action for a material violation of existing  federal  or
state  air  quality  and  emission  regulations.   As  a  result   of
requirements  imposed by the Clean Air Act, SWEPCO expects  to  spend
approximately   $1.3   million  for  annual  testing   of,   software
modifications  to, and maintenance of continuous emission  monitoring
equipment from 1995 through 1997.

CSW and WTU
      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  WTU
expects  to  spend approximately $0.5 million for annual testing  of,
software  modifications  to, and maintenance of  continuous  emission
monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

Transok
      Transok's  compressor engines and other  emission  sources  are
subject  to  air  permit requirements, including  monitoring.   As  a
result  of  new  requirements  under the  Clean  Air  Act,  seven  of
Transok's   facilities   will  be  subject   to   additional   permit
requirements.  The Clean Air Act may also impose additional  enhanced
monitoring requirements on these seven facilities.

Water Quality
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO  and WTU
      The ADPCE, LDEQ, ODEQ, TNRCC and the EPA have jurisdiction over
all  wastewater discharges into state waters.  These authorities have
jurisdiction  for  establishing water quality standards  and  issuing
waste  control  permits covering discharges which  might  affect  the
quality of state waters.  The EPA has jurisdiction over point  source
discharges  through  the  National  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination
System  provisions of the Clean Water Act.  CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and  WTU

<PAGE> 1-39
have  not received notice from any federal or state government agency
alleging that they currently are subject to an enforcement action for
a   material  violation  of  existing  federal  or  state  wastewater
discharge regulations.

RCRA, CERCLA and Related Matters
RCRA
CSW, CPL, PSO, SWEPCO and WTU
      The  RCRA and the Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas solid
waste  rules  provide for comprehensive control of all  solid  wastes
from  generation to final disposal.  The appropriate state regulatory
authorities  in  the  states in which the CSW  System  operates  have
received  authorization  from the EPA to administer  the  RCRA  solid
waste  control  program for their respective  states.   None  of  the
Electric Operating Companies has received notice from any federal  or
state  government agency alleging that it currently is subject to  an
enforcement  action for a material violation of existing  federal  or
state solid waste regulations.

CERCLA
      The  operations of the CSW System, like those of other  utility
systems, generally involve the use and disposal of substances subject
to   environmental  laws.   CERCLA,  the  federal  "Superfund"   law,
addresses  the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances.
Superfund  requires  that PRPs fund remedial  actions  regardless  of
fault  or  the  legality of past disposal activities.   PRPs  include
owners  and  operators of contaminated sites and transporters  and/or
generators  of hazardous substances.  Many states have similar  laws.
Theoretically,  any one PRP can be held responsible  for  the  entire
cost  of  a cleanup.  Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated
among PRPs.

      CSW's  subsidiaries incur significant costs for  the  handling,
transportation,  storage and disposal of hazardous and  non-hazardous
waste materials.  Unit costs for waste classified as hazardous exceed
by  a  substantial  margin unit costs for waste  classified  as  non-
hazardous waste.

      The  Electric Operating Companies are also subject  to  various
pending  claims  alleging that they are PRPs under federal  or  state
remedial   laws  for  investigating  and  cleaning  up   contaminated
property.    CSW   anticipates  that  resolution  of  these   claims,
individually  or  in the aggregate, will not have a material  adverse
effect  on  CSW's  consolidated results of  operations  or  financial
condition.   Although  the reasons for this expectation  differ  from
site  to  site,  factors that are the basis for the  expectation  for
specific  sites  are  the  volume  and/or  type  of  waste  allegedly
contributed  by the Electric Operating Company, the estimated  amount
of  costs  allocated  to  the  Electric  Operating  Company  and  the
participation of other parties.

     The Electric Operating Companies, like other electric utilities,
produce  combustion and other generation by-products, such as sludge,
slag,  low-level  radioactive  waste and  spent  nuclear  fuel.   The
Electric  Operating  Companies own distribution  poles  treated  with
creosote  or  related  substances.  The EPA  currently  exempts  coal
combustion   by-products  from  regulation   as   hazardous   wastes.
Distribution  poles treated with creosote or similar  substances  are
not  expected to exhibit characteristics that would cause them to  be
hazardous  waste.  In connection with their operations, the  Electric
Operating  Companies  also  have used asbestos,  PCBs  and  materials
classified  as hazardous waste.  If additional by-products  or  other
materials  generated  or used by companies in  the  CSW  System  were
reclassified  as hazardous wastes, or other new laws  or  regulations
concerning  hazardous wastes or other materials were put  in  effect,
CSW  System  disposal  and remedial costs could increase  materially.
The  EPA is expected to issue new regulations stating whether certain
other materials will be classified as hazardous.

Sol Lynn Superfund Site
CSW and CPL
      The Sol Lynn salvage yard was declared a Superfund site by  the
EPA  after it was found to contain a number of contaminants including
PCBs.   Gulf  States  Utilities  Company  remediated  the  site   for
approximately  $2 million and is trying to recover a portion  of  the
remediation costs from alleged PRPs, including CPL.  CPL believes its

<PAGE> 1-40
liability, if any, would be as a deminimus party.  CPL is negotiating
with Gulf States Utilities Company to determine its share, if any, of
remediation costs.

Industrial Road and Industrial Metals Site
CSW and CPL
      Several lawsuits relating to the industrial road and industrial
metal site in Corpus Christi, Texas,  naming CPL as a  defendant, are
currently pending in federal and  state court in  Texas.  Plaintiffs'
claims allege  property  damage  and clean-up  activities.  Although
management cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, based on the
defenses  that  management believes are available to CPL,  management
believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not  have
a  material adverse effect on CSW's or CPL's results of operations or
financial condition.

Rose Chemical Site
CSW, SWEPCO and WTU
      SWEPCO  and  WTU were named PRPs in the clean-up  of  the  Rose
Chemical Site, in Missouri, along with 750 other companies.  A clean-
up  fund  was  established through payments by PRPs who agreed  to  a
"buyout  settlement," and the site remediation was  undertaken.   The
site  buildings  were  removed and the grounds cleaned  to  standards
acceptable  to the EPA.  The site remediation is virtually  completed
and  the court settlement became final in July 1994.  Remaining costs
are  expected  to  be covered by the previously collected  funds  and
there should be no further costs to either SWEPCO or WTU.

B&B Salvage Site
CSW, SWEPCO and WTU
      SWEPCO  and  WTU are also PRPs at the B&B Salvage  site.   This
site,  located  in  Missouri, received  scrap  metal  from  the  Rose
Chemical  firm.   The B&B site has been remediated and  SWEPCO's  and
WTU's  share of cleaning up this site and the Rose Chemical  site  is
not  expected to have a material effect on CSW's, SWEPCO's, or  WTU's
results of operations or financial condition.

PCB Litigation
CSW and PSO
     PSO has been named a defendant in complaints filed in federal and
state courts of Oklahoma in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1993.  The complaints
allege,  among  other  things, that some of  the  plaintiffs  and  the
property  of  other plaintiffs were contaminated with PCBs  and  other
toxic  by-products following certain incidents, including  transformer
malfunctions  in  April 1982, December 1983 and May  1984.   To  date,
complaints representing approximately $736 million of claims, including
compensatory   and   punitive    damages,   have   been    dismissed,
certain  of  which resulted from settlements among the  parties.   The
settlements  did  not  have a significant effect  on  CSW's  or  PSO's
consolidated  results  of operations.  Remaining complaints  currently
total approximately $395 million, of which approximately one-third  is
for   punitive  damages.   Discovery  with  regard  to  the  remaining
complaints continues.  Management cannot predict the outcome of  these
proceedings.   However, management believes that PSO has  defenses  to
these  complaints  and  intends to pursue them vigorously.   Moreover,
management  has reason to believe that PSO's insurance may cover  some
of  the claims.  Management also believes that the ultimate resolution
of the remaining complaints will not have a material adverse effect on
CSW's  or  PSO's  consolidated  results  of  operations  or  financial
condition.

PCB Storage Facilities
CSW and PSO
      PSO investigated and identified PCB contamination at one of its
PCB  storage  facilities in Sand Springs, Oklahoma.  PSO made  proper
notification  to  the EPA of the contamination  that  was  caused  by
spills  prior to PCB spill regulations.  PSO negotiated a remediation
plan  with  the  EPA.  Remediation began in November  1994,  and  the
remediation  costs  are estimated to be $210,000.   As  part  of  the
remediation  plan,  the  EPA has requested PSO  to  sample  the  land
surrounding the PCB storage building site.  The land will include  an
active PSO substation and an industrial area that is privately owned.

<PAGE> 1-41
The extent of any PCB contamination has not been determined on either
site.

Compass Industries Superfund Site
CSW and PSO
      PSO  has  received notice from the EPA that it is a  PRP  under
CERCLA  and may be required to share in the reimbursement of  cleanup
costs  for  the  Compass Industries Superfund  site  which  has  been
remediated.   PSO  has been named defendant in  a  lawsuit  filed  in
Federal  District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August  29,  1994,  for
reimbursement  of the clean-up cost.  The range of  PSO's  degree  of
responsibility,  if  any,  as  a  de  minimis  party  appears  to  be
insignificant.  Management believes the ultimate resolution  of  this
matter  will  not have a material adverse effect on  CSW's  or  PSO's
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Alleged Coal Gasification Plant in McAlester, Oklahoma
CSW and PSO
     PSO has been notified by the EPA of the identification of a coal
gasification plant in McAlester, Oklahoma.  The EPA requested PSO  to
identify  all  properties  owned by PSO  currently  and  formerly  in
McAlester that had been once owned by a non-affiliated company.   PSO
has  submitted the information to the EPA.  PSO has not been able  to
locate  the  alleged coal gasification plant in McAlester,  Oklahoma.
PSO has had no further contact with the EPA regarding this issue.

USI Site
CSW and PSO
     PSO has been identified by the ADPCE as a PRP at the USI site in
Pine  Bluff,  Arkansas.  In 1993, the ADPCE asked PSO to  provide  it
with information regarding any transactions between USI and PSO since
1973  that involved hazardous substances.  Based on a review  of  its
records,  PSO's environmentally related transactions  with  USI  were
limited  to  USI's  provision of oil recycling  services  to  PSO  at
property  owned  by  PSO, not at the USI site.  As  a  result,  PSO's
degree  of  responsibility, if any, at the USI  site  appears  to  be
insignificant.

Coal Mine Reclamation
CSW and PSO
    In August 1994, PSO received approval from the Wyoming Department
of  Environmental  Quality to begin reclamation of  a  coal  mine  in
Sheridan,  Wyoming owned by Ash Creek Mining Company, a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of PSO.  Ash Creek Mining Company recorded a  $3  million
liability  in  1993  for  the  estimated reclamation  costs.   Actual
reclamation work is expected to commence in mid-1995, with completion
estimated  in  late 1996.  Surveillance monitoring will continue  for
ten  years after final reclamation.  Management believes the ultimate
resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect  on
CSW's  or  PSO's  consolidated results  of  operations  or  financial
condition.

Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas
CSW and SWEPCO
      SWEPCO  owns  a  suspected former MGP site in Marshall,  Texas.
SWEPCO has notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination has been
found  at the site.  As a result of sampling conducted at the end  of
1993  and  early 1994, SWEPCO is evaluating the extent,  if  any,  to
which   contamination  has  impacted  soil,  groundwater  and   other
conditions in the area.  A final range of clean-up costs has not  yet
been determined, but, based on a preliminary estimate, SWEPCO accrued
approximately  $2  million as a liability for this site  on  SWEPCO's
books as of December 31, 1993.  As more information is obtained about
the  site,  and  SWEPCO  discusses  the  site  with  the  TNRCC,  the
preliminary estimate may change.

<PAGE> 1-42
Suspected MGP Sites in Texarkana, Texas and Arkansas and Shreveport, 
Louisiana
CSW and SWEPCO
     SWEPCO also owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana, Texas
and Arkansas.  The EPA ordered an initial investigation of this site,
as  well as one in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no longer owned by
SWEPCO.  The contractor who performed the investigations of these two
sites recommended to the EPA that no further action be taken at  this
time.

Suspected Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
CSW and SWEPCO
      SWEPCO  has been notified by Mississippi Power Company that  it
may  be  a  PRP  at  the former Biloxi MGP site  formerly  owned  and
operated  by  a  predecessor  of  SWEPCO.   SWEPCO  is  working  with
Mississippi  Power Company to investigate the extent of contamination
at  this site.  The MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan and,
in  January  1995,  SWEPCO  and Mississippi Power  Company  initiated
sampling pursuant to that work plan.  On an interim basis, SWEPCO and
Mississippi Power Company are each paying fifty percent of  the  cost
of  implementing  the  site investigation work  plan.   That  interim
allocation  is  subject to a final allocation in the future.   SWEPCO
and  Mississippi  Power Company are investigating whether  there  are
other PRPs at the Biloxi site.  Until the extent of the contamination
at  the  Biloxi  site  is  identified, it is unknown  what,  if  any,
additional investigation or cleanup may be required.

Rochester Substation Spill
CSW and WTU
      In  September  1992, an automobile crashed  into  WTU's  69  KV
substation  in Rochester, Texas, and struck a transformer  containing
1,500  gallons  of 25 parts per million PCB oil.  WTU  responded  and
coordinated clean-up efforts with state officials.  In December 1993,
WTU  contracted with a consulting firm to ascertain the impact of the
spill   on  the  area  ground  water  and  to  help  determine  WTU's
effectiveness in the clean-up effort.  Total costs to date have  been
approximately  $400,000.  The consultant's  report,  dated  June  30,
1994,  concluded  that the spill cleanup procedures  were  effective.
WTU  forwarded the report to the TNRCC on July 12, 1994 and requested
the  agency  close  the  matter.  Management  believes  the  ultimate
resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect  on
CSW's or WTU's results of operations or financial condition.

Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976
      Under  the  TSCA,  the storage, use and disposal,  among  other
things, of PCBs are regulated.  Violations of TSCA may lead to  fines
and penalties.

CSW and CPL
      In  an  inspection of CPL by the EPA, the EPA alleged that  CPL
failed  to  comply  with the regulations governing the  reporting  of
leakage  of PCBs from some of its equipment.  The EPA has proposed  a
penalty of $91,000.  CPL met with EPA to negotiate a reduction in the
penalty.   EPA  responded  on  January  26,  1995,  with  a  proposed
potential reduced penalty of $61,000 dependent upon filing additional
information  with  the  EPA.   Based  on  the  information  currently
available to it, CPL expects the final penalty to be between  $61,000
and $91,000.

NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS

CSW
Transok
      Transok,  a  wholly-owned subsidiary of CSW, is  an  intrastate
natural   gas   gathering,  transmission,  processing,  storage   and
marketing  company.  Transok, incorporated in Oklahoma in  1955,  was
acquired  by  CSW  in  1961  to supply natural  gas  to  PSO's  power
stations.   While Transok's operations in recent years have  included
the marketing and transportation of natural gas for third parties, it
functions  within  the  CSW System to insure  reliable  and  economic
natural gas service to the Electric Operating Companies and CSWE.

     Transok provides a variety of services to the Electric Operating
Companies  including acquiring and transporting natural gas  to  meet
certain  of their power generation needs.  Transok's largest customer
is  PSO.   The contract between PSO and Transok provides (i) for  the
transportation  of  PSO's natural gas fuel supply  through  Transok's
pipeline  system  and  (ii)  for  Transok  to  act  as  PSO's  supply
administrator   in   acquiring  natural  gas  and   negotiating   and
administering  supply contracts.  PSO pays Transok for such  services
at  cost,  including a return on equity applicable between affiliates
as specified by the Oklahoma Commission in PSO's most recent Oklahoma
price review.  The contract expires on January 1, 2003, but continues
for  consecutive  five-year  terms  thereafter  unless  either  party
provides two years' notice of cancellation.  Under the contract,  PSO
has  the right to require delivery of up to 546 MMcf/d of natural gas
through  Transok's pipeline system.  Effective January 1,  1998,  PSO
may  adjust  the transportation capacity available to  it  under  the
contract  based on its projected needs.  Delivery of natural  gas  to
PSO is currently about 86 Bcf annually and is projected to increase.

Natural Gas Transportation and Gathering
      Transok  provides  natural  gas  suppliers  and  shippers  with
pipeline interconnects for access to the Electric Operating Companies
and  other  end-users throughout the United States.  At December  31,
1994,  Transok's  pipeline system consisted  of  approximately  6,436
miles of gathering and transmission lines which include approximately
3,973  miles  of gathering lines in Oklahoma, 275 miles in  Louisiana
and  214  miles  in Texas.  At December 31, 1994, Transok's  pipeline
system  consisted  of  200  compressors with  197,900  horsepower  to
provide  both gathering and transmission line compression.  Transok's
pipeline  facilities are located in the major natural  gas  producing
basins in Oklahoma, including the Anadarko and Arkoma basins, and  in
the major Louisiana corridor of pipelines transporting natural gas to
the  northeast  from  the  Gulf Coast and mid-continent  areas.   The
Transok   pipeline  system  has  numerous  connections   with   major
interstate  pipelines  through which natural gas  is  transported  to
markets  throughout the United States.  In 1994, the Transok pipeline
system had a throughput of 506 Bcf of natural gas.

     Transok transported more than 86 Bcf per year of natural gas for
PSO in 1994 and provided administrative services to PSO to manage its
supply of natural gas.  Transok has been active in the development of
joint  gas  purchase arrangements with its other  CSW  affiliates  as
well.  Transok's access to diverse natural gas markets combined  with
the  natural gas fuel needs of the Electric Operating Companies allow
for natural gas opportunities at high load factors, reducing the cost
of natural gas fuel for the CSW System.

Natural Gas Processing
      Transok  also  owns and operates seven natural  gas  processing
plants for the production of natural gas liquids.  The plants have an
aggregate  capacity  of 444 MMcf/d.  Transok is  the  second  largest
natural gas processor in Oklahoma and ranks seventeenth among natural
gas liquids producers nationwide.  In 1994, Transok's plants produced

<PAGE> 1-44
399.4  million gallons of natural gas liquids while revenue from  the
sale of natural gas liquids amounted to $117.9 million for the year.

Natural Gas Storage
      Transok  owns and operates an underground natural  gas  storage
reservoir   in  Oklahoma  with  an  aggregate  storage  capacity   of
approximately  26  billion  cubic  feet.   Operational   capabilities
include  injection  into  storage at a  rate  of  130  MMcf/d  and  a
withdrawal rate in excess of 210 MMcf/d.  In 1993, the FERC issued an
order  approving market-based storage rates for Transok which enables
it  to  sell  storage services to interstate customers at  negotiated
fees  based  on  the  value  of  those services  in  the  competitive
marketplace.   Transok's  gas storage field also  allows  Transok  to
offer  peaking  services, accommodate volume swings on  its  pipeline
system,  and  support the natural gas requirements  of  the  Electric
Operating Companies.

Natural Gas Marketing
      In  1989,  Transok began its natural gas marketing program  and
sold  26  Bcf  to a variety of customers including local distribution
companies, end-users and other pipelines.  In 1994, Transok's natural
gas  sales  volumes  were  257 Bcf with a  sales  revenue  of  $484.4
million.   Off-system sales of natural gas accounted for 111  Bcf  of
the  natural  gas  sold in 1994.  This increase  was  the  result  of
pipeline  acquisition and construction activities combined  with  new
customers.  Transok aggregates natural gas supply into various supply
pools, which provide Transok with reliable sources of natural gas  at
market  sensitive prices, allowing Transok to meet  its  natural  gas
supply  needs.  Transok offers various gas supply services to provide
customers with peaking and balancing alternatives utilizing Transok's
gas  supplies and facilities.  In addition, Transok's customers  have
the opportunity to select various pricing options including (i) fixed
or  variable  pricing, (ii) indexed to New York  Mercantile  Exchange
pricing or (iii) cash quotes.

      Transok  uses natural gas futures, options and basis  swaps  to
reduce its price risk exposure arising from the purchase and sale  of
natural  gas.   Natural  gas  futures and options  allow  Transok  to
protect against volatility in supply costs in fulfilling fixed  price
contracts,  meeting storage requirements and purchasing  natural  gas
for  processing operations.  Natural gas futures and options are also
used  to  protect Transok against price exposure on sales of  natural
gas  from storage or anticipated purchases.  In addition, basis swaps
protect  Transok  against volatility in price  differentials  between
geographic areas in matching anticipated supply and demand prices.

      In  1992,  FERC  Order 636 went into effect to  deregulate  the
natural  gas  industry  and increase competition.   Although  Transok
operations  were  not  directly affected by Order  636,  Transok  has
developed  tariff services, flexible contracts and other natural  gas
related services in order to meet customers' needs and take advantage
of new competitive opportunities.

Services for CSWE
      Transok  provides  natural  gas fuel  planning  and  management
services  for CSWE.  Transok assists CSWE in developing  natural  gas
supply  and transportation strategies for CSWE's non-utility electric
generation projects.

Regulation
      As  a subsidiary of CSW, Transok is subject to regulation under
the  Holding  Company  Act.   The Holding Company  Act,  among  other
things,  requires  that regulated companies seek prior  SEC  approval
before  entering into certain transactions including the  acquisition
or issuance of securities.

       Transok's  pipelines  are  considered  gathering  systems   or
intrastate pipelines.  Transok is therefore exempt from regulation by
the  FERC  under the Natural Gas Act.  However, Transok's  rates  for
transporting  gas  in  interstate  commerce  are  subject   to   FERC
regulation  under  the  Natural Gas Policy Act  of  1978.   The  FERC
approves  Transok's  rates for transportation of  gas  in  interstate
commerce  through Transok's pipelines in Oklahoma and  Louisiana  and
the   Texas   Railroad  Commission  approves  the  rates   for   such
transportation through pipelines in Texas.  The FERC also  has  given

<PAGE> 1-45
Transok  approval  to charge market-based rates for  storage  of  gas
using Transok's storage facility in Oklahoma.

      While Transok is not subject to direct regulation by any  state
public  utility  commission, the costs that result from  transactions
with  its  affiliated  Electric Operating Companies  are  subject  to
review  by the state commissions regulating such affiliates  and  are
required  to  meet  standards  for  affiliate  transactions   to   be
recoverable by the Electric Operating Companies.

CSWE
      CSWE,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of CSW,  is  authorized  to
develop various independent power and cogeneration facilities and to
own  and  operate  such  non-utility projects,  subject  to  further
regulatory approvals.  CSWE has an approximate 50% interest  in  the
Brush, Fort Lupton and Mulberry facilities which achieved commercial
operation in 1994.

Brush
      The  68 MW Brush project, located in Brush, Colorado, achieved
commercial  operation  in January 1994 and provides  steam  and  hot
water  to  a  15-acre  greenhouse and sells  electricity  to  Public
Service Company of Colorado.

Ft. Lupton
      The  Ft. Lupton project provides steam and hot water to a  20-
acre greenhouse and also sells electricity to Public Service Company
of  Colorado.   Phase I of the Ft. Lupton project, representing  122
MWs,  achieved commercial operation in June 1994.  Phase II  of  the
project  commenced  operations in July 1994 bringing  total  on-line
capacity of the project to 272 MWs.

Mulberry
     The Mulberry facility, a 117 MW gas-fired cogeneration plant in
Polk  County, Florida achieved commercial operation in  August  1994
and  provides  steam  to  a  combined distilled  water  and  ethanol
facility  and  sells  electricity to Florida Power  Corporation  and
Tampa  Electric Company.  CSWS is providing engineering, procurement
and  construction  management services  for  the  Mulberry  project.
CSWE's  operating and maintenance division is operating  the  plant.
On  December 30, 1994, the borrower, Polk Power Partners,  L.P.,  in
which  CSWE  is  indirectly a 50% owner,  was  notified  it  was  in
technical  default under the third party financing  documents  since
substantial  completion  of the Mulberry Ethanol  facility  had  not
occurred by December 30, 1994.  CSWE is in the process of discussing
with  the  lender means of curing the technical default.  Management
does  not  expect  this matter to have a material  effect  on  CSW's
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Orange Cogen
      The Orange Cogen facility, in which CSWE holds a 50% interest,
is  expected  to commence operation in June 1995.  The 103  MW,  gas
fired  plant  in Florida will provide thermal energy  to  an  orange
juice   processor  and  will  sell  electricity  to  Florida   Power
Corporation  and Tampa Electric Company.  CSWE's O&M division  plans
to operate the plant.

Oildale
      In November 1994, CSWE transferred its 50% interest in the  40
MW   Oildale  cogeneration  facility  to  two  non-affiliated  third
parties,  Oildale Holdings, Inc. and Oildale Holdings II, Inc.   The
Oildale  project,  which was financed with third-party  non-recourse
project financing, had been in default of certain provisions of  its
loan  agreement since December 1993.  Under the terms of the project
transfer, CSWE contributed $3 million in equity in exchange for  the
return of a letter of credit in the same amount in favor of a  third
party  lender.   CSWE  had  reserved for  this  liability  in  1993,
therefore, this transaction has no material adverse effect on  CSW's
or CSWE's 1994 results of operations or financial condition.

<PAGE> 1-46
Other Projects
      In  addition to these projects, CSWE has another  19  projects
totaling more than 5,000 MW in various stages of development, mostly
in   affiliation  with  other  developers.   CSWE  can  provide   no
assurances  that  these  projects,  which  are  subject  to  further
negotiations   and  regulatory  approvals,  will  be  commenced   or
completed  and,  if they are completed, that they will  provide  the
anticipated return on investment.

      As  a result of its participation in these projects, CSWE  has
contractual  commitments to provide certain  services  and  support.
These  commitments provide that the potential maximum  liability  of
CSWE  will  be  limited  to $215 million.  Management  believes  the
likelihood of material liabilities under these contracts is remote.

      The  following table sets forth information about cogeneration
projects CSWE is currently operating or bringing to operation:

CSWI
      In  November 1994, CSWI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSW, was
formed  to  engage in international activities including developing,
acquiring,  financing and owning the securities of exempt  wholesale
generators and foreign utility companies.

     In 1994, CSWI continued the Mexico initiative that CSW began in
1992.   CSWI's  goal  is  to participate in providing  for  Mexico's
future  electric power needs.  The geographical location of the  CSW
System  offers opportunities to provide bulk power sales to  Mexico.
The  Mexico  City office of CSW allows CSWI greater  access  to  key
Mexican   markets,   permitting  CSWI  to  more   readily   evaluate
opportunities  as  they  become  available.   However,  the   recent
devaluation of the Mexican peso will slow previously projected power
demand for the near-term.

      CSWI  is  also  evaluating energy-related  projects  in  other
international markets.

CSW Communications
      In July 1994, CSW Communications, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
CSW,  was  formed to provide communication services to the Operating
Companies   and   non-affiliates.   One  important   goal   of   CSW
Communications  is  to  enhance services  to  CSW  System  customers
through fiber optics and other telecommunications technologies.  CSW
Communications  will  consolidate the future  design,  construction,
maintenance  and  ownership  of the CSW System's  telecommunications
networks.   In 1994, CSW announced a $9 million project  in  Laredo,
Texas,  to  install  fiber  optic lines and  coaxial  cable  to  CPL
residential  customers who have volunteered to  take  part  in  this
pilot  program.  This project involving CSW Communications  and  CPL
will  demonstrate the energy efficiency and cost savings that result
from giving customers greater choice and control over their electric
service.   These energy-efficiency services will use only a  portion
of  the  capacity of the telecommunications lines CSW Communications
is  installing.  In the future, CSW Communications may,  subject  to
any  required  regulatory approvals, seek to lease or otherwise  use
the   remaining  capacity  for  other  services  including  possibly
telephone service, cable television and home security systems.

(1)  The 1993 cumulative effect relates to the changes in accounting

  adoption of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  See NOTE 1.
  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

(2)  The 1992 - 1990 total assets have been reclassified to reflect
the effects of the adoption in 1993 of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for 
Income Taxes.  See NOTE 2.  Federal Income Taxes.

All common stock data have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one
common stock split, effected by a 100% stock dividend paid on March 6,
1992, to stockholders of record on February 10, 1992.

CSW changed its method of accounting for unbilled revenues in 1993.
Pro forma amounts, assuming that the change in accounting for unbilled
revenues had been adopted retroactively, are not materially different
from amounts reported for prior years and therefore have not been
restated.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEST CORPORATION

      Reference is made to CSW's Consolidated Financial Statements and
related  Notes and Selected Financial Data.  The information contained
therein  should  be  read in conjunction with,  and  is  essential  in
understanding, the following discussion and analysis.

Overview
      The  electric utility industry is changing rapidly and  becoming
more  competitive.  Several years ago, in anticipation  of  increasing
competition and fundamental changes in the industry, CSW's  management
developed a four-part strategic plan.  This plan is designed  to  help
position  CSW  to  be competitive in the rapidly changing  environment
that the CSW System currently faces.  The four-part strategy is:

       Enhance CSW's core electric utility business.

       Expand CSW's core electric utility business.

       Expand CSW's non-utility business.

       Pursue financial initiatives.

      Since the introduction of CSW's strategic plan in 1990, CSW  has
undertaken initiatives in each of these areas that are important steps
in the implementation of the overall strategy.  These initiatives were
marked  by the efforts in the proposed acquisition of El Paso and  the
continued restructuring of CSW's core business.  In addition, CSW  has
faced  some operational challenges during the past two years with  the
outage and 1994 restart of STP.  These events are discussed below  and
elsewhere in this report.

      CSW  and the Electric Operating Companies believe that, compared
to other electric utilities, the CSW System is well positioned to meet
future  competition.  The CSW System benefits from economies of  scale
and  scope by virtue of its size and is a relatively low-cost producer
of  electric  power.   Moreover, CSW is taking steps  to  enhance  its
marketing  and customer service, reduce costs, improve and standardize
business practices, and grow through strategic acquisitions, in  order
to position itself for increased competition in the future.

Proposed Acquisition of El Paso
      El  Paso  filed  a voluntary petition for reorganization  under
Chapter  11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 8, 1992.  In May  1993,
CSW  entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which El Paso  would
emerge from bankruptcy as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSW.  El  Paso
is  an  electric  utility company headquartered in  El  Paso,  Texas,
engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity
to  approximately 262,000 retail customers in west Texas and southern
New  Mexico.   El  Paso  also  sells electricity  under  contract  to
wholesale  customers  in  a  number of locations  including  southern
California and Mexico.

      On July 30, 1993, El Paso filed the Modified Plan and a related
proposed  form of disclosure statement providing for the  acquisition
of  El  Paso  by  CSW.  On November 15, 1993, all voting  classes  of
creditors  and shareholders of El Paso voted to approve the  Modified
Plan.   On  December  8,  1993, the Bankruptcy  Court  confirmed  the
Modified Plan.

      Under  the  Modified Plan, the total value of  CSW's  offer  to
acquire  El  Paso is approximately $2.2 billion.  The  Modified  Plan
generally provides for El Paso creditors and shareholders to  receive
shares  of CSW Common, cash and/or securities of El Paso, or to  have

<PAGE> 2-8
their  claims cured and reinstated.  The Modified Plan also  provides
for  claims  of secured creditors generally to be paid in  full  with
debt  securities of reorganized El Paso, and for unsecured  creditors
to  receive a combination of debt securities of reorganized  El  Paso
and  CSW Common equal to 95.5 percent of their claims, and for  small
trade  creditors  to be paid in full with cash.   The  Modified  Plan
provides  for  El Paso's preferred shareholders to receive  preferred
shares  of reorganized El Paso, or cash, and for options to  purchase
El   Paso  Common  to  be  converted  into  options  to  purchase   a
proportionate number of shares of CSW Common.

      Based on information provided by El Paso, 35,544,330 shares  of
El  Paso  Common were outstanding as of the Confirmation  Date.   The
Modified  Plan provides for El Paso's common shareholders to  receive
between $3.00 and $4.50, plus dividends, per share of El Paso  Common
to  be  paid in CSW Common as described below.  The Merger  Agreement
provides  for  each share of El Paso Common to be  converted  on  the
Effective Date into the number of shares of CSW Common with  a  value
(based  on a value of $29.4583 per share of CSW Common) equal to  the
sum  of  (i)  $3.00  per share of El Paso Common outstanding  on  the
Confirmation Date, (ii) any proceeds received by El Paso prior to the
Effective Date from certain contingent claims based on a value of CSW
Common  equal to the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange  on
the  day  such  proceeds  are received by  El  Paso,  and  (iii)  the
dividends  that  would be deemed to have been  paid  on  the  amounts
described in items (i) and (ii) above from the Confirmation Date,  or
the  date upon which such contingent claims are converted into  cash,
as the case may be, through and including the Effective Date, as well
as  dividends that would have been paid on such dividends under (iii)
above; provided, however, that the sum of (i) and (ii) above will not
exceed  $4.50  multiplied by the number of shares of El  Paso  Common
outstanding on the Confirmation Date.  If $4.50 per share of El  Paso
Common  has not been realized under items (i) and (ii) above and  any
of  the  contingent claims are remaining on the Effective  Date,  the
Modified Plan and Merger Agreement provide for a liquidation trust to
be established pursuant to the Modified Plan and for El Paso's rights
in those contingent claims to be assigned to the trust.  The Modified
Plan  provides for proceeds resulting from disposition of the  assets
in  the liquidation trust, if any, to be distributed pro rata to  the
holders  of El Paso Common up to $4.50 per share under items (i)  and
(ii)  above,  with any net proceeds thereafter to be returned  to  El
Paso.   El  Paso has stated publicly that it has realized  sufficient
proceeds from the contingent claims referred to in item (ii) above so
that no liquidation trust would be required.

      The  aggregate  number of shares of CSW Common  that  would  be
issued  in  connection with the Merger cannot be determined  at  this
time due to certain contingencies, including the future price of  CSW
Common,  future  dividend rates on CSW Common and the occurrence  and
timing  of  the Effective Date of the Merger.  CSW has estimated  the
value  of  the  shares  to  be  issued to  El  Paso  stakeholders  at
approximately $569 million based on an assumed Effective Date in  the
first  half  of 1995.  In addition, CSW expects to make  payments  in
cash   of   approximately  $335  million  in  connection   with   the
consummation  of the Merger, a portion of which would  be  funded  by
cash  in  the El Paso estate and an estimated $200 million  of  which
would  be  funded from other internal or external sources  which  may
include  a  new issuance of CSW Common or debt securities.  Depending
on  the  number  of  shares issued and the outcome of  other  matters
discussed  below,  existing holders of CSW  Common  could  experience
short-term dilution in earnings if the Merger is consummated.  As  of
December 31, 1994, the price per share of CSW Common had declined  by
approximately  31%  since  May  3,  1993,  the  date  of  the  Merger
Agreement.   Because  the number of shares  of  CSW  Common  and  the
interest  rates of the debt securities that would be  issued  to  the
creditor  groups in connection with the Merger are to be  set  on  or
about the Effective Date, changes in the price of CSW Common and  the
level  of  interest  rates would affect the economic  impact  of  the
proposed acquisition to CSW.

      The  Merger is subject to numerous conditions set forth in  the
Merger  Agreement, including but not limited to (i)  the  receipt  of
final  orders  with respect to all required regulatory  approvals  on
terms  that would not cause a regulatory material adverse  effect  as
defined in the Merger Agreement, (ii) the receipt of all third  party
consents, (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect or facts  or
circumstances  that  could reasonably be  expected  to  result  in  a
material  adverse effect on El Paso or the business prospects  of  El
Paso,  (iv) transfer to El Paso of good and marketable title  to  the
leased  portion of El Paso's share of Palo Verde, (v) performance  by

<PAGE> 2-9
El  Paso, CSW and CSW's acquisition subsidiary, CSW Sub, Inc., in all
material  respects of all covenants contained in the Merger Agreement
and  (vi)  the  occurrence of the Effective Date under  the  Modified
Plan.   Required regulatory approvals and filings in connection  with
the  Merger  include  approvals  of the  FERC,  the  SEC,  the  Texas
Commission, the New Mexico Commission, the NRC, and filings with  the
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

     The Merger Agreement also provides that CSW and El Paso have the
right to terminate the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances
including  without limitation, (i) the filing of a  stand-alone  rate
plan  by  El  Paso, (ii) the failure of the Effective Date  to  occur
within 18 months after the Confirmation Date (i.e., by June 8, 1995),
or  ,  if  extended by mutual consent of CSW and El Paso,  within  24
months of the Confirmation Date (i.e., by December 8, 1995), or (iii)
the  entering  of  any  order denying any of the required  regulatory
approvals.   In  the  event  the Merger Agreement  is  terminated,  a
termination  fee  is payable in limited circumstances.   El  Paso  is
required  to pay a termination fee of $50 million to CSW if  El  Paso
terminates  the  Merger  Agreement under  certain  circumstances  and
subsequently  consummates a merger with another party.   CSW  and  El
Paso  would be required to pay a $25 million termination fee  to  the
other  party in the case of termination based upon a material  breach
of  the  Merger Agreement or failure to approve an extension of  time
permitted to consummate the Merger under specified circumstances.  If
the  Merger  Agreement is terminated, whether or not any  termination
fee is payable, CSW could be required, in most cases, to recognize as
an  expense deferred costs associated with the Merger, which amounted
to  approximately  $36 million at December 31,  1994.   Additionally,
under  certain  circumstances, if the Merger is not consummated,  the
Merger Agreement provides for CSW to pay El Paso a portion of certain
interest  costs  and  certain  fees and  expenses.   CSW's  potential
exposure  as  of  December 31, 1994 is estimated to be  approximately
$17.5  million; however, the actual amount, if any, that CSW  may  be
required  to pay pursuant to these provisions depends on a number  of
contingencies and cannot presently be predicted.

      CSW continues to use its best efforts to consummate the Merger.
At  the  same  time, however, CSW continues to monitor  contingencies
which  may preclude the consummation of the Merger, including without
limitation  the potential loss of significant portions of  El  Paso's
service area and significant El Paso customers, including Las  Cruces
and  two  military installations, Holloman Air Force Base  and  White
Sands Missile Range, regulatory risks principally related to approval
of  the Merger and El Paso's request for a rate increase in Texas  as
well  as  the effects of the conditions imposed by federal  or  state
regulatory  agencies  on the approval of the  Merger,  and  operating
risks associated with the ownership of an interest in Palo Verde.

     Based upon El Paso's written response to the concerns identified
in  a  September 12 letter from CSW to El Paso and the failure of  El
Paso to resolve the contingencies set forth above, CSW cannot predict
whether, or if so when, the Merger will be consummated.  In the event
that  the  proposed Merger is not consummated, there may  be  ensuing
litigation  between  El Paso and CSW or among  other  parties  to  El
Paso's bankruptcy proceedings and either or both of El Paso and CSW.

      Management  is  unable to predict the ultimate outcome  of  the
proposed  Merger.  In the event that recognition of  any  or  all  of
these  expenses is required, it could have a material adverse  impact
on  CSW's  consolidated results of operations in the period they  are
recognized,  but  would not be expected to have  a  material  adverse
impact  on  CSW's  consolidated results of  operations  or  financial
condition.

      See NOTE 11,  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - Proposed
Acquisition  of  El Paso, for additional information related  to  the
proposed El Paso merger.

Restructuring
      As  previously  reported, the CSW System  has  taken  steps  to
implement  a  restructuring and early retirement program designed  to
consolidate  and  restructure its operations in  order  to  meet  the
challenges  of the changing electric utility industry and to  compete
effectively  in  the  years  ahead.   The  underlying  goal  of   the

<PAGE> 2-10
restructuring is to enable the Electric Operating Companies to  focus
on  and  be  accountable for serving the customer.  The restructuring
costs were initially estimated to be $97 million and were expensed in
1993.   The  final costs of the restructuring were approximately  $88
million.  Approximately $84 million of the restructuring expenditures
were incurred during 1994, with the remaining $4 million expected  to
be   incurred  during  1995.   Approximately  $12  million   of   the
restructuring  expenses relate to employee termination benefits,  $45
million  relate to enhanced benefit costs and $31 million  relate  to
employees that will not be terminated.  Approximately $60 million  of
the  restructuring costs were paid from or will be paid from  general
corporate  funds.  The remaining $28 million represents  the  present
value  of  enhanced benefit amounts to be paid from the benefit  plan
trusts to participants over future years in accordance with the early
retirement program.  The cost of these enhanced benefit amounts  will
be  paid from general corporate funds to the benefit plan trusts over
future years.  The restructuring is substantially completed, with the
remaining activity to take place during 1995.  Certain aspects of the
restructuring are pending SEC approval under the Holding Company Act.

       CSW  expects  to  realize  a  number  of  benefits  from   the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased efficiencies and synergies are expected to be realized with
the  elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This  leads  to
enhanced communication and efficiency, which should translate into  a
reduction  in  the  rate of growth in O&M costs.   All  restructuring
costs  are expected to be recovered by early 1996 with reductions  in
the rate of growth of O&M costs continuing thereafter.

STP
Introduction
      CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which  is
located  near Bay City, Texas.  In addition to CPL, HLP, the  Project
Manager,  owns 30.8%, San Antonio owns 28.0%, and Austin owns  16.0%.
STP  Unit 1 was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit  2  was
placed in service in June 1989.

       From  February  1993  until  May  1994,  STP  experienced   an
unscheduled  outage  which  has  resulted  in  significant  rate  and
regulatory  proceedings involving CPL.  These  matters,  including  a
base  rate  case and fuel reconciliation proceedings,  are  discussed
immediately below.

STP Outage
      In February 1993, Units 1 and 2 of STP were shut down by HLP in
an  unscheduled  outage  resulting  from  mechanical  problems.   HLP
determined that the units would not be restarted until the  equipment
failures had been corrected and the NRC was briefed on the causes  of
these  failures and the corrective actions that were taken.  The  NRC
formalized  that commitment in a confirmatory action letter  that  it
supplemented  to  identify  additional  issues  to  be  resolved  and
verified by the NRC before STP could be restarted.

      During the outage, the necessary improvements were made by  HLP
to   address  the  issues  in  the  confirmatory  action  letter,  as
supplemented.   On  February  15,  1994,  the  NRC  agreed  that  the
confirmatory action letter issues had been resolved with  respect  to
Unit 1, and that it agreed with HLP's recommendation that Unit 1  was
ready  to restart.  Unit 1 restarted on February 25, 1994 and reached
100%  power on April 8, 1994.  Subsequently, the issues with  respect
to Unit 2 were resolved and the NRC on May 17, 1994 agreed with HLP's
recommendation  to restart Unit 2.  Unit 2 resumed operation  on  May
30,  1994 and reached 100% power on June 16, 1994.  During 1994, Unit
1 and Unit 2 achieved annual net capacity factors of 75.3% and 54.7%,
respectively.   During the last six months of  1994,  the  STP  units
operated  at capacity factors of 98.6% for Unit 1 and 99.2% for  Unit
2.

      In  June 1993, the NRC placed STP on its "watch list" of plants
with "weaknesses that warrant increased NRC attention."  The decision
to  place STP on the watch list followed the June 1993 issuance of  a
report  by an NRC Diagnostic Evaluation Team which conducted a review
of STP operations.

      On February 3, 1995, the NRC removed STP from the "watch list".
The  NRC  noted  that  the  four key areas for  their  decision  were
sustained  improvement throughout 1994, high standards of performance
exhibited by the plant, effective maintenance and engineering support

<PAGE> 2-11
resulting  in  reduced equipment repair backlogs and  improved  plant
reliability, and the open and positive employee climate at the plant.
With  the  NRC reviewing the "watch list" status every 6  months  and
with Unit 2 achieving 100% power in June of 1994, the February review
was  the first realistic opportunity for STP to be considered  for  a
change in status.  On average, plants previously placed on the "watch
list" have stayed on the list for 29 months.

Rates and Regulatory Matters
CPL Rate Inquiry
      Several Cities, the Texas Commission General Counsel and others
initiated  actions in late 1993 and early 1994 which, if approved  by
the Texas Commission, would lower CPL's base rates.  The requests for
a  review of CPL's rates arose out of the unscheduled outage  at  STP
which  began  in February 1993.  The STP outage did not affect  CPL's
ability  to  meet  customer demand because of existing  capacity  and
CPL's purchase of additional energy.

      CPL  submitted a filing package on July 1, 1994, to  the  Texas
Commission  justifying its current base rate structure.   Parties  to
CPL's  base  rate case have filed testimony with the Texas Commission
recommending  reductions in CPL's retail base rates  of  up  to  $147
million annually, resulting from a combination of proposed rate  base
and  cost  of service reductions, as well as a rate base disallowance
of up to $400 million.

      The  Texas  Commission held hearings in November  and  December
1994,  and  all parties have filed briefs in the case.   The  ALJ  is
expected to issue a recommended order for consideration by the  Texas
Commission in April 1995 with a final order from the Texas Commission
expected  in May 1995.  Testimony filed by parties to the rate  case,
including  the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJ or  the  Texas
Commission.

     CPL continues to maintain that its rates are reasonable and that
its  earnings  are  within  established  regulatory  guidelines.   In
addition, CPL strongly believes that 100 percent of its investment in
both  units  of STP belongs in rate base.  This belief is  based  on,
among  other factors, Units 1 and 2 providing output at high capacity
factors  since  April and June 1994, respectively.  In addition,  the
long-term  benefits nuclear generation provides to customers  further
support  their  inclusion in rate base.  Furthermore,  there  are  no
Texas Commission precedents addressing the removal of a nuclear plant
from rate base as a performance disallowance.  Assuming both units of
STP  are  included  in rate base, CPL believes it is  not  collecting
excessive  revenues, notwithstanding that market rates of  return  on
common  equity are generally lower today than they were in  1990  and
1991, when CPL's base rates were last set.

CPL Fuel
      Pursuant to the substantive rules of the Texas Commission,  CPL
generally  is allowed to recover its fuel costs through a fixed  fuel
factor. These fuel factors are in the nature of temporary rates,  and
CPL's  collection  of  revenues by such fuel factors  is  subject  to
adjustment at the time of a fuel reconciliation proceeding before the
Texas  Commission.  The difference between fuel revenues  billed  and
fuel  expense incurred is recorded as an addition to or  a  reduction
from  revenues, with a corresponding entry to unrecovered fuel  costs
or  other  current liabilities, as appropriate.  Any fuel costs,  not
limited  to  under-  or over-recoveries, which the  Texas  Commission
determines  as  unreasonable in a reconciliation proceeding  are  not
recoverable from customers.

      CPL  is currently involved in two proceedings before the  Texas
Commission  relating  to  the recovery of fuel  and  purchased  power
costs.  CPL originally filed Docket No. 12154 seeking approval  of  a
customer  surcharge  to  recover  fuel  and  purchased  power  costs,
including those resulting from the STP outage.  In Docket No.  13126,
the  Texas  Commission General Counsel and others are  reviewing  the
prudence  of  management activities at STP.  In  November  1994,  CPL
filed  a fuel reconciliation case in Docket No. 13650 with the  Texas
Commission  seeking  to reconcile fuel costs  since  March  1,  1990,
including  the  period during which CPL's fuel  and  purchased  power
costs  were increased due to the STP outage.  At December  31,  1994,
CPL's  under-recovered fuel balance was $54.1 million,  exclusive  of
interest,  which  was  due  primarily  to  the  STP  outage.   If   a

<PAGE> 2-12
significant  portion of the fuel costs were disallowed by  the  Texas
Commission,  CSW could experience a material adverse  effect  on  its
consolidated  results of operations in the year of  disallowance  but
not  on  its financial condition.  Finally, in Docket No. 13126,  the
Texas  Commission  General  Counsel  is  reviewing  the  prudence  of
management activities at STP.  On January 4, 1995, Docket  No.  12154
was  consolidated into Docket No. 13650.  The results of the prudence
inquiry in Docket No. 13126 are expected to be incorporated into  the
fuel reconciliation proceedings in Docket No. 13650.

      CPL  continues  to  negotiate with the intervening  parties  to
resolve these matters through settlement.  However, no settlement has
been reached to date.

       Management  cannot  predict  the  ultimate  outcome  of  these
regulatory  proceedings.   However,  management  believes  that   the
ultimate  resolution of the various issues will not have  a  material
adverse  effect  on  CSW's  consolidated  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

      See  NOTE 10, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - CPL, STP,
for  a  discussion of regulatory proceedings arising out of  the  STP
outage and background on STP rate orders and deferred accounting.

Nuclear Decommissioning
      CPL's  decommissioning  costs are  accrued  and  funded  to  an
external trust over the expected service life of the STP units.   The
existing NRC operating licenses will allow the operation of STP  Unit
1  until 2027, and Unit 2 until 2028.  The accrual is an annual level
cost  based  on  the  estimated  future  cost  to  decommission  STP,
including escalations for expected inflation to the expected time  of
decommissioning and is net of expected earnings on the trust fund.

      The  staff  of  the SEC has questioned certain  of  the  current
accounting  practices of the electric utility industry  regarding  the
recognition,  measurement and classification of decommissioning  costs
for nuclear generating stations.  In response to these questions, FASB
has  agreed  to  review  the accounting for removal  costs,  including
decommissioning.   If  current  electric utility  industry  accounting
practices  for such decommissioning are changed, (i) annual provisions
for  decommissioning  could  increase, (ii)  the  estimated  cost  for
decommissioning  could  be  recorded as a  liability  rather  than  as
accumulated  depreciation,  and  (iii)  trust  fund  income  from  the
external decommissioning trusts could be reported as investment income
rather than as a reduction to decommissioning expense.

      See NOTE 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Nuclear
Decommissioning,    for    further   information    regarding    CPL's
decommissioning of STP.

       See  NOTE  10,  Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for
information regarding other rate and regulatory matters, including the
PSO rate case, the SWEPCO fuel reconciliation, and WTU's fuel and rate
proceedings.

New Accounting Standards
      SFAS  No.  115,  was effective for fiscal years beginning  after
December 15, 1993.  CSW adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1994.  The adoption of
SFAS  No.  115  did  not have a material effect on CSW's  consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.

      In  June  1993  the  FASB issued SFAS No. 116.   The  statement,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, will  be
adopted  by  CSW  for  1995.   The  statement  establishes  accounting
standards  for contributions and applies to all entities that  receive
or  make  contributions.  Management does not believe the adoption  of
SFAS No. 116 will have a material impact on CSW's consolidated results
of operations or financial condition.


<PAGE> 2-13
     SFAS No. 119 was effective for fiscal years ending after December
15,  1994.   Transok, which is the only subsidiary  of  CSW  currently
using  derivative  financial instruments, uses derivatives  to  manage
price  and  market  risks for gas purchases and sales.   The  Electric
Operating Companies may use these instruments in the future to  manage
the  increased market risks associated with greater competition in the
electric utility industry.  The adoption of this new statement had  no
material  effect  on  CSW's  consolidated  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
      The  historical capital requirements of the CSW System have been
primarily  for  the  construction of electric  utility  plant.   Large
capital  expenditures for the construction of new generating  capacity
are  not  planned  through  the  end  of  this  decade.   Accordingly,
internally   generated  funds  should  meet  most  of    the   capital
requirements  of  the  Electric Operating Companies.   However,  CSW's
strategic initiatives, including expanding CSW's core electric utility
and  non-utility businesses,  may require additional capital.  Primary
sources  of capital are long-term debt and preferred stock  issued  by
the  Electric  Operating Companies, common stock  issued  by  CSW  and
internally generated funds.  In addition, CSWE uses various  forms  of
non-recourse  project  financing.  CSW, in  order  to  strengthen  its
capital  structure  and support growth from time to  time,  may  issue
additional shares of its common stock.

      Productive investment of net funds from operations in excess  of
capital  expenditures and dividend payments are necessary  to  enhance
the  long-term  value of CSW for its investors.   CSW  is  continually
evaluating  the  best use of these funds.  CSW is required  to  obtain
authorization  from  various regulators in  order  to  invest  in  any
additional business activities.

Capital Expenditures
     Construction expenditures for the CSW System totaled $578 million
in  1994.   Based  on projections of growth in peak  demand,  the  CSW
System  will not require significant additional generating  capability
through the end of this decade.  Planned construction expenditures for
the  Electric  Operating  Companies  for  the  next  three  years  are
primarily  to  improve  and  expand  distribution  facilities.   These
improvements  will be required to meet the needs of new customers  and
the  growth  in the requirements of existing customers.   Construction
expenditures, excluding capital required for acquisitions  by  CSW  or
its  subsidiaries,  if  any, are expected  to  be  approximately  $385
million,  $382 million and $358 million during 1995, 1996,  and  1997,
respectively.   Not  included in the 1995 amount is approximately  $61
million of equity investments by CSWE.

      The construction program continues to be monitored, reviewed and
adjusted  to reflect changes in estimated load growth in the  Electric
Operating   Companies'  service  areas,  variations   in   prices   of
alternative fuel sources, the cost of labor, materials, equipment  and
capital, and other external factors.

      The CSW System facilities plan presently includes projected coal
and  lignite-fired  generating plants for which  the  CSW  System  has
invested  approximately $140 million in prior years for  plant  sites,
engineering studies and lignite reserves.  Should future plans exclude
these  plants  for environmental or other reasons, CSW would  evaluate
the  probability  of  recovery of these  investments  and  may  record
appropriate reserves.

Long-Term Financing
      As  of December 31, 1994, the capitalization ratios of CSW were:
common  stock equity 48%, preferred stock 5% and long-term  debt  47%.
The  CSW System's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.7% at the  end
of  1994.  The CSW System continually monitors the capital markets for
opportunities  to  lower its cost of capital through refinancing.  The
CSW   System  continues  to  be  committed  to  maintaining  financial
flexibility  by maintaining a strong capital structure  and  favorable
securities  ratings which should allow funds to be obtained  from  the
capital markets when required.

      The  CSW  System's significant long-term financing activity  for
1994 and 1995 to date is summarized as follows:

(1)    Net  proceeds were used to repay a portion of CPL's short-term
  borrowings.

(2)     Net proceeds were used to reimburse WTU's treasury for (i) $12
  million  aggregate principal amount of 7-1/4% FMBs,  Series  G,  due
  January  1, 1999, redeemed on January 1, 1994, and (ii) $23  million
  aggregate  principal amount of 7-7/8% FMBs, Series H,  due  July  1,
  2003,  redeemed on December 30, 1993.  The balance of  the  proceeds
  were used to repay outstanding short-term borrowings.

(3)     Issuance  occurred in 1995 and is not reflected  in  the  1994
  financial statements.  Net proceeds were used to repay a portion  of
  WTU's  short-term  debt, to provide working capital  and  for  other
  general corporate purposes.

(4)     Proceeds  were used to repay short-term debt, which  had  been
  previously  used  to  finance  certain  assets,  including  the  CSW
  headquarters building in Dallas, Texas.

Shelf Registration Statements
      The Electric Operating Companies expect to obtain a majority  of
their  1995 capital requirements from internal sources, but may  issue
additional securities subject to market conditions and other  factors.
CPL  and WTU have filed shelf registration statements with the SEC for
the  sale of securities.  The amount available for issuance by company
and the date filed with the SEC follow:

                   First Mortgage Bonds          Preferred Stock
                  Amount       Date Filed      Amount    Date Filed

           WTU      $20           1993                   

      The  Operating  Companies may issue additional  debt  securities
subject to market conditions and other factors.  The proceeds  of  any
such offerings will be used principally to redeem higher cost FMBs, to
lower  the embedded cost of debt, to repay short-term debt, to provide
working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

      The  Electric Operating Companies may issue additional preferred
stock subject to market conditions and other factors.  The proceeds of
any  such  offerings  will be used principally to redeem  higher  cost
preferred stock and to repay short-term debt.

Short-Term Financing
      The Electric Operating Companies utilize short-term debt to meet
fluctuations  in  working capital requirements  due  to  the  seasonal
nature of electric sales.  The CSW System has established a money pool
to coordinate short-term borrowings and to make borrowings outside the
money  pool  through CSW's issuance of commercial paper.  At  December
31,  1994,  the  CSW System had bank lines of credit aggregating  $930
million to back up the CSW commercial paper program.

     The maximum amount of consolidated short-term debt outstanding in
1994  was $1,618 million in September 1994, which represented  26%  of
the total capitalization at December 31, 1994.  The average amount  of
short-term debt during 1994 was $1,455 million, of which $694  million
was  attributable to CSW Credit.  The weighted average cost of  short-
term debt was 4.5% in 1994.  Short-term debt outstanding increased due
to   continued  expenditures  for  corporate  initiatives,   including
investments in CSWE.

Acquisitions
      To  meet  its strategic goals, CSW will continue to  search  for
electric  utility  companies or other electric utility  properties  to
acquire  and  will continue evaluating opportunities to pursue  energy
related non-utility businesses.  For any major acquisition, additional
funds  from the capital markets, including the issuance of CSW  Common
in  underwritten  public  offerings, in  the  acquisition  transaction
itself, or otherwise, may be required.

      For  a  discussion of circumstances under which  CSW  may  issue
additional  shares  of common stock in connection  with  the  proposed
acquisition of El Paso, see Proposed Acquisition of El Paso, above.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
     The PowerShare dividend reinvestment plan is available to all CSW
stockholders,  employees,  eligible retirees,  utility  customers  and
other  residents  of  the  four states where  the  Electric  Operating
Companies  operate.  Plan participants are able to make optional  cash
payments  and  reinvest all or any portion of their dividends  in  CSW
Common.   During  1994 CSW raised approximately  $50  million  in  new
equity through the PowerShare plan.

Internally Generated Funds
      Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from  operating
activities  less common and preferred stock dividends.   The  Electric
Operating  Companies utilize short-term debt to meet  fluctuations  in
working  capital  requirements due to the seasonal  nature  of  energy
sales.  Information concerning internally generated funds follows:

CSWE and CSWI
      At December 31, 1994, CSW had loaned $221 million to CSWE on  an
interim   basis  for  the  purpose  of  developing  and   constructing
independent  power  and cogeneration facilities.  Repayment  of  these
amounts  to  CSW  is expected to be made through funds  obtained  from
third  party non-recourse  project financing.  In late February  1994,
CSWE  closed  permanent project financing for its 50%  owned  Mulberry
facility,  which  is described below, and repaid $94  million  of  the
interim  financing  provided  by CSW.   In  March  1995,  CSWE  closed
permanent  project  financing for its Ft. Lupton  facility,  which  is
described  below,  and  repaid $102 million of the  interim  financing
provided by CSW.  In addition to the amounts already expended in  1994
for  the development of projects, CSWE and CSWI have general authority
from  the  SEC  to  expend  up  to  $242  million  and  $399  million,
respectively, on future projects.

CSW Credit
      CSW  Credit purchases, without recourse, the accounts receivable
of   the  Operating  Companies  and  certain  non-affiliated  electric
companies.   CSW Credit's capital structure contains greater  leverage
than that of the Operating Companies, consequently lowering CSW's cost
of capital.

      CSW Credit issues commercial paper, secured by the assignment of
its receivables, to meet its financing needs.  CSW Credit maintains  a
secured  revolving credit agreement which aggregated $900  million  at
December 31, 1994 to back up its commercial paper program.

      The  sale  of these accounts receivables provides the  Operating
Companies  with  cash  immediately, thereby reducing  working  capital
needs and revenue requirements.

Recent Developments and Trends

Competition and Industry Challenges
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry  are
impacting  the CSW System and electric utilities generally.  Increased
competition  facing electric utilities is driven by complex  economic,
political  and technological factors.  These factors have resulted  in
legislative  and regulatory initiatives that are likely to  result  in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in the
future.   As  competition  in  the industry  increases,  the  Electric
Operating  Companies will have the opportunity to seek  new  customers
and  at  the  same  time  be  at risk of  losing  customers  to  other
competitors.   The  Electric Operating Companies  believe  that  their
prices  for  electricity  and the quality  and  reliability  of  their
service  currently place them in a position to compete effectively  in
the marketplace.

      The  Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy Policy
Act  creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding Company  Act
and  permits utilities, including registered utility holding companies
and  non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are a new category  of
non-utility  wholesale power producer that are free from most  federal
and  state  regulation, including the principal  restrictions  of  the
Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable broader participation in
wholesale  power  markets  by  reducing  regulatory  hurdles  to  such
participation.  The Energy Policy Act also allows the FERC, on a case-
by-case  basis  and  with  certain restrictions,  to  order  wholesale
transmission  access and to order electric utilities to enlarge  their
transmission  systems.  A FERC order requiring a transmitting  utility
to  provide  wholesale  transmission service must  include  provisions
generally  that  permit  (i) the utility  to  recover  from  the  FERC
applicant   all  of  the  costs  incurred  in  connection   with   the
transmission  services and (ii) any enlargement  of  the  transmission
system  and  associated services.  While CSW believes that the  Energy
Policy   Act  will  continue  to  make  the  wholesale  markets   more
competitive, CSW is unable to predict the extent to which  the  Energy
Policy Act will impact  CSW System operations.

       Increasing  competition  in  the  utility  industry  brings  an
increased  need  to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail  regulatory
environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from  traditional   rate   base
regulation  to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and  performance-
based  plans  encourage efficiencies and increased productivity  while
permitting  utilities  to share in the results.   Retail  wheeling,  a
major  industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel"  or  move
power  from  third parties to their own retail customer,  is  evolving
gradually.

      The Electric Operating Companies also compete with suppliers  of
alternative forms of energy, such as natural gas, fuel oil  and  coal,
some of which may be cheaper than electricity.  The Electric Operating
Companies believe that their prices and the quality and reliability of

<PAGE> 2-17
their   service  currently  places  them  in  a  position  to  compete
effectively in the marketplace.

      Wholesale  energy  markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment of
the  Energy  Policy Act.  The Electric Operating Companies compete  in
the   wholesale   energy   markets  with   other   public   utilities,
cogenerators,  qualified facilities, exempt wholesale  generators  and
others for sales of electric power.

      Under  the  Energy  Policy Act, the FERC  has  approved  several
proposals by utility companies to sell wholesale power at market-based
rates  and provide to electric utilities "open access" to transmission
systems,  subject  to  certain requirements.  The  adoption  of  these
proposals  increases  marketing opportunities for electric  utilities,
but  also exposes them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues
due  to  competition with alternative suppliers.   In  1993,  PSO  and
SWEPCO  filed  with the FERC tariffs under which they  make  available
firm  and  non-firm transmission services for other electric utilities
on  the  combined PSO and SWEPCO transmission systems in the Southwest
Power  Pool.  The FERC accepted the tariffs for filing on November  9,
1993.   In the event the FERC approves the Merger between CSW  and  El
Paso and denies CSW's request for rehearing wherein CSW asked FERC  to
reconsider  the imposition of a comparable service requirement,  these
tariffs could be superseded by a set of compliance tariffs which offer
point-to-point  and  network  transmission  service   on   terms   and
conditions  comparable  to  CSW's and  El  Paso's  use  of  their  own
transmission  systems.  As discussed, compliance tariffs could  expose
the merged CSW System to additional risks of loss of load from current
requirements  wholesale  customers purchasing power  from  alternative
suppliers   or   reduced  revenue  resulting  from  competition   with
alternative suppliers of electric power.

      CSW  and the Electric Operating Companies believe that, compared
to other electric utilities, the CSW System is well positioned to meet
future  competition.  The CSW System benefits from economies of  scale
and  scope by virtue of its size and is a relatively low-cost producer
of  electric  power.   Moreover, CSW is taking steps  to  enhance  its
marketing  and customer service, reduce costs, improve and standardize
business practices, and grow through strategic acquisitions, in  order
to position itself for increased competition in the future.

      CSW  is  unable  to predict the ultimate outcome  or  impact  of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or the CSW System.
As   the   wholesale  and  retail  electricity  markets  become   more
competitive,  however,  the principal factor  determining  success  is
likely  to be price, and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability
of capacity, and customer service.

Public Utility Regulatory Act
      PURA is the legal foundation for electric utility regulation  in
Texas.  PURA will expire on September 1, 1995, in accordance with  the
sunset  policy of the Texas Legislature, which applies  to  all  state
agencies,  unless the Texas Legislature reenacts PURA in  its  current
form  or in modified form.  Several proposals have been made to  amend
PURA which, among other things, provide for a market-driven integrated
resource  planning  process, pricing flexibility for  utilities  faced
with competitive challenges, incentive regulation and deregulation  of
the  wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT.  CSW is unable  to  predict
the  ultimate outcome of the 1995 session of the Texas Legislature and
in  particular  whether  amendments to  PURA  will  be  adopted.   If,
however, the Texas Legislature passes legislation permitting any  form
of  retail wheeling, such legislation could have an adverse impact  on
CPL and CPL's sales to its retail customers.

Regulatory Accounting
      Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71,  which  allows  for  the recognition and  recovery  of  regulatory
assets,  the  Electric Operating Companies have recognized significant
regulatory  assets  and  liabilities.  Management  believes  that  the
Electric  Operating Companies will continue to meet the  criteria  for
following  SFAS No. 71.  However, in the event the Electric  Operating
Companies  no longer meet the criteria for following SFAS  No.  71,  a
write-off of regulatory assets and liabilities would be required.  For
additional information regarding SFAS No. 71 reference is made to NOTE

<PAGE> 2-18
1,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities.

Holding Company Act
     The Holding Company Act generally has been construed to limit the
operations  of  a  registered holding company to a  single  integrated
public  utility  system,  plus  such  additional  businesses  as   are
functionally related to such system.  Among other things, the  Holding
Company  Act  requires  CSW and its subsidiaries  to  seek  prior  SEC
approval  before effecting mergers and acquisitions or pursuing  other
types  of  non-utility  initiatives.  Pervasive regulation  under  the
Holding  Company Act may impede or delay CSW's efforts to achieve  its
strategic  and  operating objectives, including its  pursuit  of  non-
utility  initiatives.   CSW is continuing its  efforts  to  repeal  or
modify the Holding Company Act in order to provide the flexibility  to
compete within the changing environment.

Consolidated Taxes
      The  Texas  Commission before 1992 allowed income  taxes  to  be
recovered  in  rates based on the federal income  tax  incurred  by  a
utility  as  if  it  were  a  stand-alone company.   This  stand-alone
approach  treated the regulated activities of a utility as a  separate
entity  and  considered  only those revenues  and  expenses  that  are
included  in  the utility's cost of service to calculate  the  federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.

      Beginning  in 1992, the Texas Commission changed its  method  of
calculating  the federal income tax component of rates to the  "actual
tax  approach."   The actual tax approach is an evolving  concept  but
generally  seeks to reflect in rates the actual tax liability  of  the
utility  irrespective  of its relationship to the  utility's  cost  of
service.  The approach reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions
which  are  not  considered for or included in setting rates  for  the
utility.

      The  Texas Commission is expected to use the actual tax approach
for calculating the recovery of federal income tax in the pending rate
cases  for CPL and WTU.  The impact of the actual tax approach on  the
prospective  rates  for  CPL and WTU cannot be  determined  since  the
application of the concept is unsettled.

      CSW  believes that the recovery of federal income taxes in rates
should  be  determined  on  the stand-alone  approach  for  ratemaking
purposes,  but there is no assurance this approach will be adopted  in
the  pending  CPL or WTU rate cases or the pending El  Paso  rate  and
Merger cases.

Environmental Matters
CERCLA and Related Matters
      The  operations of the CSW System, like those of  other  utility
systems, generally involve the use and disposal of substances  subject
to  environmental  laws.   The CERCLA, the  federal  "Superfund"  law,
addresses  the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous  substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault
or  the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include owners and
operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or generators  of
hazardous  substances.  Many states have similar laws.  Theoretically,
any  one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of a cleanup.
Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.

      The  Electric Operating Companies are subject to various pending
claims  alleging  that they are PRPs under federal or  state  remedial
laws  for  investigating  and cleaning up contaminated  property.  CSW
anticipates that resolution of these claims, individually  or  in  the
aggregate,  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect   on   CSW's
consolidated  results of operations or financial condition.   Although
the  reasons  for this expectation differ from site to  site,  factors
that are the basis for the expectation for specific sites include  the
volume  and/or  type of waste allegedly contributed  by  the  Electric
Operating  Company,  the estimated amount of costs  allocated  to  the
Electric Operating Company and the participation of other parties.

<PAGE> 2-19
MGPs
      Contaminated former MGPs are a type of site which utilities, and
others,  may have to remediate in the future under Superfund or  other
federal or state remedial programs.  Gas was manufactured at MGPs from
the  mid-1800s to the mid-1900s.  In some cases, utilities and  others
have faced potential liability for MGPs because they, or their alleged
predecessors, owned or operated the plants.  In other cases, utilities
or  others may have been subjected to such liability for MGPs  because
they acquired MGP sites after gas production ceased.

Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas
        SWEPCO  owns  a suspected former MGP site in Marshall,  Texas.
SWEPCO has notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination has  been
found  at the site.  As a result of sampling conducted at the  end  of
1993 and early 1994, SWEPCO is evaluating the extent, if any, to which
contamination  has impacted soil, groundwater and other conditions  in
the  area.   A  final  range  of  clean-up  costs  has  not  yet  been
determined,  but, based on a preliminary estimate, SWEPCO has  accrued
approximately  $2  million as a liability for this  site  on  SWEPCO's
books  as of December 31, 1993.  As more information is obtained about
the   site,  and  SWEPCO  discusses  the  site  with  the  TNRCC,  the
preliminary estimate may change.

Suspected  MGP  Site in Texarkana, Texas and Arkansas and  Shreveport, 
Louisiana
      SWEPCO also owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana, Texas
and  Arkansas.  The EPA ordered an initial investigation of this site,
as  well as one in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no longer owned  by
SWEPCO.  The contractor who performed the investigations of these  two
sites  recommended to the EPA that no further action be taken at  this
time.

Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
     SWEPCO has been notified by Mississippi Power Company that it may
be  a PRP at the former Biloxi MGP site formerly owned and operated by
a  predecessor  of  SWEPCO.  SWEPCO is working with Mississippi  Power
Company to investigate the extent of contamination at this site.   The
MDEQ  approved  a site investigation work plan and, in  January  1995,
SWEPCO  and  Mississippi Power Company initiated sampling pursuant  to
that  work  plan.   On an interim basis, SWEPCO and Mississippi  Power
Company are each paying fifty percent of the cost of implementing  the
site investigation work plan.  That interim allocation is subject to a
final  allocation in the future.  SWEPCO and Mississippi Power Company
are  investigating whether there are other PRPs at  the  Biloxi  site.
Until  the  extent  of  the  contamination  at  the  Biloxi  site   is
identified,  it  is unknown what, if any, additional investigation  or
cleanup may be required.

        Management  does not expect these matters to have  a  material
effect  on  CSW's  consolidated results  of  operations  or  financial
condition.

Clean Air Act Amendments
      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the  year 2000, the Electric Operating Companies will be required  to
hold  allowances  in  order  to  emit  sulfur  dioxide.   EPA  issues
allowances to owners of existing generating units based on historical
operating  conditions.  Based on the CSW System facilities plan,  CSW
believes  that the Electric Operating Companies' allowances  will  be
adequate  to  meet  their needs at least through  2008.   Public  and
private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.  CSW
presently has no intention of engaging in trading of allowances,  but
may  seek  to  do so in the future if market conditions  warrant  and
appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.  CSW estimates  that
it  and  the  Electric  Operating Companies will incur  approximately
$500,000 to prepare permit applications for the program.


<PAGE> 2-20
      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requires government studies to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission regulations and the air toxics study will have on CSW cannot
be determined at this time.

      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  CSW
expects  to  spend  an additional $4 million for annual  testing  of,
software  modifications  to, and maintenance of  continuous  emission
monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

EMFs
      Research  is  ongoing whether exposure to  EMFs  may  result  in
adverse health effects or damage to the environment.  Although  a  few
of  the  studies  to date have suggested certain associations  between
EMFs  and some types of adverse health effects, the research  to  date
has  not established a cause-and-effect relationship between EMFs  and
adverse  health  effects.  CSW cannot predict the impact  on  the  CSW
System  or the electric utility industry if further investigations  or
proceedings  were  to establish that the present electricity  delivery
system  is  contributing  to increased risk  or  incidence  of  health
problems.

       See  NOTE  10,  Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for
additional discussion of environmental issues.

Non-Utility Initiatives
      As indicated above, one component of CSW's four-part strategy to
meet  the  increasing  competition  and  fundamental  changes  in  the
electric  utility  industry is to expand CSW's  non-utility  business.
CSW  continues  to consider new business opportunities to  expand  its
energy  related business.  CSW's principal non-utility businesses  are
Transok  and  CSWE.  As discussed below, CSW recently formed  CSWI  to
seek  opportunities  internationally  for  investment  in  non-utility
generation.  CSW Communications was formed to provide a communications
network  for  the  CSW  System as well as third  parties.   While  CSW
believes  that non-utility initiatives are necessary to  maintain  its
competitiveness and to grow in the future, there can be  no  assurance
as to the level of success that will be attained in these initiatives.

Transok
      Transok  is  an intrastate natural gas gathering,  transmission,
marketing and processing company that provides natural gas services to
CSW  System  companies, predominately PSO, and to  non-affiliated  gas
customers  throughout  the  United  States.   Transok's  natural   gas
facilities are located in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas.  It  operates
gas  processing plants and markets natural gas liquids  produced  from
those plants to various markets.

CSWE
      CSWE, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSW, is authorized to develop
various  independent power and cogeneration facilities and to own  and
operate  such  non-utility  projects, subject  to  further  regulatory
approvals.   CSWE has an approximate 50% interest in  the  Brush,  Ft.
Lupton and Mulberry facilities which achieved commercial operation  in
1994.

Brush
      The  68  MW Brush project, located in Brush, Colorado,  achieved
commercial operation in January 1994, and provides steam and hot water
to  a  15-acre  greenhouse  and sells electricity  to  Public  Service
Company of Colorado.

Ft. Lupton
      The Ft. Lupton project, located in Colorado, provides steam  and
hot water to a 20-acre greenhouse and also sells electricity to Public
Service  Company  of  Colorado.  Phase I of the  Ft.  Lupton  project,
representing  122  MWs, achieved commercial operation  in  June  1994.
Phase  II  of  the project commenced operations in July 1994  bringing
total on-line capacity of the project to 272 MWs.

<PAGE> 2-21
Mulberry
      The Mulberry facility, a 117 MW gas-fired cogeneration plant  in
Polk County, Florida achieved commercial operation in August 1994  and
provides steam to a combined distilled water and ethanol facility  and
sells  electricity  to Florida Power Corporation  and  Tampa  Electric
Company.

Orange Cogen
     The Orange Cogen facility, in which CSWE holds a 50% interest, is
expected  to  commence operation in June 1995.  The 103 MW,  gas-fired
plant  in  Florida  will provide thermal energy  to  an  orange  juice
processor  and will sell electricity to Florida Power Corporation  and
Tampa  Electric  Company.  CSWE's O&M division plans  to  operate  the
plant.

Other Projects
      In  addition  to  these  projects, CSWE has  19  other  projects
totaling  more than 5,000 MW in various stages of development,  mostly
in  affiliation with other developers.  CSWE can provide no assurances
that  these  projects, which are subject to further  negotiations  and
regulatory approvals, will be commenced or completed and, if they  are
completed,   that  they  will  provide  the  anticipated   return   on
investment.

CSWI
      In  November 1994, CSWI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of  CSW,  was
formed  to  engage  in international activities including  developing,
acquiring,  financing and owning the securities  of  exempt  wholesale
generators and foreign utility companies.

      In 1994, CSWI continued with the Mexico initiative that began in
1992.   CSWI's  goal  is to participate in providing  Mexico's  future
electricity needs.  The geographical location of the CSW System offers
opportunities to provide bulk power sales to Mexico.  The  Mexico City
office  of  CSW,  opened in 1993, allows CSWI greater  access  to  key
Mexican   markets,   permitting  CSWI   to   more   readily   evaluate
opportunities   as  they  become  available.   However,   the   recent
devaluation  of the Mexican peso will slow previously projected  power
demand for the near-term.

CSW Communications
      In July 1994, CSW Communications, a wholly-owned subsidiary,  of
CSW,  was  formed to provide communication services to the CSW  System
and  non-affiliates.  One important goal of CSW Communications  is  to
enhance  services  to CSW System customers through  fiber  optics  and
other   telecommunications  technologies.   CSW  Communications   will
consolidate the future design, construction, maintenance and ownership
of  the  CSW  System's  telecommunications  networks.   In  1994,  CSW
announced  a  $9  million project in Laredo, Texas, to  install  fiber
optic  lines and coaxial cable to CPL residential customers  who  have
volunteered  to  take  part  in  this  pilot  program.   This  project
involving  CSW  Communications and CPL  will  demonstrate  the  energy
efficiency and cost savings that result from giving customers  greater
choice  and  control  over  their  electric  service.   These  energy-
efficiency  services will use only a portion of the  capacity  of  the
telecommunications  lines CSW Communications is  installing.   In  the
future,  CSW  Communications may, subject to any  required  regulatory
approvals,  seek  to lease the remaining capacity for  other  services
including  possibly  telephone  service,  cable  television  and  home
security systems.

Results of Operations

Overview Of Results
      CSW's  earnings increased to $394 million or $2.08 per share  in
1994  as compared to $308 million or $1.63 per share in 1993 and  $382
million  or  $2.03  per share in 1992.  The return on  average  common
stock equity was 13.4% in 1994 compared to 10.6% in 1993 and 13.5%  in
1992.   Electric operations contributed approximately  100%  of  total
earnings  in  1994  and 1993, and 95% in 1992.  In 1994,  earnings  at
Transok,  CSWE,  and CSW Credit totaling $34 million, were  offset  by
corporate expenditures including merger and acquisition activities and
the formation of two new subsidiaries.

<PAGE> 2-22
      Earnings  increased in 1994 compared to 1993  due  primarily  to
higher  KWH  sales  and  natural gas operations  and  decreased  costs
associated  with  the end of the outage at STP.   In  addition,  CSWE,
which  had  three projects become operational during 1994, contributed
$2  million  to  earnings.   These  items  were  partially  offset  by
increased   interest   and  depreciation  and  amortization   expense.
Earnings  in  1993  were  significantly  affected  by  several   items
described below:

                               (millions,after-tax)
Restructuring charges                $(63)
Recognition of unbilled revenues       49
Early adoption of SFAS No. 112         (9)
Adoption of SFAS No. 109                6
Establishment of reserves for   
  fuel and other properties           (11)
Prior year tax adjustments            (18)

      In  addition to the aforementioned items, earnings in 1993  were
below  1992  levels due to additional costs primarily associated  with
the outage at STP, higher benefit costs as a result of the adoption of
SFAS  No.  106, higher taxes other than income as a result  of  school
funding tax increases in Texas, and the increase in the federal income
tax rate from 34% to 35%.  These items were partially offset by higher
KWH  sales  in  1993  due primarily to more normal  weather  than  was
experienced in 1992.

Operating Revenues
      Revenues decreased 2% in 1994, after increasing 12% in 1993  and
8% in 1992 from the previous years due to the following items:

                          Revenue Increase (Decrease)
                                From Prior Year

Electric Revenues
     Electric revenues increased $10 million in 1994 compared to 1993.
Total  KWH sales increased approximately 6%, with increases  in  sales
among  all  customer  classes.  During 1994,  the  average  number  of
customers increased approximately 2%.  In addition to customer growth,
there  was slightly more favorable weather during 1994 as compared  to
1993.  However, offsetting much of the increases in revenue due to KWH
sales,  fuel revenues were down substantially during 1994 compared  to
1993.   Fuel  costs  incurred  in the generation  of  electricity  are
typically passed through to the customers, so decreases in fuel  costs
will  cause  a corresponding decrease in fuel revenues.   Fuel  costs,
which decreased during 1994, are more fully discussed below under Fuel
and  Purchased Power. Fuel revenues increased in 1993 compared to 1992
due to higher per unit costs of fuel and purchased power.

<PAGE> 2-23
     Base rates increased slightly at PSO because of changes in retail
customers'  rates, and decreased due to a 3.2% interim rate  reduction
at  WTU implemented during the fourth quarter of 1994.  Because  PSO's
increased   base   rates,  finalized  in  December  1993,   were   not
significantly  higher than the interim rates that had been  in  effect
throughout  the year, base rates had little overall change from  1993.
As  part  of a stipulated agreement reflecting its rate increase,  PSO
agreed that it will not file for an increase in base rates until after
June  30,  1995.  During  late 1993 and early  1994,  several  parties
initiated  actions, which, if approved, would lower CPL's base  rates.
The  review of CPL's rates arose out of the unscheduled outage at  STP
as discussed above under the heading Rates and Regulatory Matters, CPL
Rate Inquiry.

NOTE 10, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings.

The  percentage  changes  in KWH sales for the  three  years  were  as
follows:

                          KWH Sales Increase (Decrease)
                                 From Prior Year
                           1994        1993       1992
Residential                 2.9%        9.0%      (4.2)%
Commercial                  3.8         4.8       (1.1)
Industrial                  3.6         5.5        3.1
Sales for resale           21.9        (6.6)       5.4
Total sales                 5.5         4.9        0.1

      KWH  sales to retail customers increased in 1994 and 1993  as  a
result  of more favorable weather and increased residential customers.
In  addition,  KWH  sales grew in all of the other  customer  classes.
SWEPCO  acquired  BREMCO  in July 1993, and  accordingly,  there  were
twelve months of KWH sales to these customers in 1994 compared to only
six  months in 1993.  Weather was more favorable in 1994 than in 1993,
while  extremely mild weather was experienced in 1992.  The  continued
increases  in industrial sales over the last three years  reflect  the
increased  marketing efforts by the Electric Operating  Companies  and
the  continued  improvement in the economy  throughout  their  service
areas.  Sales for resale increased in 1994 because STP was operational
for  most of the year, whereas in 1993, plants in the CSW System  were
producing power to replace the power normally produced at STP.

      The  Electric  Operating Companies have  maintained  competitive
rates  in  an  increasingly  competitive  marketplace.   Efforts  have
increased  at each of the Electric Operating Companies to attract  new
customers   while   efficiently  serving  all   customers.    Economic
conditions  in  the service areas of the Electric Operating  Companies
are expected to continue to improve in 1995.

Natural Gas Revenues
      Revenues from natural gas decreased 14% in 1994 due primarily to
a  decrease in the price of gas, even though total natural gas volumes
increased 4% from 1994 to 1993.  However,  lower gas sales prices were
mitigated  by  lower  gas purchase prices, which are  described  below
under  Gas  Purchased for Resale.  The lower gas sales  revenues  were
partially  offset  by  both  increased  gathering  and  transportation
revenues  and  increased  natural  gas  liquids  processing  revenues.
Gathering and transportation sales volumes increased 12% primarily  as
a  result  of  a  pipeline extension completed during  1994,  and  gas
liquids  processing volumes increased 12% during 1994.  Revenues  from
natural  gas  increased  22% in 1993 from 1992  due  primarily  to  an
increase in sales volumes and to a lesser extent an increase in  sales
prices.  A portion of this increase is attributable to the acquisition
of  the  NGC Anadarko Gathering System in 1993.  Revenue increases  in
1993  from  natural  gas  liquids are due to increased  sales  volumes
combined with slightly higher prices.

<PAGE> 2-24
Other Diversified Revenues
     Other diversified revenues increased 38% from 1994 as compared to
1993  due  to  the reclassification of CSWE's operating revenues  more
fully  discussed  below  under  Other Income  and  Deductions.   Other
diversified  revenues increased substantially in 1993 as  compared  to
1992  because  CSW  Credit  began  factoring  the  receivables  of   a
significant non-affiliated utility in January 1993.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expense
       During   1994,  the  Electric  Operating  Companies   generated
approximately 95% of their electric energy requirements.  During  1993
and  1992, they generated 92% and 94%, respectively.  Total  fuel  and
purchased power expenses decreased 4% during 1994 due to a decrease in
fossil fuel costs and increased usage of lower cost nuclear fuel.  The
average unit cost of fuel was $1.82 during 1994, compared to $2.11 and
$1.92  for 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Several contracts with  major
fuel  suppliers  and carriers have been recently renegotiated.   These
settlements have contributed to the lower cost of fuel.  In  addition,
because STP restarted and Units 1 and 2 reached 100% capacity in April
and  June of 1994, respectively, lower cost nuclear fuel was utilized,
whereas  the  1993  outage required higher cost  energy  purchases  to
replace STP's nuclear power.  The increase in fuel and purchased power
expense in 1993 compared to 1992 is attributable to higher natural gas
costs as well as the cost of STP replacement power.

Gas Purchased for Resale/Gas Extraction and Marketing
      Gas  purchased for resale decreased 30% in 1994 from 1993, while
it  increased  29%  in 1993 from 1992.  Lower gas  prices  caused  the
decrease  in  1994,  including a significant portion  attributable  to
sales  made on natural gas drawn from storage.  Increased natural  gas
prices   and   increased  pipeline  capacity  from  Transok's   recent
acquisitions  caused the 1993 increase.  Gas extraction and  marketing
expenses increased 14% in 1994 from 1993 and 19% in 1993 from 1992 due
to  higher  input  costs associated with higher  natural  gas  liquids
processing volumes.

Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses and Taxes
      Other  operating and maintenance expenses decreased 8%  in  1994
compared  to 1993, due primarily to the absence of expenses that  were
incurred  during  the 1993 STP outages.  In 1993, in addition  to  $29
million in maintenance costs associated with the STP outage, operating
expenses  increased compared to 1992 due to expenses  associated  with
the  adoption  of  SFAS  106,  reserves taken  on  lignite  and  other
property, corporate expenditures, and other administrative and general
expenses.  Federal income taxes were higher in 1994 than 1993  due  to
higher  pre-tax income.  Federal income taxes were lower in 1993  than
1992 due to lower pre-tax income offset in part by tax adjustments and
the  increase  in the corporate tax rate from 34% to  35%,  which  was
effective  retroactive to January 1, 1993.  Taxes other  than  federal
income remained comparable in 1994 from 1993, while they increased  in
1993 compared to 1992 due to school funding tax increases in Texas.

Restructuring Charges
      In  1994, the original restructuring accrual of $97 million that
had been recorded in 1993 was reduced by $9 million.  Accordingly, the
final costs associated with the CSW System's restructuring totaled $88
million over the two year period.  For additional information on CSW's
restructuring, see Restructuring, above.

Depreciation and Amortization
      Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 1994 compared
to  1993  and also 1993 compared to 1992 as a result of  increases  in
depreciable plant.

Inflation
      Annual  inflation  rates, as measured by the  national  Consumer
Price  Index,  have averaged about 2.7% during the three  years  ended
December  31,  1994.   Management believes that  inflation,  at  these
levels,  does  not  materially affect CSW's  consolidated  results  of
operations  or financial position.  However, under existing regulatory
practice,  only  the  historical cost of  plant  is  recoverable  from

<PAGE> 2-25
customers.   As a result, cash flows designed to provide  recovery  of
historical plant costs may not be adequate to replace plant in  future
years.

Other Income and Deductions
      Other income and deductions increased $18 million or 19% in 1994
compared  to  1993,  as  a  result of the reclassification  of  CSWE's
operating  activities  offset  partially  by  decreased  Mirror   CWIP
liability amortization and the absence of adjustments recorded in 1993
associated with Transok's 1991 acquisition of TEX/CON.  Prior to 1994,
CSWE  was in the developmental stage of its business, so its operating
activities  were  classified  in CSW's Other  Income  and  Deductions.
However, in conjunction with the completion of three projects in 1994,
CSWE's  revenues and expenses were classified as operating  activities
in  CSW's  Other  Diversified Revenues and Other  Operating  Expenses.
Both  of these components had negative earnings impacts classified  in
Other  Income  and  Deductions in 1993.  Other Income  and  Deductions
increased  $11  million  or  13% in 1993 from  1992  due  in  part  to
Transok's aforementioned TEX/CON acquisition adjustments and  slightly
higher  Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction  partially
offset by decreased Mirror CWIP liability amortization.

Interest Expense
      Interest  expense  on long-term debt in 1994 was  comparable  to
1993, whereas 1993 interest expense was substantially lower than  1992
due  to long-term debt refinancings, which lowered CSW's embedded cost
of  long-term debt from 8.3% in 1992 to 7.8% in 1993.  CSW's  embedded
cost of long-term debt decreased slightly to 7.7% in 1994.  Short-term
interest  expense increased in 1994 due primarily to higher short-term
interest rates combined with higher general corporate borrowings,  and
in  1993 because of increased borrowings attributable to the expansion
of  CSW  Credit's business, interim financing of CSWE's projects,  and
various corporate initiatives.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
      In 1993, CSW implemented SFAS No. 112, SFAS No. 109, and changed
the  method of accounting for unbilled revenues.  These changes had  a
cumulative effect of increasing net income approximately $46 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Public Utility Regulation
  CSW  is  subject  to regulation by the SEC as a registered  holding
  company  under the Holding Company Act.  CSW's Operating  Companies
  are  also  regulated  by  the SEC under the  Holding  Company  Act.
  CSW's  four Electric Operating Companies, Central Power  and  Light
  Company,  Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Southwestern Electric
  Power  Company,  and West Texas Utilities Company, are  subject  to
  regulation  by the FERC under the Federal Power Act and follow  the
  Uniform  System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC.  The  Operating
  Companies  are subject to further regulation with regard  to  rates
  and other matters by state regulatory commissions.

  CSW Credit
  CSW  Credit,  as  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  CSW,  purchases,
  without  recourse, the billed and unbilled accounts  receivable  of
  the Operating Companies and certain non-affiliated companies.

  The   more   significant  accounting  policies  of  CSW   and   its
  subsidiaries are summarized below:

  Principles of Consolidation
  The  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  CSW
  and  its subsidiary companies.  All significant intercompany  items
  and transactions have been eliminated.

  Plant
  Electric  utility  plant  is  stated  at  the  original   cost   of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct   labor,  materials,  overhead  items  and  allowances   for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.  Transok's  gas
  plant  acquisitions are stated at fair market value  based  on  the
  purchase price while other gas plant is stated at original cost  of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct labor, materials, overhead items and capitalized interest.

  Depreciation
  Provisions  for  depreciation  of  plant  are  computed  using  the
  straight-line method, generally at individual rates applied to  the
  various  classes  of  depreciable  property.   The  annual  average
  consolidated composite rate was 3.2% for 1994, 1993 and 1992.

  Nuclear Decommissioning
  At  the  end of STP's service life, decommissioning is expected  to
  be  accomplished using the decontamination method, which is one  of
  the  techniques  acceptable to the NRC.   Using  this  method,  the
  decontamination activities occur as soon as possible after the  end
  of  plant operations.  Contaminated equipment is cleaned or removed
  to  a  permanent  disposal  location  and  the  site  is  generally
  returned to its pre-plant state.

  CPL's  decommissioning costs are accrued and funded to an  external
  trust  over  the  expected service life  of  the  STP  units.   The
  existing  NRC  operating licenses will allow the operation  of  STP
  Unit  1  until  2027, and Unit 2 until  2028.  The  accrual  is  an
  annual   level  cost  based  on  the  estimated  future   cost   to
  decommission  STP, including escalations for expected inflation  to
  the  expected  time  of decommissioning, and  is  net  of  expected
  earnings on the trust fund.

  CPL's  portion  of the costs of decommissioning STP were  estimated
  to  be  $85 million in 1986 dollars based on a site specific  study
  completed  in 1986.  CPL is recovering these decommissioning  costs
  through  rates based on the service life of STP at a rate  of  $4.2
  million  per year.  The $4.2 million annual cost of decommissioning
  is  reflected  on the income statement in other operating  expense.
  Decommissioning  costs  are paid to an irrevocable  external  trust

<PAGE> 2-32
  and  as such are not reflected on CPL's balance sheet.  At December
  31, 1994, the trust balance was $19.3 million.

  In  May 1994, CPL received a new decommissioning study updating the
  cost  estimates to decommission STP that indicated that CPL's share
  of  such  costs would increase from $85 million, as stated in  1986
  dollars,  to $251 million, as stated in 1994 dollars.  The increase
  in  costs  occurred  primarily  as a  result  of  extended  on-site
  storage  of  high level waste, much higher estimates  of  low-level
  waste  disposal  costs and increased labor costs  since  the  prior
  study.   These costs are expected to be incurred during  the  years
  2027  through  2062.  While this is the best estimate available  at
  this  time, these costs may change between now and when  the  funds
  are  actually  expended because of changes in the assumptions  used
  to  derive  the  estimates, including the prices of the  goods  and
  services  required  to accomplish the decommissioning.   Additional
  studies will be completed periodically to update this information.

  Based  on  this  projected cost to decommission STP, CPL  estimates
  that  its  annual funding level should increase to  $10.0  million.
  CPL  has  requested this amount as part of its cost of  service  in
  its  current rate filing. Other parties to the rate proceeding have
  filed  their  projections of the annual amount, which  have  ranged
  from  $4.5  million to $8.1 million.  CPL expects to  fund  at  the
  level  ultimately  ordered  by the Texas  Commission  although  CPL
  cannot  predict what that level will be.  Historically,  the  Texas
  Commission  has  allowed  full recovery of nuclear  decommissioning
  costs.   For further information on CPL's current rate filing,  see
  NOTE  10,  Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Texas Commission
  Proceedings, below.

  Electric Revenues and Fuel
  Prior  to January 1, 1993, electric revenues were recorded  at  the
  time  billings  were  made to customers on a  cycle-billing  basis.
  Electric  service provided subsequent to billing dates through  the
  end  of  each  calendar month became part of operating revenues  of
  the  next  month.   To conform to general industry  standards,  the
  Electric Operating Companies changed their method of accounting  to
  accrue  for estimated unbilled revenues.  The effect of this change
  on  1993  net  income was pre-tax increase of $75 million,  and  an
  after-tax  increase of $49 million, included in  cumulative  effect
  of changes in accounting principles.

  CPL,  SWEPCO  and  WTU  recover fuel costs  in  Texas  as  a  fixed
  component  of  base  rates  whereby  over-recoveries  of  fuel  are
  payable  to  customers  and  under-recoveries  may  be  billed   to
  customers  after Texas Commission approval.  The cost  of  fuel  is
  charged  to  expense  as  consumed.  See NOTE  10,  Litigation  and
  Regulatory   Proceedings,  for  further  information   about   fuel
  recovery.

  PSO  recovers fuel costs in Oklahoma and SWEPCO recovers fuel costs
  in   Arkansas   and  Louisiana  through  automatic  fuel   recovery
  mechanisms.   The  application  of  these  mechanisms   varies   by
  jurisdiction.

  Each  of  the  Electric  Operating Companies  recovers  fuel  costs
  applicable  to  wholesale customers, which  are  regulated  by  the
  FERC, through an automatic fuel adjustment clause.

  CPL amortizes the costs of nuclear fuel to fuel expense based on  a
  ratio  of  the  estimated  Btu's used  and  available  to  generate
  electric  energy,  and includes a provision  for  the  disposal  of
  spent nuclear fuel.
  
  Accounts Receivable
  Each of the Operating Companies sells its billed and unbilled
  accounts receivable, without recourse, to CSW Credit.
  
  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
  For their regulated activities, each of the Electric Operating
  Companies follows SFAS No. 71 which defines the criteria for
  establishing regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities.
  Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue to the company
  associated with certain costs which will be recovered from
  customers through the ratemaking process.  Regulatory liabilities

<PAGE> 2-33
  represent probable future refunds to customers.  At December 31,
  1994 and 1993, the CSW System had recorded the following
  significant regulatory assets and liabilities:

                                         1994    1993
                                          (millions)

               Regulatory Liabilities
               Mirror CWIP liability       41     109

  Deferred Plant Costs
  In  accordance  with orders of the Texas Commission,  WTU  and  CPL
  deferred  operating,  depreciation  and  tax  costs  incurred   for
  Oklaunion  Power  Station  Unit  1 and  STP,  respectively.   These
  deferrals  were  for  the period beginning on  the  date  when  the
  plants  began commercial operation until the date the  plants  were
  included  in rate base. The deferred costs are being amortized  and
  recovered  through  rates over the lives of the respective  plants.
  See  NOTE  10, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings,  for  further
  discussion of WTU's and CPL's deferred accounting proceedings.

  Mirror CWIP
  In   accordance  with  Texas  Commission  orders,  CPL   previously
  recorded  a  Mirror CWIP asset, which is being amortized  over  the
  life  of STP. For more information regarding Mirror CWIP, reference
  is made to NOTE 10, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings.
  Statements of Cash Flows
  Cash   equivalents  are  considered  to  be  highly   liquid   debt
  instruments  purchased  with a maturity of three  months  or  less.
  Accordingly,   temporary  cash  investments  are  considered   cash
  equivalents.

  Reclassification
  Certain  financial  statement  items  for  prior  years  have  been
  reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

  Accounting Changes
  Effective  January 1, 1993, the CSW System adopted  SFAS  No.  106,
  SFAS  No. 112 and  SFAS No. 109. See NOTE 2, Federal Income  Taxes,
  for  further information regarding SFAS No. 109.  In addition,  the
  Electric   Operating  Companies  also  changed  their   method   of
  accounting for unbilled revenues.  See Electric Revenues  and  Fuel
  above for further information.

  The  adoption  of  SFAS No. 106 resulted in  an  increase  in  1993
  operating expenses of $16 million.  The adoption of SFAS  No.  109,
  SFAS  No.  112  and the change in accounting for unbilled  revenues
  are  presented  as  a  cumulative effect of changes  in  accounting
  principles as shown below:


<PAGE> 2-34
                        Pre-Tax        Tax        Net Income     EPS

                                     (millions, except EPS)
    SFAS No. 109         $ --          $  6           $ 6       $0.03
    SFAS No. 112          (13)            4            (9)      (0.05)          
    Unbilled revenues      75           (26)           49        0.26   
    Total                 $62          $(16)          $46       $0.24

  Pro  forma  amounts,  assuming that the change  in  accounting  for
  unbilled   revenues  had  been  adopted  retroactively,   are   not
  materially  different from amounts previously  reported  for  prior
  years.

2.Federal Income Taxes
  The  CSW  System adopted the provisions of SFAS No.  109  effective
  January  1, 1993.  The net effect on CSW's earnings was a  one-time
  adjustment  to  increase  net income by $6  million  or  $0.03  per
  share.   This  adjustment was recorded as a  cumulative  effect  of
  change  in  accounting principle.  The benefit was attributable  to
  the  reduction in deferred taxes associated with CSW's  non-utility
  operations previously recorded at rates higher than current rates.

  For  utility operations, there were no material effects of SFAS No.
  109  on CSW's earnings.  As a result of this change, CSW recognized
  additional  accumulated  deferred income  taxes  from  its  utility
  operations  and corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities  to
  ratepayers in amounts equal to future revenues or the reduction  in
  future  revenues required when the income tax temporary differences
  reverse  and are recovered or settled in rates.  As a result  of  a
  favorable  earnings  history, the CSW System  did  not  record  any
  valuation  allowance against deferred tax assets  at  December  31,
  1994 and 1993.

  CSW   files   a   consolidated  federal  income  tax   return   and
  participates in a tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries.
  The components of income taxes follow:

                                                1994    1993    1992

  The  mortgage  indentures,  as amended and  supplemented,  securing
  first  mortgage  bonds issued by the Electric Operating  Companies,
  constitute  a  direct  first  mortgage lien  on  substantially  all
  electric utility plant.

  The  Operating Companies may offer additional first mortgage  bonds
  and  medium-term  notes  subject to  market  conditions  and  other
  factors.

  Annual Requirements
  Certain  series  of  outstanding first mortgage bonds  have  annual
  sinking fund requirements, which are generally 1% of the amount  of
  each  such series issued.  These requirements may be, and generally
  have  been,  satisfied by the application of net  expenditures  for
  bondable  property  in an amount equal to 166-2/3%  of  the  annual
  requirements.  Certain series of pollution control bonds also  have
  sinking  fund  requirements.   At December  31,  1994,  the  annual
  sinking  fund requirements and annual maturities for first mortgage
  bonds and pollution control bonds for the next five years follow:

                                   Sinking Fund
                                   Requirements   Maturities

  Dividends
  The  subsidiary  companies'  mortgage indentures,  as  amended  and
  supplemented,  contain certain restrictions on  the  use  of  their
  retained earnings for cash dividends on their common stock.   These
  restrictions  do not limit the ability of CSW to pay  dividends  to
  its  stockholders.   At December 31, 1994, $1,375  million  of  the
  subsidiary companies' retained earnings were available for  payment
  of cash dividends to CSW.

  Reacquired Long-term Debt
  During  1994,  1993  and  1992,  the Electric  Operating  Companies
  reacquired $27 million, $987 million and $652 million of  long-term
  debt,  respectively,  including reacquisition  premiums,  prior  to
  maturity.   The  premiums  and  related  reacquisition  costs   and
  discounts  are  included  in long-term  debt  on  the  consolidated
  balance  sheets  and  are  being amortized  over  5  to  35  years,
  consistent with its expected ratemaking treatment.

  The  weighted  average cost of long-term debt was  7.7%  for  1994,
  7.8% for 1993 and 8.3% for 1992.

  Reference  is  made  to  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF
  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS,  Liquidity  and
  Capital  Resources,  for further information related  to  long-term
  debt, including new issues and reacquisition.

  The   outstanding   preferred  stock  not  subject   to   mandatory
  redemption  is  redeemable at the option of the Electric  Operating
  Companies  upon 30 days notice at the current redemption price  per
  share.   CPL's  auction preferred stock totaling $160 million  also
  may  be  redeemed  at par on any dividend payment  date.   The  CSW
  System's  authorized  number of shares of preferred  stock  totaled
  6.4 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

    Redemption prices of certain preferred stock decline at specified
  intervals  in  future periods.  The preferred stock issues  subject
  to  mandatory redemption are refundable at various times during the
  period  1995  through  1999.   The  minimum  annual  sinking   fund
  requirements of the preferred stock are $1.2 million for the  years
  1995  through  1999.  During 1994 and 1993, the Electric  Operating
  Companies  redeemed $33 million and $17 million,  respectively,  of
  preferred stock, including redemption premiums.

<PAGE> 2-38
  CPL
  The  dividends  on  CPL's  $160 million auction  and  money  market
  preferred  stocks  are  adjusted every 49 days,  based  on  current
  market  rates.   The dividend rates averaged 3.5%, 2.7%,  and  3.6%
  during 1994, 1993 and 1992.

  CPL  retired  its  remaining 10.05% preferred stock  during  August
  1994.

  WTU
  In  July  1993,  WTU redeemed 100,000 shares of its  7.25%  Series,
  $100  par  value, Preferred Stock, for $10 million,  in  accordance
  with  mandatory and optional sinking fund provisions.  The  capital
  required   for   this  transaction  was  provided   by   short-term
  borrowings from the CSW System money pool and internal sources.

  In  July  1994,  WTU redeemed the remaining 47,000  shares  of  its
  7.25% Series, $100 par value, Preferred Stock.

5.Common Stock
  On  March 6, 1992, CSW effected a two-for-one split of CSW's common
  stock  by  means  of a 100% stock dividend paid to stockholders  of
  record  on  February 10, 1992.  All references to number of  shares
  outstanding,   to   per  share  information  in  the   Consolidated
  Financial  Statements, and to the notes thereto have been  adjusted
  to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis.

  CSW  has  a  restricted stock plan and a stock option plan.   Under
  the  stock  option  plan,  3,833,000 shares  of  common  stock  are
  available  for grant and 491,000 shares are reserved  for  exercise
  of options which were outstanding at December 31, 1994.

  The  PowerShare dividend reinvestment plan is available to all  CSW
  stockholders,  employees, eligible retirees, utility customers  and
  other  residents  of  the four states where the Electric  Operating
  Companies  operate.  Plan participants are able  to  make  optional
  cash  payments  and reinvest all or any portion of their  dividends
  in  CSW  common shares.  During 1994, CSW raised approximately  $50
  million in common stock equity through PowerShare.

6.Financial Instruments
  The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate  the
  fair  value of each class of financial instruments for which it  is
  practicable to estimate fair value.
  
  Cash and temporary cash investments
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  Short-term investments
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity   of   those  instruments.   Short-term  investments   are
  classified  in  accounts  receivable on  the  consolidated  balance
  sheets.
  
  Long-term debt
  The  fair  value  of the CSW System's long-term debt  is  estimated
  based  on  the quoted market prices for the same or similar  issues
  or  on  the  current  rates offered to CSW for  debt  of  the  same
  remaining maturities.
  
  Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption
  The  fair  value  of  the Electric Operating  Companies'  preferred
  stock  subject  to  mandatory redemption  is   estimated  based  on
  quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  issues  or  on  the
  current  rates offered to CSW for preferred stock with the same  or
  similar remaining redemption provision.

<PAGE> 2-39
  Long-term debt and preferred stock due within 12 months
  The  fair  value  of  current  maturities  of  long-term  debt  and
  preferred stock due within 12 months are estimated based on  quoted
  market  prices  for the same or similar issues or  on  the  current
  rates  offered for long-term debt or preferred stock with the  same
  or similar remaining redemption provisions.
  
  Short-term debt
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  The  fair value does not affect CSW's liabilities unless the issues
  are redeemed prior to their maturity dates.
  
  The estimated fair values of  CSW's financial instruments follow:
  
                                              1994                1993

7.Short-Term Financing
  The  CSW  System has established a money pool to coordinate  short-
  term  borrowings  and  to make borrowings outside  the  money  pool
  through CSW's issuance of commercial paper.  At December 31,  1994,
  the  CSW  System had bank lines of credit aggregating $930  million
  to back up its commercial paper program.

  CSW  Credit,  which does not participate in the money pool,  issues
  commercial  paper  that  is  secured  by  the  assignment  of   its
  receivables.   CSW  Credit  maintains a  secured  revolving  credit
  agreement  which aggregated $900 million at December 31,  1994,  to
  back up its commercial paper program.

8.Benefit Plans
  Defined Benefit Pension Plan
  The  CSW System maintains a tax qualified, non-contributory defined
  benefit   pension  plan  covering  substantially   all   employees.
  Benefits are based on employees' years of credited service, age  at
  retirement,  and final average annual earnings with an  offset  for
  the   participant's  primary  Social  Security  benefit.   The  CSW
  System's   funding  policy  is  based  on  actuarially   determined
  contributions,  taking into account amounts  which  are  deductible
  for  income tax purposes and minimum contributions required by  the
  ERISA.  Pension plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  and
  short-term and intermediate-term fixed income investments.
  
  Contributions  to the plan for the years ended December  31,  1994,
  1993  and  1992  were  $28 million, $32 million  and  $29  million,
  respectively.
  
  The  approximate maximum number of participants in the plan  during
  1994   were   8,500   active  participants,  3,600   retirees   and
  beneficiaries and 1,000 terminated employees.

  A  reconciliation of the funded status of the plan to  the  amounts
  recognized on the balance sheets is shown below:

                                               December 31,
                                             1994        1993

          Prepaid pension cost               $ 64         $ 79

  The  vested  portion  of  the accumulated  benefit  obligations  at
  December  31,  1994  and 1993 was $626 million  and  $586  million,
  respectively.   The unrecognized net obligation is being  amortized
  over  the average remaining service life of employees or 16  years.
  Prepaid pension cost is included in other deferred charges  on  the
  consolidated balance sheets.

  In  addition  to  the  amounts shown in the above  table,  the  CSW
  System  has  a  non-qualified excess benefit plan.   This  plan  is
  available  to  all pension plan participants who  are  entitled  to
  receive  a  pension  benefit from CSW which is  in  excess  of  the
  limitations  imposed  on  benefits by  the  Internal  Revenue  Code
  through the qualified plan.  CSW's net periodic cost for this  non-
  qualified  plan  for the years ended December 31,  1994,  1993  and
  1992   was   $1.8   million,  $1.8  million   and   $0.5   million,
  respectively.

  Health and Welfare Plans
  The   CSW   System  had  medical,  dental,  group  life  insurance,
  dependent  life  insurance, and accidental death and  dismemberment
  plans  for  substantially  all active CSW System  employees  during
  1994.   The  contributions, recorded on a pay-as-you-go basis,  for
  the  years ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 were approximately  $17

<PAGE> 2-41
  million  and  $23 million, respectively.  Effective  January  1993,
  the  CSW  System's method of providing health benefits was modified
  to  include  such  benefits  as a health maintenance  organization,
  preferred  provider options, managed prescription  drug  and  mail-
  order  program and a mental health and substance abuse  program  in
  addition to the self-insured indemnity plans.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
  The  CSW System adopted SFAS No. 106 effective January 1, 1993. The
  effect  on  operating  expense  in 1993  was  an  increase  of  $16
  million.  The transition obligation is being amortized over  twenty
  years,  with  eighteen  years remaining.  In  prior  years,   these
  benefits were accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.

  The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost follow:

                                                1994      1993

9.Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
  The  Electric  Operating  Companies are parties  to  various  joint
  ownership  agreements  with  other non-affiliated  entities.   Such
  agreements  provide  for  the  joint  ownership  and  operation  of
  generating   stations   and   related  facilities,   whereby   each
  participant bears its share of the project costs.  At December  31,
  1994,   the  companies  have  undivided  interests  in  five   such
  generating stations and related facilities as shown below:

10.    Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings

  CPL
  STP
  From  February 1993 until May 1994, STP experienced an  unscheduled
  outage  which  has  resulted  in significant  rate  and  regulatory
  proceedings  involving CPL.  These matters, including a  base  rate
  case   and   fuel   reconciliation   proceedings,   are   discussed
  immediately below.

  Texas Commission Proceedings
  Base Rates
  Rate Inquiry - Docket No. 12820
  Several  Cities,  the Texas Commission General Counsel  and  others
  initiated  actions in late 1993 and early 1994 which,  if  approved
  by  the  Texas  Commission,  would lower  CPL's  base  rates.   The
  requests  for a review of CPL's rates arose out of the  unscheduled
  outage  at  STP which began in February 1993.  The STP  outage  did
  not  affect  CPL's  ability  to meet  customer  demand  because  of
  existing capacity and CPL's purchase of additional energy.

  Pursuant to a scheduling and procedural settlement agreement  among
  the  parties challenging CPL's rates, which was approved by a Texas
  Commission  ALJ  on  April  1, 1994, CPL submitted  a  rate  filing
  package  on  July  1, 1994 to the Texas Commission  justifying  its
  current  base rate structure.  In that filing, CPL stated  that  it
  had  a  $111  million  retail  revenue  deficiency  and  would   be
  justified  in  seeking a base rate increase.   However,  consistent
  with  the  procedural settlement agreement, CPL has not  sought  to
  increase  base rates as a part of this docket but seeks to maintain
  its  rates  at the same levels agreed to in the settlement  of  its
  last  two  rate cases in 1990 and 1991.  As part of  the  1990  and
  1991  settlements, CPL agreed to freeze base rates from January  1,
  1991   through  1994,  subject  to  certain  force  majeure  events
  including    double   digit   inflation,   major   tax   increases,
  extraordinary  increases in operating expenses or serious  declines
  in  operating  revenues.  On October 31, 1994, CPL  filed  rebuttal
  testimony   that   revised  its  retail   revenue   deficiency   to
  approximately  $103 million.  CPL continues to  maintain  that  its
  rates  are  reasonable and that its earnings are within established
  regulatory guidelines.


<PAGE> 2-43
  Parties  to  CPL's  base rate case have filed  testimony  with  the
  Texas  Commission  recommending reductions  in  CPL's  base  rates.
  Among  the  parties that filed testimony were OPUC which  initially
  recommended  an  annual $100 million retail rate reduction.   After
  hearings  on the rate case, OPUC claimed that CPL did not meet  its
  burden  of  proof concerning deferred accounting and  as  a  result
  OPUC  changed its proposed reduction to $147 million.  The  Cities,
  which are parties to the rate case, have recommended an annual  $75
  million retail rate reduction and the write-off of $219 million  of
  CPL's Mirror CWIP asset.  See Deferred Accounting below.

  The  Staff  filed  testimony recommending an  annual  reduction  in
  retail  rates  of  $99.6 million resulting from  a  combination  of
  proposed  rate  base  and  cost  of service  reductions,  which  it
  subsequently revised during the hearings to $83.9 million.  In  its
  final  brief to the ALJ, the Texas Commission's Staff withdrew  its
  recommendation that short-term debt be included in the  calculation
  of  CPL's weighted cost of capital.  CPL estimates that this change
  in  the  Staff's  position will lower its revised  proposed  retail
  rate  reduction by approximately $6 million.  The Staff recommended
  a  rate base disallowance of $407 million, or approximately 17%  of
  CPL's  investment  in  STP, based upon the Staff's  calculation  of
  historical  performance for STP compared to a peer group  of  other
  nuclear  facilities.  The Staff also recommended  that  accumulated
  depreciation and accumulated deferred federal income taxes  related
  to  the  disallowed portion of STP be adjusted  to  reflect  a  net
  reduction  to rate base of $325 million.  Additionally,  the  Staff
  proposed   to   disallow  depreciation  expense  related   to   the
  recommended STP disallowed plant.

  In  its testimony, the Staff argued that its proposed STP rate base
  reduction  was  a  historical performance-based  disallowance  that
  could  be  temporary in nature and would not have to  result  in  a
  permanent  disallowance.  The Staff indicated that, in the  future,
  CPL  could  seek recovery in rates of the proposed  STP  rate  base
  disallowance, subject to the performance of STP.

  The  Texas Commission held hearings in November and December  1994,
  and  all  parties  have  filed briefs in  the  case.   The  ALJ  is
  expected  to  issue  a recommended order for consideration  by  the
  Texas  Commission in April 1995, with a final order from the  Texas
  Commission  expected in May 1995.  Testimony filed  by  parties  to
  the  rate  case, including the Staff, is not binding on either  the
  ALJ or the Texas Commission.

  CPL  strongly believes that 100 percent of its investment  in  both
  units  of STP belong in rate base.  This belief is based on,  among
  other  factors,  Units 1 and 2 providing output  at  high  capacity
  factors since April and June 1994, respectively.  In addition,  the
  long-term   benefits  nuclear  generation  provides  to   customers
  supports their inclusion in rate base.  Furthermore, there  are  no
  Texas  Commission precedents addressing the removal  of  a  nuclear
  plant   from   rate  base  as  a  performance-based   disallowance.
  Assuming  both units of STP are included in rate base, CPL believes
  it  is  not  collecting  excessive revenues,  notwithstanding  that
  market  rates of return on common equity are generally lower  today
  than  they  were in 1990 and 1991, when CPL's base rates were  last
  set.

  Fuel
  Introduction
  Pursuant  to  the  substantive rules of the Texas  Commission,  CPL
  generally  is  allowed to recover its fuel costs  through  a  fixed
  fuel  factor.  These  fuel factors are in the nature  of  temporary
  rates,  and  CPL's collection of revenues by such fuel  factors  is
  subject  to  adjustment  at  the  time  of  a  fuel  reconciliation
  proceeding  before  the Texas Commission.  The  difference  between
  fuel  revenues billed and fuel expense incurred is recorded  as  an
  addition to or a reduction of revenues, with a corresponding  entry
  to   unrecovered  fuel  costs  or  other  current  liabilities,  as
  appropriate.   Any  fuel  costs, not limited  to  under-  or  over-
  recoveries,  which the Texas Commission determines as  unreasonable
  in a reconciliation proceeding are not recoverable from customers.

  Fuel Surcharge - Docket No. 12154
  In  July  1993,  CPL  filed  a fuel surcharge  petition,  which  is
  separate  from  a fuel reconciliation proceeding,  with  the  Texas
  Commission  to comply with the mandatory provisions  of  the  Texas
  Commission's  fuel  rules.  The petition requested  approval  of  a

<PAGE> 2-44
  customer  surcharge to recover under-recovered fuel  and  purchased
  power  costs  resulting from the STP outage, increased natural  gas
  costs  and  other  factors.  The petition also requested  that  the
  Texas Commission postpone consideration of the surcharge until  the
  STP  outage concluded or at the time fuel costs are next reconciled
  as  discussed  above.   In  August 1993,  a  Texas  Commission  ALJ
  granted  CPL's request to postpone consideration of the  surcharge.
  In  January  and  July  of  1994, CPL updated  its  fuel  surcharge
  petition  to  reflect  amounts of under-recovery  through  November
  1993  and  May 1994, respectively.  Also, CPL further  updated  its
  petition  in  January  1995  to reflect amounts  of  under-recovery
  through  November 1994.  Likewise, CPL requested  and  was  granted
  postponement  of  the  updated  petitions  until  the  STP   outage
  concluded  or  at  the  time fuel costs are  next  reconciled.   On
  January 4, 1995, Docket No. 12154 was consolidated into Docket  No.
  13650.

  Prudence Inquiry - Docket No. 13126
  In  April  1994, the Texas Commission's General Counsel  and  Staff
  issued  a Request for Proposal for an audit of the STP outage,  and
  in  July 1994 a consultant was selected to perform the audit.   The
  purpose  of  the  audit is to evaluate the prudence  of  management
  activities  at  STP,  including the actions  of  HLP  and  the  STP
  management  committee, of which CPL is a participant.  Such  review
  will  include the time from original commercial operation  of  each
  unit  until  they  were returned to service from the  outage.   The
  findings  of this audit are expected to be incorporated  into  this
  proceeding.  CPL and HLP will pay the costs of the audit  but  will
  have no control over the ultimate work product of the consultant.

  In  June 1994, the Texas Commission's General Counsel initiated  an
  inquiry into the operation and management of STP which resulted  in
  the  establishment of this proceeding.  As part of the inquiry, CPL
  presented   certain   information  concerning   the   prudence   of
  management   activities  at  STP  relating  to  the   STP   outage.
  Testimony filed by CPL stated that the cause of the STP outage  was
  the   result  of  an  accidental  equipment  failure  rather   than
  imprudent   management   activities  at   STP.    Based   on   this
  information,   CPL   will   seek  full   recovery   in   its   fuel
  reconciliation case of incremental energy costs related to the  STP
  outage.

  As  a part of this proceeding, CPL was required to reconstruct  its
  production  costs  assuming  STP was available  100%  of  the  time
  during  the actual outage.  Testimony filed by CPL stated  that  it
  is  unrealistic  to expect any generating unit to operate  all  the
  time.   The  testimony  provided calculations  of  STP  replacement
  power  cost  estimates  for availability factor  scenarios  at  (i)
  100%,  (ii) 75% and (iii) 65% average availability.  Based on these
  average  availability factors, STP net replacement power costs  for
  the  entire  outage period were estimated to be (i) $104.5  million
  at  100%, (ii) $79.0 million at 75% and (iii) $68.2 million at  65%
  average availability.

  The  results of this prudence inquiry are expected to  be  used  in
  CPL's  pending fuel reconciliation proceeding in Docket No.  13650,
  as  discussed  below, and possibly CPL's next base rate  proceeding
  should  a  return  on  equity  penalty  be  ordered  by  the  Texas
  Commission.   Such  penalty could lower  CPL's  allowed  return  on
  equity  in its next base rate case from what it otherwise would  be
  permitted to earn.

  Fuel Reconciliation - Docket No. 13650
  On  November  15, 1994, CPL filed a fuel reconciliation  case  with
  the  Texas  Commission  seeking  to  reconcile  approximately  $1.2
  billion  of  fuel costs from March 1, 1990 through June  30,  1994.
  This  period includes the STP outage where CPL's fuel and purchased
  power  costs were increased as the power normally generated by  STP
  was  replaced  through sources with higher costs.  At December  31,
  1994,   CPL's  under-recovered  fuel  balance  was  $54.1  million,
  exclusive  of  interest.  This under-recovery of fuel costs,  while
  due  primarily to the STP outage, was also affected by  changes  in
  fuel   prices  and  timing  differences.   CPL  cannot   accurately
  estimate the amount of any future under- or over-recoveries due  to
  the  nature of the above factors.  CPL cannot predict how the Texas
  Commission  will  ultimately resolve the reasonableness  of  higher
  replacement energy costs associated with the STP outage.   Although
  the  Texas  Commission could disallow all or a portion of  the  STP
  replacement energy costs, such determination cannot be  made  until
  a  final  order is issued by the Texas Commission in  this  docket.

<PAGE> 2-45
  If  a significant portion of the fuel costs were disallowed by  the
  Texas  Commission, CSW could experience a material  adverse  effect
  on   its  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  the  year   of
  disallowance but not on its financial condition.

  CPL  continues to negotiate with the intervening parties to resolve
  Docket  Nos. 12820, 13126 and the STP portions of Docket No.  13650
  through settlement.  However, no settlement has been reached.

  Management  cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these regulatory
  proceedings.   However,  management  believes  that  the   ultimate
  resolution  of the various issues will not have a material  adverse
  effect  on  CSW's consolidated results of operations  or  financial
  condition.

  STP Background
  Final Orders
  In  October 1990, the Texas Commission issued the STP Unit 1  Order
  which  fully  implemented a stipulated agreement filed in  February
  1990  to  resolve dockets then pending before the Texas Commission.
  In  December 1990, the Texas Commission issued the STP Unit 2 Order
  which  fully  implemented  a stipulated agreement  to  resolve  all
  issues regarding CPL's investment in STP Unit 2.

  The  STP Unit 1 Order allowed CPL to increase retail base rates  by
  $144  million.   This  base rate increase  made  permanent  a  $105
  million  interim  base rate increase placed into  effect  in  March
  1990  and  a  $39  million interim base rate increase  placed  into
  effect  in  September 1989.  The STP Unit 2 Order  provided  for  a
  retail  base  rate  increase of $120 million effective  January  1,
  1991.   The  STP  Unit 1 Order also provided for  the  deferral  of
  operating  expenses  and carrying costs on STP  Unit  2.   A  prior
  Texas  Commission  order  had authorized deferral  of  STP  Unit  1
  costs.   See  Deferred  Accounting below.   Such  costs  are  being
  recovered through rates over the remaining life of STP.  Also,  the
  STP  Unit 1 Order authorized use of Mirror CWIP, pursuant to  which
  CPL  recognized  $360 million of carrying costs as deferred  costs,
  and established a corresponding liability to customers recorded  in
  Mirror  CWIP  Liability and Other Deferred Credits on  the  balance
  sheets.   In  compliance with the order, carrying  costs  collected
  through  rates during periods when CWIP was included in  rate  base
  were  recognized  as  a loan from customers.   The  loan  is  being
  repaid  through  lower rates from 1991 through  1995.   The  Mirror
  CWIP  liability  is  being reduced by the recognition  of  non-cash
  income during the period 1991 through 1995.  The Mirror CWIP  asset
  is being amortized to expense over the life of the plant.

  The  STP Unit 1 and 2 Orders resolved all issues pertaining to  the
  reasonable original costs of STP and the appropriate amount  to  be
  included  in  rate base.  Pursuant to the Texas Commission  orders,
  the original costs of CPL's total investment in STP is included  in
  rate  base.   As  indicated  under  the  heading  Texas  Commission
  Proceedings above, however, CPL is currently involved in base  rate
  and  fuel  proceedings  which  challenge  CPL's  right  to  recover
  certain costs associated with the STP outage.

  As  part  of  the stipulated agreement, CPL agreed to  freeze  base
  rates  from January 1, 1991 through 1994, subject to certain  force
  majeure   events  including  double-digit  inflation,   major   tax
  increases,   extraordinary  increases  in  operating  expenses   or
  serious   declines  in  operating  revenues.   CPL  may  file   for
  increases  in base rates, which would be effective after  1994  and
  subject  to  certain limitations.  The fuel portion  of  customers'
  bills  is  subject  to adjustment following the normal  review  and
  approval by the Texas Commission.

  The  stipulated agreements, as discussed above, were  entered  into
  by  CPL,  the  Staff and a majority of intervenors including  major
  cities  in  CPL's service territory and major industrial customers.
  These   intervenors  represent  a  significant  majority  of  CPL's
  customers.   CPL  and  the  TSA  reached  agreements,  which   were
  subsequently  approved by the Staff and other signatories,  whereby
  TSA  agreed not to oppose the stipulated agreements in any respect,
  except  with  regard to deferred accounting and rate design  issues

<PAGE> 2-46
  in  the  STP  Unit  1  Order.  OPUC and a coalition  of  low-income
  customers declined to enter into the stipulated agreements.

  In  January  1991,  the TSA, OPUC and the coalition  of  low-income
  customers  filed appeals of the STP Unit 1 Order in District  Court
  requesting reversal of the deferred accounting for STP Unit  2  and
  other aspects of that order.  In March 1991, the TSA, OPUC and  the
  coalition of low-income customers filed appeals of the STP  Unit  2
  Order  in  the  District Court requesting reversal of  that  order.
  These  appeals  are pending before the District  Court.   If  these
  orders   are   ultimately  reversed  on  appeal,   the   stipulated
  agreements   would  be  nullified  and  CSW  could   experience   a
  significant   adverse  effect  on  its  consolidated   results   of
  operations  and financial condition.  However, the parties  to  the
  stipulated  agreement,  should  it  be  nullified,  are  bound   to
  renegotiate  and  try  to  reach  a revised  agreement  that  would
  achieve  the same economic results.  Management believes  that  the
  STP Unit 1 and 2 Orders will be upheld.

  Deferred Accounting
  CPL  was granted deferred accounting for STP Unit 1 and 2 costs  by
  Texas  Commission orders.  These orders allowed CPL to defer  post-
  in-service  operating and maintenance costs,  including  taxes  and
  depreciation,  and carrying costs until these costs were  reflected
  in  retail  rates.   Deferred accounting had an immediate  positive
  effect  on net income in the years allowed, but cash earnings  were
  not  increased  until  rates went into  effect  reflecting  STP  in
  service.   See  Final Orders above.  The total  deferrals  for  the
  periods  affected were approximately $492 million with an after-tax
  net  income  effect  of  approximately $325  million.   This  total
  deferral  included  approximately  $270  million  of  pre-tax  debt
  carrying  costs.   Pursuant to the STP Unit 1 and 2  Orders,  CPL's
  retail  rates  include recovery of STP Unit 1 and 2 deferrals  over
  the remaining life of the plant.

  In  July  1989,  OPUC  and  the  TSA filed  appeals  of  the  Texas
  Commission's final order in District Court requesting  reversal  of
  deferred  accounting  for  STP Unit  1.   In  September  1990,  the
  District  Court issued a judgment affirming the Texas  Commission's
  order  for STP Unit 1, which was subsequently appealed to the Court
  of  Appeals by OPUC and the TSA.  The hearing of CPL's STP  Unit  1
  deferred  accounting  order was combined by the  Court  of  Appeals
  with similar appeals of HLP deferred accounting orders.

  In  September  1992, the Court of Appeals issued  a  decision  that
  allows   CPL   to  include  STP  Unit  1  deferred  post-in-service
  operating  and maintenance costs in rate base.  However, the  Court
  of  Appeals held that deferred post-in-service carrying costs could
  not  be included in rate base, thereby prohibiting CPL from earning
  a return on such costs.

  After  the  Court  of  Appeals' denial of each party's  motion  for
  rehearing  of  the  decision,  CPL  and  the  Texas  Commission  in
  December 1992 filed Applications for Writ of Error petitioning  the
  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  to review the  September  1992  decision
  denying  rate  base treatment of deferred post-in-service  carrying
  costs  by  the  Court of Appeals.  Additionally, the TSA  and  OPUC
  filed  Applications for Writ of Error petitioning the Supreme Court
  of  Texas  to  reverse the Court of Appeals' decision,  challenging
  generally  the  legality  of  deferred  accounting  for  rate  base
  treatment  of  any deferred costs.  In May 1993, the Supreme  Court
  of  Texas granted CPL's Application for Writ of Error.  CPL's  case
  was  consolidated with the deferred accounting cases of El Paso and
  HLP.   In  June 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas sustained deferred
  accounting as an appropriate mechanism for the Texas Commission  to
  use  in  preserving  the  financial integrity  of  utilities.   The
  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  held  that  the  Texas  Commission   can
  authorize utilities to defer those costs that are incurred  between
  the  in-service date of a plant and the effectiveness of new rates,
  which  include  such costs.  On October 6, 1994, the Supreme  Court
  of  Texas  denied a motion for rehearing CPL's deferred  accounting
  matter  filed by the State of Texas.  The language of  the  Supreme
  Court  of  Texas  opinion  suggests  that  the  appropriateness  of
  allowing deferred accounting may need to again be reviewed under  a
  financial  integrity  standard at the time the  costs  begin  being
  recovered  through rates.  For CPL, that would be the  STP  Unit  1

<PAGE> 2-47
  and  Unit  2 Orders discussed above.  To the extent that additional
  review is required, it should occur in those dockets.

  If  these  deferred accounting matters are not favorably  resolved,
  CSW  could experience a material adverse effect on its consolidated
  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.   While   CPL's
  management  cannot predict the ultimate outcome of  these  matters,
  management  believes  CPL  will receive approval  of  its  deferred
  accounting  orders  or will be successful in renegotiation  of  its
  rate  orders, so that there will be no material adverse  effect  on
  CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

  Westinghouse Litigation
  CPL  and  other owners of STP are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed  in
  October  1990  in  the  District Court in Matagorda  County,  Texas
  against  Westinghouse, seeking damages and other relief.  The  suit
  alleges  that  Westinghouse  supplied  STP  with  defective   steam
  generator  tubes that are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.
  Westinghouse  filed  an answer to the suit in March  1992,  denying
  the  plaintiff's allegations.  The suit is set for  trial  in  July
  1995.

  Inspections  during  the STP outage have detected  early  signs  of
  stress  corrosion  cracking in tubes at  STP  Unit  1.   Management
  believes  additional problems would develop gradually and  will  be
  monitored  by the Project Manager of STP.  An accurate estimate  of
  the   costs   of  remedying  any  further  problems  currently   is
  unavailable  due  to  many  uncertainties,  including  among  other
  things,  the  timing of repairs, which may coincide with  scheduled
  outages,  and  the  recoverability of  amounts  from  Westinghouse.
  Management  believes that the ultimate resolution  of  this  matter
  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect on  CSW's  consolidated
  results of operations or financial condition.

  Civil Penalties
  In  October  1994, the NRC staff advised HLP that  it  proposes  to
  fine  HLP  $100,000  for what the NRC believes  was  discrimination
  against  a  contractor  employee at STP who brought  complaints  of
  possible  safety  problems to the NRC's attention.   These  actions
  resulted  from  the  findings  of a NRC  investigation  of  alleged
  violations  of  STP security and work process procedures  in  1992.
  The  incident  cited  by  the NRC is the  subject  of  a  contested
  hearing  that is scheduled to be held in the spring of 1995  before
  a  United  States Department of Labor judge.  Until the  Department
  of  Labor  issues a final decision in this matter, the NRC  is  not
  requiring HLP to respond to its notice of violation.

  PSO

  Rate Review
  In   December  1993,  the  Oklahoma  Commission  issued  an   order
  unanimously  approving  a  joint  stipulation  between   PSO,   the
  Oklahoma  Commission Staff, and the Office of the Attorney  General
  of  the  State of Oklahoma, as recommended by the ALJ.   The  order
  allowed  PSO  an increase in retail prices of $14.4 million  on  an
  annual  basis which represents a $4.3 million increase above  those
  authorized by the March 1993 interim order.  In January  1994,  the
  Oklahoma  Commission  issued an order unanimously  approving  PSO's
  price  schedules reflecting the $14.4 million price increase.   The
  new  prices  became effective beginning with the billing  month  of
  February 1994.

  The   December  1993  order  addresses,  among  other  things,  the
  following  issues.   PSO  will recover  $4.5  million  annually  in
  expenses  associated  with OPEBs, which,  for  PSO,  are  primarily
  health  care  related benefits.  Such expenses  will  be  recovered
  along  with amortization of the deferred 1993 OPEBs at  a  rate  of
  $0.5  million  per  year for 10 years.  PSO will amortize  deferred
  storm  expenses associated with both a 1987 ice storm  and  a  1992
  wind storm, amounting to $1.2 million per year for five years.   In
  addition,  the order recognizes the increase in federal income  tax
  expenses  resulting  from  the  recent  increase  in  the   federal
  corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent.  PSO  will
  continue to use the depreciation rates previously approved  by  the

<PAGE> 2-48
  Oklahoma  Commission.   PSO agreed that it will  not  file  another
  retail price increase application until after June 30, 1995.

  Gas Transportation and Fuel Management Fees
  An  order  issued by the Oklahoma Commission in 1991 required  that
  the  level of gas transportation and fuel management fees, paid  to
  Transok  by PSO, permitted for recovery through the fuel adjustment
  clause  be  reviewed in the aforementioned price proceeding.   This
  portion  of the price review was bifurcated.  In February 1995,  an
  agreement  was  reached  which allows PSO to recover  approximately
  $28.4  million of transportation and fuel management fees  in  base
  rates  using 1991 determinants and approximately $1 million through
  the fuel adjustment clause.  The agreement also requires the phase-
  in   of   competitive   bidding  of  natural   gas   transportation
  requirements  in  excess  of  165  MMcf/d  per  day.   An  ALJ  has
  recommended  approval of the agreement to the Oklahoma  Commission.
  A final order is expected in the first quarter of 1995.

  Gas Purchase Contracts
  PSO  has  been named defendant in complaints filed in  federal  and
  state  courts  of Oklahoma and Texas in 1984 through February  1995
  by  gas  suppliers  alleging  claims arising  out  of  certain  gas
  purchase  contracts.   Cases currently pending  seek  approximately
  $29  million  in actual damages, together with claims for  punitive
  damages  which, in compliance with pleading code requirements,  are
  alleged  to  be in excess of $10,000.  The plaintiffs  seek  relief
  through the filing dates as well as attorney fees.  As a result  of
  settlements  among the parties, certain plaintiffs dismissed  their
  claims  with prejudice to further action.  The settlements did  not
  have  a  significant  effect  on  CSW's  consolidated  results   of
  operations.   The  remaining suits are in the  preliminary  stages.
  Management   cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings.
  However,  management  believes  that  PSO  has  defenses  to  these
  complaints and intends to pursue them vigorously.  Management  also
  believes  that the ultimate resolution of the remaining  complaints
  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect on  CSW's  consolidated
  results of operations or financial condition.

  PCB Cases
  PSO  has been named a defendant in complaints filed in state  court
  in  Oklahoma  alleging,  among  other  things,  that  some  of  the
  plaintiffs  were contaminated with PCBs and other toxic by-products
  following   transformer  malfunctions.   The  complaints  currently
  total  approximately $383 million of which approximately  one-third
  represents  punitive  damages.  Some claims  have  been  dismissed,
  certain  of  which resulted in settlements among the parties.   The
  settlements   did   not  have  a  significant   effect   on   CSW's
  consolidated  results  of operations.  Although  management  cannot
  predict the outcome of these proceedings, management believes  that
  PSO  has  defenses  to  these claims and  intends  to  pursue  them
  vigorously.  Moreover, management has reason to believe that  PSO's
  insurance  may cover some of the claims.  Management also  believes
  that  the  ultimate  resolution of these  cases  will  not  have  a
  material   adverse   effect  on  CSW's  consolidated   results   of
  operations or financial condition.

  Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
  In  June  1992, PSO filed suit in Federal District Court in  Tulsa,
  Oklahoma,  against Burlington Northern  seeking declaratory  relief
  under  a  long-term contract for the transportation  of  coal.   In
  July  1992, Burlington Northern asserted counterclaims against  PSO
  alleging that PSO breached the contract.  The counterclaims  sought
  damages  in  an unspecified amount.  In December 1993, PSO  amended
  its   suit   against  Burlington  Northern  seeking   damages   and
  declaratory  relief under federal and state anti-trust  laws.   PSO
  and  Burlington  Northern  filed motions for  summary  judgment  on
  certain  dispositive issues in the litigation.  In March 1994,  the
  court  issued an order granting PSO's motions for summary  judgment
  and  denying  Burlington Northern's motion.  It was  not  necessary
  for  the  court  to decide the federal and state anti-trust  claims
  raised  by  PSO.   Judgment was rendered in favor  of  PSO  by  the
  United   States  District  Court  in  May  1994.   In  June   1994,
  Burlington  Northern appealed this judgment to  the  United  States
  Court  of  Appeals  for  the Tenth Circuit.   This  appeal  is  now
  pending.


<PAGE> 2-49
  Burlington Northern Arbitration
  In  May  1994, in a related arbitration, an arbitration panel  made
  an  award  favorable  to PSO concerning basic transportation  rates
  under  the  coal  transportation  contract  described  above,   and
  concerning  the  contract  mechanism  for  adjustment   of   future
  transportation  rates.  These arbitrated issues were  not  involved
  in  the related lawsuit described above.  Burlington Northern filed
  an  action to vacate the arbitrated award in the District Court for
  Dallas  County,  Texas.   PSO removed this  action  to  the  United
  States  District  Court  for the Northern District  of  Texas,  and
  filed   a  motion  to  either  dismiss  this  action  or  have   it
  transferred  to the United States District Court for  the  Northern
  District  of  Oklahoma.  Burlington Northern moved  to  remand  the
  action  to  state  court.   In September 1994,  the  United  States
  District   Court  for  the  Northern  District  of   Texas   denied
  Burlington  Northern's motion to remand, and granted  PSO's  motion
  to  transfer the action to the United States District Court for the
  Northern District of Oklahoma.  Separately, PSO filed an action  to
  confirm  the arbitration award in the United States District  Court
  for  the  Northern  District of Oklahoma, and  Burlington  Northern
  filed  a  motion to dismiss this confirmation action.  On  December
  6,   1994,  the  District  Court  entered  an  order  denying   the
  Burlington  Northern's motion to vacate the arbitration award,  and
  granting  PSO's  motion  to  confirm  the  arbitration  award.   On
  December  29, 1994, the District Court entered judgment  confirming
  the  arbitration award, including a money judgment in  PSO's  favor
  for  $16.4  million,  with interest at 7.2%  per  annum  compounded
  annually  from December 21, 1994 until paid.  On January  6,  1995,
  Burlington Northern  appealed the District Court's judgment to  the
  United  States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  This appeal
  is now pending.

  SWEPCO
  Fuel Reconciliation
  On  March  17,  1994,  SWEPCO  filed  a  petition  with  the  Texas
  Commission  to  reconcile fuel costs for the period  November  1989
  through  December 1993.  Total Texas jurisdictional  fuel  expenses
  subject   to   reconciliation  for  this   50-month   period   were
  approximately  $559 million.  SWEPCO's net under-recovery  for  the
  reconciliation period was approximately $0.9 million.   SWEPCO  and
  the  intervening parties in this proceeding were able to  negotiate
  a   stipulated  agreement  providing  a  $3.2  million  fuel   cost
  disallowance  and  settling  all issues  except  one.   That  issue
  involved  the  recovery  of  certain fuel  related  litigation  and
  settlement  negotiation  expenses.  The Texas  Commission,  at  its
  Final  Order  hearing on January 18, 1995, approved the  stipulated
  disallowance  and  granted  SWEPCO recovery  of  the  fuel  related
  litigation  expense.  The $3.2 million disallowance is included  in
  SWEPCO's  1994  results  of  operations.   SWEPCO  recognized   the
  litigation costs as expenses in prior periods.

  Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
  On  January  20,  1995,  a state district court  in  Bowie  County,
  Texas,  entered  judgment  in favor of  SWEPCO  against  Burlington
  Northern  in a lawsuit between the parties regarding rates  charged
  under  two  rail transportation contracts for delivery of  coal  to
  SWEPCO's  Welsh  and Flint Creek power plants.  The  court  awarded
  SWEPCO  approximately $72 million covering damages for  the  period
  from  April  27,  1989 through September 26, 1994  and  prejudgment
  interest  fees  and grant certain declaratory relief  requested  by
  SWEPCO.

  Kansas City Southern Railway Company Transportation Contracts
  In  March  1994, SWEPCO entered into a settlement with  the  Kansas
  City  Southern  Railway  Company of   litigation   between  parties
  regarding  two  coal  transportation contracts.   Pursuant  to  the
  settlement,  SWEPCO  and the Kansas City Southern  Railway  Company
  executed  a  new coal transportation agreement.  The settlement  is
  expected  to  result in a reduction of SWEPCO's coal transportation
  costs  now  and in the future.  Burlington Northern, another  party
  to  the  prior contracts and to the litigation, did not participate
  in  the  settlement  and  the litigation is still  pending  between
  SWEPCO and Burlington Northern.

<PAGE> 2-50
  WTU
  
  Rate Proceeding - Docket No. 13369
  On August 25, 1994, WTU filed a petition with the Texas Commission
  and  with cities with original jurisdiction to review WTU's rates,
  proposed an interim across-the-board base rate reduction of  3.25%
  or,  approximately $5.7 million, effective October  1,  1994,  and
  sought  until February 28, 1995, the time to develop  and  file  a
  RFP.  WTU also requested the ability to "true-up", back to October
  1,  1994, any difference in revenue requirements upon final  order
  of  the Texas Commission, and proposed that any increases over the
  pre-October  1,  1994, base rates be implemented prospectively  on
  the effective date of the final order.
  
  As  discussed  below, WTU's fuel reconciliation  was  consolidated
  with  this proceeding in September 1994.  Reconcilable fuel  costs
  during  the reconciliation period were approximately $300 million.
  At   June   30,   1994,  the  fuel  cost  under-recovery   totaled
  approximately $5.1 million, including interest.  At  December  31,
  1994,  this  amount had become an over-recovery  of  approximately
  $0.2 million.  WTU is not seeking a change in fuel factors.
  
  On  February  28,  1995, WTU filed with the Texas  Commission  and
  cities  with  original jurisdiction the rate filing package  which
  indicates  a  revenue deficiency of approximately  $14.5  million.
  However,  WTU  simultaneously filed with the parties a  settlement
  proposal  to reduce overall base rate revenue by 3.25%,  effective
  October  1,  1994,  an  annual impact in the rate  year  beginning
  January  1,  1996 of approximately $5.9 million.   The  settlement
  proposal  reflects  WTU's  desire to maintain  competitive  rates,
  recognizes  the  importance of competitive rates in  the  changing
  electric  service  marketplace,  and  demonstrates  WTU's   strong
  commitment to the long-term success of WTU and its customers.
  
  Unless  a  settlement  accelerates the schedule,  WTU  anticipates
  hearings  in mid-1995 with a final order in the fourth quarter  of
  1995.    Management  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  the   rate
  proceeding,  the fuel reconciliation, or the settlement  proposal,
  but  believes  that the ultimate resolution of these matters  will
  not  have a material adverse effect on CSW's consolidated  results
  of operations or financial condition.
  
  Fuel Reconciliation - Docket No. 13172
  On  June  30, 1994, WTU filed a petition with the Texas Commission
  to  reconcile  fuel  costs  for the period  January  1991  through
  February  1994.   Subsequently,  in  September  1994,  this   fuel
  reconciliation proceeding was consolidated into Docket  No.  13369
  described  above,  and  the  reconciliation  period  was  extended
  through June 1994.
  
  Rate Case Proceeding - Docket No. 7510
  In  November  1987, the Texas Commission issued a final  order  in
  WTU's  retail  rate  case providing for WTU to receive  an  annual
  increase  in  base  retail  revenues  of  $34.9  million.    Rates
  reflecting  the  final order were implemented  in  December  1987.
  WTU, along with certain intervenors in the retail rate proceeding,
  appealed the Texas Commission's final order to the District  Court
  seeking  reversal  of  various  provisions  of  the  final  order,
  including the inclusion of deferred accounting in rate base.
  
  The  appeals were consolidated and in September 1988, the District
  Court  affirmed  the  final  order of the  Texas  Commission.   In
  November  1988, certain intervenors filed appeals of the  District
  Court's judgment with the Court of Appeals.  In February 1990, the
  Court  of  Appeals  ruled that an intervenor had  improperly  been
  excluded  from  presenting  its  appeal  to  the  District  Court,
  reversed  the District Court's judgment and remanded the  case  to
  the District Court for further proceedings.
  
  In  October 1992, the District Court heard the remanded appeals of
  the  final order of the Texas Commission and in March 1993  issued
  an  order  affirming the Texas Commission's order in all  material
  respects  with the single exception of the inclusion  of  deferred
  
<PAGE> 2-51
  Oklaunion  carrying  costs  in rate base.   In  its  treatment  of
  deferred costs, the District Court followed a then-current opinion
  of the Court of Appeals which precluded recovery of deferred post-
  in-service  carrying costs.  In April 1993, WTU and other  parties
  filed  appeals,  and  oral argument was held  on  the  appeals  in
  December 1993 on the non-deferred accounting issues.  With respect
  to  the deferred accounting issues, the parties recognized certain
  Supreme   Court  of  Texas  decisions  regarding  other   deferred
  accounting cases would be influential in WTU's case.
  
  In June 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas issued its opinion in the
  three  other cases involving deferred accounting holding that  the
  Texas  Commission  has the authority to allow deferred  accounting
  treatment during the deferral period, including deferred  post-in-
  service  carrying  costs.  The Supreme Court of Texas  upheld  the
  Court  of Appeals in all respects except it reversed the Court  of
  Appeals  to the extent it disallowed carrying costs deferrals  and
  remanded  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  consideration  of  the
  unresolved   arguments  of  the  improperly  excluded  intervenor.
  Motions  for  rehearing were filed by certain parties  which  were
  denied  by  the Supreme Court of Texas.  These rulings  influenced
  the  Court  of  Appeals' decision in WTU's rate case  appeals,  as
  described below.
  
  On February 15, 1995, the Court of Appeals affirmed all aspects of
  the  District  Court  judgment relating to the Texas  Commission's
  allowance of non-Oklaunion depreciation rates and the surcharge of
  rate   case  expenses,  reversed  the  District  Court's  judgment
  relating to the exclusion of deferred Oklaunion carrying costs  in
  rate  base,  and  remanded the cause to the  Texas  Commission  to
  reexamine  the issue of deferred costs in light of the  remand  of
  Docket  No. 7289, as described above.  However, on March 3,  1995,
  WTU  filed a motion for rehearing at the Court of Appeals  seeking
  clarification of certain aspects of its order and arguing that the
  Court  of  Appeals  erred  in remanding  the  case  to  the  Texas
  Commission for it to determine to what extent deferred  costs  are
  necessary to preserve WTU's financial integrity because the  issue
  has been waived since it was not briefed or argued to the Court of
  Appeals.   WTU  expects other parties may also  file  motions  for
  rehearing.
  
  WTU's motion for rehearing may, if granted, prevent further review
  of  financial integrity issues with respect to deferred accounting
  in  any  remand  of  Docket No. 7510.   If  a  broader  remand  is
  permitted and if the Texas Commission concludes in Docket No. 7289
  that deferred accounting was necessary to preserve WTU's financial
  integrity  during the deferral period, the Texas  Commission  must
  decide  to  what  extent the deferred Oklaunion  costs,  including
  carrying   costs,  were  necessary  to  preserve  WTU's  financial
  integrity.   If WTU's deferred accounting treatment is  ultimately
  reversed  or  is  substantially reduced, WTU  could  experience  a
  material  adverse  impact  on its results  of  operations.   While
  management  can  give  no assurances as  to  the  outcome  of  the
  remanded  proceeding  or  the  motion  for  rehearing,  management
  believes that 100 percent of the Oklaunion deferred costs will  be
  determined  by  the  Texas Commission to have  been  necessary  to
  preserve  WTU's financial integrity during the deferral period  so
  that   there  will  be  no  material  adverse  effect   on   CSW's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
  
  Deferred Accounting - Docket No. 7289
  WTU  received approval from the Texas Commission in September 1987
  to  defer  operating expenses and carrying costs  associated  with
  Oklaunion  incurred  subsequent to its  December  1986  commercial
  operation  date  until  December 1987 (the deferral  period)  when
  retail  rates  including  Oklaunion  in  WTU's  rate  base  became
  effective.    WTU  has  recorded  approximately  $32  million   of
  Oklaunion deferred costs, of which $25 million are carrying costs.
  The  deferred  costs  are being recovered and amortized  over  the
  remaining  life  of the plant.  In November 1987,  OPUC  filed  an
  appeal  in  the District Court challenging the Texas  Commission's
  final  order  authorizing WTU to defer the costs  associated  with
  Oklaunion.  In October 1988, the District Court affirmed the final
  order  of  the Texas Commission.  In December 1988, OPUC filed  an
  appeal of the District Court judgment in the Court of Appeals.  In
  September  1990, the Court of Appeals upheld the District  Court's
  affirmance  of the Texas Commission's final order and  in  October
  1990,  OPUC filed a motion for rehearing of the Court of  Appeals'
  decision,  which was denied in November 1990.  On further  appeal,

<PAGE> 2-52
  the  Supreme Court heard oral argument in September 1993, in WTU's
  case  as  well as three other cases involving deferred  accounting
  and  in June 1994 issued its opinions in these cases affirming the
  Texas   Commission's   authority  to  allow  deferred   accounting
  treatment, but establishing a financial integrity standard  rather
  than the measurable harm standard used by the Texas Commission.
  
  In  October  1994,  the Supreme Court of Texas  issued  a  mandate
  remanding  WTU's deferred accounting case to the Texas Commission.
  While no schedule has yet been established for the proceedings  on
  remand  at the Texas Commission, this remand may be considered  in
  tandem  with  WTU's pending rate case, Docket No. 13369.   In  the
  remanded  proceeding,  the Texas Commission  must  make  a  formal
  finding  that  the  deferral of Oklaunion costs was  necessary  to
  prevent WTU's financial integrity during the deferral period  from
  being jeopardized.
  
  If  WTU's deferred accounting treatment is ultimately reversed and
  not  favorably  resolved, WTU could experience a material  adverse
  impact  on  its  results of operations.  While  management  cannot
  predict  the  ultimate  outcome of these  proceedings,  management
  believes   that  WTU's  deferred  accounting  will  be  ultimately
  sustained  by  the Texas Commission on the basis of the  financial
  integrity  standard set forth by the Supreme Court  of  Texas,  so
  that   there  will  be  no  material  adverse  effect   on   CSW's
  consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
  
  WTU FERC Order
  On April 4, 1994, the FERC issued an order pursuant to section 211
  of  the  Federal Power Act forcing a regional utility to  transmit
  power  to Tex-La on behalf of WTU.  The order was one of the first
  issued by FERC under that provision, which was added by the Energy
  Policy  Act  to  increase competition in wholesale power  markets.
  WTU  began serving Tex-La, which has requirements of approximately
  120  MW of electric power.  WTU will serve Tex-La until facilities
  are  completed to connect Tex-La to SWEPCO, an affiliated  system,
  at  which time SWEPCO will provide 85 MW and WTU will retain 35 MW
  of the Tex-La electric load.
  
  Other
  Cimmaron
  On  January  12, 1994, Cimmaron brought suit against  CSW  and  its
  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  CSWE, in the  125th  District  Court  of
  Houston, Harris County, Texas.  Cimmaron alleges that CSW and  CSWE
  breached  commitments to participant with Cimmaron  in  the  failed
  BioTech Cogeneration project located in Colorado.  Cimmaron  claims
  breach  of  contract,  fraud and negligent  misrepresentation  with
  alleged  damages  totaling $250 million,  punitive  damages  of  an
  unspecified amount, as well as attorney's fees.
  
  CSWE  filed a counterclaim against Cimmaron and third-party  claims
  against  the principals of Cimmaron on December 22, 1994,  alleging
  that  they  misrepresented and omitted material facts  about  their
  experience  and  background  and about  the  proposed  cogeneration
  project.   CSWE seeks damages of $500,000, the earnest  money  paid
  when  the letter of intent was executed, the costs associated  with
  due  diligence and punitive damages.  On January 10, 1995, Cimmaron
  filed  a  first amended original petition suing CSWE board  members
  at the time, personally.
  
  Pre-trial  discovery  on  the  case  is  presently  underway   with
  depositions  of the parties being taken during March, 1995.   Trial
  was  originally set for the week of April 10, 1995, but the parties
  have  filed a joint motion for continuance which is set for hearing
  on  March  20, 1995.  Management of CSW cannot predict the  outcome
  of  this  litigation, but believes that CSW and CSWE have  defenses
  to  these complaints and are pursuing them vigorously and that  the
  ultimate  resolution  will not have a material  adverse  effect  on
  CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

<PAGE> 2-53
  General Matters
  CSW  and  the Operating Companies are party to various other  legal
  claims,  actions  and complaints arising in the  normal  course  of
  business.  Management does not expect disposition of these  matters
  to  have a material adverse effect on CSW's consolidated results of
  operations or financial condition.

11.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
  Proposed Acquisition of El Paso
  Background
  In  May 1993, CSW entered into a Merger Agreement pursuant to which
  El  Paso  would emerge from bankruptcy as a wholly-owned subsidiary
  of  CSW.   El Paso is an electric utility company headquartered  in
  El   Paso,  Texas,  engaged  principally  in  the  generation   and
  distribution   of  electricity  to  approximately  262,000   retail
  customers  in  west Texas and southern New Mexico.   El  Paso  also
  sells  electricity  under  contract to  wholesale  customers  in  a
  number  of locations including southern California and Mexico.   El
  Paso  had  filed  a  voluntary petition  for  reorganization  under
  Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 8, 1992.

  On  July  30, 1993, El Paso filed the Modified Plan and  a  related
  proposed   form   of   Disclosure  Statement  providing   for   the
  acquisition  of El Paso by CSW.  On November 15, 1993,  all  voting
  classes  of creditors and shareholders of El Paso voted to  approve
  the  Modified  Plan.   On December 8, 1993,  the  Bankruptcy  Court
  confirmed the Modified Plan.

  Under  the Modified Plan, the total value of CSW's offer to acquire
  El   Paso  is  approximately  $2.2  billion.   The  Modified   Plan
  generally  provides  for  El  Paso creditors  and  shareholders  to
  receive  shares of CSW Common, cash and/or securities of  El  Paso,
  or  to  have their claims cured and reinstated.  The Modified  Plan
  also  provides for claims of secured creditors generally to be paid
  in  full  with  debt securities of reorganized  El  Paso,  and  for
  unsecured creditors to receive a combination of debt securities  of
  reorganized El Paso and CSW Common equal to 95.5 percent  of  their
  claims,  and  for  small trade creditors to be paid  in  full  with
  cash.    The   Modified  Plan  provides  for  El  Paso's  preferred
  shareholders  to receive preferred shares of reorganized  El  Paso,
  or  cash,  and  for  options  to purchase  El  Paso  Common  to  be
  converted  into  options  to  purchase a  proportionate  number  of
  shares of CSW Common.  In addition, the Modified Plan provides  for
  certain  creditor  classes of El Paso to accrue interest  on  their
  claims  and  to  receive  periodic interim  distributions  of  such
  interest   through  the  Effective  Date  or  the   withdrawal   or
  revocation of the Modified Plan, subject to certain conditions  and
  limitations  set  forth in the Modified Plan.  To  date,  all  such
  accrued  interest payments to creditors have been made by  El  Paso
  on  a timely basis.  If, under certain circumstances, the Merger is
  not  consummated, the Merger Agreement provides for CSW to  pay  El
  Paso  for  a  portion  of such interim interest  payments  paid  or
  accrued  prior  to  the termination of the Merger  Agreement.   The
  Merger  Agreement  also provides for CSW to pay for  a  portion  of
  fees  and  expenses, including legal expenses of  certain  El  Paso
  creditors  under such circumstances.  CSW's potential  exposure  as
  of  December  31,  1994  is  estimated to  be  approximately  $17.5
  million;  however,  the actual amount, if  any,  that  CSW  may  be
  required  to pay pursuant to these provisions depends on  a  number
  of contingencies and cannot presently be predicted.

  On  June  14,  1994, Las Cruces filed a motion with the  Bankruptcy
  Court  to lift the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy  filing
  to  allow it to (i) commence action against El Paso for failure  to
  pay  franchise fees after the expiration of its franchise agreement
  with  Las  Cruces in March 1994, (ii) enter El Paso's  property  to
  conduct  an appraisal of the electric distribution system  and  any
  suitability  studies,  (iii)  give  notice  of  intent  to  file  a
  condemnation  action  and  (iv) commence state  court  condemnation
  proceedings  against  El  Paso to condemn  El  Paso's  distribution
  system within Las Cruces' city limits.

  On  June  29  and July 1, 1994, El Paso and CSW filed responses  in
  the Bankruptcy Court opposing the Las Cruces motion.  On August  1,
  1994,  CSW filed an amended response to the Las Cruces motion which
  states  that  the  threat  or actual commencement  of  condemnation
  proceedings  by Las Cruces or the elimination of El Paso's  service

<PAGE> 2-54
  to  Las  Cruces by condemnation or otherwise may constitute  an  El
  Paso  material adverse effect, as defined in the Merger  Agreement,
  the  absence  of  which  is  a condition  of  CSW's  obligation  to
  consummate  the  Merger.   The existence of  an  El  Paso  material
  adverse  effect would preclude consummation of the Merger  and  the
  Modified Plan, unless CSW waives this condition in writing.   CSW's
  amended  response concludes that Las Cruces' intention  to  file  a
  condemnation proceeding creates a situation that must be  favorably
  resolved before the closing of the Merger.

  By  letter dated August 5, 1994, El Paso protested CSW's filing  of
  the  amended  response  and asserted its  disagreement  with  CSW's
  position  regarding Las Cruces as summarized above.   In  addition,
  El  Paso asserted that CSW's filing of the amended response over El
  Paso's   objection  was  contrary  to  the  terms  of  the   Merger
  Agreement.

  On  August  22,  1994,  Las Cruces entered into  a  wholesale  full
  requirements  power  contract  with  SPS  to  supply  power  to   a
  municipal  utility proposed to be established by  Las  Cruces.   On
  August  30, 1994, voters in Las Cruces approved by nearly a two-to-
  one  margin  a  referendum authorizing Las Cruces to  proceed  with
  efforts  to  acquire from El Paso, through negotiated  purchase  or
  condemnation proceedings, the electric utility system  of  El  Paso
  within  Las Cruces, including certain distribution, substation  and
  associated transmission facilities.

  On  September  12,  1994, CSW delivered a  response  to  El  Paso's
  August  5  letter.  In its September 12 letter, CSW reiterated  its
  position  that  Las Cruces is a material element of  CSW's  bargain
  with  El Paso and advised El Paso that the municipalization efforts
  in  Las Cruces and other matters, including (i) the potential  loss
  of  other  customers  in  El  Paso's service  area,  including  the
  Holloman  Air Force Base and the White Sands Missile Range  in  New
  Mexico,  (ii)  cracking in steam generator  tubes  at  Palo  Verde,
  (iii)  intense political and regulatory opposition to  the  Merger,
  and  (iv)  a  new "comparable transmission service" standard  being
  imposed  on  the  Merger by the FERC, place the completion  of  the
  Merger  in jeopardy.  CSW's September 12 letter further advised  El
  Paso  that  the  foregoing matters, individually and  cumulatively,
  constitute  a  material adverse effect or failure of other  closing
  conditions   under  the  Merger  Agreement  which,  unless   timely
  resolved  in  accordance with the Merger Agreement,  will  preclude
  closing of the proposed Merger.

  Since CSW's September 12 letter, CSW has exchanged letters with  El
  Paso   and  others  regarding  the  interpretation  of  the  Merger
  Agreement  and the legal significance of the matters cited  by  CSW
  in  its  September 12 letter.  Most of these letters are summarized
  below.

  On  September 14, 1994, CSW filed a second amended response to  Las
  Cruces'  motion  to  lift the stay in bankruptcy.   In  its  second
  amended  response,  CSW  stated that the intent  and  plan  of  Las
  Cruces  to file a condemnation proceeding creates a situation  that
  must  be  timely  and  favorably resolved by  El  Paso  before  the
  consummation of the Merger, whether or not the stay is modified  or
  maintained.  Further, CSW supported the maintenance of the stay  as
  a  means  of  avoiding  disruption pending resolution  of  the  Las
  Cruces  dispute  and because El Paso had taken  the  position  that
  maintenance  of the stay was in the best interests  of  the  Merger
  and  the  El  Paso estate and put El Paso in a better  position  to
  resolve the Las Cruces dispute.

  By  letter  dated  September 16, 1994, El Paso disagreed  with  the
  positions set forth by CSW in its September 12 letter and  asserted
  that  CSW's September 12 letter "had inflicted irreparable harm  on
  El Paso and the Merger process."

  On  September  20, 1994, following a hearing on the June  14,  1994
  motion  of  Las Cruces discussed above, the Bankruptcy Court  judge
  indicated  orally that, effective January 1, 1995,  he  would  lift
  the  bankruptcy stay on certain actions against El Paso  and  allow
  Las  Cruces to pursue condemnation proceedings against El Paso with
  respect  to  the  electric distribution system  within  Las  Cruces
  under  applicable New Mexico law.  El Paso filed a  motion  seeking
  clarification  of  this oral ruling as to whether  Las  Cruces  may

<PAGE> 2-55
  take  immediate possession of the El Paso distribution system under
  the  New  Mexico condemnation statutes.  On November 22, 1994,  the
  Bankruptcy  Court judge orally ruled that Las Cruces  can  commence
  condemnation  proceedings  but  can  not  take  possession  of  the
  distribution system when the stay is lifted until returning to  the
  Bankruptcy Court and obtaining an order which permits that action.

  By  letter  dated  September  23, 1994,  El  Paso  requested  CSW's
  consent  to  meet  with  the  City of Las  Cruces  to  discuss  the
  possibility of a resolution of El Paso's dispute with Las Cruces.

  By  letter  dated  October  3, 1994, CSW  responded  to  El  Paso's
  September  16  letter  and reaffirmed the positions  set  forth  in
  CSW's  September  12  letter.  In addition,  CSW  consented  to  El
  Paso's meeting with Las Cruces, but advised El Paso that CSW  would
  not participate directly in negotiations between Las Cruces and  El
  Paso.

  By  letter  dated October 5, 1994, counsel to the El Paso Unsecured
  Creditors   Committee,  with  the  concurrence  of  certain   other
  creditor  groups,  advised  CSW that the committee  disagreed  with
  certain  positions set forth in CSW's September  12  letter  to  El
  Paso.   By  letter  dated October 27, 1994, CSW  responded  to  and
  stated  its disagreement with various statements set forth  in  the
  Unsecured Creditors Committee's letter.

  By  letter  dated October 5, 1994, El Paso's New Mexico  regulatory
  counsel  asserted  that  CSW's September 12 letter  had  "adversely
  affected proceedings before the New Mexico Commission" relating  to
  the  Merger and that the letter "is being widely interpreted  as  a
  statement  from  CSW that the Merger will not  close."   By  letter
  dated  October  7,  1994, CSW's New Mexico regulatory  counsel  set
  forth  CSW's  disagreement with statements made in  El  Paso's  New
  Mexico  regulatory  counsel's October 5  letter.   The  New  Mexico
  Commission  had  delayed  the  New  Mexico  proceedings  prior   to
  September  12, 1994.  On October 12, 1994, a New Mexico  Commission
  hearing  examiner held a prehearing conference covering  scheduling
  and  other matters.  On October 14, 1994, CSW filed a Statement  of
  Position  and  Request for Procedural Schedule in  the  New  Mexico
  proceeding. El Paso filed a separate position statement in the  New
  Mexico  proceeding  and advised CSW, by letter  dated  October  14,
  1994,   that  CSW's  statement  of  position  did  not   "state   a
  sufficiently  clear  and strong commitment by CSW  to  closing  the
  Merger."   By  letter  dated October 25,  1994,  CSW's  New  Mexico
  regulatory counsel stated that the filing by El Paso of a  separate
  position   statement  "impairs  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary
  regulatory  approvals from the New Mexico Commission  on  a  timely
  basis   by  implying  that  there  are  severe  problems   in   the
  relationship  between El Paso and CSW."  CSW's  October  25  letter
  also  stated that "the lack of a favorable resolution of Las Cruces
  municipalization efforts continues to not only prevent the  closing
  of  the  Merger, but is also hindering our ability  to  obtain  New
  Mexico regulatory approvals."

  By  letter dated October 18, 1994, El Paso reasserted its  position
  that  the  Merger Agreement does not condition CSW's obligation  to
  consummate  the Merger on a favorable resolution of the Las  Cruces
  situation.  El Paso asserted it was not clear from CSW's October  3
  letter whether CSW consented to El Paso's proposed discussion  with
  Las  Cruces and again requested CSW's consent to a meeting  between
  El Paso and Las Cruces.

  By  letter  dated  October 27, 1994, CSW reaffirmed  the  positions
  taken  in  its  September  12  and October  3  letters,  and  again
  consented  to  El  Paso's meeting with Las  Cruces  and  reiterated
  CSW's  willingness to discuss with El Paso possible resolutions  of
  the Las Cruces situation.

  On  October  11, 1994, the Bankruptcy Court granted an  application
  by  El Paso to employ special litigation counsel to advise El  Paso
  as  to ongoing activities with CSW and to assist El Paso as to  the
  best  means of preserving its rights.  El Paso's application stated
  that  special litigation counsel was needed to evaluate  El  Paso's
  rights, remedies and obligations with respect to CSW, the Plan  and
  the  Merger Agreement and to advise key officers of El  Paso  on  a
  course  of  action  to preserve and enforce El  Paso's  rights  and
  remedies.   The  application also stated  that  special  litigation

<PAGE> 2-56
  counsel  "should  also be in a position to conduct  any  litigation
  which  may  be  necessary," and noted that another  law  firm  then
  representing  El Paso "would not be in a position to represent  the
  Debtor in litigation against CSW."  On October 28, 1994, CSW  filed
  a  response  to  El Paso's application, in which  CSW  stated  that
  while  it  did  not  oppose  El Paso's  motion  to  employ  special
  litigation  counsel,  the  hiring  and  future  use  of  litigation
  counsel  may  be  incongruous with the  goal  of  consummating  the
  Merger.   The  response  also  stated  that  El  Paso's  Disclosure
  Statement, pursuant to which it obtained confirmation of  its  Plan
  of  Reorganization,  contained projections that  explicitly  assume
  the  continuation  of  service  to  Las  Cruces  and  two  military
  installations in New Mexico.

  By  letter  dated  December 21, 1994, El  Paso  objected  to  CSW's
  motion  filed  with  the  New  Mexico  Commission  to  extend   the
  procedural schedule by two-weeks.  CSW responded to El  Paso  in  a
  letter  dated January 11, 1995, that CSW considered the  short  two
  week  extension  to be in the best interest of obtaining  favorable
  and  timely regulatory approval in New Mexico.  The two weeks  were
  to  be used to facilitate efforts to narrow and resolve outstanding
  issues  in  the  proceedings and thereby expedite the  progress  of
  those  proceedings.   El  Paso restated its disagreement  to  CSW's
  motion for extension in a letter dated January 16, 1995.

  By  letter  dated January 13, 1995, CSW recommended  that  El  Paso
  object  to  a  request  by  the  Equity  Committee  to  renew   its
  engagement  of  Salomon  Brothers  as  financial  advisor  to  said
  committee.   CSW  stated  that the Merger  Agreement  requires  the
  parties  to  cooperate in limiting professional fees and  that  the
  cost  and  timing of the reengagement is inappropriate.  By  letter
  dated  January 20, 1995, El Paso responded to CSW that  the  Equity
  Committee's request to reemploy Salomon is a direct consequence  of
  CSW's  September  12  letter to El Paso and that  it  supports  the
  Equity  Committee's  application.  El  Paso  subsequently  filed  a
  statement  of  support  of the Equity Committee's  request  in  the
  Bankruptcy Court.  On February 6, 1995, the Equity Committee of  El
  Paso  filed  a response in the Bankruptcy Court to objections  made
  by  other  parties to its rehiring of financial advisors  in  which
  the  committee  accused CSW of taking moves  to  back  out  of  the
  Merger Agreement, thereby causing harm to the equity holders.

  On  January 3, 1995, a PFD was issued by the presiding officers  in
  the  proceedings  pending before the Texas Commission  relating  to
  the  Merger.   On  January 17, 1995, CSW and El  Paso  filed  joint
  exceptions  to the proposed decision, stating, among other  things,
  that,  "in CSW's view, the rate relief recommended . . . falls  far
  short  of  what is necessary for the consummation of  the  merger."
  That same day, CSW issued a press release describing the filing  of
  the  exceptions  and repeating CSW's view that  the  terms  of  the
  proposed interim decision failed to provide sufficient revenue  and
  adequate  rate-making treatment for CSW to consummate the  proposed
  Merger.

  In  a  letter dated January 19, 1995, El Paso objected to the tenor
  of  CSW's  January  17 press release and claimed that  CSW's  press
  release  harmed  El  Paso,  its  creditors,  and  shareholders  and
  poisoned  the  regulatory approval process.   CSW  responded  in  a
  letter  dated  January 31 that it is El Paso's  actions  that  have
  hindered   obtaining   the   regulatory  approvals   necessary   to
  consummate  the Merger and that these actions were contrary  to  El
  Paso's  obligations  under  the  Merger  Agreement.   Further,  CSW
  called on El Paso again to detail the steps it proposes to take  to
  solve  the  problems identified by CSW in its September  12  letter
  cited  in the PFD by the hearing examiners of the Texas Commission,
  and to desist from further actions which undercut CSW's efforts  to
  obtain  the  rate  relief, asset treatment and required  regulatory
  approvals necessary to consummate the Merger.

  On  February 17, 1995, El Paso responded to CSW's January 31,  1995
  letter  stating that CSW's assertion that El Paso has breached  the
  Merger  Agreement are unfounded.  El Paso further  accused  CSW  of
  searching  for  a  "viable contractual excuse"  not  to  close  the
  Merger.


<PAGE> 2-57
  On  February  20,  1995,  El Paso sent a letter  to  CSW  inquiring
  whether  CSW  would consent to the sale of the Las  Cruces  service
  territory  by El Paso and, if so, on what terms and at what  price.
  In  addition,  the letter inquired whether CSW would consent  to  a
  rate  reduction  in  New  Mexico and, if  so,  at  what  percentage
  reduction  over what period of time.  CSW responded in  a  February
  27,  1995 letter that CSW is unwilling to give up any more  of  the
  value  it  bargained for in the Merger Agreement, or to accept  the
  risk  of  a  litigated  outcome  with  Las  Cruces.   However,  CSW
  encouraged  dialogue between El Paso and Las Cruces and  stated  it
  continues to support El Paso's efforts to resolve its dispute  with
  Las   Cruces.   CSW  stated  it  is  amenable  to  considering  any
  alternatives negotiated between Las Cruces and El Paso  that  would
  not  deprive the Merger of further value and that would  enable  El
  Paso  to  continue to serve the Las Cruces service area or  provide
  El  Paso  with full compensation for the loss of Las  Cruces.   CSW
  looks  to  El  Paso to resolve this situation prior to consummation
  of the proposed Merger.

  Texas Commission Applications
  On  January  10,  1994, CSW and El Paso filed a  joint  application
  with  the  Texas  Commission requesting a  determination  that  the
  Merger  is consistent with the public interest.  As a part  of  the
  application,  CSW  proposed  a  three-step  rate  settlement  plan,
  contingent  upon  the Texas Commission's approval  of  the  Merger,
  that  seeks to limit El Paso's proposed $41.4 million initial  base
  rate  increase  for  Texas  customers,  discussed  below,  to   $25
  million.  In addition, the settlement rate plan proposed to  reduce
  El  Paso's  fixed  fuel factors by $12.8 million and  refund  $16.4
  million  from a one-time fuel reconciliation.  As a result  of  the
  proposed annual reductions in fuel cost, El Paso's rates would  not
  increase  during  the  first  year of  the  settlement  plan.   The
  settlement   plan  also  provided  for  a  three-year   freeze   on
  additional  base rate increases, a limitation on the  frequency  of
  base  rate increases following the rate freeze period through  2001
  to  not  more  than once every other year (i.e.,  1997,  1999,  and
  2001),  and a limitation on the amount of the 1997, 1999  and  2001
  base  rate  increases to an amount not to exceed eight  percent  of
  total  revenues.  No party to the proceedings accepted  CSW's  rate
  settlement plan.

  On  January  10,  1994,  El Paso separately filed  with  the  Texas
  Commission  for  a  base  rate  increase,  exclusive  of  fuel,  of
  approximately   $41.4   million.   The   proposed   rate   increase
  represents  what El Paso has stated it believes is supported  under
  Texas  law  and prior Texas Commission orders, adjusted to  reflect
  El  Paso's proposed Merger with CSW.  If the Texas Commission  were
  to  approve  El Paso's request, the net effect would  be  to  raise
  rates  significantly higher than those proposed in  the  settlement
  plan.

  On  June  23,  1994, the El Paso City Council voted  to  reduce  El
  Paso's  rates  $15.7  million following a recommendation  from  the
  City of El Paso's Public Utility Regulation Board.  The City of  El
  Paso's   decision  was  appealed  to  the  Texas   Commission   and
  consolidated with the rate case pending before that commission.

  On  June 24, 1994, the Staff filed testimony in the case before the
  Texas  Commission recommending an increase in base rates  of  $17.1
  million and taking the position that the proposed Merger is not  in
  the  public  interest  because of the possible  cost  increases  to
  CSW's   subsidiaries,  which  the  Staff  attributed  to  increased
  financial  risk  associated  with the proposed  acquisition  of  El
  Paso.   The Staff's recommendation was revised and increased  to  a
  $21.5  million increase in base rates for El Paso in October  1994.
  In  addition, the Staff determined that the proposed purchase price
  for  El Paso is too high by $300 to $500 million and disagreed with
  the  estimates of the Merger-related savings presented by  CSW  and
  El  Paso  in the case.  Hearings at the Texas Commission  began  on
  July 20, 1994 and were completed in early November 1994.

  Effective  July 16, 1994, El Paso implemented under  bond,  a  base
  rate  increase of approximately $25 million annually for its  Texas
  jurisdiction, which is subject to refund depending on  the  outcome
  of  the  rate  case.   The bonded increase in rates  is  authorized
  under  PURA.   Because of the current uncertainty as to  the  final
  outcome  of  the  rate proceeding, El Paso has stated  that  it  is
  deferring  on  its books the recognition of the revenues  resulting
  from the increased rates.


<PAGE> 2-58
  On  January  3, 1995, the Texas Commission presiding  officers  who
  heard  El  Paso's pending rate case and the CSW and El Paso  Merger
  case   filed  their  proposed  interim  decision  with  the   Texas
  Commission.   The presiding officers proposed an initial  base-rate
  increase  for  El  Paso  of $21.2 million.  The  PFD  recommends  a
  determination  by  the Texas Commission that  the  Merger  and  the
  reacquisition  of the leased Paso Verde assets are  in  the  public
  interest  and  that  the purchase price to be  paid  to  El  Paso's
  creditors  and  equity  holders is fair,  subject  to  satisfactory
  resolution  of  the  Las  Cruces  and  Palo  Verde  problems.   The
  presiding officers found Merger related benefits ranging from  $309
  million  to  $379.4 million over the first ten years of the  Merger
  which  the  presiding  officers allocated to  El  Paso's  customers
  under the PFD.

  In  addition  to recommending the imposition of conditions  in  the
  determination  that the Merger is in the public interest,  the  PFD
  failed  to  provide  sufficient revenue  and  adequate  rate-making
  treatment   for   CSW   to   consummate   the   proposed    Merger.
  Specifically,  the presiding officers propose to reduce  El  Paso's
  rates  by  allocating to customers certain potential  tax  benefits
  related  to  the payment of lease rejection damages on  the  leased
  Palo   Verde  assets.   Reallocation  of  these  tax  benefits   to
  customers  effectively increases the acquisition  cost  to  CSW  by
  $133  million.   The presiding officers attempted to  mitigate  the
  economic  effect  of  their allocation of  these  tax  benefits  by
  allowing  recovery through rates of an acquisition adjustment  over
  the  remaining 33 year life of Palo Verde.  However,  CSW  believes
  that   the  proposed  recovery  through  rates  of  an  acquisition
  adjustment  has  considerably  less economic  value  than  the  tax
  deductions.   The presiding officers also recommended  a  reduction
  in  El  Paso's rate moderation plan and disallowance of  El  Paso's
  Palo  Verde Unit 3 deferred accounting assets.  CSW believes  that,
  in  recommending these rate treatments, the PFD fails to  recognize
  rate  relief  to  which  El Paso is entitled under  previous  Texas
  Commission decisions in El Paso rate cases.  Additionally, the  PFD
  proposed  an  11.5%  return on equity rather than  a  12.5%  return
  which   CSW  believes  is  necessary  for  El  Paso  to  have   the
  opportunity  to  earn a reasonable return on its equity.   Finally,
  the   presiding  officers  proposed  that  the  Texas  Commission's
  interim  order be conditioned on the successful resolution  of  the
  loss  of  Las Cruces as a customer of El Paso and on the successful
  resolution of the Palo Verde steam generator problems.

  On  March 3, 1995, the Texas Commission issued an interim order  in
  the  El  Paso rate case and proposed Merger with CSW.  The  interim
  order  found  the proposed Merger to be in the public interest  and
  provides  for a $24.9 million base rate increase for El Paso.   The
  interim  order adopted most of the recommendations of the presiding
  officers.  The most significant revision to the presiding  officers
  recommendations  was an increase in the allowed  return  on  equity
  from  11.5%  to 12%.  The presiding officers' recommendations  were
  adopted  in  the  interim decision for several  significant  issues
  even  though  agreement  was not reached by the  Texas  Commission.
  The  interim decision allows for motions for reconsideration to  be
  filed  on  these  issues.  The Texas Commission has indicated  that
  the  motions  for reconsideration will be granted to  allow  for  a
  consensus  of  the Texas Commission to be reached on  these  issues
  prior  to  the effective date of the merger.  These issues included
  conditioning  approval  of  the merger on  resolution  of  the  Las
  Cruces  and  Palo  Verde  issues, the rate  treatment  of  the  tax
  effects  of  lease rejection damages, recovery of  any  acquisition
  adjustment  and  deferred costs associated with the regulatory  lag
  period  prior to the rate treatment of Palo Verde Unit 3.   Pending
  resolution of these issues, the Texas Commission allowed El  Paso's
  bonded  rates  to  remain  in  effect until  a  subsequent  interim
  decision is issued.

  The  Texas Commission severed fuel related issues from the El  Paso
  rate  case  and issued a final order which allows for  El  Paso  to
  lower  fixed fuel factors by $14.3 million annually and  to  refund
  $13.7 million in fuel costs over a twelve month period.

  New Mexico Commission Application
  On  March  14, 1994, CSW and El Paso filed an application with  the
  New  Mexico Commission seeking approval of the pending Merger,  the
  reacquisition  of  the  leased  Palo  Verde  assets   and   certain
  accounting  treatments.   On February  10,  1995,  the  New  Mexico
  Commission Staff filed testimony recommending approval of  each  of

<PAGE> 2-59
  these  requests.  El Paso plans to seek approval for  the  issuance
  of securities in connection with the Merger.

  On  October 27, 1994, the hearing examiner assigned to hear CSW and
  El  Paso's  Merger  application before the  New  Mexico  Commission
  issued  an  order amending the procedural schedule to  provide  for
  hearings  beginning February 13, 1995.  On December 21,  1994,  the
  hearing  examiner issued an order granting a two week extension  to
  the  procedural schedule, resulting in hearings beginning  February
  27,  1995.  Hearings in New Mexico were completed on March 2, 1995.
  This  revised schedule allows for the issuance of a final order  by
  the  New  Mexico  Commission  by June 1995.   However,  CSW  cannot
  predict  when  a  final  order may be  issued  by  the  New  Mexico
  Commission.

  FERC Applications
  On  November  4,  1993, CSWS, as agent for the  Electric  Operating
  Companies  and  El Paso, filed an application with the  FERC  under
  Section  211 of the Federal Power Act seeking an order of the  FERC
  and  requiring  SPS  to  provide  firm  and  non-firm  transmission
  services in connection with the transfers of power between PSO  and
  El  Paso  in connection with the post-Merger coordinated operations
  of  the  Electric Operating Companies and El Paso.  The  intent  of
  the  transmission services is to obtain the benefits of  integrated
  operations and thereby meet the requirement of the Holding  Company
  Act   that  the  Electric  Operating  Companies  and  El  Paso   be
  physically  interconnected or capable of  physical  interconnection
  and   economically   operated  as  a  single   interconnected   and
  coordinated electric system.  SPS subsequently requested  that  the
  application  be  dismissed  or, in  the  alternative,  be  set  for
  hearing.

  On  January 10, 1994, as supplemented on January 13, 1994, CSWS, on
  behalf  of  the Electric Operating Companies and El Paso,  filed  a
  joint  application with the FERC under Sections 203 and 205 of  the
  Federal  Power Act requesting approval by the FERC of  the  Merger.
  CSWS  and  El  Paso have requested expedited consideration  of  the
  joint  application.  However, CSW cannot predict at this time  when
  the FERC will issue a final decision on the joint application.

  On  August 1, 1994, the FERC issued orders in two proceedings  that
  relate to the Merger.  In an order issued under Section 211 of  the
  Federal  Power  Act,  the FERC preliminarily found  that  "a  final
  order  requiring SPS to provide the transmission service  requested
  by  the Applicants would comply with the statutory standards,  once
  reliability  concerns  have been met."  The  FERC's  order  rejects
  assertions  made  by  SPS  that the FERC  has  no  authority  under
  Section 211 to order transmission service where the purpose of  the
  service  is to allow coordination of merging utilities' operations.
  The  order  directed SPS to perform studies so that  the  FERC  can
  determine  whether provision of the requested transmission  service
  will   unreasonably   impair   reliability.    Such   studies   and
  supplemental  pleadings analyzing the studies were filed  with  the
  FERC  in early October and November 1994.  If, after reviewing  the
  studies  and  comments filed by SPS, CSWS and  El  Paso,  the  FERC
  concludes  that reliability will not be unreasonably impaired,  the
  FERC  will issue a further "proposed order" requiring El Paso, CSWS
  and  SPS to negotiate the rates, terms and conditions on which  the
  requested transmission service will be provided.

  The  FERC  also  issued an order under Section 203 of  the  FPA  in
  which  the  FERC  ruled that it will require merging  utilities  to
  offer  transmission service to others on a basis that is comparable
  to  their  own uses of their transmission systems.  On  August  10,
  1994,  CSW and El Paso notified the FERC that they will accept,  as
  a  condition  to  the FERC's approval of CSW's  acquisition  of  El
  Paso,   the  requirement  to  amend  their  non-ERCOT  transmission
  tariffs  to  offer "comparable service."  On August 31,  1994,  CSW
  and  El  Paso  filed  with the FERC a request for  rehearing  that,
  among  other things, asks the FERC to reconsider the imposition  of
  the  comparable service requirement.  On August 31, 1994,  CSW  and
  El  Paso  also  filed the form of transmission tariffs  they  would
  propose  to  file  with the FERC in order to  meet  the  comparable
  service requirement if the requirement is upheld and the Merger  is
  consummated.  In agreeing to accept, as a condition to the  Merger,
  the  requirement that comparable service be provided over CSW's and
  El  Paso's non-ERCOT transmission facilities, both CSW and El  Paso

<PAGE> 2-60
  do  not intend to waive or otherwise prejudice any of their rights,
  including  but  not limited to the right to seek rehearing  of  the
  order   or  any  other  order  the  FERC  later  enters  in   these
  proceedings.   In addition, both CSW and El Paso do not  intend  to
  waive  or  otherwise prejudice their right under the  FPA  to  seek
  judicial review of the order or any subsequent order or orders,  if
  and  to  the  extent CSW and El Paso deem such action necessary  or
  advisable.

  The  FERC  has  not  yet determined what "comparable  service"  is.
  However, the FERC said it will establish what uses PSO, SWEPCO  and
  El  Paso  make  of their own systems.  The FERC will  also  examine
  likely  costs and benefits of the Merger and determine whether  the
  Merger  is  consistent  with the public  interest.   The  FERC  has
  instructed  one  of  its  administrative law  judges  to  issue  an
  initial  decision  by  April 14, 1995.  A FERC  administrative  law
  judge  established  a  procedural schedule whereby  hearings  began
  January  3, 1995.  Hearings ended January 25, 1995, and the judge's
  initial  decision is expected to be issued on or  before  April  5,
  1995.

  On  November 15, 1994, the FERC trial staff filed its testimony  in
  the   Merger  proceeding.   The  FERC  staff  determined  that  the
  proposed Merger will result in total savings of $414 million,  $265
  million  in net present value for the period 1995 through  2004  of
  post-Merger operations.  This compares to Merger savings  projected
  by  CSW for the same period of $420 million, or $280 million in net
  present  value.   The staff found $140.7 million  in  non-fuel  O&M
  expense  savings,  $109.0 million in financial savings,  and  $15.3
  million in production cost savings.

  The  FERC staff has recommended that approval of the Merger be made
  subject  to  two conditions.  As required in the FERC's  August  1,
  1994  order, the merged companies must offer the use of their  non-
  ERCOT  transmission  system  to  others  under  rates,  terms   and
  conditions  comparable  to the rates, terms  and  conditions  under
  which  CSW will use their non-ERCOT transmission system.  The  FERC
  staff   has   also  recommended  that  the  Merger   be   approved,
  conditioned  on  the  existing CSW Operating  Companies  not  being
  allocated  any transmission costs associated with firm transmission
  service  across SPS's system in excess of $24.6 million,  which  is
  the amount CSW projects through 2004.

  The  FERC  staff  also  determined that "hold harmless  conditions"
  proposed   by   various   state  utility  commissions   and   other
  intervenors  to  protect  CSW  Operating  Companies  from   certain
  potential effects of the Merger are unnecessary to assure that  the
  Merger is in the public interest.  The FERC staff concluded that:

     As  proposed,  the Merger is beneficial to El  Paso  and  is
     roughly  neutral  with  respect  to  the  four  present  CSW
     Operating  Companies.   If enacted  as  proposed,  with  the
     Applicants'   voluntary  offer  to  exclude   Merger-related
     transmission   expenses   of   non-affiliates    from    the
     transmission  customers  of  CSW's  four  current  Operating
     Companies,  the  Merger  should not substantially  harm  any
     class of wholesale customers.

  SEC Application
  On  January  10, 1994, CSW filed with the SEC an application  under
  the  Holding  Company Act seeking authorization of (i)  the  Merger
  and  reacquisition  of  the  Palo Verde  leased  assets,  (ii)  the
  issuance  of securities by CSW and El Paso in connection  with  the
  Modified  Plan  and  Merger and certain related  transactions,  and
  (iii) to engage in certain hedging transactions in connection  with
  the  Merger.  CSW subsequently amended the application to eliminate
  the   request  for  authorization  to  engage  in  certain  hedging
  transactions,   at  the  request  of  the  SEC  staff.    CSW   has
  subsequently  amended  and supplemented  the  application  and  has
  filed  a  brief in response to intervention petitions.  CSW  cannot
  predict  what  action  the  SEC  will  take  with  respect  to  the
  application, or when such action will be taken.

<PAGE> 2-61
  NRC Application
  On  January  13,  1994,  APS, as operating agent  for  Palo  Verde,
  joined by El Paso, filed a request with the NRC for (i) consent  to
  the  indirect  transfer  of  El Paso's interest  in  the  operating
  licenses  for  Palo Verde Units 1, 2, and 3 that will  occur  as  a
  result of the Merger, and (ii) to amend the operating licenses  for
  Units 2 and 3 to delete provisions of those licenses related to  El
  Paso's sale and leaseback transactions involving those units.   The
  request  to the NRC specifies that the proposed amendments  to  the
  operating  licenses and consent become effective on  the  Effective
  Date, but CSW cannot predict at this time whether and, if so,  when
  the approvals and consent will be granted.

  Palo Verde
  The  operating agent of Palo Verde, APS, discovered axial  cracking
  in  steam  generator tubes in Unit 2 following a  tube  rupture  in
  March  1993.  APS began an ongoing examination and analysis of  the
  tubes  in  each of the two steam generators in each  unit  of  Palo
  Verde  and, as a result, has identified axial cracking  in  Unit  3
  and  another  more common type of cracking in the  steam  generator
  tubes  of all three units.  APS has indicated that it believes  the
  axial  cracking  in  Units 2 and 3 is due to the susceptibility  of
  tube  materials to a combination of deposits on the tubes  and  the
  relatively  high  temperatures at which all  three  units  at  Palo
  Verde are designed to operate.  According to statements by APS  and
  El  Paso,  the  form of the degradation experienced  in  the  steam
  generators  is  uncommon in the nuclear industry.  APS  has  stated
  that  it  believes  it  can  retard  further  tube  degradation  to
  acceptable  levels  by remedial actions, which  include  chemically
  cleaning   the   steam  generators  and  performing  analyses   and
  adjustments  that  will allow the units to  be  operated  at  lower
  temperatures  without  appreciably  reducing  their  power  output.
  These  analyses and adjustments have been performed  on  all  three
  units,  with  each  unit  operating at  100%  of  capability.   All
  remedial  actions have been completed on each of the  three  units,
  except for chemically cleaning Unit 1 which is scheduled for  April
  1995.    El   Paso  has  stated  that  it  is  incurring  increased
  maintenance  costs  related  to the mid-cycle  inspections  of  the
  steam generator tubes and the remedial actions being undertaken  to
  retard tube degradation.  El Paso also incurs additional costs  for
  fuel  and/or  purchased power during periods in which one  or  more
  units are removed from service every 6 months for inspections.   In
  its  September  12,  1994 letter to El Paso, CSW  stated  that  the
  significance  of  the  tube  cracking  problems  will  have  to  be
  determined before CSW will close the Merger.

  Other
  El  Paso  is  subject  to  the informational  requirements  of  the
  Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in accordance
  therewith  files reports and other information with the  SEC.   See
  El  Paso's  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, its Current Reports  on
  Form  8-K  and  its  Annual Report on Form 10-K and  the  documents
  referenced therein.

  CSW  continues  to use its best efforts to consummate  the  Merger.
  At  the  same time, however, CSW continues to monitor contingencies
  which  may  preclude  the  consummation of  the  Merger,  including
  without  limitation the potential loss of significant  portions  of
  El   Paso's   service  area  and  significant  El  Paso  customers,
  including  Las Cruces and two military installations, Holloman  Air
  Force   Base  and  White  Sands  Missile  Range,  regulatory  risks
  principally  related  to  approval of  the  Merger  and  El  Paso's
  request for a rate increase in Texas as well as the effects of  the
  conditions imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies  on  the
  approval  of  the Merger, and operating risks associated  with  the
  ownership of an interest in Palo Verde.

  Based  upon  El Paso's written response to the concerns  identified
  in  CSW's September 12 letter and the failure of El Paso to resolve
  items  set  forth  in the preceding paragraph, CSW  cannot  predict
  whether,  and if so when, the Merger will be consummated.   In  the
  event  that  the proposed Merger is not consummated, there  may  be
  ensuing  litigation between El Paso and CSW or among other  parties
  to  El Paso's bankruptcy proceedings and either or both of El  Paso
  and CSW.

  Other Commitments and Contingencies

  Construction
  It  is estimated that the CSW System will spend approximately  $385
  million  in  construction  expenditures during  1995.   Substantial
  commitments  have  been made in connection with  this  construction
  expenditure program.

  Fuel
  To  supply  a  portion of the fuel requirements of the CSW  System,
  the  subsidiary companies have entered into various commitments for
  the procurement of fuel.

  SWEPCO
  Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant
  In  connection  with the South Hallsville lignite  mining  contract
  for  its  Henry  W.  Pirkey Power Plant, SWEPCO has  agreed,  under
  certain  conditions,  to  assume  the  obligations  of  the  mining
  contractor.   As  of December 31, 1994, the maximum  amount  SWEPCO
  would  have  to assume was $73.7 million.  The maximum  amount  may
  vary  as  the  mining contractor's need for funds fluctuates.   The
  contractor's  actual obligation outstanding at  December  31,  1994
  was $60.9 million.

  South Hallsville Lignite Mine
  As  part  of  the process to receive a renewal of a Texas  Railroad
  Commission  permit  for  lignite mining  at  the  South  Hallsville
  lignite mine, SWEPCO has agreed to provide bond guarantees on  mine
  reclamation in the amount of $70 million.  Since SWEPCO uses  self-
  bonding,  the guarantee provides for SWEPCO to commit  to  use  its
  resources to complete the reclamation in the event the work is  not
  completed by the third party miner.  The current estimate  of  cost
  to reclaim the mine is estimated to be approximately $25 million.

  Coal Transportation
  SWEPCO  has  entered into various financing arrangements  primarily
  with  respect  to coal transportation and related equipment,  which
  are  treated  as  operating  leases for rate-making  purposes.   At
  December   31,  1994,  leased  assets  of  $46  million,   net   of
  accumulated  amortization  of  $30.1  million,  were  included   in
  electric  plant  on  the balance sheet and at  December  31,  1993,
  leased assets were $46 million, net of accumulated amortization  of
  $26.8  million.   Total charges to operating  expenses  for  leases
  were  $6.8  million, $7.1 million, and $6.9 million for  the  years
  1994, 1993, and 1992.

  Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas
  SWEPCO  owns  a  suspected  former MGP  site  in  Marshall,  Texas.
  SWEPCO  has  notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination  has
  been  found at the site.  As a result of sampling conducted at  the
  end  of  1993 and early 1994, SWEPCO is evaluating the  extent,  if
  any,  to  which  contamination has impacted soil,  groundwater  and
  other conditions in the area.  A final range of clean-up costs  has
  not  yet  been  determined, but, based on a  preliminary  estimate,
  SWEPCO  has  accrued approximately $2 million as  a  liability  for
  this  site  on  SWEPCO's books as of December 31,  1993.   As  more
  information  is obtained about the site, and SWEPCO  discusses  the
  site with the TNRCC, the preliminary estimate may change.

  Suspected   MGP   Site  in  Texarkana,  Texas  and   Arkansas   and
  Shreveport, Louisiana
  SWEPCO  also  owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana,  Texas
  and  Arkansas.   The EPA ordered an initial investigation  of  this
  site,  as well as one in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no  longer
  owned  by  SWEPCO.  The contractor who performed the investigations
  of  these  two sites recommended to the EPA that no further  action
  be taken at this time.

<PAGE> 2-63
  Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
  SWEPCO  has been notified by Mississippi Power Company that it  may
  be  a PRP at the former Biloxi MGP site formerly owned and operated
  by  a  predecessor  of SWEPCO.  SWEPCO is working with  Mississippi
  Power  Company to investigate the extent of contamination  at  this
  site.   The  MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan  and,  in
  January  1995,  SWEPCO  and  Mississippi  Power  Company  initiated
  sampling  pursuant to that work plan.  On an interim basis,  SWEPCO
  and  Mississippi Power Company are each paying fifty percent of the
  cost  of  implementing  the  site investigation  work  plan.   That
  interim  allocation is subject to a final allocation in the future.
  SWEPCO  and  Mississippi  Power Company are  investigating  whether
  there  are other PRPs at the Biloxi site.  Until the extent of  the
  contamination  at  the  Biloxi site is identified,  it  is  unknown
  what, if any, additional investigation or cleanup may be required.

  Management does not expect these matters to have a material  effect
  on CSW's consolidated results of operations or financial position.

  WTU
  WTU  has  a sale/leaseback agreement with Transok for full capacity
  use  of  a  natural  gas pipeline to WTU's Ft.  Phantom  generating
  plant.  The lease agreement also provides for full capacity use  of
  Transok's  natural gas pipelines serving WTU's San Angelo  and  Oak
  Creek  generating plants.  The initial terms of the  agreement  are
  for twelve years with renewable options thereafter.

  CPL
  Nuclear Insurance
  In  connection with the licensing and operation of STP, the  owners
  have  purchased the maximum limits of nuclear liability  insurance,
  as  required  by law, and have executed indemnification  agreements
  with   the   NRC  in  accordance  with  the  financial   protection
  requirements of the Price-Anderson Act.

  The  Price-Anderson  Act,  a  comprehensive  statutory  arrangement
  providing   limitations  on  nuclear  liability  and   governmental
  indemnities,  is  in  effect until August 1, 2002.   The  limit  of
  liability  under  the Price-Anderson Act for licensees  of  nuclear
  power  plants  is  $8.92  billion per  incident,  effective  as  of
  January  1995.   The owners of STP are insured for their  share  of
  this   liability   through  a  combination  of  private   insurance
  amounting  to  $200  million and a mandatory industry-wide  program
  for  self-insurance  totaling $8.72 billion.   The  maximum  amount
  that  each licensee may be assessed under the industry-wide program
  of  self-insurance  following  a nuclear  incident  at  an  insured
  facility  is  $75.5 million per reactor, which may be adjusted  for
  inflation  plus a five percent charge for legal expenses,  but  not
  more than $10 million per reactor for each nuclear incident in  any
  one  year.   CPL  and each of the other STP owners are  subject  to
  such  assessments, which CPL and other owners have agreed  will  be
  allocated  on the basis of their respective ownership interests  in
  STP.   For  purposes  of these assessments, STP  has  two  licensed
  reactors.

  The  owners  of  STP  currently  maintain  on-site  decontamination
  liability  and  property damage insurance in the  amount  of  $2.75
  billion provided by ANI and NEIL.  Policies of insurance issued  by
  ANI  and NEIL stipulate that policy proceeds must be used first  to
  pay  decontamination and clean-up costs before being used to  cover
  direct  losses to property.  Under project agreements, CPL and  the
  other  owners  of  STP will share the total cost of decontamination
  liability  and property insurance for STP, including  premiums  and
  assessments,  on  a  pro  rata basis,  according  to  each  owner's
  respective ownership interest in STP.

  CPL  purchases, for its own account, a NEIL I Business Interruption
  and/or  Extra  Expense policy.  This insurance will  reimburse  CPL
  for  extra  expenses incurred, up to $1.65 million  per  week,  for
  replacement  generation  or purchased power  as  the  result  of  a
  covered  accident that shuts down production at STP for  more  than
  21  weeks.   The maximum amount recoverable for Unit  1  is  $111.3
  million  and  for Unit 2 is $111.8 million.  CPL is subject  to  an
  additional  assessment up to $2.1 million for  the  current  policy

<PAGE> 2-64
  year in the event that losses as a result of a covered accident  at
  a  nuclear  facility  insured under the NEIL I policy  exceeds  the
  accumulated funds available under the policy.

  On  August  28,  1994, CPL filed a claim under the  NEIL  I  policy
  related  to  the  outage at STP Units 1 and 2.  NEIL  is  currently
  reviewing  the  claim.   CPL management is unable  to  predict  the
  ultimate outcome of this matter.

  CSWE
  CSWE   has   provided  construction  services   to   the   Mulberry
  cogeneration  facility  through  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,   CSW
  Development-I, Inc.  The project achieved commercial  operation  in
  August  1994  and added 117 MWs of on-line capacity of  which  CSWE
  owns  50%.   CSWE's  maximum potential liability  under  the  fixed
  price  contract is $83 million and will decrease to zero  over  the
  next  two  years  as contractual standards are met.   Additionally,
  CSW Development-I, Inc. has entered into a fixed price contract  to
  construct   the  Mulberry  thermal  host  facility.   The   maximum
  potential  liability  under  this  fixed  price  contract  is   $14
  million.  The thermal host facility is expected to be completed  by
  the  first quarter of 1995.  CSW has provided additional guarantees
  to the project totaling approximately $57 million.

  CSWE  has  entered  into a purchase agreement  on  the  Ft.  Lupton
  project  to provide $79.5 million of equity upon the occurrence  of
  certain events.  As of January 9, 1995, $43 million has been  paid.
  CSWE  has  provided three letters of credit to the project totaling
  $14.3  million.   During March 1995, CSWE closed permanent  project
  financing  on  the  Ft.  Lupton facility  in  the  amount  of  $208
  million.

  CSWE  has  committed to provide up to $125 million of  construction
  financing to the Orange cogeneration project in which CSWE  owns  a
  50%  interest.   Of this total, CSWE has provided  $62  million  at
  December  31,  1994.  CSWE expects to obtain third party  permanent
  financing for this project in 1995.

  In  November 1994, CSWE transferred its 50% interest in the  40  MW
  Oildale  cogeneration facility to two non-affiliated third parties,
  Oildale  Holdings, Inc. and Oildale Holdings II, Inc.  The  Oildale
  project,  which was financed with third party non-recourse  project
  financing,  had been in default of certain provisions of  its  loan
  agreement  since  December 1993.  Under the terms  of  the  project
  transfer,  CSWE  contributed $3 million in equity in  exchange  for
  the  return of a letter of credit in the same amount in favor of  a
  third party lender.

  In  addition, CSWE has posted security deposits and other  security
  instruments   of  approximately  $14  million  on  six   additional
  projects  in  various  stages  of  development,  construction,  and
  operation.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Central and South West
Corporation:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Central  and  South  West Corporation (a Delaware  corporation)  and
subsidiary  companies, as of December 31, 1994  and  1993,  and  the
related  consolidated  statements of income, retained  earnings  and
cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December
31,  1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Corporation's  management.   Our responsibility  is  to  express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing  standards.   Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
financial  statements are free of material misstatement.   An  audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the accounting principles used and significant  estimates
made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
Central  and South West Corporation and subsidiary companies  as  of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations  and
their  cash  flows for each of the three years in the  period  ended
December  31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

      In  1993,  as  discussed  in NOTE 1, Central  and  South  West
Corporation  and  subsidiary  companies  changed  their  methods  of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

      Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.   The  supplemental
Schedule  II  is  presented  for  purposes  of  complying  with  the
Securities  and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part  of  the
basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the
auditing  procedures  applied in the audits of the  basic  financial
statements  and,  in  our  opinion, fairly states  in  all  material
respects  the  financial data required to be set  forth  therein  in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

Report of Management

      Management  is responsible for the preparation,  integrity  and
objectivity  of the consolidated financial statements of Central  and
South  West  Corporation and subsidiary companies as  well  as  other
information  contained  in  this  Annual  Report.   The  consolidated
financial  statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and,  in
some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates and judgments
of  management,  giving due consideration to materiality.   Financial
information  contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is  consistent
with that in the consolidated financial statements.

      The consolidated financial statements have been audited by  the
independent  accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP,  which  was  given
unrestricted  access  to  all financial  records  and  related  data,
including  minutes  of  all meetings of stockholders,  the  board  of
directors  and  committees of the board.  CSW  and  its  subsidiaries
believe that representations made to the independent auditors  during
their  audit were valid and appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit
report is presented elsewhere in this report.

      CSW, together with its subsidiary companies, maintains a system
of   internal   controls   to  provide  reasonable   assurance   that
transactions   are   executed   in   accordance   with   management's
authorization,   that  the  consolidated  financial  statements   are
prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and  that  the  assets  of  CSW  and its  subsidiaries  are  properly
safeguarded against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The
system includes a documented organizational structure and division of
responsibility,  established  policies  and  procedures  including  a
policy  on  ethical standards which provides that the companies  will
maintain  the  highest legal and ethical standards, and  the  careful
selection, training and development of our employees.

      Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal  control  system  following  standards  established  by  the
Institute  of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management  to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who  are  not  officers  or  employees of CSW  or  its  subsidiaries,
provides oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls,  no internal control system can provide absolute  assurance
that  errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a  balance,  recognizing that the cost of such a  system  should  not
exceed the benefits derived.

     CSW and its subsidiaries believe that, in all material respects,
its  system  of internal controls over financial reporting  and  over
safeguarding  of  assets  against unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or
disposition functioned effectively during 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CENTRAL POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY

      Reference  is made to CPL's Financial Statements  and  related
Notes  and  Selected  Financial  Data.   The  information  contained
therein  should  be read in conjunction with, and  is  essential  in
understanding, the following discussion and analysis.

Overview
      Net  income  for common stock for 1994 increased 21%  to  $192
million  from $158 million in 1993.  The increase was due  primarily
to  an  increase in base revenues, a decrease in restructuring costs
and   a  decrease  in  maintenance  expense.   Such  increases  were
partially  offset by the cumulative effect of changes in  accounting
principles recorded in 1993.

Restructuring
      As  previously  reported, CPL has taken steps  to  implement  a
restructuring  and early retirement program designed  to  consolidate
and restructure its operations in order to meet the challenges of the
changing electric utility industry and to compete effectively in  the
years  ahead.  The underlying goal of the restructuring is to  enable
CPL  to  focus  on and be accountable for serving the customer.   The
restructuring  costs were initially estimated to be $29  million  and
were  expensed  in  1993.  The final costs of the restructuring  were
approximately  $29  million.   Approximately  $28  million   of   the
restructuring  expenditures  were  incurred  during  1994,  with  the
remaining   $1   million  expected  to  be  incurred   during   1995.
Approximately  $4  million of the restructuring  expenses  relate  to
employee termination benefits, $15 million relate to enhanced benefit
costs  and  $10  million  relate  to  employees  that  will  not   be
terminated.   Approximately $21 million of  the  restructuring  costs
were  paid  from or will be paid from general corporate  funds.   The
remaining $8 million represents the present value of enhanced benefit
amounts to be paid from the benefit plan trusts to participants  over
future  years  in accordance with the early retirement program.   The
cost  of  these  enhanced benefit amounts will be paid  from  general
corporate  funds to the benefit plan trusts over future  years.   The
restructuring is substantially completed, with the remaining activity
to  take place during 1995.  Certain aspects of the restructuring are
pending SEC approval under the Holding Company Act.

       CPL  expects  to  realize  a  number  of  benefits  from   the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased efficiencies and synergies are expected to be realized with
the  elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This  leads  to
enhanced communication and efficiency, which should translate into  a
reduction in the rate of growth in O&M costs.  The CSW System expects
that  all  restructuring costs will be recovered by early  1996  with
reductions in the rate of growth of O&M costs continuing thereafter.

STP
Introduction
      CPL owns 25.2% of STP, a two-unit nuclear power plant which  is
located  near Bay City, Texas.  In addition to CPL, HLP, the  Project
Manager,  owns 30.8%, San Antonio owns 28.0%, and Austin owns  16.0%.
STP  Unit 1 was placed in service in August 1988 and STP Unit  2  was
placed in service in June 1989.

       From  February  1993  until  May  1994,  STP  experienced   an
unscheduled  outage  which  has  resulted  in  significant  rate  and
regulatory  proceedings involving CPL.  These  matters,  including  a
base  rate  case and fuel reconciliation proceedings,  are  discussed
immediately below.

STP Outage
      In February 1993, Units 1 and 2 of STP were shut down by HLP in
an  unscheduled  outage  resulting  from  mechanical  problems.   HLP
determined that the units would not be restarted until the  equipment
failures had been corrected and the NRC was briefed on the causes  of

<PAGE> 2-72
these  failures and the corrective actions that were taken.  The  NRC
formalized  that commitment in a confirmatory action letter  that  it
supplemented  to  identify  additional  issues  to  be  resolved  and
verified by the NRC before STP could be restarted.

      During the outage, the necessary improvements were made by  HLP
to   address  the  issues  in  the  confirmatory  action  letter,  as
supplemented.   On  February  15,  1994,  the  NRC  agreed  that  the
confirmatory action letter issues had been resolved with  respect  to
Unit 1, and that it agreed with HLP's recommendation that Unit 1  was
ready  to restart.  Unit 1 restarted on February 25, 1994 and reached
100%  power on April 8, 1994.  Subsequently, the issues with  respect
to Unit 2 were resolved and the NRC on May 17, 1994 agreed with HLP's
recommendation  to restart Unit 2.  Unit 2 resumed operation  on  May
30,  1994 and reached 100% power on June 16, 1994.  During 1994, Unit
1 and Unit 2 achieved annual net capacity factors of 75.3% and 54.7%,
respectively.   During the last six months of  1994,  the  STP  units
operated  at capacity factors of 98.6% for Unit 1 and 99.2% for  Unit
2.

      In  June 1993, the NRC placed STP on its "watch list" of plants
with "weaknesses that warrant increased NRC attention."  The decision
to  place STP on the watch list followed the June 1993 issuance of  a
report  by an NRC Diagnostic Evaluation Team which conducted a review
of STP operations.

      On February 3, 1995, the NRC removed STP from the "watch list".
The  NRC  noted  that  the  four key areas for  their  decision  were
sustained  improvement throughout 1994, high standards of performance
exhibited by the plant, effective maintenance and engineering support
resulting  in  reduced equipment repair backlogs and  improved  plant
reliability, and the open and positive employee climate at the plant.
With  the  NRC reviewing the "watch list" status every 6  months  and
with Unit 2 achieving 100% power in June of 1994, the February review
was  the first realistic opportunity for STP to be considered  for  a
change in status.  On average, plants previously placed on the "watch
list" have stayed on the list for 29 months.

Rates and Regulatory Matters
CPL Rate Inquiry
      Several Cities, the Texas Commission General Counsel and others
initiated  actions in late 1993 and early 1994 which, if approved  by
the Texas Commission, would lower CPL's base rates.  The requests for
a  review of CPL's rates arose out of the unscheduled outage  at  STP
which  began  in February 1993.  The STP outage did not affect  CPL's
ability  to  meet  customer demand because of existing  capacity  and
CPL's purchase of additional energy.

      CPL  submitted an RFP on July 1, 1994, to the Texas  Commission
justifying  its current base rate structure.  Parties to  CPL's  base
rate case have filed testimony with the Texas Commission recommending
reductions in CPL's retail base rates of up to $147 million annually,
resulting  from  a  combination of proposed rate  base  and  cost  of
service reductions, as well as a rate base disallowance of up to $400
million.

      The  Texas  Commission held hearings in November  and  December
1994,  and  all parties have filed briefs in the case.   The  ALJ  is
expected to issue a recommended order for consideration by the  Texas
Commission in April 1995 with a final order from the Texas Commission
expected  in May 1995.  Testimony filed by parties to the rate  case,
including  the Staff, is not binding on either the ALJ or  the  Texas
Commission.

     CPL continues to maintain that its rates are reasonable and that
its  earnings  are  within  established  regulatory  guidelines.   In
addition, CPL strongly believes that 100 percent of its investment in
both  units  of STP belongs in rate base.  This belief is  based  on,
among  other factors, Units 1 and 2 providing output at high capacity
factors  since  April and June 1994, respectively.  In addition,  the
long-term  benefits nuclear generation provides to customers  further
support  their  inclusion in rate base.  Furthermore,  there  are  no
Texas Commission precedents addressing the removal of a nuclear plant
from rate base as a performance disallowance.  Assuming both units of
STP  are  included  in rate base, CPL believes it is  not  collecting
excessive  revenues, notwithstanding that market rates of  return  on

common  equity are generally lower today than they were in  1990  and
1991, when CPL's base rates were last set.

CPL Fuel
      Pursuant to the substantive rules of the Texas Commission,  CPL
generally  is allowed to recover its fuel costs through a fixed  fuel
factor. These fuel factors are in the nature of temporary rates,  and
CPL's  collection  of  revenues by such fuel factors  is  subject  to
adjustment at the time of a fuel reconciliation proceeding before the
Texas  Commission.  The difference between fuel revenues  billed  and
fuel  expense incurred is recorded as an addition to or  a  reduction
from  revenues, with a corresponding entry to unrecovered fuel  costs
or  other  current liabilities, as appropriate.  Any fuel costs,  not
limited  to  under-  or over-recoveries, which the  Texas  Commission
determines  as  unreasonable in a reconciliation proceeding  are  not
recoverable from customers.

      CPL  is currently involved in two proceedings before the  Texas
Commission  relating  to  the recovery of fuel  and  purchased  power
costs.  CPL originally filed Docket No. 12154 seeking approval  of  a
customer  surcharge  to  recover  fuel  and  purchased  power  costs,
including those resulting from the STP outage.  In Docket No.  13126,
the  Texas  Commission General Counsel and others are  reviewing  the
prudence  of  management activities at STP.  In  November  1994,  CPL
filed  a fuel reconciliation case in Docket No. 13650 with the  Texas
Commission  seeking  to reconcile fuel costs  since  March  1,  1990,
including  the  period during which CPL's fuel  and  purchased  power
costs  were increased due to the STP outage.  At December  31,  1994,
CPL's  under-recovered fuel balance was $54.1 million,  exclusive  of
interest,  which  was  due  primarily  to  the  STP  outage.   If   a
significant  portion of the fuel costs were disallowed by  the  Texas
Commission,  CPL could experience a material adverse  effect  on  its
results  of  operations in the year of disallowance but  not  on  its
financial  condition.   Finally,  in  Docket  No.  13126,  the  Texas
Commission  General Counsel is reviewing the prudence  of  management
activities  at  STP.   On  January 4,  1995,  Docket  No.  12154  was
consolidated  into  Docket No. 13650.  The results  of  the  prudence
inquiry in Docket No. 13126 are expected to be incorporated into  the
fuel reconciliation proceedings in Docket No. 13650.

      CPL  continues  to  negotiate with the intervening  parties  to
resolve these matters through settlement.  However, no settlement has
been reached to date.

      Management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the CPL  rate
inquiry  and  CPL  fuel regulatory proceedings.  However,  management
believes that the ultimate resolution of the various issues will  not
have  a  material  adverse effect on CPL's results of  operations  or
financial condition.

      See NOTE 9, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - STP, for  a
discussion  of regulatory proceedings arising out of the  STP  outage
and background on STP rate orders and deferred accounting.

Nuclear Decommissioning
      CPL's  decommissioning  costs are  accrued  and  funded  to  an
external trust over the expected service life of the STP units.   The
existing NRC operating licenses will allow the operation of STP  Unit
1  until 2027, and Unit 2 until 2028.  The accrual is an annual level
cost  based  on  the  estimated  future  cost  to  decommission  STP,
including escalations for expected inflation to the expected time  of
decommissioning and is net of expected earnings on the trust fund.

      The  staff  of  the SEC has questioned certain  of  the  current
accounting  practices of the electric utility industry  regarding  the
recognition,  measurement and classification of decommissioning  costs
for nuclear generating stations.  In response to these questions, FASB
has  agreed  to  review  the accounting for removal  costs,  including
decommissioning.   If  current  electric utility  industry  accounting
practices  for such decommissioning are changed, (i) annual provisions
for  decommissioning  could  increase, (ii)  the  estimated  cost  for
decommissioning  could  be  recorded as a  liability  rather  than  as
accumulated  depreciation,  and  (iii)  trust  fund  income  from  the
external decommissioning trusts could be reported as investment income
rather than as a reduction to decommissioning expense.

<PAGE> 2-74
      See NOTE 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Nuclear
Decommissioning,    for    further   information    regarding    CPL's
decommissioning of STP.

New Accounting Standards
      SFAS  No.  115  was effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 1993.  CPL adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1994.  The adoption of
SFAS  No.  115  did  not have a material effect on  CPL's  results  of
operations or financial condition.

      In  June  1993  the  FASB issued SFAS No. 116.   The  statement,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, will  be
adopted  by  CPL  for  1995.   The  statement  establishes  accounting
standards  for contributions and applies to all entities that  receive
or  make  contributions.  Management does not believe the adoption  of
SFAS  No.  116  will  have  a  material impact  on  CPL's  results  of
operations or financial condition.

     SFAS No. 119 was effective for fiscal years ending after December
15,  1994.  CPL does not currently use derivative instruments, but may
use  these  instruments in the future to manage the  increased  market
risks  associated  with greater competition in  the  electric  utility
industry.   The adoption of this new statement had no material  effect
on CPL's results of operations or financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
     CPL's need for capital results primarily from its construction of
facilities  to  provide reliable electric service  to  its  customers.
Accordingly,  internally  generated funds should  meet  most  of   the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are  not
sufficient,  CPL's financial condition should allow it access  to  the
capital markets.

Capital Expenditures
      Construction  expenditures, including AFUDC, were  approximately
$178  million in 1994, $180 million in 1993, and $102 million in 1992.
It  is  estimated  that  construction expenditures,  including  AFUDC,
during the 1995 through 1997 period will aggregate $357 million.  Such
expenditures primarily will be made to improve and expand distribution
facilities.  These improvements are expected to meet the needs of  new
customers  and to satisfy changing requirements of existing customers.
No  new  baseload power plants are currently planned until after  year
2000.

      The construction program continues to be monitored, reviewed and
adjusted to reflect changes in estimated load growth in CPL's  service
area,  variations in prices of alternative fuel sources, the  cost  of
labor, materials, equipment and capital, and other external factors.

     The CSW System facilities plan presently includes projected coal-
and  lignite-fired  generating  plants  for  which  CPL  has  invested
approximately $21 million in prior years for plant sites,  engineering
studies  and  lignite  reserves.  Should future  plans  exclude  these
plants  for  environmental or other reasons, CPL  would  evaluate  the
probability   of  recovery  of  these  investments  and   may   record
appropriate reserves.

Long-Term Financing
      As  of December 31, 1994, the capitalization ratios of CPL  were
45%  common  stock equity, 8% preferred stock and 47% long-term  debt.
CPL  continually  monitors the capital markets  for  opportunities  to
lower  its cost of capital through refinancing.  CPL continues  to  be
committed to maintaining financial flexibility by maintaining a strong
capital structure and favorable securities ratings which should  allow
funds to be obtained from the capital markets when required.

<PAGE> 2-75
      CPL's  long-term  financing activity for 1994 is  summarized  as
follows:

      In  May, CPL issued $100 million of 7-1/2% First Mortgage Bonds,
Series JJ, due May 1, 1999.  Net proceeds were used to repay a portion
of  CPL's short-term borrowings.

      In July and August, CPL reacquired $0.6 million of 9-3/8%  First
Mortgage  Bonds, Series Z, due December 1, 2019.  The  funds  required
for this transaction were provided from internal sources.

      In  August,  CPL  retired $22.4 million,  all  remaining  shares
outstanding, of its 10.05% Series Preferred Stock.  The funds required
for  this  transaction were provided from internal sources and  short-
term borrowings.

     CPL has $260 million remaining for the issuance of first mortgage
bonds under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in 1993.
CPL  may  offer  additional first mortgage  bonds  subject  to  market
conditions and other factors.  The proceeds of any such offerings will
be  used  principally to redeem higher cost first  mortgage  bonds  in
order to lower CPL's embedded cost of debt.

      CPL  has  $75 million available for issuance of preferred  stock
under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in March 1994.
CPL  may offer preferred stock subject to market conditions and  other
factors.   The proceeds of any such offerings will be used principally
to redeem higher cost preferred stock and to repay short-term debt.

Short-Term Financing
     CPL, together with other members of CSW System, has established a
CSW  System  money  pool to coordinate short-term  borrowings.   These
loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates approximating the  CSW
System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  CPL's short-term borrowing
limit  from  the money pool is $300 million.  During 1994, the  annual
weighted  average  interest rate was 4.5% and the  average  amount  of
short-  term  month-end borrowings outstanding was $129 million.   The
maximum  amount of short-term borrowings outstanding at any  month-end
during  1994  was  $232 million, which was the amount  outstanding  at
February 28, 1994.

Internally Generated Funds
      Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from  operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  CPL uses short-
term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital requirements due  to
the  seasonal  nature of energy sales.  CPL anticipates  that  capital
requirements for the period 1995 to 1997 will be met, in  large  part,
from  internal  sources.   CPL  also anticipates  that  some  external
financing  will be required during the period, but the nature,  timing
and  extent  have  not  yet been determined.   Information  concerning
internally generated funds follows:

                                       1994   1993   1992
                                            (millions)
           Internally Generated Funds  $114    $92    $95
                                                        
           Construction Expenditures                    
           Provided by Internally 
           Generated Funds              65%    52%    94%

Sales of Accounts Receivable
      CPL  sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable,  without
recourse,   to  CSW  Credit.   The  sales  provided  CPL   with   cash
immediately,  thereby  reducing  working  capital  needs  and  revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts receivable
sold  were  $121.9 million and $113.5 million in 1994, as compared  to
$112.3 million and $105.8 million in 1993.

<PAGE> 2-76
Recent Developments and Trends
Competition and Industry Challenges
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry  are
impacting CPL and electric utilities generally.  Increased competition
facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic, political and
technological factors.  These factors have resulted in legislative and
regulatory  initiatives  that are likely to  result  in  even  greater
competition at both the wholesale and retail level in the future.   As
competition  in the industry increases, CPL will have the  opportunity
to  seek  new  customers and at the same time be  at  risk  of  losing
customers  to  other competitors.  CPL believes that  its  prices  for
electricity  and the quality and reliability of its service  currently
places it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

      The  Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy Policy
Act  creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding Company  Act
and  permits utilities, including registered utility holding companies
and  non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are a new category  of
non-utility  wholesale power producer that are free from most  federal
and  state  regulation, including the principal  restrictions  of  the
Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable broader participation in
wholesale  power  markets  by  reducing  regulatory  hurdles  to  such
participation.  The Energy Policy Act also allows the FERC, on a case-
by-case  basis  and  with  certain restrictions,  to  order  wholesale
transmission  access and to order electric utilities to enlarge  their
transmission  systems.  A FERC order requiring a transmitting  utility
to  provide  wholesale  transmission service must  include  provisions
generally  that  permit  (i) the utility  to  recover  from  the  FERC
applicant   all  of  the  costs  incurred  in  connection   with   the
transmission  services and (ii) any enlargement  of  the  transmission
system  and  associated services.  While CPL believes that the  Energy
Policy   Act  will  continue  to  make  the  wholesale  markets   more
competitive, CPL is unable to predict the extent to which  the  Energy
Policy Act will impact its operations.

       Increasing  competition  in  the  utility  industry  brings  an
increased  need  to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail  regulatory
environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from  traditional   rate   base
regulation  to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and  performance-
based  plans  encourage efficiencies and increased productivity  while
permitting  utilities  to share in the results.   Retail  wheeling,  a
major  industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel"  or  move
power  from  third parties to their own retail customer,  is  evolving
gradually.

      Wholesale  energy  markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment of
the  Energy Policy Act.  CPL competes in the wholesale energy  markets
with  other  public  utilities,  cogenerators,  qualified  facilities,
exempt wholesale generators and others for sales of electric power.

      Under  the  Energy  Policy Act, the FERC  has  approved  several
proposals by utility companies to sell wholesale power at market-based
rates  and provide to electric utilities "open access" to transmission
systems,  subject  to  certain requirements.  The  adoption  of  these
proposals  increases  marketing opportunities for electric  utilities,
but  also exposes them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues
due to competition with alternative suppliers.

      CPL  believes that, compared to other electric utilities, it  is
well  positioned  to  meet  future  competition.   CPL  benefits  from
economies  of  scale  and  scope  by  virtue  of  its  size  and   its
relationship  to  the CSW System.  Moreover, CPL is  taking  steps  to
enhance its marketing and customer service, reduce costs, improve  and
standardize   business   practices,   and   grow   through   strategic
acquisitions, in order to position itself for increased competition in
the future.

      CPL  is  unable  to predict the ultimate outcome  or  impact  of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on CPL.  As the
wholesale  and  retail  electricity markets become  more  competitive,
however,  the  principal factor determining success is  likely  to  be
price,  and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability of capacity,
and customer service.

<PAGE> 2-77
Public Utility Regulatory Act
      PURA is the legal foundation for electric utility regulation  in
Texas.  PURA will expire on September 1, 1995, in accordance with  the
sunset  policy of the Texas Legislature, which applies  to  all  state
agencies,  unless the Texas Legislature reenacts PURA in  its  current
form  or in modified form.  Several proposals have been made to  amend
PURA which, among other things, provide for a market-driven integrated
resource  planning  process, pricing flexibility for  utilities  faced
with competitive challenges, incentive regulation and deregulation  of
the  wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT.  CPL is unable  to  predict
the  ultimate outcome of the 1995 session of the Texas Legislature and
in  particular  whether  amendments to  PURA  will  be  adopted.   If,
however, the Texas Legislature passes legislation permitting any  form
of  retail wheeling, such legislation could have an adverse impact  on
CPL and CPL's sales to its retail customers.

Regulatory Accounting
      Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71,  which  allows  for  the recognition and  recovery  of  regulatory
assets,   CPL  has  recognized  significant  regulatory   assets   and
liabilities.  Management believes that CPL will continue to  meet  the
criteria  for  following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the  event  CPL  no
longer  meets  the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off  of
regulatory  assets and liabilities would be required.  For  additional
information  regarding  SFAS  No. 71 reference  is  made  to  NOTE  1,
Summary  of  Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory  Assets  and
Liabilities.

Consolidated Taxes
      The  Texas  Commission before 1992 allowed income  taxes  to  be
recovered  in  rates based on the federal income  tax  incurred  by  a
utility  as  if  it  were  a  stand-alone company.   This  stand-alone
approach  treated the regulated activities of a utility as a  separate
entity  and  considered  only those revenues  and  expenses  that  are
included  in  the utility's cost of service to calculate  the  federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.

      Beginning  in 1992, the Texas Commission changed its  method  of
calculating  the federal income tax component of rates to the  "actual
tax  approach."   The actual tax approach is an evolving  concept  but
generally  seeks to reflect in rates the actual tax liability  of  the
utility  irrespective  of its relationship to the  utility's  cost  of
service.  The approach reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions
which  are  not  considered for or included in setting rates  for  the
utility.

      The  Texas Commission is expected to use the actual tax approach
for calculating the recovery of federal income tax in the pending rate
case  for  CPL.   The  impact  of  the  actual  tax  approach  on  the
prospective  rates for CPL cannot be determined since the  application
of the concept is unsettled.

      CPL  believes that the recovery of federal income taxes in rates
should  be  determined  on  the stand-alone  approach  for  ratemaking
purposes,  but there is no assurance this approach will be adopted  in
the pending CPL rate case.

Environmental Matters
CERCLA and Related Matters
      The  operations of CPL, like those of other utilities, generally
involve  the  use and disposal of substances subject to  environmental
laws.   The CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses the cleanup
of  sites  contaminated by hazardous substances.   Superfund  requires
that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault or the legality of
past  disposal  activities.   PRPs include  owners  and  operators  of
contaminated  sites  and transporters and/or generators  of  hazardous
substances.   Many states have similar laws.  Theoretically,  any  one
PRP  can  be  held  responsible for the  entire  cost  of  a  cleanup.
Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.

      CPL  is subject to various pending claims alleging it is  a  PRP
under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and cleaning up
contaminated  property.  CPL  anticipates  that  resolution  of  these
claims,  individually or in the aggregate, will not  have  a  material
adverse  effect on CPL's results of operations or financial condition.

<PAGE> 2-78
Although  the reasons for this expectation differ from site  to  site,
factors  that  are  the basis for the expectation for  specific  sites
include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly contributed by  CPL,
the  estimated  amount of costs allocated to CPL and the participation
of other parties.

Clean Air Act Amendments
      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the  year  2000, CPL will be required to hold allowances in order  to
emit sulfur dioxide.  The EPA issues allowances to owners of existing
generating units based on historical operating conditions.  Based  on
the CSW System facilities plan, CPL believes that its allowances will
be  adequate  to  meet its needs at least through 2008.   Public  and
private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.  CPL
presently has no intention of engaging in trading of allowances,  but
may  seek  to  do so in the future if market conditions  warrant  and
appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.

      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requires government studies to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission regulations and the air toxics study will have on CPL cannot
be determined at this time.

      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  CPL
expects  to  spend  $1.3  million for  annual  testing  of,  software
modifications  to, and maintenance of continuous emission  monitoring
equipment from 1995 through 1997.

EMFs
      Research  is  ongoing whether exposure to  EMFs  may  result  in
adverse  health effects.  Although a few of the studies to  date  have
suggested certain associations between EMFs and some types of effects,
the   research   to   date  has  not  established  a  cause-and-effect
relationship  between  EMFs and adverse health  effects.   CPL  cannot
predict  the impact on CPL or the electric utility industry if further
investigations  or  proceedings were to  establish  that  the  present
electricity  delivery  system is contributing  to  increased  risk  or
incidence of health problems.

Results of Operations
Electric Operating Revenues
      Total  revenues  decreased $5.5 million in 1994  and  increased
$110.1  million  in  1993.  The 1994 decrease  reflects  lower  fuel-
related  revenues of $41.5 million partially offset  by  higher  base
revenues  of  $35.9  million.  Fuel-related revenues  declined  as  a
result  of   lower  per  unit  fuel and  purchased  power  costs,  as
discussed below.

      Total  KWH sales were up 8%, reflecting growth of 7% in  retail
sales and  41% in lower margin sales for resale.  All of CPL's retail
classes  showed  KWH growth with increases of 6% in both  residential
and  commercial sales.  An increase in the number of residential  and
commercial  customers  served and warmer spring  as  well  as  summer
weather  also contributed to this growth.   Industrial sales were  up
8%  as  a  result of higher demand in the petrochemical and petroleum
industries,  where several companies CPL serves had plant  expansions
and  increased  load requirements.  The rise in sales for  resale  is
attributable to warmer summer and spring weather and lower  cost  STP
generation.

     The increase in revenues in 1993 over 1992 reflects higher fuel-
related  revenues  and greater base revenues.  Fuel-related  revenues
were  up  because  of the rise in per unit fuel and  purchased  power
costs,  as  discussed below, and  higher fuel consumption on  greater
KWH sales.

<PAGE> 2-79
Fuel and Purchased Power
      Fuel expense decreased $21.8 million or 6% due primarily  to  a
decrease in the average unit cost of fuel from $2.17 in 1993 to $1.75
in  1994 partially offset by a 16% increase in generation.  The lower
average unit cost of fuel reflects increased usage of lower unit cost
nuclear  fuel  since  STP  Units 1 and 2 restarted  and  reached  100
percent  output  level in April and June of 1994,  respectively,  and
lower unit costs of gas and coal in 1994.  STP Units 1 and 2 had  not
operated  at  full  capacity  since February  1993  as  discussed  in
Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings in NOTE 9.

      Fuel  expense  increased in 1993 due primarily to  higher  fuel
consumption in both gas and coal as a result of the STP outage and an
increase in the average unit cost of fuel from $1.70 in 1992 to $2.17
in 1993.

       Purchased  power  decreased  $21.7  million  during  1994  and
increased $46.9 million in 1993 when compared to the prior  year  due
to the outage at STP.

Other Operating and Maintenance Expenses and Taxes
      Other  operating expenses were relatively stable  in  1994  and
increased  $40.5 million or 22% in 1993 when compared  to  the  prior
year.

      The 1993 increase in other operating expenses was due primarily
to  the  higher  costs associated with the STP outage  and  increased
pension and medical costs, which included implementation of SFAS  No.
106.

      Restructuring charges reflect the initial estimated cost of $29
million as previously discussed.  Such expenses include the estimated
costs   associated  with  the  early  retirement  program,  severance
packages and relocation.

      Maintenance  expense decreased $12.8 million  during  1994  and
increased $20.0 million in 1993 when compared to the prior  year  due
primarily  to  maintenance  activities at  STP  associated  with  the
outage.

      Depreciation and amortization increased in 1994 and 1993  as  a
result  of increases in depreciable plant.  The increase in  1994  is
also  attributable  to a decline in amortization credits  related  to
power plant investment.

      Taxes, other than federal income, decreased in 1994 mainly as a
result of a franchise tax refund.  The increase in 1993 is largely  a
result of increased ad valorem taxes.

      Federal  income taxes increased $10.2 million in  1994  due  to
higher  pre-tax income.  Federal income taxes decreased $12.1 million
in  1993 due to lower pre-tax income partially offset by the increase
in  the  statutory tax rate from 34% to 35% effective retroactive  to
January 1, 1993.

Inflation
     Annual inflation rates, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,
have  averaged 2.7% during the three years ended December  31,  1994.
CPL  believes  that inflation, at these levels, does  not  materially
affect  its  results  of operation or financial condition.   However,
under existing regulatory practice, only the historical cost of plant
is  recoverable from customers.  As a result, cash flows designed  to
provide  recovery of historical plant costs may not  be  adequate  to
replace plant in future years.

Mirror CWIP Liability Amortization
     CPL is amortizing its Mirror CWIP liability in declining amounts
over  the years 1991 through 1995.  Non-cash earnings of $68  million
were recognized in 1994, a decrease from the $75.7 million recognized
in  1993.  The remaining liability to be  amortized for 1995  is  $41
million, which will fully amortize the Mirror CWIP liability.

<PAGE> 2-80
Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
      In  1993,  CPL  changed its method of accounting  for  unbilled
revenues and implemented SFAS No. 112.  These accounting changes  had

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Public Utility Regulation
  CPL  is  subject to regulation by the SEC under the Holding Company
  Act  and  the  FERC under the Federal Power Act,  and  follows  the
  Uniform  System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC.  CPL is subject
  to  further  regulation with regard to rates and other  matters  by
  the  Texas Commission.  CPL, as a member of the CSW System, engages
  in  transactions and coordinates its activities and operations with
  other members of the CSW System.

  The  more  significant accounting policies of  CPL  are  summarized
  below:

  Electric Utility Plant
  Electric  utility  plant  is  stated  at  the  original   cost   of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct   labor,  materials,  overhead  items  and  allowances   for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.

  Depreciation
  Provisions  for  depreciation of utility plant are  computed  using
  the straight-line method, generally at individual rates applied  to
  the  various  classes of depreciable property.  The annual  average
  consolidated composite rates were 3.0% for 1994, 1993 and 1992.

  Nuclear Decommissioning
  At  the  end of STP's service life, decommissioning is expected  to
  be  accomplished using the decontamination method, which is one  of
  the  techniques  acceptable  to the NRC.   Using  this  method  the
  decontamination activities occur as soon as possible after the  end
  of  plant operations.  Contaminated equipment is cleaned or removed
  to  a  permanent  disposal  location  and  the  site  is  generally
  returned to its pre-plant state.

  CPL's  decommissioning costs are accrued and funded to an  external
  trust  over  the  expected service life  of  the  STP  units.   The
  existing  NRC  operating licenses will allow the operation  of  STP
  Unit  1  until  2027, and Unit 2 until 2028.   The  accrual  is  an
  annual   level  cost  based  on  the  estimated  future   cost   to
  decommission  STP, including escalations for expected inflation  to
  the  expected  time  of decommissioning, and  is  net  of  expected
  earnings on the trust fund.

  CPL's  portion  of the costs of decommissioning STP were  estimated
  to  be  $85 million in 1986 dollars based on a site specific  study
  completed  in 1986.  CPL is recovering these decommissioning  costs
  through  rates based on the service life of STP at a rate  of  $4.2
  million  per year.  The $4.2 million annual cost of decommissioning
  is  reflected on the income statement in other operating   expense.
  Decommissioning  costs  are paid to an irrevocable  external  trust
  and  as such are not reflected on CPL's balance sheet.  At December
  31, 1994, the trust balance was $19.3 million.

  In  May 1994, CPL received a new decommissioning study updating the
  cost  estimates to decommission STP that indicated that CPL's share
  of  such  costs would increase from $85 million, as stated in  1986
  dollars,  to $251 million, as stated in 1994 dollars.  The increase
  in  costs  occurred  primarily  as a  result  of  extended  on-site
  storage  of  high level waste, much higher estimates  of  low-level
  waste  disposal  costs and increased labor costs  since  the  prior
  study.   These costs are expected to be incurred during  the  years
  2027  through  2062.  While this is the best estimate available  at
  this  time, these costs may change between now and when  the  funds
  are  actually  expended because of changes in the assumptions  used
  to  derive  the  estimates, including the prices of the  goods  and
  services  required  to accomplish the decommissioning.   Additional
  studies will be completed periodically to update this information.


<PAGE> 2-88
  Based  on  this  projected cost to decommission STP, CPL  estimates
  that  its  annual funding level should increase to  $10.0  million.
  CPL  has  requested this amount as part of its cost of  service  in
  its  current rate filing. Other parties to the rate proceeding have
  filed  their  projections of the annual amount, which  have  ranged
  from  $4.5  million to $8.1 million.  CPL expects to  fund  at  the
  level  ultimately  ordered  by the Texas  Commission  although  CPL
  cannot  predict what that level will be.  Historically,  the  Texas
  Commission  has  allowed  full recovery of nuclear  decommissioning
  costs.    For further information on CPL's current rate filing  see
  NOTE  9,  Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Texas  Commission
  Proceedings.

  Electric Revenues and Fuel
  Prior  to January 1, 1993, electric revenues were recorded  at  the
  time  billings  were  made to customers on a  cycle-billing  basis.
  Electric  service provided subsequent to billing dates through  the
  end  of  each  calendar month became part of operating revenues  of
  the  next  month.   To conform to general industry  standards,  CPL
  changed  its method of accounting to accrue for estimated  unbilled
  revenues.   The  effect of this change on 1993 net  income  was  an
  increase of $29.5 million included in cumulative effect of  changes
  in accounting principles.

  CPL  recovers  fuel  costs in Texas as a fixed  component  of  base
  rates whereby over-recoveries of fuel are payable to customers  and
  under-recoveries may be billed to customers after Texas  Commission
  approval.   The  cost  of fuel is charged to expense  as  consumed.
  See  NOTE  9,  Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings,  for  further
  information  about  fuel  recoveries.   CPL  recovers  fuel   costs
  applicable  to  wholesale customers, which  are  regulated  by  the
  FERC,  through an automatic fuel adjustment clause.  CPL  amortizes
  direct  nuclear fuel costs to fuel expense on the basis of a  ratio
  of  the estimated energy used in the core to the energy expected to
  be  derived from such fuel assembly over its life in the core.   In
  addition  to  fuel  amortization,  CPL  also  incurs  nuclear  fuel
  expense  as a result of other items, including spent fuel  disposal
  fees  assessed  on  the basis of net KWHs sold from  STP,  and  DOE
  special assessment fees for decontamination and decommissioning  of
  the   enrichment  facilities  on  the  basis  of  prior  usage   of
  enrichment services.

  Accounts Receivable
  CPL  sells  its  billed and unbilled accounts  receivable,  without
  recourse, to CSW Credit.

  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
  For  its  regulated  activities, CPL follows  SFAS  No.  71,  which
  defines  the  criteria  for  establishing  regulatory  assets   and
  regulatory  liabilities.   Regulatory  assets  represent   probable
  future  revenue to CPL associated with certain costs which will  be
  recovered   from   customers  through   the   ratemaking   process.
  Regulatory   liabilities  represent  probable  future  refunds   to
  customers.   At  December 31, 1994 and 1993, CPL had  recorded  the
  following significant regulatory assets and liabilities:

                                           1994       1993

  Deferred Plant Costs
  In  accordance with orders of the Texas Commission,   CPL  deferred
  operating,  depreciation and tax costs  incurred  for   STP.   This
  deferral  was for the period beginning on the date when  the  plant
  began  commercial operation until the date the plant  was  included
  in   rate  base.   The  deferred  costs  are  being  amortized  and
  recovered  through rates over the life of the plant.  See  NOTE  9,
  Litigation  and Regulatory Proceedings, for further  discussion  of
  CPL's deferred accounting proceedings.

  Mirror CWIP
  In   accordance  with  Texas  Commission  orders,  CPL   previously
  recorded   Mirror CWIP, which is being amortized over the  life  of
  STP.  For more information regarding Mirror CWIP, reference is made
  to NOTE 9, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings.
  Statements of Cash Flows
  Cash   equivalents  are  considered  to  be  highly   liquid   debt
  instruments  purchased  with a maturity of three  months  or  less.
  Accordingly,   temporary  cash  investments  are  considered   cash
  equivalents.

  Reclassification
  Certain  financial  statement  items  for  prior  years  have  been
  reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

  Accounting Changes
  Effective January 1, 1993, CPL adopted SFAS Nos. 106, 112 and  109.
  See   NOTE   2,  Federal  Income  Taxes,  for  further  information
  regarding  SFAS No. 109.  In addition, CPL also changed its  method
  of  accounting  for unbilled revenues.  See Electric  Revenues  and
  Fuel above for further information.

  The  adoption  of  SFAS No. 106 resulted in  an  increase  in  1993
  operating expenses of $5.9 million.  The adoption of SFAS  No.  112
  and  the  change in accounting for unbilled revenues are  presented
  as  a  cumulative  effect  of changes in accounting  principles  as
  shown below:

                               Pre-Tax        Tax          Net Income
                               Effect         Effect         Effect
                                           (thousands)
        SFAS No. 112          $(3,371)      $  1,180       $ (2,191)
        Unbilled revenues      45,363        (15,877)        29,486
        Total                 $41,992       $(14,697)       $27,295

  Pro  forma  amounts,  assuming that the change  in  accounting  for
  unbilled   revenues  had  been  adopted  retroactively,   are   not
  materially  different from amounts previously  reported  for  prior
  years.

2.Federal Income Taxes
  CPL  adopted  the provisions of SFAS No. 109 effective  January  1,
  1993.   The  implementation of SFAS No. 109 had no material  effect
  on  CPL's  earnings.   As a result of this change,  CPL  recognized
  additional  accumulated  deferred income  taxes  from  its  utility
  operations, and corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities  to
  ratepayers in amounts equal to future revenues or the reduction  in
  future  revenues required when the income tax temporary differences
  reverse  and are recovered or settled in rates.  As a result  of  a
  favorable  earnings  history,  CPL did  not  record  any  valuation
  allowance  against  deferred tax assets at December  31,  1994  and
  1993.

  CPL,  together  with  other members of  the  CSW  System,  files  a
  consolidated federal income tax return and participates  in  a  tax
  sharing agreement.

3.Long-Term Debt
  The  mortgage  indenture,  as  amended and  supplemented,  securing
  first  mortgage  bonds issued by CPL, constitutes  a  direct  first
  mortgage  lien  on substantially all electric utility  plant.   CPL
  may  offer  additional  first  mortgage  bonds  subject  to  market
  conditions and other factors.

  Annual Requirements
  Certain  series  of  outstanding first mortgage bonds  have  annual
  sinking fund requirements, which are generally 1% of the amount  of
  each  such series issued.  These requirements may be, and generally
  have  been,  satisfied by the application of net  expenditures  for
  bondable  property  in an amount equal to 166-2/3%  of  the  annual
  requirements.   In addition, one series of CPL's pollution  control
  bonds,  has a sinking fund requirement.  At December 31, 1994,  the
  annual  sinking fund requirements and annual maturities  for  CPL's
  first mortgage bonds and pollution control bonds for the next  five
  years follow:

                               Sinking Fund
                               Requirements   Maturities

                      1997        2,585         202,840

                      1999        2,560          27,560

  Dividends
  CPL's  mortgage  indenture, as amended and  supplemented,  contains
  certain  restrictions  on the use of their  retained  earnings  for
  cash  dividends on their common stock.  These restrictions  do  not

<PAGE> 2-92
  limit  the ability of CSW to pay dividends to its stockholders.  At
  December  31,  1994, the amount of retained earnings available  for
  payment of cash dividends to CSW by CPL was $684 million.
  
  Reacquired Long-term Debt
  Reference  is  made  to  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF
  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS,  Liquidity  and
  Capital  Resources,  for further information related  to  long-term
  debt, including new issues and reacquisitions.

4.Preferred Stock
  The  dividends on CPL's $160 million auction preferred  stocks  are
  adjusted  every  49  days,  based on  current  market  rates.   The
  dividend rates averaged 3.5%, 2.7%, and 3.6% during 1994, 1993  and
  1992.

  CPL  retired  the  remaining shares of its 10.05% Series  preferred
  stock during August 1994.

  Each  series of preferred stock, with the exception of the  auction
  preferred  stock, is redeemable at the option of CPL upon  30  days
  notice  at  the  current  redemption price per  share.   Redemption
  prices  of  the  8.72%  Series decline at  specified  intervals  in
  future years.  CPL's two issues of auction preferred stock and  one
  issue  of  money market preferred stock may be redeemed at  par  on
  any dividend payment date.

5.Short-Term Financing
  CPL,   together  with  other  members  of  the  CSW   System,   has
  established  a  money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings  and
  to  make  borrowings outside the money pool through CSW's  issuance
  of  commercial paper.  Money pool balances are shown as advances to
  or  from  affiliates on the Balance Sheets.  At December 31,  1994,
  the  CSW  System had bank lines of credit aggregating $930  million
  to   back  up  its  commercial  paper  program.   Short-term   cash
  surpluses transferred to the money pool receive interest income  in
  accordance with the money pool arrangement.

6.Financial Instruments
  The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate  the
  fair  value of each class of financial instruments for which it  is
  practicable to estimate fair value.

  Cash, special deposits and temporary cash investments
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  Advances from affiliates
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  Long-term debt
  The  fair  value  CPL's long-term debt is estimated  based  on  the
  quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  issues  or  on  the
  current  rates  offered  to CPL for debt of  the  same  or  similar
  remaining maturities.
  
  Preferred stock
  The  fair  value  of  CPL's preferred stock  subject  to  mandatory
  redemption is estimated based on quoted market prices for the  same
  or  similar  issues  or on the current rates  offered  to  CPL  for
  preferred  stock  with  the  same or similar  remaining  redemption
  provisions.
  
  Long-term debt and preferred stock due within twelve months
  The  fair values of CPL's current maturities of long-term debt  and
  preferred  stock  are estimated based on current rates  offered  to
  CPL for long-term debt and preferred stock.

<PAGE> 2-93
  The estimated fair values of CPL's financial instruments follow:
  
                                         1994                       1993

  The fair value does not affect CPL's liabilities unless the issues
  are redeemed prior to their maturity dates.

7.Benefit Plans
  Defined Benefit Pension Plan
  CPL,  together with the other members of the CSW System,  maintains
  a  tax  qualified,  non-contributory defined benefit  pension  plan
  covering  substantially  all  employees.   Benefits  are  based  on
  employees' years of credited service, age at retirement, and  final
  average  annual  earnings  with  an offset  for  the  participant's
  primary  Social Security benefit.  The CSW System's funding  policy
  is  based  on  actuarially  determined contributions,  taking  into
  account  amounts which are deductible for income tax  purposes  and
  minimum  contributions required by the ERISA. Pension  plan  assets
  consist primarily of common stocks and short-term and intermediate-
  term fixed income investments.
  Contributions  to the plan for the years ended December  31,  1994,
  1993  and  1992 were $7.1 million, $11.0 million and $11.7 million,
  respectively.

  The  approximate maximum number of participants in the plan  during
  1994  were 2,300 active employees, 1,200 retirees and beneficiaries
  and 300 terminated employees.

  The  components  of net periodic pension cost and  the  assumptions
  used in accounting for pension follow:

<PAGE> 2-94
  At  December  31,  1994, the plan's net assets  were  approximately
  equal  to  the  total  actuarial present value of  the  accumulated
  benefit   obligation.  At   December  31,  1993   the   plan's  net
  assets   exceeded  the  total  actuarial  present  value   of   the
  accumulated  benefit obligation.  No reconciliation of the  funding
  status  of  the  plan  is  presented because  such  information  is
  unavailable.

  Health and Welfare Plans
  CPL  had  medical,  dental,  group life insurance,  dependent  life
  insurance,  and  accidental  death  and  dismemberment  plans   for
  substantially   all   active  CPL  employees   during   1994.   The
  contributions,  recorded on a pay-as-you-go basis,  for  the  years
  ended  December 31, 1994 and 1993 were approximately  $4.6  million
  and  $6.1  million,  respectively.  Effective January  1993,  CPL's
  method  of  providing health benefits was modified to include  such
  benefits  as a health maintenance organization, preferred  provider
  options,  managed prescription drug and mail-order  program  and  a
  mental health and substance abuse program in addition to the  self-
  insured indemnity plans.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
  CPL  adopted SFAS No. 106 effective January 1, 1993. The effect  on
  operating expense in 1993 was $5.9 million.  CPL is amortizing  the
  transition  obligation  over   twenty years,  with  eighteen  years
  remaining.  In prior years,  these benefits were accounted  for  on
  a pay-as-you-go basis.

  The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost follow:

                                                      1994      1993

  benefits by $1.1 million.

8.Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
  CPL  has a joint ownership agreement with other members of the  CSW
  System  and other non-affiliated entities.  Such agreements provide
  for  the  joint ownership and operation of STP and Oklaunion  power
  plants.   The  statements  of  income  reflect  CPL's  portion   of
  operating costs associated with jointly owned plants.  At  December
  31, 1994, CPL had interests as shown below:

9.Litigation and  Regulatory Proceedings
  STP
  From  February 1993 until May 1994, STP experienced an  unscheduled
  outage  which  has  resulted  in significant  rate  and  regulatory
  proceedings  involving CPL.  These matters, including a  base  rate
  case   and   fuel   reconciliation   proceedings,   are   discussed
  immediately below.

  Texas Commission Proceedings
  Base Rates
  Rate Inquiry - Docket No. 12820
  Several  Cities,  the Texas Commission General Counsel  and  others
  initiated  actions in late 1993 and early 1994 which,  if  approved
  by  the  Texas  Commission,  would lower  CPL's  base  rates.   The
  requests  for a review of CPL's rates arose out of the  unscheduled
  outage  at  STP which began in February 1993.  The STP  outage  did
  not  affect  CPL's  ability  to meet  customer  demand  because  of
  existing capacity and CPL's purchase of additional energy.

  Pursuant to a scheduling and procedural settlement agreement  among
  the  parties challenging CPL's rates, which was approved by a Texas
  Commission  ALJ  on  April  1, 1994, CPL submitted  a  rate  filing
  package  on  July  1, 1994 to the Texas Commission  justifying  its
  current  base rate structure.  In that filing, CPL stated  that  it

<PAGE> 2-96
  had  a  $111  million  retail  revenue  deficiency  and  would   be
  justified  in  seeking a base rate increase.   However,  consistent
  with  the  procedural settlement agreement, CPL has not  sought  to
  increase  base rates as a part of this docket but seeks to maintain
  its  rates  at the same levels agreed to in the settlement  of  its
  last  two  rate cases in 1990 and 1991.  As part of  the  1990  and
  1991  settlements, CPL agreed to freeze base rates from January  1,
  1991   through  1994,  subject  to  certain  force  majeure  events
  including    double   digit   inflation,   major   tax   increases,
  extraordinary  increases in operating expenses or serious  declines
  in  operating  revenues.  On October 31, 1994, CPL  filed  rebuttal
  testimony   that   revised  its  retail   revenue   deficiency   to
  approximately  $103 million.  CPL continues to  maintain  that  its
  rates  are  reasonable and that its earnings are within established
  regulatory guidelines.

  Parties  to  CPL's  base rate case have filed  testimony  with  the
  Texas  Commission  recommending reductions  in  CPL's  base  rates.
  Among  the  parties that filed testimony were OPUC which  initially
  recommended  an  annual $100 million retail rate reduction.   After
  hearings  on the rate case, OPUC claimed that CPL did not meet  its
  burden  of  proof concerning deferred accounting and  as  a  result
  OPUC  changed its proposed reduction to $147 million.  The  Cities,
  which are parties to the rate case, have recommended an annual  $75
  million retail rate reduction and the write-off of $219 million  of
  CPL's Mirror CWIP asset.  See Deferred Accounting below.

  The  Staff  filed  testimony recommending an  annual  reduction  in
  retail  rates  of  $99.6 million resulting from  a  combination  of
  proposed  rate  base  and  cost  of service  reductions,  which  it
  subsequently revised during the hearings to $83.9 million.  In  its
  final brief to the ALJ, the Staff withdrew its recommendation  that
  short-term  debt be included in the calculation of  CPL's  weighted
  cost  of  capital.  CPL estimates that this change in  the  Staff's
  position  will lower its revised proposed retail rate reduction  by
  approximately  $6  million.   The Staff  recommended  a  rate  base
  disallowance  of  $407  million,  or  approximately  17%  of  CPL's
  investment   in   STP,  based  upon  the  Staff's  calculation   of
  historical  performance for STP compared to a peer group  of  other
  nuclear  facilities.  The Staff also recommended  that  accumulated
  depreciation and accumulated deferred federal income taxes  related
  to  the  disallowed portion of STP be adjusted  to  reflect  a  net
  reduction  to rate base of $325 million.  Additionally,  the  Staff
  proposed   to   disallow  depreciation  expense  related   to   the
  recommended STP disallowed plant.

  In  its testimony, the Staff argued that its proposed STP rate base
  reduction  was  a  historical performance-based  disallowance  that
  could  be  temporary in nature and would not have to  result  in  a
  permanent  disallowance.  The Staff indicated that, in the  future,
  CPL  could  seek recovery in rates of the proposed  STP  rate  base
  disallowance, subject to the performance of STP.

  The  Texas Commission held hearings in November and December  1994,
  and  all  parties  have  filed briefs in  the  case.   The  ALJ  is
  expected  to  issue  a recommended order for consideration  by  the
  Texas  Commission in April 1995, with a final order from the  Texas
  Commission  expected in May 1995.  Testimony filed  by  parties  to
  the  rate  case, including the Staff, is not binding on either  the
  ALJ or the Texas Commission.

  CPL  strongly believes that 100 percent of its investment  in  both
  units  of STP belong in rate base.  This belief is based on,  among
  other  factors,  Units 1 and 2 providing output  at  high  capacity
  factors since April and June 1994, respectively.  In addition,  the
  long-term   benefits  nuclear  generation  provides  to   customers
  supports their inclusion in rate base.  Furthermore, there  are  no
  Texas  Commission precedents addressing the removal  of  a  nuclear
  plant   from   rate  base  as  a  performance-based   disallowance.
  Assuming  both units of STP are included in rate base, CPL believes
  it  is  not  collecting  excessive revenues,  notwithstanding  that
  market  rates of return on common equity are generally lower  today
  than  they  were in 1990 and 1991, when CPL's base rates were  last
  set.

  Fuel
  Introduction
  Pursuant  to  the  substantive rules of the Texas  Commission,  CPL
  generally  is  allowed to recover its fuel costs  through  a  fixed
  fuel  factor.  These  fuel factors are in the nature  of  temporary
  rates,  and  CPL's collection of revenues by such fuel  factors  is
  subject  to  adjustment  at  the  time  of  a  fuel  reconciliation
  proceeding  before  the Texas Commission.  The  difference  between
  fuel  revenues billed and fuel expense incurred is recorded  as  an
  addition to or a reduction of revenues, with a corresponding  entry
  to   unrecovered  fuel  costs  or  other  current  liabilities,  as
  appropriate.   Any  fuel  costs, not limited  to  under-  or  over-
  recoveries,  which the Texas Commission determines as  unreasonable
  in a reconciliation proceeding are not recoverable from customers.

  Fuel Surcharge - Docket No. 12154
  In  July  1993,  CPL  filed  a fuel surcharge  petition,  which  is
  separate  from  a fuel reconciliation proceeding,  with  the  Texas
  Commission  to comply with the mandatory provisions  of  the  Texas
  Commission's  fuel  rules.  The petition requested  approval  of  a
  customer  surcharge to recover under-recovered fuel  and  purchased
  power  costs  resulting from the STP outage, increased natural  gas
  costs  and  other  factors.  The petition also requested  that  the
  Texas Commission postpone consideration of the surcharge until  the
  STP  outage concluded or at the time fuel costs are next reconciled
  as  discussed  above.   In  August 1993,  a  Texas  Commission  ALJ
  granted  CPL's request to postpone consideration of the  surcharge.
  In  January  and  July  of  1994, CPL updated  its  fuel  surcharge
  petition  to  reflect  amounts of under-recovery  through  November
  1993  and  May 1994, respectively.  Also, CPL updated its  petition
  in  January  1995  to  reflect amounts  of  under-recovery  through
  November   1994.    Likewise,  CPL  requested   and   was   granted
  postponement  of  the  updated  petitions  until  the  STP   outage
  concluded  or  at  the  time fuel costs are  next  reconciled.   On
  January 4, 1995, Docket No. 12154 was consolidated into Docket  No.
  13650.

  Prudence Inquiry - Docket No. 13126
  In  April  1994, the Texas Commission's General Counsel  and  Staff
  issued  a Request for Proposal for an audit of the STP outage,  and
  in  July 1994 a consultant was selected to perform the audit.   The
  purpose  of  the  audit is to evaluate the prudence  of  management
  activities  at  STP,  including the actions  of  HLP  and  the  STP
  management  committee, of which CPL is a participant.  Such  review
  will  include the time from original commercial operation  of  each
  unit  until  they  were returned to service from the  outage.   The
  findings  of this audit are expected to be incorporated  into  this
  proceeding.  CPL and HLP will pay the costs of the audit  but  will
  have no control over the ultimate work product of the consultant.

  In  June 1994, the Texas Commission's General Counsel initiated  an
  inquiry into the operation and management of STP which resulted  in
  the  establishment of this proceeding.  As part of the inquiry, CPL
  presented   certain   information  concerning   the   prudence   of
  management   activities  at  STP  relating  to  the   STP   outage.
  Testimony filed by CPL stated that the cause of the STP outage  was
  the   result  of  an  accidental  equipment  failure  rather   than
  imprudent   management   activities  at   STP.    Based   on   this
  information,   CPL   will   seek  full   recovery   in   its   fuel
  reconciliation case of incremental energy costs related to the  STP
  outage.

  As  a part of this proceeding, CPL was required to reconstruct  its
  production  costs  assuming  STP was available  100%  of  the  time
  during  the actual outage.  Testimony filed by CPL stated  that  it
  is  unrealistic  to expect any generating unit to operate  all  the
  time.   The  testimony  provided calculations  of  STP  replacement
  power  cost  estimates  for availability factor  scenarios  at  (i)
  100%,  (ii) 75% and (iii) 65% average availability.  Based on these
  average  availability factors, STP net replacement power costs  for
  the  entire  outage period were estimated to be (i) $104.5  million
  at  100%, (ii) $79.0 million at 75% and (iii) $68.2 million at  65%
  average availability.

  The  results of this prudence inquiry are expected to  be  used  in
  CPL's  pending fuel reconciliation proceeding in Docket No.  13650,
  as  discussed  below, and possibly CPL's next base rate  proceeding
  should  a  return  on  equity  penalty  be  ordered  by  the  Texas

<PAGE> 2-98
  Commission.   Such  penalty could lower  CPL's  allowed  return  on
  equity  in its next base rate case from what it otherwise would  be
  permitted to earn.

  Fuel Reconciliation - Docket No. 13650
  On  November  15, 1994, CPL filed a fuel reconciliation  case  with
  the  Texas  Commission  seeking  to  reconcile  approximately  $1.2
  billion  of  fuel costs from March 1, 1990 through June  30,  1994.
  This  period includes the STP outage where CPL's fuel and purchased
  power  costs were increased as the power normally generated by  STP
  was  replaced  through sources with higher costs.  At December  31,
  1994,   CPL's  under-recovered  fuel  balance  was  $54.1  million,
  exclusive  of  interest.  This under-recovery of fuel costs,  while
  due  primarily to the STP outage, was also affected by  changes  in
  fuel   prices  and  timing  differences.   CPL  cannot   accurately
  estimate the amount of any future under- or over-recoveries due  to
  the  nature of the above factors.  CPL cannot predict how the Texas
  Commission  will  ultimately resolve the reasonableness  of  higher
  replacement energy costs associated with the STP outage.   Although
  the  Texas  Commission could disallow all or a portion of  the  STP
  replacement energy costs, such determination cannot be  made  until
  a  final  order is issued by the Texas Commission in  this  docket.
  If  a significant portion of the fuel costs were disallowed by  the
  Texas  Commission, CPL could experience a material  adverse  effect
  on  its  results of operations in the year of disallowance but  not
  on its financial condition.

  CPL  continues to negotiate with the intervening parties to resolve
  Docket  Nos. 12820, 13126 and the STP portions of Docket No.  13650
  through settlement.  However, no settlement has been reached.

  Management  cannot predict the ultimate outcome  of  the  CPL  rate
  inquiry  and  fuel  regulatory  proceedings.   However,  management
  believes  that the ultimate resolution of the various  issues  will
  not  have a material adverse effect on CPL's  results of operations
  or financial condition.

  STP Background
  Final Orders
  In  October 1990, the Texas Commission issued the STP Unit 1  Order
  which  fully  implemented a stipulated agreement filed in  February
  1990  to  resolve dockets then pending before the Texas Commission.
  In  December 1990, the Texas Commission issued the STP Unit 2 Order
  which  fully  implemented  a stipulated agreement  to  resolve  all
  issues regarding CPL's investment in STP Unit 2.

  The  STP Unit 1 Order allowed CPL to increase retail base rates  by
  $144  million.   This  base rate increase  made  permanent  a  $105
  million  interim  base rate increase placed into  effect  in  March
  1990  and  a  $39  million interim base rate increase  placed  into
  effect  in  September 1989.  The STP Unit 2 Order  provided  for  a
  retail  base  rate  increase of $120 million effective  January  1,
  1991.   The  STP  Unit 1 Order also provided for  the  deferral  of
  operating  expenses  and carrying costs on STP  Unit  2.   A  prior
  Texas  Commission  order  had authorized deferral  of  STP  Unit  1
  costs.   See  Deferred  Accounting below.   Such  costs  are  being
  recovered through rates over the remaining life of STP.  Also,  the
  STP  Unit 1 Order authorized use of Mirror CWIP, pursuant to  which
  CPL  recognized  $360 million of carrying costs as deferred  costs,
  and established a corresponding liability to customers recorded  in
  Mirror  CWIP  Liability and Other Deferred Credits on  the  balance
  sheets.   In  compliance with the order, carrying  costs  collected
  through  rates during periods when CWIP was included in  rate  base
  were  recognized  as  a loan from customers.   The  loan  is  being
  repaid  through  lower rates from 1991 through  1995.   The  Mirror
  CWIP  liability  is  being reduced by the recognition  of  non-cash
  income during the period 1991 through 1995.  The Mirror CWIP  asset
  is being amortized to expense over the life of the plant.

  The  STP Unit 1 and 2 Orders resolved all issues pertaining to  the
  reasonable original costs of STP and the appropriate amount  to  be
  included  in  rate base.  Pursuant to the Texas Commission  orders,

<PAGE> 2-99
  the original costs of CPL's total investment in STP is included  in
  rate  base.   As  indicated  under  the  heading  Texas  Commission
  Proceedings above, however, CPL is currently involved in base  rate
  and  fuel  proceedings  which  challenge  CPL's  right  to  recover
  certain costs associated with the STP outage.

  As  part  of  the stipulated agreement, CPL agreed to  freeze  base
  rates  from January 1, 1991 through 1994, subject to certain  force
  majeure   events  including  double-digit  inflation,   major   tax
  increases,   extraordinary  increases  in  operating  expenses   or
  serious   declines  in  operating  revenues.   CPL  may  file   for
  increases  in base rates, which would be effective after  1994  and
  subject  to  certain limitations.  The fuel portion  of  customers'
  bills  is  subject  to adjustment following the normal  review  and
  approval by the Texas Commission.

  The  stipulated agreements, as discussed above, were  entered  into
  by  CPL,  the  Staff and a majority of intervenors including  major
  cities  in  CPL's service territory and major industrial customers.
  These   intervenors  represent  a  significant  majority  of  CPL's
  customers.   CPL  and  the  TSA  reached  agreements,  which   were
  subsequently  approved by the Staff and other signatories,  whereby
  TSA  agreed not to oppose the stipulated agreements in any respect,
  except  with  regard to deferred accounting and rate design  issues
  in  the  STP  Unit  1  Order.  OPUC and a coalition  of  low-income
  customers declined to enter into the stipulated agreements.

  In  January  1991,  the TSA, OPUC and the coalition  of  low-income
  customers  filed appeals of the STP Unit 1 Order in District  Court
  requesting reversal of the deferred accounting for STP Unit  2  and
  other aspects of that order.  In March 1991, the TSA, OPUC and  the
  coalition of low-income customers filed appeals of the STP  Unit  2
  Order  in  the  District Court requesting reversal of  that  order.
  These  appeals  are pending before the District  Court.   If  these
  orders   are   ultimately  reversed  on  appeal,   the   stipulated
  agreements   would  be  nullified  and  CPL  could   experience   a
  significant  adverse  effect  on  its  results  of  operations  and
  financial  condition.   However,  the  parties  to  the  stipulated
  agreement,  should  it be nullified, are bound to  renegotiate  and
  try  to  reach  a  revised agreement that would  achieve  the  same
  economic results.  Management believes that the STP Unit  1  and  2
  Orders will be upheld.

  Deferred Accounting
  CPL  was granted deferred accounting for STP Unit 1 and 2 costs  by
  Texas  Commission orders.  These orders allowed CPL to defer  post-
  in-service  operating and maintenance costs,  including  taxes  and
  depreciation,  and carrying costs until these costs were  reflected
  in  retail  rates.   Deferred accounting had an immediate  positive
  effect  on net income in the years allowed, but cash earnings  were
  not  increased  until  rates went into  effect  reflecting  STP  in
  service.   See  Final Orders above.  The total  deferrals  for  the
  periods  affected were approximately $492 million with an after-tax
  net  income  effect  of  approximately $325  million.   This  total
  deferral  included  approximately  $270  million  of  pre-tax  debt
  carrying  costs.   Pursuant to the STP Unit 1 and 2  Orders,  CPL's
  retail  rates  include recovery of STP Unit 1 and 2 deferrals  over
  the remaining life of the plant.

  In  July  1989,  OPUC  and  the  TSA filed  appeals  of  the  Texas
  Commission's final order in District Court requesting  reversal  of
  deferred  accounting  for  STP Unit  1.   In  September  1990,  the
  District  Court issued a judgment affirming the Texas  Commission's
  order  for STP Unit 1, which was subsequently appealed to the Court
  of  Appeals by OPUC and the TSA.  The hearing of CPL's STP  Unit  1
  deferred  accounting  order was combined by the  Court  of  Appeals
  with similar appeals of HLP deferred accounting orders.

  In  September  1992, the Court of Appeals issued  a  decision  that
  allows   CPL   to  include  STP  Unit  1  deferred  post-in-service
  operating  and maintenance costs in rate base.  However, the  Court
  of  Appeals held that deferred post-in-service carrying costs could
  not  be included in rate base, thereby prohibiting CPL from earning
  a return on such costs.

  After  the  Court  of  Appeals' denial of each party's  motion  for
  rehearing  of  the  decision,  CPL  and  the  Texas  Commission  in
  December 1992 filed Applications for Writ of Error petitioning  the

<PAGE> 2-100
  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  to review the  September  1992  decision
  denying  rate  base treatment of deferred post-in-service  carrying
  costs  by  the  Court of Appeals.  Additionally, the TSA  and  OPUC
  filed  Applications for Writ of Error petitioning the Supreme Court
  of  Texas  to  reverse the Court of Appeals' decision,  challenging
  generally  the  legality  of  deferred  accounting  for  rate  base
  treatment  of  any deferred costs.  In May 1993, the Supreme  Court
  of  Texas granted CPL's Application for Writ of Error.  CPL's  case
  was  consolidated with the deferred accounting cases of El Paso and
  HLP.   In  June 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas sustained deferred
  accounting as an appropriate mechanism for the Texas Commission  to
  use  in  preserving  the  financial integrity  of  utilities.   The
  Supreme  Court  of  Texas  held  that  the  Texas  Commission   can
  authorize utilities to defer those costs that are incurred  between
  the  in-service date of a plant and the effectiveness of new rates,
  which  include  such costs.  On October 6, 1994, the Supreme  Court
  of  Texas  denied a motion for rehearing CPL's deferred  accounting
  matter  filed by the State of Texas.  The language of  the  Supreme
  Court  of  Texas  opinion  suggests  that  the  appropriateness  of
  allowing deferred accounting may need to again be reviewed under  a
  financial  integrity  standard at the time the  costs  begin  being
  recovered  through rates.  For CPL, that would be the  STP  Unit  1
  and  Unit  2 Orders discussed above.  To the extent that additional
  review is required, it should occur in those dockets.

  If  these  deferred accounting matters are not favorably  resolved,
  CPL  could  experience a material adverse effect on its results  of
  operations and financial condition.  While CPL's management  cannot
  predict  the ultimate outcome of these matters, management believes
  CPL  will  receive  approval of its deferred accounting  orders  or
  will  be  successful in renegotiation of its rate orders,  so  that
  there  will  be  no  material adverse effect on  CPL's  results  of
  operations or financial condition.

  Westinghouse Litigation
  CPL  and  other owners of STP are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed  in
  October  1990  in  the  District Court in Matagorda  County,  Texas
  against  Westinghouse, seeking damages and other relief.  The  suit
  alleges  that  Westinghouse  supplied  STP  with  defective   steam
  generator  tubes that are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.
  Westinghouse  filed  an answer to the suit in March  1992,  denying
  the  plaintiff's allegations.  The suit is set for  trial  in  July
  1995.

  Inspections  during  the STP outage have detected  early  signs  of
  stress  corrosion  cracking in tubes at  STP  Unit  1.   Management
  believes  additional problems would develop gradually and  will  be
  monitored  by the Project Manager of STP.  An accurate estimate  of
  the   costs   of  remedying  any  further  problems  currently   is
  unavailable  due  to  many  uncertainties,  including  among  other
  things,  the  timing of repairs, which may coincide with  scheduled
  outages,  and  the  recoverability of  amounts  from  Westinghouse.
  Management  believes that the ultimate resolution  of  this  matter
  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect  on  CPL's  results  of
  operations or financial condition.

  Industrial Road and Industrial Metals Site
  Several  lawsuits  relating to the industrial road  and  industrial
  metals  site  in Corpus Christi, Texas, naming CPL as a  defendant,
  are  currently  pending  in  federal  and  state  court  in  Texas.
  Plaintiffs' claims allege property damage and health impairment  as
  a  result  of  operations  on  the site  and  clean-up  activities.
  Although   management   cannot  predict  the   outcome   of   these
  proceedings,  based  on the defenses that management  believes  are
  available  to CPL, management believes that the ultimate resolution
  of  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on  CPL's
  results of operations or financial condition.

  Civil Penalties
  In  October  1994, the NRC staff advised HLP that  it  proposes  to
  fine  HLP  $100,000  for what the NRC believes  was  discrimination
  against  a  contractor  employee at STP who brought  complaints  of
  possible  safety  problems to the NRC's attention.   These  actions
  resulted  from  the  findings  of a NRC  investigation  of  alleged
  violations  of  STP security and work process procedures  in  1992.
  The  incident  cited  by  the NRC is the  subject  of  a  contested
  hearing  that is scheduled to be held in the spring of 1995  before
  a  United  States Department of Labor judge.  Until the  Department

<PAGE> 2-101
  of  Labor  issues a final decision in this matter, the NRC  is  not
  requiring HLP to respond to its notice of violation.

  Other
  CPL  is party to various other legal claims, actions and complaints
  arising  in  the  normal course of business.  Management  does  not
  expect  disposition  of these matters to have  a  material  adverse
  effect on CPL's results of operations or financial condition.

10.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
  It  is estimated that CPL will spend approximately $108 million  in
  construction  expenditures  during 1995.   Substantial  commitments
  have   been  made  in  connection  with  this  capital  expenditure
  program.

  To  supply a portion of its fuel requirements CPL has entered  into
  various commitments for the procurement of fuel.

  Nuclear Insurance
  In  connection with the licensing and operation of STP, the  owners
  have  purchased the maximum limits of nuclear liability  insurance,
  as  required  by law, and have executed indemnification  agreements
  with   the   NRC  in  accordance  with  the  financial   protection
  requirements of the Price-Anderson Act.

  The  Price-Anderson  Act,  a  comprehensive  statutory  arrangement
  providing   limitations  on  nuclear  liability  and   governmental
  indemnities,  is  in  effect until August 1, 2002.   The  limit  of
  liability  under  the Price-Anderson Act for licensees  of  nuclear
  power  plants  is  $8.92  billion per  incident,  effective  as  of
  January  1995.   The owners of STP are insured for their  share  of
  this   liability   through  a  combination  of  private   insurance
  amounting  to  $200  million and a mandatory industry-wide  program
  for  self-insurance  totaling $8.72 billion.   The  maximum  amount
  that  each licensee may be assessed under the industry-wide program
  of  self-insurance  following  a nuclear  incident  at  an  insured
  facility  is  $75.5 million per reactor, which may be adjusted  for
  inflation  plus a five percent charge for legal expenses,  but  not
  more than $10 million per reactor for each nuclear incident in  any
  one  year.   CPL  and each of the other STP owners are  subject  to
  such  assessments, which CPL and other owners have agreed  will  be
  allocated  on the basis of their respective ownership interests  in
  STP.   For  purposes  of these assessments, STP  has  two  licensed
  reactors.

  The  owners  of  STP  currently  maintain  on-site  decontamination
  liability  and  property damage insurance in the  amount  of  $2.75
  billion provided by ANI and NEIL.  Policies of insurance issued  by
  ANI  and NEIL stipulate that policy proceeds must be used first  to
  pay  decontamination and clean-up costs before being used to  cover
  direct  losses to property.  Under project agreements, CPL and  the
  other  owners  of  STP will share the total cost of decontamination
  liability  and property insurance for STP, including  premiums  and
  assessments,  on  a  pro  rata basis,  according  to  each  owner's
  respective ownership interest in STP.

  CPL  purchases, for its own account, a NEIL I Business Interruption
  and/or  Extra  Expense policy.  This insurance will  reimburse  CPL
  for  extra  expenses incurred, up to $1.65 million  per  week,  for
  replacement  generation  or purchased power  as  the  result  of  a
  covered  accident that shuts down production at STP for  more  than
  21  weeks.   The maximum amount recoverable for Unit  1  is  $111.3
  million  and  for Unit 2 is $111.8 million.  CPL is subject  to  an
  additional  assessment up to $2.1 million for  the  current  policy
  year in the event that losses as a result of a covered accident  at
  a  nuclear  facility  insured under the NEIL I policy  exceeds  the
  accumulated funds available under the policy.

  On  August  28,  1994, CPL filed a claim under the  NEIL  I  policy
  related  to  the  outage at STP Units 1 and 2.  NEIL  is  currently
  reviewing  the  claim.   CPL management is unable  to  predict  the
  ultimate outcome of this matter.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To  the  Stockholders and Board of Directors of  Central  Power  and
Light Company:

      We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of  capitalization  of  Central Power and  Light  Company  (a  Texas
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central and South  West
Corporation)   as  of December 31, 1994 and 1993,  and  the  related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for  each  of
the  three  years  in  the period ended December  31,  1994.   These
financial  statements  are the responsibility of  CPL's  management.
Our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion  on  these  financial
statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing  standards.   Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
financial  statements are free of material misstatement.   An  audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the accounting principles used and significant  estimates
made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
Central  Power and Light Company  as of December 31, 1994 and  1993,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three  years  in the period ended December 31, 1994,  in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

      In  1993,  as discussed in NOTE 1, CPL changed its methods  of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

      Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.   The  supplemental
Schedule  II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of  complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of  the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit  have
been  subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits  of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state  in
all  material respects the financial data required to be  set  forth
therein  in  relation to the basic financial statements taken  as  a
whole.

Report of Management

      Management  is responsible for the preparation,  integrity  and
objectivity  of the financial statements of Central Power  and  Light
Company as well as other information contained in this Annual Report.
The  financial  statements  have been  prepared  in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting principles applied  on  a  consistent
basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates
and judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial  information contained elsewhere in this Annual  Report  is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

      The   financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting  firm,  Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given  unrestricted
access  to all financial records and related data, including  minutes
of   all  meetings  of  shareholders,  the  board  of  directors  and
committees of the board.  CPL believes that representations  made  to
the independent auditors during its audit were valid and appropriate.
Arthur  Andersen  LLP's audit report is presented elsewhere  in  this
report.

       CPL  maintains  a  system  of  internal  controls  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  that transactions are executed  in  accordance
with  management's authorization, that the financial  statements  are
prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and   that  the  assets  of  CPL  are  properly  safeguarded  against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system  includes  a
documented  organizational structure and division of  responsibility,
established  policies and procedures including a  policy  on  ethical
standards which provides that CPL will maintain the highest legal and
ethical   standards,   and  the  careful  selection,   training   and
development of our employees.

      Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal  control  system  following  standards  established  by  the
Institute  of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management  to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who  are not officers or employees of CPL  provides oversight to  the
financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls,  no internal control system can provide absolute  assurance
that  errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a  balance,  recognizing that the cost of such a  system  should  not
exceed the benefits derived.

      CPL  believes  that, in all material respects,  its  system  of
internal  controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding  of
assets   against   unauthorized  acquisition,  use   or   disposition
functioned effectively during 1994.

       PSO  changed its method of accounting for unbilled revenues  in
1993.   Pro forma amounts, assuming that the change in accounting  for
unbilled  revenues had been adopted retroactively, are not  materially
different from amounts reported for prior years and therefore have not
been restated.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA

      Reference is made to PSO's Consolidated Financial Statements and
related  Notes and Selected Financial Data.  The information contained
therein  should  be  read in conjunction with,  and  is  essential  to
understanding, the following discussion and analysis.

Overview
      Net  income  for common stock for 1994 was $67  million,  a  47%
increase  from  1993.   The increase was due  primarily  to  increased
energy  sales  to  retail  customers and sales  for  resale  to  other
electric  utilities due to increased market place demand and the  1993
restructuring charges of $25 million.

Restructuring
      As  previously  reported, PSO has taken steps  to  implement  a
restructuring  and early retirement program designed  to  consolidate
and restructure its operations in order to meet the challenges of the
changing electric utility industry and to compete effectively in  the
years  ahead.  The underlying goal of the restructuring is to  enable
PSO  to  focus  on and be accountable for serving the customer.   The
restructuring  costs were initially estimated to be $25  million  and
were  expensed  in  1993.  The final costs of the restructuring  were
approximately  $25  million.   Approximately  $24  million   of   the
restructuring  expenditures  were  incurred  during  1994,  with  the
remaining   $1   million  expected  to  be  incurred   during   1995.
Approximately  $4  million of the restructuring  expenses  relate  to
employee termination benefits, $12 million relate to enhanced benefit
costs and $9 million relate to employees that will not be terminated.
Approximately $17 million of the restructuring costs were  paid  from
or  will  be  paid  from general corporate funds.  The  remaining  $8
million  represents the present value of enhanced benefit amounts  to
be  paid  from  the benefit plan trusts to participants  over  future
years  in accordance with the early retirement program.  The cost  of
these  enhanced  benefit amounts will be paid from general  corporate
funds   to   the  benefit  plan  trusts  over  future   years.    The
restructuring is substantially completed, with the remaining activity
to  take place during 1995.  Certain aspects of the restructuring are
pending SEC approval under the Holding Company Act.

       PSO  expects  to  realize  a  number  of  benefits  from   the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased efficiencies and synergies are expected to be realized with
the  elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This  leads  to
enhanced communication and efficiency, which should translate into  a
reduction in the rate of growth in O&M costs.  The CSW System expects
that  all  restructuring costs will be recovered by early  1996  with
reductions in the rate of growth of O&M costs continuing thereafter.

Rates and Regulatory Matters
       See   NOTE  8,  Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for
information regarding the PSO rate case.

New Accounting Standards
      SFAS  No.  115  was effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 1993.  PSO adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1994.  The adoption of
SFAS  No.  115  did  not have a material effect on PSO's  consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.

      In  June  1993  the  FASB issued SFAS No. 116.   The  statement,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, will  be
adopted  by  PSO  for  1995.   The  statement  establishes  accounting
standards  for contributions and applies to all entities that  receive
or  make  contributions.  Management does not believe the adoption  of
SFAS No. 116 will have a material impact on PSO's consolidated results
of operations or financial condition.

<PAGE> 2-108
     SFAS No. 119 was effective for fiscal years ending after December
15, 1994.  PSO does not currently uses derivative instruments, but may
use  these  instruments in the future to manage the  increased  market
risks  associated  with greater competition in  the  electric  utility
industry.   The adoption of this new statement had no material  effect
on PSO's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
     PSO's need for capital results primarily from the construction of
facilities  to  provide reliable electric service  to  its  customers.
Accordingly,  internally  generated funds should  meet  most  of   the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are  not
sufficient,  PSO's financial condition should allow it access  to  the
capital markets.

Capital Expenditures
      Construction  expenditures, including AFUDC, were  approximately
$131  million in 1994, $95 million in 1993, and $100 million in  1992.
It  is  estimated  that  construction expenditures,  including  AFUDC,
during the 1995 through 1997 period will aggregate $213 million.  Such
expenditures primarily will be made to improve and expand distribution
facilities.  These improvements are expected to meet the needs of  new
customers  and to satisfy changing requirements of existing customers.
No  new  baseload power plants are currently planned until  after  the
year 2000.

      The construction program continues to be monitored, reviewed and
adjusted to reflect changes in estimated load growth in PSO's  service
area,  variations in prices of alternative fuel sources, the  cost  of
labor, materials, equipment and capital, and other external factors.

      The  CSW  System  facilities plan presently  includes  projected
lignite-fired   generating  plants  for   which   PSO   has   invested
approximately $15 million in prior years for plant sites,  engineering
studies  and  lignite  reserves.   Should future plans  exclude  these
plants  for  environmental or other reasons, PSO  would  evaluate  the
probability   of  recovery  of  these  investments  and   may   record
appropriate reserves.

Long-Term Financing
      As  of December 31, 1994, the capitalization ratios of PSO  were
52%  common  stock equity, 2% preferred stock and 46% long-term  debt.
PSO's  embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.4% at the  end  of  1994.
PSO  continually  monitors the capital markets  for  opportunities  to
lower  its cost of capital through refinancing.  PSO continues  to  be
committed to maintaining financial flexibility by maintaining a strong
capital structure and favorable securities ratings which should  allow
funds to be obtained from the capital markets when required.

Short-Term Financing
     PSO, together with other members of CSW System, has established a
CSW  System  money  pool to coordinate short-term  borrowings.   These
loans are unsecured demand obligations at rates approximating the  CSW
System's commercial paper borrowing costs.  PSO's short-term borrowing
limit  from  the money pool is $100 million.  During 1994, the  annual
weighted  average  interest rate was 4.5% and the  average  amount  of
short-term  month-end  borrowings outstanding was  $42  million.   The
maximum  amount of short-term borrowings outstanding at any  month-end
during  1994 was $73 million, which was the amount outstanding at  May
31, 1994.

Internally Generated Funds
      Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from  operating
activities  less common and preferred stock dividends.   PSO  utilizes
short-term  debt to meet fluctuations in working capital  requirements
due  to  the  seasonal nature of energy sales.  PSO  anticipates  that
capital requirements for the period 1995 to 1997 will be met in  large
part  from internal sources.  PSO also anticipates that some  external
financing  will be required during the period, but the nature,  timing
and  extent  have  not  yet been determined.   Information  concerning
internally generated funds follows:

Sales of Accounts Receivable
      PSO  sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable,  without
recourse,   to  CSW  Credit.   The  sales  provided  PSO   with   cash
immediately,  thereby  reducing  working  capital  needs  and  revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts receivable
sold  were  $88  million and $75 million in 1994, as compared  to  $85
million and $80 million in 1993.

Recent Developments and Trends
Competition and Industry Challenges
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry  are
impacting PSO and electric utilities generally.  Increased competition
facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic, political and
technological factors.  These factors have resulted in legislative and
regulatory  initiatives  that are likely to  result  in  even  greater
competition at both the wholesale and retail level in the future.   As
competition  in the industry increases, PSO will have the  opportunity
to  seek  new  customers and at the same time be  at  risk  of  losing
customers  to  other competitors.  PSO believes that  its  prices  for
electricity  and the quality and reliability of its service  currently
place it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

      The  Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy Policy
Act  creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding Company  Act
and  permits utilities, including registered utility holding companies
and  non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are a new category  of
non-utility  wholesale power producer that are free from most  federal
and  state  regulation, including the principal  restrictions  of  the
Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable broader participation in
wholesale  power  markets  by  reducing  regulatory  hurdles  to  such
participation.  The Energy Policy Act also allows the FERC, on a case-
by-case  basis  and  with  certain restrictions,  to  order  wholesale
transmission  access and to order electric utilities to enlarge  their
transmission  systems.  A FERC order requiring a transmitting  utility
to  provide  wholesale  transmission service must  include  provisions
generally  that  permit  (i) the utility  to  recover  from  the  FERC
applicant   all  of  the  costs  incurred  in  connection   with   the
transmission  services and (ii) any enlargement  of  the  transmission
system  and  associated services.  While PSO believes that the  Energy
Policy   Act  will  continue  to  make  the  wholesale  markets   more
competitive, PSO is unable to predict the extent to which  the  Energy
Policy Act will impact on its operations.

       Increasing  competition  in  the  utility  industry  brings  an
increased  need  to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail  regulatory
environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from  traditional   rate   base
regulation  to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and  performance-
based  plans  encourage efficiencies and increased productivity  while
permitting  utilities  to share in the results.   Retail  wheeling,  a
major  industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel"  or  move
power  from  third parties to their own retail customer,  is  evolving
gradually.

      Wholesale  energy  markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment of
the  Energy Policy Act.  PSO competes in the wholesale energy  markets
with  other  public  utilities,  cogenerators,  qualified  facilities,
exempt wholesale generators and others for sales of electric power.

      Under  the  Energy  Policy Act, the FERC  has  approved  several
proposals by utility companies to sell wholesale power at market-based
rates  and provide to electric utilities "open access" to transmission
systems,  subject  to  certain requirements.  The  adoption  of  these
proposals  increases  marketing opportunities for electric  utilities,

<PAGE> 2-110
but  also exposes them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues
due to competition with alternative suppliers.

      PSO  believes that, compared to other electric utilities, it  is
well  positioned  to  meet  future  competition.   PSO  benefits  from
economies  of  scale  and  scope  by  virtue  of  its  size  and   its
relationship  to  the  CSW System.  PSO is also a relatively  low-cost
producer of electric power.  Moreover, PSO is taking steps to  enhance
its   marketing  and  customer  service,  reduce  costs,  improve  and
standardize   business   practices,   and   grow   through   strategic
acquisitions, in order to position itself for increased competition in
the future.

      PSO  is  unable  to predict the ultimate outcome  or  impact  of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on PSO.  As the
wholesale  and  retail  electricity markets become  more  competitive,
however,  the  principal factor determining success is  likely  to  be
price,  and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability of capacity,
and customer service.

Regulatory Accounting
      Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71,  which  allows  for  the recognition and  recovery  of  regulatory
assets,   PSO  has  recognized  significant  regulatory   assets   and
liabilities.  Management believes that PSO will continue to  meet  the
criteria  for  following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the  event  PSO  no
longer  meets  the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off  of
regulatory  assets and liabilities would be required.  For  additional
information  regarding  SFAS  No. 71 reference  is  made  to  NOTE  1,
Summary  of  Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory  Assets  and
Liabilities.

Environmental Matters
CERCLA and Related Matters
      The  operations of PSO, like those of other utilities, generally
involve  the  use and disposal of substances subject to  environmental
laws.   The CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses the cleanup
of  sites  contaminated by hazardous substances.   Superfund  requires
that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault or the legality of
past  disposal  activities.   PRPs include  owners  and  operators  of
contaminated  sites  and transporters and/or generators  of  hazardous
substances.   Many states have similar laws.  Theoretically,  any  one
PRP  can  be  held  responsible for the  entire  cost  of  a  cleanup.
Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.

      PSO  is subject to various pending claims alleging it is  a  PRP
under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and cleaning up
contaminated  property.  PSO  anticipates  that  resolution  of  these
claims,  individually or in the aggregate, will not  have  a  material
adverse  effect  on  PSO's  consolidated  results  of  operations   or
financial condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ
from site to site, factors that are the basis for the expectation  for
specific  sites  include  the volume and/or type  of  waste  allegedly
contributed by PSO, the estimated amount of costs allocated to PSO and
the participation of other parties.

Clean Air Act Amendments
      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the  year  2000, PSO will be required to hold allowances in order  to
emit sulfur dioxide.  The EPA issues allowances to owners of existing
generating units based on historical operating conditions.  Based  on
the CSW System facilities plan, PSO believes that its allowances will
be  adequate  to  meet its needs at least through 2008.   Public  and
private markets are developing for trading of excess allowances.  PSO
presently has no intention of engaging in trading of allowances,  but
may  seek  to  do so in the future if market conditions  warrant  and
appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.


<PAGE> 2-111
      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requires government studies to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission regulations and the air toxics study will have on PSO cannot
be determined at this time.

      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  PSO
expects  to  spend an additional $1.3 million for annual testing  of,
software  modifications  to, and maintenance of  continuous  emission
monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

EMFs
      Research  is  ongoing whether exposure to  EMFs  may  result  in
adverse  health effects.  Although a few of the studies to  date  have
suggested certain associations between EMFs and some types of effects,
the   research   to   date  has  not  established  a  cause-and-effect
relationship  between  EMFs and adverse health  effects.   PSO  cannot
predict  the impact on it or the electric utility industry if  further
investigations  or  proceedings were to  establish  that  the  present
electricity  delivery  system is contributing  to  increased  risk  or
incidence of health problems.

      See  ITEM  1.  BUSINESS  - Environmental  Matters  and  NOTE  8,
Litigation  and Regulatory Proceedings, for additional  discussion  of
environmental issues.

Results of Operations
Electric Operating Revenues
     Revenues for 1994 increased approximately $33 million or 5% when
compared  to  1993.  Revenues for 1993 increased approximately  $85.4
million or 14% when compared to 1992.  The increase in 1994 reflected
an increase of approximately 8% in KWH sales resulting from increased
sales  for  resale  to  other  electric utilities  due  to  increased
marketplace  demand, partially offset by lower  unit  fuel  costs  as
described below.  Approximately $7.9 million of the 1993 increase was
due  to  an  increase  in retail prices.  Retail kilowatt-hour  sales
increased  7% as a result of warmer weather in 1993 compared  to  the
substantially milder than normal weather in 1992.  Additionally, 1994
and 1993 were affected by increased fuel recovery as discussed below.
The  Company  recovers its monthly fuel and purchased power  expenses
currently  in its revenues and therefore the increase in these  costs
resulted in higher revenues.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
      Fuel expense for 1994 increased approximately $17.6 million  or
6%  when  compared  to  1993.  During 1993,  fuel  expense  increased
approximately $64 million or 27% when compared to 1992. Fuel  expense
for  1994 and 1993 increased primarily as a result of fewer customers
participating  in  the  FUSER  Program,  which  terminated  effective
October  1993.   See  ITEM 1. BUSINESS -- REGULATION  AND  RATES  for
additional information relating to FUSER.  In 1994, fuel expense  was
also  affected  by  a  17% increase in KWH generation  and  an  over-
recovery  of fuel costs from customers, which was previously recorded
as  deferred fuel, offset in part by a reduction in average unit fuel
costs. The average unit fuel cost for 1994 was $1.96 per million BTU,
a  decrease of approximately 18% from the same period last year.  The
decrease  in per unit fuel cost reflects the reversal of prior  years
accruals for potential liabilities related to coal transportation, as
well  as lower costs for natural gas and coal.  The increase in  fuel
expense  during  1993  was  due  primarily  to  an  increase  in  KWH
generation  and  an  increase  in unit fuel  costs.   KWH  generation
increased  10%  due  primarily to increased weather-related  customer
usage  and unscheduled 1992 power station maintenance which  did  not
recur  in  1993.  The average unit fuel cost for 1993 was  $2.38  per
million  Btu, an increase of approximately 2% from 1992 of $2.34  per
million Btu.  The increase in unit fuel costs was primarily due to an
accrual  for  potential liabilities related to  coal  transportation,
partially offset by lower costs of natural gas and coal.

      Purchased power expenses for 1994 increased approximately  $2.2
million  or  7%  as a result of additional economy energy  purchases.
Purchased  power  expenses  for  1993 decreased  approximately  $10.4
million or 24% as a result of additional purchases of firm energy  in

<PAGE> 2-112
1992 due to unscheduled power station maintenance which did not recur
in 1993.

Operating Expenses and Taxes
     Changes in operating expenses in 1994 and 1993 were affected  by
1993  restructuring  charges  of  approximately  $25  million,  which
includes  approximately  $18  million for  an  early  retirement  and
voluntary severance program.  Changes in operating expenses for  both
years  were  also  affected by the 1993 write-off of certain  lignite
properties  of approximately $5 million and accrued mine  reclamation
expenses  of approximately $3 million.  Maintenance in 1993 decreased
as a result of unscheduled power station maintenance in 1992.

     Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $4
million  or 7% in 1994 and $3 million or 5% in 1993 due to  increases
in depreciable property.

     Taxes,  other  than federal income increased approximately  $3.6
million or 13% in 1994 and decreased approximately $.5 million or  2%
in 1993 primarily as a result of changes in state income taxes.

     Federal income tax expense increased approximately $11.3 million
or  56% in 1994 and $5.2 million or 35% in 1993 primarily as a result
of   increased  pre-tax  income.   Additionally,  1993  tax   expense
increased  as  a result of an increase in the federal statutory  rate
from 34% in 1992 to 35% in 1993.

Inflation
      Annual  inflation  rates, as measured by the national  Consumer
Price Index, have averaged 2.7% during the three years ended December
31,  1994.   PSO  believes that inflation, at this  level,  does  not
materially affect its consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.   However, under existing regulatory  practice,  only  the
historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As a result,
cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may
not be adequate to replace plant in future years.

Interest Charges
      Interest charges for 1994 decreased approximately $1.3  million
or  4%  as  a result of the refinancing in 1993 of higher cost  debt.
This   decrease  is  offset  in  part  by  increases  in   short-term
borrowings.  In 1993, charges increased approximately $1.3 million or
4%  as  a  result  of  higher  principal amounts  of  long-term  debt
outstanding, offset in part by the reacquisition of higher cost debt.
In  1993,  interest  on  short-term debt and other  was  affected  by
interest  accruals associated with the settlement of  federal  income
tax  audit issues partially offset by decreased short-term borrowings
at lower rates.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
      PSO  implemented a number of accounting changes in 1993.  These
included  the  adoption of SFAS No. 112 and SFAS No. 109.   PSO  also
changed  its  method  of  accounting for  unbilled  revenues.   These
accounting  changes had a cumulative effect of increasing net  income
approximately $6 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Public Utility Regulation
  PSO  is  subject to regulation by the SEC under the Holding Company
  Act  and  the  FERC under the Federal Power Act,  and  follows  the
  Uniform  System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC.  PSO is subject
  to  further  regulation with regard to rates and other  matters  by
  the  Oklahoma  Commission.  PSO, as a member  of  the  CSW  System,
  engages   in  transactions  and  coordinates  its  activities   and
  operations with other members of the CSW System.

  The  more significant accounting policies of PSO and its subsidiary
  are summarized below:

  Principles of Consolidation
  The  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  PSO
  and  its  wholly-owned subsidiary, Ash Creek Mining  Company.   All
  significant   intercompany  items  and   transactions   have   been
  eliminated.

  Electric Utility Plant
  Electric  utility  plant  is  stated  at  the  original   cost   of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct   labor,  materials,  overhead  items  and  allowances   for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.

  Depreciation
  Provisions for depreciation of electric utility plant are  computed
  using  the  straight-line  method, generally  at  individual  rates
  applied  to  the  various  classes of  depreciable  property.   The
  annual  average  consolidated composite rates were  3.5%  in  1994,
  1993 and 1992.

  Electric Revenues and Fuel
  Prior  to January 1, 1993, electric revenues were recorded  at  the
  time  billings  were  made to customers on a  cycle-billing  basis.
  Electric  service provided subsequent to billing dates through  the
  end  of  each  calendar month became part of operating revenues  of
  the  next  month.   To conform to general industry  standards,  PSO
  changed  its method of accounting to accrue for estimated  unbilled
  revenues.   The  effect of this change on 1993 net  income  was  an
  increase  of $8.4 million included in cumulative effect of  changes
  in accounting principles.

  PSO   recovers  fuel  costs  in  Oklahoma  through  automatic  fuel
  recovery  mechanisms.   PSO  recovers  fuel  costs  applicable   to
  wholesale  customers, which are regulated by the FERC,  through  an
  automatic fuel adjustment clause.  Under rules established  by  the
  Oklahoma   Commission,  PSO  uses  a  method   of   deferred   fuel
  accounting.  The difference between fuel revenues billed  and  fuel
  expense  incurred is recorded as a reduction of or an  addition  to
  fuel expense, with a corresponding entry to accounts receivable  or
  payables  to  customers as appropriate.  Deferred  fuel  costs  are
  applied  to  the  customers' billings as  a  portion  of  the  fuel
  adjustment  clause  the second month subsequent  to  the  month  in
  which the under-recoveries or over-recoveries occurred.

  Accounts Receivable
  PSO  sells  its  billed and unbilled accounts  receivable,  without
  recourse, to CSW Credit.

  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
  For  its  regulated  activities, PSO follows  SFAS  No.  71,  which
  defines  the  criteria  for  establishing  regulatory  assets   and
  regulatory  liabilities.   Regulatory  assets  represent   probable
  future  revenue to PSO associated with certain costs which will  be
  recovered   from   customers  through   the   ratemaking   process.
  Regulatory   liabilities  represent  probable  future  refunds   to
  customers   At  December 31, 1994 and 1993, PSO  had  recorded  the
  following significant regulatory assets and liabilities:

  Statements of Cash Flows
  Cash   equivalents  are  considered  to  be  highly   liquid   debt
  instruments  purchased  with a maturity of three  months  or  less.
  Accordingly,   temporary  cash  investments  are  considered   cash
  equivalents.

  Reclassification
  Certain  financial  statement  items  for  prior  years  have  been
  reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

  Accounting Changes
  Effective January 1, 1993, PSO adopted SFAS Nos. 106, 112 and  109.
  See   NOTE   2,  Federal  Income  Taxes,  for  further  information
  regarding  SFAS  No.  109.  In addition,  PSO  also  changed  their
  method  of accounting for unbilled revenues.  See Electric Revenues
  and Fuel above for further information.

  The  adoption  of  SFAS  No. 106 resulted in  an  increase  in  the
  establishment  of a regulatory asset of approximately  $5  million.
  See  Note 8, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings-Rate Review  for
  further  information.  The adoption of SFAS No. 109, SFAS  No.  112
  and  the  change in accounting for unbilled revenues are  presented
  as  a  cumulative  effect  of changes in accounting  principles  as
  shown below:

                            Pre-Tax        Tax         Net Income
                            Effect        Effect         Effect
    SFAS No. 109            $    --      $  (268)       $  (268)
    SFAS No. 112             (3,173)       1,227         (1,946)
    Unbilled revenues        13,758       (5,321)         8,437
    Total                   $10,585      $(4,362)        $6,223

  Pro  forma  amounts,  assuming that the change  in  accounting  for
  unbilled   revenues  had  been  adopted  retroactively,   are   not
  materially  different from amounts previously  reported  for  prior
  years.

2.Federal Income Taxes
  PSO  adopted  the provisions of SFAS No. 109 effective  January  1,
  1993.   The  implementation of SFAS No. 109 had no material  effect
  on  PSO's  earnings.   As a result of this change,  PSO  recognized
  additional  accumulated  deferred income  taxes  and  corresponding
  regulatory  assets and liabilities to ratepayers in  amounts  equal
  to  future  revenues or the reduction in future  revenues  required
  when   the  income  tax  temporary  differences  reverse  and   are
  recovered  or  settled  in  rates.  As  a  result  of  a  favorable
  earnings  history,  PSO  did  not record  any  valuation  allowance
  against deferred tax assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

<PAGE> 2-121
  PSO,  together  with  other members of  the  CSW  System,  files  a
  consolidated Federal income tax return and participates  in  a  tax

  Certain  series  of  outstanding first mortgage bonds  have  annual
  sinking fund requirements, which are generally 1% of the amount  of
  each  such series issued.  These requirements may be, and generally
  have  been,  satisfied by the application of net  expenditures  for
  bondable  property  in an amount equal to 166-2/3%  of  the  annual
  requirements.   At  December  31, 1994,  the  annual  sinking  fund
  requirements and annual maturities for the next five years follow:
     
                      Sinking Fund
                      Requirements      Maturities
                             (thousands)
               1995      $800             $   800
               1996       550              25,550
               1997       550                 550
               1998       550                 550
               1999       300              25,300
  
  Dividends
  PSO's  mortgage  indenture, as amended and  supplemented,  contains
  certain restrictions on the payment of common stock dividends.   At
  December   31,  1994,  $124  million  of  retained  earnings   were
  available for payment of cash dividends to its parent, CSW.

4.Financial Instruments
  The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate  the
  fair  value of each class of financial instruments for which it  is
  practicable to estimate fair value.

<PAGE> 2-123
  Cash and temporary cash investments
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.

  Long-term debt
  The  fair value of PSO's long-term debt is estimated based  on  the
  quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  issues  or  on  the
  current  rates  offered  to PSO for debt of  the  same  or  similar
  remaining maturities.

  Advances from affiliates
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.

  The estimated fair values of PSO's financial instruments follow:

                                      1994                    1993
                              Carrying       Fair     Carrying      Fair
                               Amount        Value     Amount       Value
                                            (thousands)
  Cash and temporary cash
    investments              $  5,453      $  5,453   $  2,429   $  2,429
  Long-term debt              402,752       364,585    401,255    413,218
  Advances from affiliates     55,160        55,160     31,744     31,744

   The fair value does not affect PSO's liabilities unless the issues
are redeemed prior to their maturity dates.

5.Short Term Financing
  PSO,   together  with  other  members  of  the  CSW   System,   has
  established  a  money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings  and
  to  make  borrowings outside the money pool through CSW's  issuance
  of  commercial paper.  Money pool balances are shown as advances to
  or   from  affiliates  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.   At
  December  31,  1994,  the  CSW System  had  bank  lines  of  credit
  aggregating  $930 million to back up its commercial paper  program.
  Short-term  cash  surpluses transferred to the money  pool  receive
  interest income in accordance with the money pool arrangement.

6.Benefit Plans
  Defined Benefit Pension Plan
  PSO,  together  with other members of the CSW System,  maintains  a
  tax   qualified,  non-contributory  defined  benefit  pension  plan
  covering  substantially  all  employees.   Benefits  are  based  on
  employees' years of credited service, age at retirement, and  final
  average  annual  earnings  with  an offset  for  the  participant's
  primary  Social Security benefit.  The CSW System's funding  policy
  is  based  on  actuarially  determined contributions,  taking  into
  account  amounts which are deductible for income tax  purposes  and
  minimum  contributions required by the ERISA. Pension  plan  assets
  consist primarily of common stocks and short-term and intermediate-
  term fixed income investments.

  Contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 1994,
  1993 and 1992 were $6.3 million, $6.7 million and $5.9 million,
  respectively.
  
  The approximate maximum number of participants in the plan during
  1994, were 2,000 active employees, 1,100 retirees and
  beneficiaries and 300 terminated employees.

  The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions
  used in accounting for pensions follows:
                                           1994       1993        1992

     Discount rate                         8.25%       7.75%      8.50%
     Long-term compensation increase       5.46%       5.46%      5.96%
     Return on plan assets                 9.50%       9.50%      9.50%

  At  December  31,  1994, the plan's net assets  were  approximately
  equal  to  the  total  actuarial present value of  the  accumulated
  benefit   obligation.   At   December   31,  1993  the  plan's  net
  assets   exceeded  the  total  actuarial  present  value   of   the
  accumulated  benefit obligation.  No reconciliation of the  funding
  status  of  the  plan  is  presented because  such  information  is
  unavailable.

  Health and Welfare Plans
  PSO  had  medical,  dental,  group life insurance,  dependent  life
  insurance,  and  accidental  death  and  dismemberment  plans   for
  substantially   all  active  PSO  employees   during   1994.    The
  contributions  recorded on a pay-as-you-go  basis,  for  the  years
  ended  December 31, 1994 and 1993 were approximately  $3.6  million
  and  $5.0 million, respectively.  Effective January 1993, the PSO's
  method  of  providing health benefits was modified to include  such
  benefits  as a health maintenance organization, preferred  provider
  options,  managed prescription drug and mail-order  program  and  a
  mental health and substance abuse program in addition to the  self-
  insured indemnity plans.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
  PSO  adopted SFAS No. 106 January 1, 1993.  PSO is amortizing their
  transition  obligation  over  twenty  years,  with  eighteen  years
  remaining.  In prior years, these benefits were accounted for on  a
  pay-as-you-go basis.

  The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost follow:

                                                         1994     1993

  A  reconciliation of the funded status of the plan to  the  amounts
  recognized on the consolidated balance sheets follow:

                                                       December 31,

   Accrued/(Prepaid) Cost                          $   (576)   $   (576)

  The following assumptions were used in accounting for SFAS No.
  106:

                                                    1994            1993
       Discount rate                                8.25%           7.75%
       Return on plan assets                        9.50%           9.00%
       Tax rate for taxable trusts                 39.60%          39.60%

  Health Care Cost Trend Rate Assumptions
  Pre-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.75% grading  down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.5% in 2001.

  Post-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.25% grading down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.0% in 2001.

  Increasing  the  assumed  health  care  cost  trend  rates  by  one
  percentage  point  in  each year would  increase  the  APBO  as  of
  December 31, 1994 by $7 million and increase the aggregate  of  the
  service   and  interest  costs  components  on  net  postretirement
  benefits by $1 million.

7.Jointly Owned Electric Plant
  PSO  has a joint ownership agreement with other members of the  CSW
  System  and  non-affiliated entities.  Such agreements provide  for
  the  joint  ownership  and  operation of  the  676  MW,  coal-fired
  Oklaunion   Power   Station  and  its  related  facilities.    Each
  participant provided financing for its share of the project,  which
  was   placed   in  service  in  December  1986.   The  consolidated
  statements  of  income  reflect PSO's portion  of  operating  costs
  associated  with plant in service.  PSO's share  is  106  MW  or  a
  15.6%  interest in the generating station.  PSO's total investment,
  including  allowance  for funds used during  construction,  is  $80
  million  and accumulated depreciation at December 31, 1994 was  $24
  million.

8.Litigation and  Regulatory Proceedings
  Rate Review
  In   December  1993,  the  Oklahoma  Commission  issued  an   order
  unanimously  approving  a  joint  stipulation  between   PSO,   the
  Oklahoma  Commission Staff, and the Office of the Attorney  General
  of  the  State of Oklahoma, as recommended by the ALJ.   The  order
  allowed  PSO  an increase in retail prices of $14.4 million  on  an
  annual  basis which represents a $4.3 million increase above  those
  authorized by the March 1993 interim order.  In January  1994,  the
  Oklahoma  Commission  issued an order unanimously  approving  PSO's
  price  schedules reflecting the $14.4 million price increase.   The
  new  prices  became effective beginning with the billing  month  of
  February 1994.

<PAGE> 2-126
  The   December  1993  order  addresses,  among  other  things,  the
  following  issues.   PSO  will recover  $4.5  million  annually  in
  expenses  associated  with OPEBs, which,  for  PSO,  are  primarily
  health  care  related benefits.  Such expenses  will  be  recovered
  along  with amortization of the deferred 1993 OPEBs at  a  rate  of
  $0.5  million  per  year for 10 years.  PSO will amortize  deferred
  storm  expenses associated with both a 1987 ice storm  and  a  1992
  wind storm, amounting to $1.2 million per year for five years.   In
  addition,  the order recognizes the increase in federal income  tax
  expenses  resulting  from  the  recent  increase  in  the   federal
  corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent.  PSO  will
  continue to use the depreciation rates previously approved  by  the
  Oklahoma  Commission.   PSO agreed that it will  not  file  another
  retail price increase application until after June 30, 1995.

  Gas Transportation and Fuel Management Fees
  An  order  issued by the Oklahoma Commission in 1991 required  that
  the  level of gas transportation and fuel management fees, paid  to
  Transok  by PSO, permitted for recovery through the fuel adjustment
  clause  be  reviewed in the aforementioned price proceeding.   This
  portion  of  the  price review was bifurcated.  In March  1995,  an
  order  was issued by the Oklahoma Commission approving an agreement
  which  allows  PSO  to  recover  approximately  $28.4  million   of
  transportation  and fuel management fees in base rates  using  1991
  determinants  and  approximately  $1  million  through   the   fuel
  adjustment  clause.  The agreement also requires  the  phase-in  of
  competitive  bidding of natural gas transportation requirements  in
  excess of 165 MMcf/d.

  Gas Purchase Contracts
  PSO  has  been named defendant in complaints filed in  federal  and
  state  courts  of Oklahoma and Texas in 1984 through February  1995
  by  gas  suppliers  alleging  claims arising  out  of  certain  gas
  purchase  contracts.   Cases currently pending  seek  approximately
  $29  million  in actual damages, together with claims for  punitive
  damages  which, in compliance with pleading code requirements,  are
  alleged  to  be in excess of $10,000.  The plaintiffs  seek  relief
  through the filing dates as well as attorney fees.  As a result  of
  settlements  among the parties, certain plaintiffs dismissed  their
  claims  with prejudice to further action.  The settlements did  not
  have  a  significant  effect  on  PSO's  consolidated  results   of
  operations.   The  remaining suits are in the  preliminary  stages.
  Management   cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  these  proceedings.
  However,  management  believes  that  PSO  has  defenses  to  these
  complaints and intends to pursue them vigorously.  Management  also
  believes  that the ultimate resolution of the remaining  complaints
  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect on  PSO's  consolidated
  results of operations or financial condition.

  PCB Cases
  PSO  has  been named defendant in complaints filed in  federal  and
  state  court  in  Oklahoma  in 1984,  1985,  1986  and  1993.   The
  complaints  allege, among other things, that some of the plaintiffs
  and  the  property of other plaintiffs were contaminated with  PCBs
  and  other toxic by-products following certain incidents, including
  transformer  malfunctions  in April 1982,  December  1983  and  May
  1984.   To  date, complaints represent approximately $736  million,
  including   compensatory and punitive damages of claims  have  been
  dismissed,  certain  of which resulted from settlements  among  the
  parties.   The  settlements did not have a  significant  effect  on
  PSO's  consolidated  results of operations.   Remaining  complaints
  currently  total approximately $395 million, of which approximately
  one-third  is for punitive damages.  Discovery with regard  to  the
  remaining  complaints  continues.  Management  cannot  predict  the
  outcome  of  these proceedings.  However, management believes  that
  PSO  has  defenses to these complaints and intends to  pursue  them
  vigorously.  Moreover, management has reason to believe that  PSO's
  insurance  may cover some of the claims.  Management also  believes
  that  the ultimate resolution of the remaining complaints will  not
  have  a  material adverse effect on PSO's consolidated  results  of
  operations or financial condition.

  Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
  In  June  1992, PSO filed suit in Federal District Court in  Tulsa,
  Oklahoma,  against Burlington Northern  seeking declaratory  relief
  under  a  long-term contract for the transportation  of  coal.   In
  July  1992, Burlington Northern asserted counterclaims against  PSO
  alleging that PSO breached the contract.  The counterclaims  sought

<PAGE> 2-127
  damages  in  an unspecified amount.  In December 1993, PSO  amended
  its   suit   against  Burlington  Northern  seeking   damages   and
  declaratory  relief under federal and state anti-trust  laws.   PSO
  and  Burlington  Northern  filed motions for  summary  judgment  on
  certain  dispositive issues in the litigation.  In March 1994,  the
  court  issued an order granting PSO's motions for summary  judgment
  and  denying  Burlington Northern's motion.  It was  not  necessary
  for  the  court  to decide the federal and state anti-trust  claims
  raised  by  PSO.   Judgment was rendered in favor  of  PSO  by  the
  United   States  District  Court  in  May  1994.   In  June   1994,
  Burlington  Northern appealed this judgment to  the  United  States
  Court  of  Appeals  for  the Tenth Circuit.   This  appeal  is  now
  pending.

  Burlington Northern Arbitration
  In  May  1994, in a related arbitration, an arbitration panel  made
  an  award  favorable  to PSO concerning basic transportation  rates
  under  the  coal  transportation  contract  described  above,   and
  concerning  the  contract  mechanism  for  adjustment   of   future
  transportation  rates.  These arbitrated issues were  not  involved
  in  the related lawsuit described above.  Burlington Northern filed
  an  action to vacate the arbitrated award in the District Court for
  Dallas  County,  Texas.   PSO removed this  action  to  the  United
  States  District  Court  for the Northern District  of  Texas,  and
  filed   a  motion  to  either  dismiss  this  action  or  have   it
  transferred  to the United States District Court for  the  Northern
  District  of  Oklahoma.  Burlington Northern moved  to  remand  the
  action  to  state  court.   In September 1994,  the  United  States
  District   Court  for  the  Northern  District  of   Texas   denied
  Burlington  Northern's motion to remand, and granted  PSO's  motion
  to  transfer the action to the United States District Court for the
  Northern District of Oklahoma.  Separately, PSO filed an action  to
  confirm  the arbitration award in the United States District  Court
  for  the  Northern  District of Oklahoma, and  Burlington  Northern
  filed  a  motion to dismiss this confirmation action.  On  December
  6,  1994,  the  District Court entered an order denying  Burlington
  Northern's  motion  to vacate the arbitration award,  and  granting
  PSO's  motion  to confirm the arbitration award.  On  December  29,
  1994,   the   District  Court  entered  judgment   confirming   the
  arbitration  award, including a money judgment in PSO's  favor  for
  $16.4  million, with interest at 7.2% per annum compounded annually
  from  December 21, 1994 until paid.  On January 6, 1995, Burlington
  Northern   appealed  the District Court's judgment  to  the  United
  States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  This appeal is  now
  pending.

  Coal Mine Reclamation
  In  August  1994, PSO received approval from the Wyoming Department
  of  Environmental Quality to begin reclamation of a  coal  mine  in
  Sheridan,  Wyoming  owned by Ash Creek Mining  Company,  a  wholly-
  owned  subsidiary of PSO.  Ash Creek Mining Company recorded  a  $3
  million  liability  in  1993 for the estimated  reclamation  costs.
  Actual  reclamation work is expected to commence in mid-1995,  with
  completion  estimated in late 1996.  Surveillance  monitoring  will
  continue   for  ten  years  after  final  reclamation.   Management
  believes  the ultimate resolution of this matter will  not  have  a
  material   adverse   effect  on  PSO's  consolidated   results   of
  operations or financial condition.

  Other
  PSO  is party to various other legal claims, actions and complaints
  arising  in  the  normal course of business.  Management  does  not
  expect  disposition  of these matters to have  a  material  adverse
  effect  on  PSO's consolidated results of operations  or  financial
  condition.

9.   Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
  It  is  estimated that PSO will spend approximately $71 million  in
  capital  expenditures  during 1995.  Substantial  commitments  have
  been made in connection with the 1995 construction program

  To  supply the fuel requirements of its generating plants, PSO  has
  entered into various commitments for the procurement of fuel.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Public Service Company
of Oklahoma:

      We  have audited the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets
and  consolidated  statements of capitalization  of  Public  Service
Company  of  Oklahoma (an Oklahoma corporation  and  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  Central and South West Corporation)  and  subsidiary
company,  as  of  December  31,  1994  and  1993,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows,
for  each of the three years in the period ended December 31,  1994.
These   financial  statements  are  the  responsibility   of   PSO's
management.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion  on  these
financial statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing  standards.   Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
financial  statements are free of material misstatement.   An  audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the accounting principles used and significant  estimates
made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
Public  Service  Company of Oklahoma and subsidiary  company  as  of
December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations  and
their  cash  flows for each of the three years in the  period  ended
December  31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

      In  1993,  as discussed in NOTE 1, PSO changed its methods  of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

      Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.   The  supplemental
Schedule  II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of  complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of  the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit  have
been  subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits  of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state  in
all  material respects the financial data required to be  set  forth
therein  in  relation to the basic financial statements taken  as  a
whole.

Report of Management

      Management  is responsible for the preparation,  integrity  and
objectivity  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Public
Service  Company of Oklahoma and its subsidiary company  as  well  as
other  information contained in this Annual Report.  The consolidated
financial  statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis and,  in
some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates and judgments
of  management,  giving due consideration to materiality.   Financial
information  contained elsewhere in this Annual Report is  consistent
with that in the consolidated financial statements.

      The consolidated financial statements have been audited by  the
independent  accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP,  which  was  given
unrestricted  access  to  all financial  records  and  related  data,
including  minutes  of  all meetings of shareholders,  the  board  of
directors  and  committees  of the board.   PSO  and  its  subsidiary
believe that representations made to the independent auditors  during
their  audit were valid and appropriate.  Arthur Andersen LLP's audit
report is presented elsewhere in this report.

     PSO, together with its subsidiary company, maintains a system of
internal  controls to provide reasonable assurance that  transactions
are  executed in accordance with management's authorization, that the
consolidated  financial statements are prepared  in  accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles and that the assets  of  the
companies  are properly safeguarded against unauthorized acquisition,
use  or  disposition. The system includes a documented organizational
structure  and division of responsibility, established  policies  and
procedures  including  a policy on ethical standards  which  provides
that  PSO will maintain the highest legal and ethical standards,  and
the careful selection, training and development of our employees.

      Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal  control  system  following  standards  established  by  the
Institute  of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management  to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who  are not officers or employees of PSO or its subsidiary, provides
oversight to the financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls,  no internal control system can provide absolute  assurance
that  errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a  balance,  recognizing that the cost of such a  system  should  not
exceed the benefits derived.

      PSO  and its subsidiary believe that, in all material respects,
its  system  of internal controls over financial reporting  and  over
safeguarding  of  assets  against unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or
disposition functioned effectively during 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SOUTHWESTERN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY

      Reference is made to SWEPCO's Financial Statements and  related
Notes and Selected Financial Data.  The information contained therein
should   be   read   in  conjunction  with,  and  is   essential   in
understanding, the following discussion and analysis.

Overview
      Net  income  for  common stock increased  30%  during  1994  to
approximately  $102.4  million from approximately  $78.5  million  in
1993,  due  primarily to the effects of restructuring costs  recorded
during 1993.

Restructuring
      As  previously reported, SWEPCO has taken steps to implement  a
restructuring  and early retirement program designed  to  consolidate
and restructure its operations in order to meet the challenges of the
changing electric utility industry and to compete effectively in  the
years  ahead.  The underlying goal of the restructuring is to  enable
SWEPCO to focus on and be accountable for serving the customer.   The
restructuring  costs were initially estimated to be $25  million  and
were  expensed  in  1993.  The final costs of the restructuring  were
approximately  $20  million.   Approximately  $19  million   of   the
restructuring  expenditures  were  incurred  during  1994,  with  the
remaining   $1   million  expected  to  be  incurred   during   1995.
Approximately  $1  million of the restructuring  expenses  relate  to
employee termination benefits, $12 million relate to enhanced benefit
costs and $7 million relate to employees that will not be terminated.
Approximately $13 million of the restructuring costs were  paid  from
or  will  be  paid  from general corporate funds.  The  remaining  $7
million  represents the present value of enhanced benefit amounts  to
be  paid  from  the benefit plan trusts to participants  over  future
years  in accordance with the early retirement program.  The cost  of
these  enhanced  benefit amounts will be paid from general  corporate
funds   to   the  benefit  plan  trusts  over  future   years.    The
restructuring is substantially completed, with the remaining activity
to  take place during 1995.  Certain aspects of the restructuring are
pending SEC approval under the Holding Company Act.

      SWEPCO  expects  to  realize  a number  of  benefits  from  the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased efficiencies and synergies are expected to be realized with
the  elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This  leads  to
enhanced communication and efficiency, which should translate into  a
reduction in the rate of growth in O&M costs.  The CSW System expects
that  all  restructuring costs will be recovered by early  1996  with
reductions in the rate of growth of O&M costs continuing thereafter.

Rates and Regulatory Matters
       See   NOTE  9,  Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for
information regarding the SWEPCO fuel reconciliation proceeding.

New Accounting Standards
      SFAS  No.  115  was effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 1993.  SWEPCO adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1994.  The adoption
of  SFAS No. 115 did not have a material effect on SWEPCO's results of
operations or financial condition.

      In  June  1993  the  FASB issued SFAS No. 116.   The  statement,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, will  be
adopted  by  SWEPCO  for  1995.  The statement establishes  accounting
standards  for contributions and applies to all entities that  receive
or  make  contributions.  Management does not believe the adoption  of
SFAS  No.  116  will  have a material impact on  SWEPCO's  results  of
operations or financial condition.


<PAGE> 2-134
     SFAS No. 119 was effective for fiscal years ending after December
15,   1994.   SWEPCO  does  not  currently  use  derivative  financial
instruments, but may use these instruments in the future to manage the
increased  market  risks associated with greater  competition  in  the
electric utility industry.  The adoption of this new statement had  no
material  effect  on  SWEPCO's  results  of  operations  or  financial
condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
     SWEPCO's need for capital results primarily from its construction
of  facilities to provide reliable electric service to its  customers.
Accordingly,  internally  generated funds  should  meet  most  of  the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are  not
sufficient, SWEPCO's financial condition should allow it access to the
capital markets.

Capital Expenditures
       Construction  expenditures, including AFUDC, were approximately
$153  million in 1994, $176 million in 1993 and $97 million  in  1992.
Included  in  the expenditures for 1993 was approximately $35  million
for  the  acquisition  of  BREMCO, a rural electric  cooperative  with
service territory adjacent to SWEPCO's service territory in Louisiana.
Construction expenditures during the period 1995-1997 are estimated at
$286  million.  These expenditures will consist primarily of expansion
and  improvements to distribution facilities.  No new  baseload  power
plants are currently planned until after the year 2000.

      The construction program continues to be monitored, reviewed and
adjusted  to  reflect  changes in estimated load  growth  in  SWEPCO's
service  area, variations in prices of alternative fuel  sources,  the
cost  of  labor, materials, equipment and capital, and other  external
factors.

     The CSW System facilities plan presently includes projected coal-
and  lignite-fired  generating plants for which  SWEPCO  has  invested
approximately $34 million in prior years for plant sites,  engineering
studies  and  lignite  reserves.  Should future  plans  exclude  these
plants  for environmental or other reasons, SWEPCO would evaluate  the
probability  of  recovery  of  these  investments  and   may    record
appropriate reserves.

Long-Term Financing
     As of December 31, 1994, the capitalization ratios of SWEPCO were
51%  common  stock equity, 4% preferred stock and 45% long-term  debt.
SWEPCO's embedded cost of long-term debt was 7.6% at the end of  1994.
SWEPCO  continually monitors the capital markets for opportunities  to
lower its cost of capital through refinancing.  SWEPCO continues to be
committed to maintaining financial flexibility by maintaining a strong
capital  structure and favorable securities rating which should  allow
funds to be obtained from the capital markets when required.

      SWEPCO's  long-term financing activity for  1994  is  summarized
below:

      In  June  1994, SWEPCO renegotiated a $50 million term loan  due
June  1997,  changing  certain terms, including an  extension  of  the
maturity to June 2000.

      In  several  transactions  during  1994,  SWEPCO  redeemed  $5.8
million, which represented all remaining bonds outstanding of  its  9-
1/8%  First Mortgage Bonds, Series U, due November 1, 2019.  The funds
required   for  these  transactions  were  provided  from   short-term
borrowings and internal sources.  Redemption premiums are included  in
long-term debt on the balance sheets and are being amortized over 5 to
30 years, in accordance with anticipated regulatory treatment.

Short-Term Financing
       SWEPCO,  together  with  other  members  of  CSW  System,   has
established   a  CSW  System  money  pool  to  coordinate   short-term
borrowings.   These  loans are unsecured demand obligations  at  rates
approximating  the  CSW  System's commercial  paper  borrowing  costs.

<PAGE> 2-135
SWEPCO's  short-term  borrowing limit from  the  money  pool  is  $150
million.   During 1994, the annual weighted average interest rate  was
4.5%  and  the average amount of short-term borrowings outstanding  at
month-end   was  $25  million.   The  maximum  amount  of   short-term
borrowings  outstanding at any month-end during 1994 was $82  million,
which was the amount outstanding at December 31,  1994.

Internally Generated Funds
      Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from  operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  SWEPCO utilizes
short-term  debt to meet fluctuations in working capital  requirements
due  to the seasonal nature of energy sales.   SWEPCO anticipates that
capital requirements for the period 1995 to 1997 will be met, in large
part,  from  internal  sources.  SWEPCO  also  anticipates  that  some
external  financing  will be required during the period,  however  the
nature,  timing and extent have not yet been determined.   Information
concerning internally generated funds follows:

                                                    1994    1993   1992
                                                         (millions)
             Internally Generated Funds             $105    $149    $75
                                                          
             Construction  Expenditures Provided
             by Internally Generated Funds            71%     85%    78%

Sales of Accounts Receivable
     SWEPCO sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable, without
recourse,  to  CSW  Credit.   The  sales  provide  SWEPCO  with   cash
immediately,  thereby  reducing  working  capital  needs  and  revenue
requirements.  The average and year end amounts of accounts receivable
sold  were  $69  million and $62 million in 1994, as compared  to  $64
million and $57 million in 1993.

Recent Developments and Trends
Competition and Industry Challenges
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry  are
impacting   SWEPCO   and  electric  utilities  generally.    Increased
competition  facing electric utilities is driven by complex  economic,
political  and technological factors.  These factors have resulted  in
legislative  and regulatory initiatives that are likely to  result  in
even greater competition at both the wholesale and retail level in the
future.   As competition in the industry increases, SWEPCO  will  have
the  opportunity to seek new customers and at the same time be at risk
of  losing customers to other competitors.  SWEPCO believes  that  its
prices  for electricity and the quality and reliability of its service
currently  place  it  in  a  position to compete  effectively  in  the
marketplace.

      The  Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy Policy
Act  creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding Company  Act
and  permits utilities, including registered utility holding companies
and  non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are a new category  of
non-utility  wholesale power producer that are free from most  federal
and  state  regulation, including the principal  restrictions  of  the
Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable broader participation in
wholesale  power  markets  by  reducing  regulatory  hurdles  to  such
participation.  The Energy Policy Act also allows the FERC, on a case-
by-case  basis  and  with  certain restrictions,  to  order  wholesale
transmission  access and to order electric utilities to enlarge  their
transmission  systems.  A FERC order requiring a transmitting  utility
to  provide  wholesale  transmission service must  include  provisions
generally  that  permit  (i) the utility  to  recover  from  the  FERC
applicant   all  of  the  costs  incurred  in  connection   with   the
transmission  services and (ii) any enlargement  of  the  transmission
system and associated services.  While SWEPCO believes that the Energy
Policy   Act  will  continue  to  make  the  wholesale  markets   more
competitive,  SWEPCO  is unable to predict the  extent  to  which  the
Energy Policy Act will impact its operations.


<PAGE> 2-136
       Increasing  competition  in  the  utility  industry  brings  an
increased  need  to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail  regulatory
environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from  traditional   rate   base
regulation  to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and  performance-
based  plans  encourage efficiencies and increased productivity  while
permitting  utilities  to share in the results.   Retail  wheeling,  a
major  industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel"  or  move
power  from  third parties to their own retail customer,  is  evolving
gradually.

      Wholesale  energy  markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment of
the  Energy  Policy  Act.   SWEPCO competes in  the  wholesale  energy
markets   with   other   public  utilities,  cogenerators,   qualified
facilities,  exempt  wholesale generators  and  others  for  sales  of
electric power.

      Under  the  Energy  Policy Act, the FERC  has  approved  several
proposals by utility companies to sell wholesale power at market-based
rates  and provide to electric utilities "open access" to transmission
systems,  subject  to  certain requirements.  The  adoption  of  these
proposals  increases  marketing opportunities for electric  utilities,
but  also exposes them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues
due to competition with alternative suppliers.

     SWEPCO believes that, compared to other electric utilities, it is
well  positioned  to  meet future competition.  SWEPCO  benefits  from
economies  of  scale  and  scope  by  virtue  of  its  size  and   its
relationship to the CSW System.  SWEPCO is also a relatively  low-cost
producer  of  electric power.  Moreover, SWEPCO  is  taking  steps  to
enhance its marketing and customer service, reduce costs, improve  and
standardize   business   practices,   and   grow   through   strategic
acquisitions, in order to position itself for increased competition in
the future.

      SWEPCO  is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or  impact  of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on SWEPCO.   As
the  wholesale and retail electricity markets become more competitive,
however,  the  principal factor determining success is  likely  to  be
price,  and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability of capacity,
and customer service.

Public Utility Regulatory Act
      PURA is the legal foundation for electric utility regulation  in
Texas.  PURA will expire on September 1, 1995, in accordance with  the
sunset  policy of the Texas Legislature, which applies  to  all  state
agencies,  unless the Texas Legislature reenacts PURA in  its  current
form  or in modified form.  Several proposals have been made to  amend
PURA which, among other things, provide for a market-driven integrated
resource  planning  process, pricing flexibility for  utilities  faced
with competitive challenges, incentive regulation and deregulation  of
the wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT.  SWEPCO is unable to predict
the  ultimate outcome of the 1995 session of the Texas Legislature and
in particular whether amendments to PURA will be adopted.

Regulatory Accounting
      Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71,  which  allows  for  the recognition and  recovery  of  regulatory
assets,  SWEPCO  has  recognized regulatory  assets  and  liabilities.
Management believes that SWEPCO will continue to meet the criteria for
following  SFAS  No. 71.  However, in the event the SWEPCO  no  longer
meets  the  criteria  for  following  SFAS  No.  71,  a  write-off  of
regulatory  assets and liabilities would be required.  For  additional
information  regarding  SFAS  No. 71 reference  is  made  to  NOTE  1,
Summary  of  Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory  Assets  and
Liabilities.

Consolidated Taxes
      The  Texas  Commission before 1992 allowed income  taxes  to  be
recovered  in  rates based on the federal income  tax  incurred  by  a
utility  as  if  it  were  a  stand-alone company.   This  stand-alone
approach  treated the regulated activities of a utility as a  separate
entity  and  considered  only those revenues  and  expenses  that  are
included  in  the utility's cost of service to calculate  the  federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.


<PAGE> 2-137
      Beginning  in 1992, the Texas Commission changed its  method  of
calculating  the federal income tax component of rates to the  "actual
tax  approach."   The actual tax approach is an evolving  concept  but
generally  seeks to reflect in rates the actual tax liability  of  the
utility  irrespective  of its relationship to the  utility's  cost  of
service.  The approach reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions
which  are  not  considered for or included in setting rates  for  the
utility.

      SWEPCO  believes that the recovery of federal  income  taxes  in
rates  should be determined on the stand-alone approach for ratemaking
purposes, but there is no assurance this approach will be adopted.

Environmental Matters
CERCLA and Related Matters
      The  operations  of  SWEPCO,  like  those  of  other  utilities,
generally  involve  the  use and disposal  of  substances  subject  to
environmental   laws.   The  CERCLA,  the  federal  "Superfund"   law,
addresses  the cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous  substances.
Superfund requires that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault
or  the legality of past disposal activities.  PRPs include owners and
operators of contaminated sites and transporters and/or generators  of
hazardous  substances.  Many states have similar laws.  Theoretically,
any  one PRP can be held responsible for the entire cost of a cleanup.
Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.

     SWEPCO is subject to various pending claims alleging that it is a
PRP  under  federal  or  state  remedial laws  for  investigating  and
cleaning  up contaminated property. SWEPCO anticipates that resolution
of  these  claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not  have  a
material adverse effect on SWEPCO's results of operations or financial
condition.  Although the reasons for this expectation differ from site
to  site,  factors that are the basis for the expectation for specific
sites include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly contributed by
SWEPCO,  the  estimated amount of costs allocated to  SWEPCO  and  the
participation of other parties.

MGPs
      Contaminated former MGPs are a type of site which utilities, and
others,  may have to remediate in the future under Superfund or  other
federal or state remedial programs.  Gas was manufactured at MGPs from
the  mid-1800s to the mid-1900s.  In some cases, utilities and  others
have faced potential liability for MGPs because they, or their alleged
predecessors, owned or operated the plants.  In other cases, utilities
or  others may have been subjected to such liability for MGPs  because
they acquired MGP sites after gas production ceased.

Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas
      SWEPCO  owns  a  suspected former MGP site in  Marshall,  Texas.
SWEPCO has notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination has  been
found  at the site.  As a result of sampling conducted at the  end  of
1993 and early 1994, SWEPCO is evaluating the extent, if any, to which
contamination  has impacted soil, groundwater and other conditions  in
the  area.   A  final  range  of  clean-up  costs  has  not  yet  been
determined,  but, based on a preliminary estimate, SWEPCO has  accrued
approximately  $2  million as a liability for this  site  on  SWEPCO's
books  as of December 31, 1993.  As more information is obtained about
the   site,  and  SWEPCO  discusses  the  site  with  the  TNRCC,  the
preliminary estimate may change.

Suspected  MGP  Site in Texarkana, Texas and Arkansas and  Shreveport,
Louisiana
      SWEPCO also owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana, Texas
and  Arkansas.  The EPA ordered an initial investigation of this site,
as  well as one in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no longer owned  by
SWEPCO.  The contractor who performed the investigations of these  two
sites  recommended to the EPA that no further action be taken at  this
time.

Suspected Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
     SWEPCO has been notified by Mississippi Power Company that it may
be  a PRP at the former Biloxi MGP site formerly owned and operated by
a  predecessor  of  SWEPCO.  SWEPCO is working with Mississippi  Power

<PAGE> 2-138
Company to investigate the extent of contamination at this site.   The
MDEQ  approved  a site investigation work plan and, in  January  1995,
SWEPCO  and  Mississippi Power Company initiated sampling pursuant  to
that  work  plan.   On an interim basis, SWEPCO and Mississippi  Power
Company are each paying fifty percent of the cost of implementing  the
site investigation work plan.  That interim allocation is subject to a
final  allocation in the future.  SWEPCO and Mississippi Power Company
are  investigating whether there are other PRPs at  the  Biloxi  site.
Until  the  extent  of  the  contamination  at  the  Biloxi  site   is
identified,  it  is unknown what, if any, additional investigation  or
cleanup may be required.

        Management  does not expect these matters to have  a  material
effect on SWEPCO's results of operations or financial position.

Clean Air Act Amendments
      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the year 2000, SWEPCO will be required to hold allowances in order to
emit  sulfur  dioxide.  EPA issues allowances to owners  of  existing
generating units based on historical operating conditions.  Based  on
the  CSW  System facilities plan, SWEPCO believes that its allowances
will be adequate to meet its needs at least through 2008.  Public and
private  markets  are  developing for trading of  excess  allowances.
SWEPCO  presently  has  no  intention  of  engaging  in  trading   of
allowances, but may seek to do so in the future if market  conditions
warrant and appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.

      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requires government studies to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission  regulations and the air toxics study will  have  on  SWEPCO
cannot be determined at this time.

     As a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act, SWEPCO
expects  to  spend an additional $1.3 million for annual testing  of,
software  modifications  to, and maintenance of  continuous  emission
monitoring equipment from 1995 through 1997.

EMFs
      Research  is  ongoing whether exposure to  EMFs  may  result  in
adverse  health effects.  Although a few of the studies to  date  have
suggested certain associations between EMFs and some types of effects,
the   research   to   date  has  not  established  a  cause-and-effect
relationship  between EMFs and adverse health effects.  SWEPCO  cannot
predict  the  impact  on SWEPCO or the electric  utility  industry  if
further  investigations  or proceedings were  to  establish  that  the
present electricity delivery system is contributing to increased  risk
or incidence of health problems.

      See  ITEM  1.  BUSINESS - ENVIRONMENTAL  MATTERS  and  NOTE  10,
Commitments  and Contingent Liabilities, for additional discussion  of
environmental issues.

Results of Operations
Electric Operating Revenues
      Total electric operating revenues decreased $11.9 million or 1%
during 1994 due primarily to decreased fuel revenues partially offset
by a 3% increase in retail KWH sales due to customer growth and a 15%
increase  in  sales  for resale. Sales for resale  to  non-affiliated
electric   utilities   and  rural  electric  cooperatives   increased
approximately $9.4 million during the year.  Total revenues increased
approximately  $59 million in 1993 when compared to the  prior  year.
The  increase  was  due  primarily to a  6%  increase  in  KWH  sales

<PAGE> 2-139
resulting  from  favorable weather and customer  growth  due  to  the
acquisition of BREMCO in 1993 as well as increased sales for resale.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
      Fuel expense decreased approximately $27.2 million or 7% during
1994 and increased approximately $28 million or 8% during 1993.   The
decrease  in 1994 is due primarily to a decrease in unit  fuel  costs
from $1.94 in 1993 to $1.75 in 1994.  The decrease in unit fuel costs
is  primarily due to coal contract settlements and a decrease in  the
cost of spot market gas.  This decrease was partially offset by a  4%
increase in generation.  The increase in 1993 is attributable  to  an
8%  increase  in generation and an increase in unit fuel  costs  from
$1.93 in 1992 to $1.94 in 1993.

      Purchased  power costs increased approximately $7.1 million  in
1994  and  $6.5 million in 1993.  The 1994 increase was due primarily
to  a  purchased  power contract negotiated as a  part  of  the  1993
purchase of BREMCO. The increase in 1993 was largely due to scheduled
and  unscheduled  maintenance at the Company's generating  facilities
and the above-mentioned  purchased power contract.

Operating Expenses and Taxes
      Other  operating expenses increased approximately $18.1 million
in  1993  due primarily to expensing of reserves for certain  lignite
properties,  outside and legal services, and an increase in  employee
benefit expenses in 1993 resulting form the adoption of SFAS No. 106.

      Restructuring charges reflect the initial estimated cost of the
restructuring  of   $25.2 million.  As the restructuring  progressed,
this amount was adjusted during 1994 to approximately $20 million.

     Maintenance expense decreased approximately $7.4 million in 1994
and increased approximately $8 million in 1993 when compared to 1992.
The  changes during both periods are due to increased maintenance  of
distribution facilities and general plant in 1993.

      Taxes, other than federal income, increased approximately  $4.4
million or 10% in 1993 due primarily to a Texas franchise tax  refund
recognized in 1992.

     Federal income tax expense increased approximately $13.1 million
or 48% in 1994 primarily as a result of increased pre-tax income.  In
1993,  federal income taxes decreased approximately $5.8  million  or
18%  as  a  result  of lower pre-tax income partially  offset  by  an
increase in the federal income tax rate from 34% to 35%.

Inflation
      Annual  inflation  rates, as measured by the national  Consumer
Price  Index,  have  averaged approximately 2.7% for  the  three-year
period ending December 31, 1994.  Inflation at these levels does  not
materially  affect  SWEPCO's  results  of  operations  or   financial
condition.   Under  existing regulatory practice, however,  only  the
historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers.  As a result,
cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical plant costs may
not be adequate to replace plant in future years.

Allowance for Equity and Debt Funds Used During Construction
      AFUDC  is  a function of the amounts of construction  on  which
AFUDC  is  calculated and the rate used.  The increases in  1994  and
1993 were due primarily to increased construction work in process.

Interest on Long-Term Debt
       Interest   expense  on  long-term  debt  increased   in   1994
approximately  $2.4 million or 6% due primarily  to  an  increase  in
average balances outstanding. The 1993 decrease of approximately $6.5
million  is attributable to the refinancing of higher cost debt  with
lower cost debt.


<PAGE> 2-140
Interest on Short-Term Debt and Other
       Interest  expense  on  short-term  debt  and  other  increased
approximately  $2.7  million  in  1994  when  compared  to  1993  due
primarily  to  an  interest  accrual  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  a
settlement  agreement approved by the Texas Commission in  connection
with  SWEPCO's  fuel  reconciliation and increased  interest  expense
associated with short-term debt.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
      Accounting  changes in 1993 include the adoption of  SFAS  112.
SWEPCO  also changed its method of accounting for unbilled  revenues.
These  accounting changes had a cumulative effect of  increasing  net
income by $3.4 million.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Public Utility Regulation
  SWEPCO  is  subject  to  regulation by the SEC  under  the  Holding
  Company  Act and the FERC under the Federal Power Act, and  follows
  the  Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC.  SWEPCO  is
  subject  to  further  regulation with regard  to  rates  and  other
  matters  by  state  regulatory commissions including  the  Arkansas
  Commission,   Louisiana  Commission  and  the   Texas   Commission.
  SWEPCO, as a member of the CSW System, engages in transactions  and
  coordinates  its  activities and operations with other  members  of
  the CSW System.

  The  more  significant accounting policies of SWEPCO are summarized
  below:

  Electric Utility Plant
  Electric  utility  plant  is  stated  at  the  original   cost   of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct   labor,  materials,  overhead  items  and  allowances   for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.

  Depreciation
  Provisions for depreciation of electric utility plant are  computed
  using  the  straight-line  method, generally  at  individual  rates
  applied  to  the  various  classes of  depreciable  property.   The
  annual  average  consolidated composite rates were  3.2%  in  1994,
  1993 and 1992.

  Electric Revenues and Fuel
  Prior  to January 1, 1993, electric revenues were recorded  at  the
  time  billings  were  made to customers on a  cycle-billing  basis.
  Electric  service provided subsequent to billing dates through  the
  end  of  each  calendar month became part of operating revenues  of
  the  next month.  To conform to general industry standards,  SWEPCO
  changed  its method of accounting to accrue for estimated  unbilled
  revenues.   The  effect  of  this change  on  1993  income  was  an
  increase  of $5.4 million included in cumulative effect of  changes
  in accounting principles.

  SWEPCO  recovers fuel costs in Texas as a fixed component  of  base
  rates whereby over-recoveries of fuel are payable to customers  and
  under-recoveries may be billed to customers after Texas  Commission
  approval.  The cost of fuel is charged to expense as consumed.

  SWEPCO  recovers  fuel  costs  in Arkansas  and  Louisiana  through
  automatic  fuel  recovery  mechanisms.  The  application  of  these
  mechanisms varies by jurisdiction.

  SWEPCO recovers fuel costs applicable to wholesale customers,
  which are regulated by the FERC, through an automatic fuel
  adjustment clause.

  Accounts Receivable
  SWEPCO sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable, without
  recourse, to CSW Credit.

  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
  For  its  regulated activities, SWEPCO follows SFAS No.  71,  which
  defines  the  criteria  for  establishing  regulatory  assets   and
  regulatory  liabilities.   Regulatory  assets  represent   probable
  future  revenue to the company associated with certain costs  which
  will  be  recovered from customers through the ratemaking  process.
  Regulatory   liabilities  represent  probable  future  refunds   to
  customers.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, SWEPCO had recorded  the
  following significant regulatory assets and liabilities:

     regulatory liabilities, net       $44,836       $52,828

  Statements of Cash Flows
  Cash   equivalents  are  considered  to  be  highly   liquid   debt
  instruments  purchased  with a maturity of three  months  or  less.
  Accordingly,   temporary  cash  investments  are  considered   cash
  equivalents.

  Reclassification
  Certain  financial  statement  items  for  prior  years  have  been
  reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

  Accounting Changes
  Effective  January 1, 1993, SWEPCO adopted SFAS Nos. 106,  112  and
  109.   See  NOTE  2, Federal Income Taxes, for further  information
  regarding  SFAS  No.  109.  In addition, SWEPCO  also  changed  its
  method  of accounting for unbilled revenues.  See Electric Revenues
  and Fuel above for further information.

  The  adoption  of  SFAS No. 106 resulted in  an  increase  in  1993
  operating  expenses of $3 million.   The adoption of SFAS  No.  112
  and  the  change in accounting for unbilled revenues are  presented
  as  a  cumulative  effect  of changes in accounting  principles  as
  shown below:

                          Pre-Tax       Tax        Net Income
                          Effect       Effect        Effect
                                      
    SFAS No. 112         $(3,047)     $ 1,066       $(1,981)
    Unbilled revenues      8,286       (2,900)        5,386
    Total                $ 5,239      $(1,834)      $ 3,405

  Pro  forma  amounts,  assuming that the change  in  accounting  for
  unbilled   revenues  had  been  adopted  retroactively,   are   not
  materially  different from amounts previously  reported  for  prior
  years.

2.Federal Income Taxes
  SWEPCO adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 109 effective January  1,
  1993. The implementation of SFAS No. 109 had no material effect  on
  SWEPCO's  earnings.  As a result of this change, SWEPCO  recognized
  additional  accumulated  deferred income taxes  and   corresponding
  regulatory  assets and liabilities to ratepayers in  amounts  equal
  to  future  revenues or the reduction in future  revenues  required
  when   the  income  tax  temporary  differences  reverse  and   are
  recovered  or  settled  in  rates.  As  a  result  of  a  favorable
  earnings  history,  SWEPCO did not record any  valuation  allowance
  against deferred tax assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

  SWEPCO,  together  with other members of the CSW  System,  files  a
  consolidated federal income tax return and participates  in  a  tax
  sharing agreement.

3.Long-Term Debt
  The  mortgage  indenture,  as  amended and  supplemented,  securing
  first  mortgage bonds issued by SWEPCO, constitutes a direct  first
  mortgage lien on substantially all electric utility plant.   SWEPCO
  may  offer  additional  first  mortgage  bonds  subject  to  market
  conditions and other factors.

  Annual Requirements
  Certain  series  of  outstanding first mortgage bonds  have  annual
  sinking fund requirements, which are generally 1% of the amount  of
  each  such series issued.  These requirements may be, and generally
  have  been,  satisfied by the application of net  expenditures  for
  bondable  property  in an amount equal to 166-2/3%  of  the  annual
  requirements.   At  December  31, 1994,  the  annual  sinking  fund
  requirements and annual maturities for the next five years follow:

                             Sinking Fund
                             Requirements    Maturities
                                     (thousands)
                      1995     $  145          $ 4,100
                      1996        145            3,900
                      1997        145            2,600
                      1998        145            2,400
                      1999        595           44,000

  Dividends
  SWEPCO's  mortgage indenture, as amended and supplemented, contains
  certain  restrictions  on  the payment of  common  dividends.    At
  December   31,  1994,  all  of  SWEPCO's  retained  earnings   were
  available for the payment of cash dividends to its parent, CSW.

  Reacquired Long-term Debt
  Reference  is  made  to  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF
  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS,  Liquidity  and
  Capital  Resources  - Long-term Financing, for further  information
  related    to   long-term   debt,   including   new   issues    and
  reacquisitions.

4.Preferred Stock
  SWEPCO's  6.95% Series, $100 par value preferred stock  required  a
  mandatory   sinking  fund  sufficient  to  retire   12,000   shares
  annually.
     
  The   outstanding   preferred  stock  not  subject   to   mandatory
  redemption  is  redeemable at the option of  SWEPCO  upon  30  days
  notice at the current redemption price per share.

5.Financial Instruments
  The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate  the
  fair  value of each class of financial instruments for which it  is
  practicable to estimate fair value.

  Cash and temporary cash investments
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.

  Advances from affiliates
  The  carrying amount approximates fair value because of  the  short
  maturity of those instruments.

  Long-term debt
  The  fair  value of the SWEPCO's long-term debt is estimated  based
  on  the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues  or  on
  the  current rates offered to SWEPCO for debt of the same remaining
  maturities.

<PAGE> 2-151
  Current  maturities  of  long-term debt  and  preferred  stock  due
  within 12 months
  The  fair  values of the SWEPCO's current maturities  of  long-term
  debt  and preferred stock due within 12 months are estimated  based
  on  quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or  on  the
  current  rates  offered to SWEPCO for long-term debt  or  preferred
  stock with the same or similar remaining redemption provisions.

  Preferred stock
  The  fair  value of SWEPCO's preferred stock is estimated based  on
  quoted  market  prices for the same or similar  issues  or  on  the
  current  rates offered to SWEPCO for preferred stock with the  same
  or similar remaining redemption provisions.

  The  estimated  fair  values  of   SWEPCO's  financial  instruments
  follow:
                                              1994               1993

   The  fair  value does not affect SWEPCO's liabilities  unless  the
issues are redeemed prior to their maturity  dates.

6.Short-Term Financing
  SWEPCO,  together  with  other  members  of  the  CSW  System,  has
  established  a  money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings  and
  to  make  borrowings outside the money pool through CSW's  issuance
  of  commercial paper.  Money pool balances are shown as advances to
  or  from  affiliates on the Balance Sheets.  At December 31,  1994,
  the  CSW  System had bank lines of credit aggregating $930  million
  to   back  up  its  commercial  paper  program.   Short-term   cash
  surpluses transferred to the money pool receive interest income  in
  accordance with the money pool arrangement.

7.Benefit Plans
  Defined Benefit Pension Plan
  SWEPCO, together with other members of the CSW System, maintains  a
  tax   qualified,  non-contributory  defined  benefit  pension  plan
  covering  substantially  all  employees.   Benefits  are  based  on
  employees' years of credited service, age at retirement, and  final
  average  annual  earnings  with  an offset  for  the  participants'
  primary  Social Security benefit.  The CSW System's funding  policy
  is  based  on  actuarially  determined contributions,  taking  into
  account  amounts which are deductible for income tax  purposes  and
  minimum  contributions  required by  ERISA.   Pension  plan  assets
  consist primarily of common stocks and short-term and intermediate-
  term fixed income investments.

  Contributions  to the plan for the years ended December  31,  1994,
  1993  and  1992  were $5.9 million, $6.1 million and $5.2  million,
  respectively.

  The  approximate maximum number of participants in the plan  during
  1994  was  2,000 active employees,  800 retirees and  beneficiaries
  and 100 terminated employees.

  At  December  31,  1994, the plan's net assets  were  approximately
  equal  to  the  total  actuarial present value of  the  accumulated
  benefit obligation.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the plan's  net
  assets   exceeded  the  total  actuarial  present  value   of   the
  accumulated  benefit obligation.  No reconciliation of the  funding
  status  of  the  plan  is  presented because  such  information  is
  unavailable.

  Health and Welfare Plans
  SWEPCO  had  medical, dental, group life insurance, dependent  life
  insurance,  and  accidental  death  and  dismemberment  plans   for
  substantially  all  active  SWEPCO  employees  during   1994.   The
  contributions,  recorded on a pay-as-you-go basis,  for  the  years
  ended  December 31, 1994 and 1993 were approximately  $4.1  million
  and  $5.4  million, respectively.  Effective January 1993, SWEPCO's
  method  of  providing health benefits was modified to include  such
  benefits  as a health maintenance organization, preferred  provider
  options,  managed prescription drug and mail-order  program  and  a
  mental health and substance abuse program in addition to the  self-
  insured indemnity plans.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
  SWEPCO  adopted  SFAS  No. 106 on January 1, 1993.  The  effect  on
  operating  expense  in 1993 was $3 million.  SWEPCO  is  amortizing
  its  transition  obligation over twenty years, with eighteen  years
  remaining.  In prior years, these benefits were accounted for on  a
  pay-as-you-go basis.

  The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost follow:

  The following assumptions were used in accounting for SFAS No.
  106.

                                                  1994        1993

       Tax rate for taxable trusts               39.60%      39.60%

  Health Care Cost Trend Rate Assumptions
  Pre-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.75% grading  down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.5% in 2001.

  Post-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.25% grading down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.0% in 2001.

  Increasing  the  assumed  health  care  cost  trend  rates  by  one
  percentage  point  in  each year would  increase  the  APBO  as  of
  December 31, 1994  by $6 million and increase the aggregate of  the
  service   and  interest  costs  components  on  net  postretirement
  benefits by $0.9 million.

8.Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
  SWEPCO   has    joint  ownership  agreements  with   non-affiliated
  entities.   Such  agreements provide for the  joint  ownership  and
  operation of  the Flint Creek, Pirkey and Dolet Hills power  plants
  and  related facilities.  The statements of income reflect SWEPCO's
  portion  of  operating costs associated with jointly owned  plants.
  At December 31, 1994, SWEPCO had interests as shown below:
                                   Flint             Dolet
                                   Creek   Pirkey    Hills

<PAGE> 2-154
9.Litigation and  Regulatory Proceedings
  Fuel Reconciliation
  On  March  17,  1994,  SWEPCO  filed  a  petition  with  the  Texas
  Commission  to  reconcile fuel costs for the period  November  1989
  through  December 1993.  Total Texas jurisdictional  fuel  expenses
  subject   to   reconciliation  for  this   50-month   period   were
  approximately  $559 million.  SWEPCO's net under-recovery  for  the
  reconciliation period was approximately $0.9 million.   SWEPCO  and
  the  intervening parties in this proceeding were able to  negotiate
  a   stipulated  agreement  providing  a  $3.2  million  fuel   cost
  disallowance  and  settling  all issues  except  one.   That  issue
  involved  the  recovery  of  certain fuel  related  litigation  and
  settlement  negotiation  expenses.  The Texas  Commission,  at  its
  Final  Order  hearing on January 18, 1995, approved the  stipulated
  disallowance  and  granted  SWEPCO recovery  of  the  fuel  related
  litigation  expense.  The $3.2 million disallowance is included  in
  SWEPCO's  1994  results  of  operations.   SWEPCO  recognized   the
  litigation costs as expenses in prior periods.

  Burlington Northern Transportation Contract
  On  January  20,  1995,  a state district court  in  Bowie  County,
  Texas,  entered  judgment  in favor of  SWEPCO  against  Burlington
  Northern  in a lawsuit between the parties regarding rates  charged
  under  two  rail transportation contracts for delivery of  coal  to
  SWEPCO's  Welsh  and Flint Creek power plants.  The  court  awarded
  SWEPCO  approximately $72 million covering damages for  the  period
  from  April  27,  1989 through September 26, 1994  and  prejudgment
  interest  fees and granted certain declaratory relief requested  by
  SWEPCO.

  Kansas City Southern Railway Company Transportation Contracts
  In  March  1994, SWEPCO entered into a settlement with  the  Kansas
  City   Southern  Railway  Company  of  litigation  between  parties
  regarding  two  coal  transportation contracts.   Pursuant  to  the
  settlement,  SWEPCO  and the Kansas City Southern  Railway  Company
  executed  a  new coal transportation agreement.  The settlement  is
  expected  to  result in a reduction of SWEPCO's coal transportation
  costs  now  and in the future.  Burlington Northern, another  party
  to  the  prior contracts and to the litigation, did not participate
  in  the  settlement  and  the litigation is still  pending  between
  SWEPCO and Burlington Northern.

  Other
  SWEPCO  is  party  to  various  other  legal  claims,  actions  and
  complaints  arising  in the normal course of business.   Management
  does  not  expect disposition of these matters to have  a  material
  adverse  effect  on  SWEPCO's results of  operations  or  financial
  condition.

10.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
  It  is  estimated that SWEPCO will spend approximately $96  million
  in  construction expenditures during 1995.  Substantial commitments
  have   been  made  in  connection  with  this  capital  expenditure
  program.

  To  supply  a portion of the fuel requirements, SWEPCO has  entered
  into various commitments for procurement of fuel.

  Henry W. Pirkey Power Plant
  In  connection with the South Hallsville lignite mining contract for
  its  Henry  W. Pirkey  Power  Plant, SWEPCO has agreed, under certain
  conditions, to assume the obligations of the mining contractor.  As
  of December 31, 1994, the maximum amount SWEPCO would have to assume
  was  $73.7  million.   The maximum amount may vary  as  the  mining
  contractor's  need  for funds fluctuates.  The contractor's  actual
  obligation outstanding at December 31, 1994 was $60.9 million.

  South Hallsville Lignite Mine
  As  part  of  the process to receive a renewal of a Texas  Railroad
  Commission  permit  for  lignite mining  at  the  South  Hallsville
  lignite mine, SWEPCO has agreed to provide bond guarantees on  mine
  reclamation in the amount of $70 million.  Since SWEPCO uses  self-

<PAGE> 2-155
  bonding,  the guarantee provides for SWEPCO to commit  to  use  its
  resources to complete the reclamation in the event the work is  not
  completed  by the third party miner.  The current cost  to  reclaim
  the mine is estimated to be approximately $25 million.

  Coal Transportation
  SWEPCO  has  entered into various financing arrangements  primarily
  with  respect  to coal transportation and related equipment,  which
  are  treated  as  operating  leases for rate-making  purposes.   At
  December   31,  1994,  leased  assets  of  $46  million,   net   of
  accumulated  amortization  of  $30.1  million,  were  included   in
  electric  plant  on  the balance sheet and at  December  31,  1993,
  leased assets were $46 million, net of accumulated amortization  of
  $26.8  million.   Total charges to operating  expenses  for  leases
  were  $6.8  million, $7.1 million, and $6.9 million for  the  years
  1994, 1993, and 1992.

  Suspected MGP Site in Marshall, Texas
  SWEPCO  owns  a  suspected  former MGP  site  in  Marshall,  Texas.
  SWEPCO  has  notified the TNRCC that evidence of contamination  has
  been  found at the site.  As a result of sampling conducted at  the
  end  of  1993 and early 1994, SWEPCO is evaluating the  extent,  if
  any,  to  which  contamination has impacted soil,  groundwater  and
  other conditions in the area.  A final range of clean-up costs  has
  not  yet  been  determined, but, based on a  preliminary  estimate,
  SWEPCO  has  accrued approximately $2 million as  a  liability  for
  this  site  on  SWEPCO's books as of December 31,  1993.   As  more
  information  is obtained about the site, and SWEPCO  discusses  the
  site with the TNRCC, the preliminary estimate may change.

  Suspected   MGP   Site  in  Texarkana,  Texas  and   Arkansas   and
  Shreveport, Louisiana
  SWEPCO  also  owns a suspected former MGP site in Texarkana,  Texas
  and  Arkansas.   The EPA ordered an initial investigation  of  this
  site,  as well as one in Shreveport, Louisiana, which is no  longer
  owned  by  SWEPCO.  The contractor who performed the investigations
  of  these  two sites recommended to the EPA that no further  action
  be taken at this time.
  
  Biloxi, Mississippi MGP Site
  SWEPCO  has been notified by Mississippi Power Company that it  may
  be  a PRP at the former Biloxi MGP site formerly owned and operated
  by  a  predecessor  of SWEPCO.  SWEPCO is working with  Mississippi
  Power  Company to investigate the extent of contamination  at  this
  site.   The  MDEQ approved a site investigation work plan  and,  in
  January  1995,  SWEPCO  and  Mississippi  Power  Company  initiated
  sampling  pursuant to that work plan.  On an interim basis,  SWEPCO
  and  Mississippi Power Company are each paying fifty percent of the
  cost  of  implementing  the  site investigation  work  plan.   That
  interim  allocation is subject to a final allocation in the future.
  SWEPCO  and  Mississippi  Power Company are  investigating  whether
  there  are other PRPs at the Biloxi site.  Until the extent of  the
  contamination  at  the  Biloxi site is identified,  it  is  unknown
  what, if any, additional investigation or cleanup may be required.

  Management does not expect these matters to have a material  effect
  on SWEPCO's results of operations or financial position.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To  the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Southwestern Electric
Power Company:

      We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of capitalization of Southwestern Electric Power Company (a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central and South  West
Corporation)   as  of December 31, 1994 and 1993,  and  the  related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for  each  of
the  three  years  in  the period ended December  31,  1994.   These
financial  statements are the responsibility of SWEPCO's management.
Our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion  on  these  financial
statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing  standards.   Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
financial  statements are free of material misstatement.   An  audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the accounting principles used and significant  estimates
made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
Southwestern  Electric Power Company  as of December  31,  1994  and
1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for  each
of  the  three  years  in  the period ended December  31,  1994,  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

      In 1993, as discussed in NOTE 1, SWEPCO changed its method  of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

      Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.   The  supplemental
Schedule  II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of  complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of  the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit  have
been  subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits  of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state  in
all  material respects the financial data required to be  set  forth
therein  in  relation to the basic financial statements taken  as  a
whole.

Report of Management

      Management  is responsible for the preparation,  integrity  and
objectivity  of  the  financial statements of  Southwestern  Electric
Power  Company as well as other information contained in this  Annual
Report.   The  financial statements have been prepared in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates
and judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial  information contained elsewhere in this Annual  Report  is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

      The   financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting  firm,  Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given  unrestricted
access  to all financial records and related data, including  minutes
of   all  meetings  of  shareholders,  the  board  of  directors  and
committees  of the board.  SWEPCO believes that representations  made
to   the  independent  auditors  during  its  audit  were  valid  and
appropriate.   Arthur  Andersen  LLP's  audit  report  is   presented
elsewhere in this report.

      SWEPCO  maintains  a  system of internal  controls  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  that transactions are executed  in  accordance
with  management's authorization, that the financial  statements  are
prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of the companies are properly safeguarded against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system  includes  a
documented  organizational structure and division of  responsibility,
established  policies and procedures including a  policy  on  ethical
standards which provides that SWEPCO will maintain the highest  legal
and  ethical  standards,  and  the careful  selection,  training  and
development of our employees.

      Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal  control  system  following  standards  established  by  the
Institute  of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management  to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who are not officers or employees of SWEPCO provides oversight to the
financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls,  no internal control system can provide absolute  assurance
that  errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a  balance,  recognizing that the cost of such a  system  should  not
exceed the benefits derived.

      SWEPCO  believes that, in all material respects, its system  of
internal  controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding  of
assets   against   unauthorized  acquisition,  use   or   disposition
functioned effectively during 1994.

MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WEST TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY

     Reference is made to WTU's Financial Statements and related Notes
and Selected Financial Data.  The information contained therein should
be  read  in conjunction with, and is essential to understanding,  the
following discussion and analysis.

Overview
      Net  income  for common stock was $37 million  in  1994,  a  26%
increase when compared to 1993. This increase was due primarily to  an
increase  in  retail base revenues and other income and a decrease  in
restructuring charges.

Restructuring
      As  previously  reported, WTU has taken steps  to  implement  a
restructuring  and early retirement program designed  to  consolidate
and restructure its operations in order to meet the challenges of the
changing electric utility industry and to compete effectively in  the
years  ahead.  The underlying goal of the restructuring is to  enable
WTU  to  focus  on and be accountable for serving the customer.   The
restructuring  costs were initially estimated to be $15  million  and
were  expensed  in  1993.  The final costs of the restructuring  were
approximately  $13  million.   Approximately  $12  million   of   the
restructuring  expenditures  were  incurred  during  1994,  with  the
remaining   $1   million  expected  to  be  incurred   during   1995.
Approximately  $1  million of the restructuring  expenses  relate  to
employee termination benefits, $7 million relate to enhanced  benefit
costs and $5 million relate to employees that will not be terminated.
Approximately $9 million of the restructuring costs were paid from or
will  be paid from general corporate funds.  The remaining $4 million
represent  the present value of enhanced benefit amounts to  be  paid
from  the  benefit plan trusts to participants over future  years  in
accordance  with  the early retirement program.  The  cost  of  these
enhanced benefit amounts will be paid from general corporate funds to
the  benefit  plan  trusts over future years.  The  restructuring  is
substantially  completed, with the remaining activity to  take  place
during  1995.  Certain aspects of the restructuring are  pending  SEC
approval under the Holding Company Act.

       WTU  expects  to  realize  a  number  of  benefits  from   the
restructuring.   Beginning in 1994 and continuing  into  the  future,
increased efficiencies and synergies are expected to be realized with
the  elimination of previously duplicated functions.  This  leads  to
enhanced communication and efficiency, which should translate into  a
reduction in the rate of growth in O&M costs.  The CSW System expects
that  all  restructuring costs will be recovered by early  1996  with
reductions in the rate of growth of O&M costs continuing thereafter.

Rates and Regulatory Matters
       See   NOTE  9,  Litigation  and  Regulatory  Proceedings,   for
information regarding the WTU fuel and rate proceedings, and  deferred
accounting matters.

New Accounting Standards
      SFAS  No.  115  was effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 1993.  WTU adopted SFAS No. 115 in 1994.  The adoption of
SFAS  No.  115  did  not have a material effect on  WTU's  results  of
operations or financial condition.

      In  June  1993,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 116.   The  statement,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994, will  be
adopted  by  WTU  for  1995.   The  statement  establishes  accounting
standards  for contributions and applies to all entities that  receive
or  make  contributions.  Management does not believe the adoption  of
SFAS  No.  116  will  have  a  material impact  on  WTU's  results  of
operations or financial condition.


<PAGE> 2-162
     SFAS No. 119 was effective for fiscal years ending after December
15,  1994.  WTU currently does not use derivative instruments, but may
use  these  instruments in the future to manage the  increased  market
risks  associated  with greater competition in  the  electric  utility
industry.   The adoption of this new statement had no material  effect
on WTU's results of operations or financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
     WTU's need for capital results primarily from the construction of
facilities  to  provide reliable electric service  to  its  customers.
Accordingly,  internally  generated funds  should  meet  most  of  the
capital requirements.  However, if internally generated funds are  not
sufficient,  WTU's financial condition and credit rating should  allow
it access to the capital markets.

Capital Expenditures
      Construction expenditures including AFUDC were $42 million,  $37
million  and  $29 million for the years 1994, 1993 and  1992.   It  is
estimated that construction expenditures, including AFUDC, during  the
1995   through   1997  period  will  aggregate  $109  million.    Such
expenditures primarily will be made to improve and expand transmission
and  distribution facilities.  These improvements are expected to meet
the  needs  of  new customers and to satisfy changing requirements  of
existing  customers.   No  new  baseload power  plants  are  currently
planned until after the year 2000.

      The construction program continues to be monitored, reviewed and
adjusted to reflect changes in estimated load growth in WTU's  service
area,  variations in prices of alternative fuel sources, the  cost  of
labor, materials, equipment and capital, and other external factors.

     The CSW System facilities plan presently includes projected coal-
and  lignite-fired  generating  plants  for  which  WTU  has  invested
approximately $15 million in prior years for plant sites,  engineering
studies  and  lignite  reserves.  Should future  plans  exclude  these
plants  for  environmental or other reasons, WTU  would  evaluate  the
probability   of  recovery  of  these  investments  and   may   record
appropriate reserves.

Long-Term Financing
      As  of December 31, 1994, the capitalization ratios of WTU  were
56%  common  stock equity, 1% preferred stock and 43% long-term  debt.
WTU  continually  monitors the capital markets  for  opportunities  to
lower  its cost of capital through refinancing.  WTU continues  to  be
committed  to  maintaining financial flexibility  by  maintaining  its
strong capital structure and favorable securities ratings which should
allow funds to be obtained from the capital markets when required.

      WTU's long-term financing activity is shown below:

      In  February 1994, WTU issued $40 million of 6-1/8% FMBs, Series
S,  due  February  1,  2004.  Proceeds were used  to  reimburse  WTU's
treasury  for  (i)  $12 million aggregate principal amount  of  7-1/4%
First  Mortgage  Bonds, Series G, due January  1,  1999,  redeemed  on
January 1, 1994, and, (ii) $23 million aggregate principal amount of 7-
7/8%  FMBs, Series H, due July 1, 2003, redeemed on December 30, 1993.
The  balance of the proceeds was used to repay outstanding  short-term
borrowings.

     In July 1994, WTU redeemed its remaining $4.7 million outstanding
of  7-1/4% Series Preferred Stock in accordance with mandatory sinking
fund  provisions.   The  funds  required  for  this  transaction  were
provided from internal sources and short-term borrowings.

      In  October  and  November  1994, WTU  reacquired  $7.8  million
aggregate principal amount of its 9-1/4% FMBs, Series O, due  December
1,  2019  in open market transactions.  The funds required  for  these
transactions  were  provided from short-term borrowings  and  internal
sources.  The premiums and reacquisition costs of reacquired long-term

<PAGE> 2-163
debt  are  included in long-term debt on the balance  sheets  and  are
being amortized over 10 to 30 years in accordance with the anticipated
regulatory treatment.

      In  December  1994, pursuant to sinking fund  requirements,  WTU
elected to redeem at par $650,000 Series O, FMBs.

      In March 1995, WTU issued $40 million of 7-1/2% FMBs, Series  T,
due  April  1, 2000.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion  of  WTU's
short-term  debt,  to provide working capital and  for  other  general
corporate purposes.

WTU Shelf Registration
       WTU  expects  to  obtain  a  majority  of  their  1995  capital
requirements   from  internal  sources,  but  may   issue   additional
securities  subject  to  market conditions  and  other  factors.   The
proceeds  of  any  such offerings will be used principally  to  redeem
higher  cost  preferred stock and to repay short-term debt.   WTU  has
filed  shelf  registration statements with the SEC  for  the  sale  of
securities.   As  of  March 1995, WTU had $20  million  remaining  for
issuance of first mortgage bonds under a shelf registration filed with
the SEC in 1993.   WTU may issue additional debt securities subject to
market  conditions  and  other factors.   The  proceeds  of  any  such
offerings  will  be used principally to redeem higher  cost  FMBs,  to
lower  embedded  cost of debt, to repay short-term  debt,  to  provide
working capital and for other general corporate purposes.

      WTU  may  issue  additional preferred stock  subject  to  market
conditions and other factors.  The proceeds of any such offerings will
be  used  principally  to redeem higher cost preferred  stock  and  to
redeem short-term debt.

Short-Term Financing
      WTU,  together  with  other  members  of  the  CSW  System,  has
established   a  CSW  System  money  pool  to  coordinate   short-term
borrowings.   These  loans are unsecured demand obligations  at  rates
approximating  the  CSW  System's commercial  paper  borrowing  costs.
WTU's  short-term borrowing limit from the money pool is $50  million.
During  1994, the annual weighted average interest rate was  4.5%  and
the  average amount of short-term month-end borrowings outstanding was
$22  million.  The maximum amount of short-term borrowings outstanding
at  any  month-end during 1994 was $46 million, which was  the  amount
outstanding at December 31,  1994.

Internally Generated Funds
      Internally generated funds consist of cash flows from  operating
activities less common and preferred stock dividends.  WTU uses short-
term debt to meet fluctuations in working capital requirements due  to
the  seasonal  nature  of energy sales.  During  1993  and  1994,  WTU
experienced  several  non-recurring  transactions  that  resulted   in
negative internally generated funds in 1994, including the refinancing
of  Series G and Series H FMBs with Series S FMBs which occurred  from
December  1993  through  February 1994.  This  refinancing  caused  an
abnormally  high accounts payable balance at December 31,  1993  which
was subsequently reduced by the issuance of Series S in February 1994,
resulting in the appearance of a large out flow of cash from operating
funds.  WTU anticipates that capital requirements for the period  1995
to  1997 will be met, in large part, from internal sources.  WTU  also
expects  that  some  external  financings maybe  required  during  the
period,  but  the  nature,  timing  and  extent  have  not  yet   been
determined.    Information  concerning  internally   generated   funds
follows:

                                                1994  1993  1992
                                                   (millions)
          Internally Generated Funds            ($4)   $59   $49
                                               
          Construction Expenditures Provided
          by Internally Generated Funds          --   163%  169%


<PAGE> 2-164
     As discussed above, WTU issued $40 million of 7-1/2%  FMBs during
the first quarter of 1995, which were used to reduce short-term debt.

Sales of Accounts Receivable
      WTU  sells its billed and unbilled accounts receivable,  without
recourse, to CSW Credit.  The sales provide WTU with cash immediately,
thereby reducing working capital needs and revenue requirements.   The
average  and  year end amounts of accounts receivable  sold  were  $35
million  and $18 million in 1994, as compared to $36 million  and  $34
million in 1993.

Recent Developments and Trends
Competition and Industry Challenges
      Competitive forces at work in the electric utility industry  are
impacting WTU and electric utilities generally.  Increased competition
facing electric utilities is driven by complex economic, political and
technological factors.  These factors have resulted in legislative and
regulatory  initiatives  that are likely to  result  in  even  greater
competition at both the wholesale and retail level in the future.   As
competition  in the industry increases, WTU will have the  opportunity
to  seek  new  customers and at the same time be  at  risk  of  losing
customers  to  other competitors.  WTU believes that  its  prices  for
electricity  and the quality and reliability of its service  currently
place it in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace.

      The  Energy Policy Act, which was enacted in 1992, significantly
alters the way in which electric utilities compete.  The Energy Policy
Act  creates exemptions from regulation under the Holding Company  Act
and  permits utilities, including registered utility holding companies
and  non-utility companies, to form EWGs.  EWGs are a new category  of
non-utility  wholesale power producer that are free from most  federal
and  state  regulation, including the principal  restrictions  of  the
Holding Company Act.  These provisions enable broader participation in
wholesale  power  markets  by  reducing  regulatory  hurdles  to  such
participation.  The Energy Policy Act also allows the FERC, on a case-
by-case  basis  and  with  certain restrictions,  to  order  wholesale
transmission  access and to order electric utilities to enlarge  their
transmission  systems.  A FERC order requiring a transmitting  utility
to  provide  wholesale  transmission service must  include  provisions
generally  that  permit  (i) the utility  to  recover  from  the  FERC
applicant   all  of  the  costs  incurred  in  connection   with   the
transmission  services and (ii) any enlargement  of  the  transmission
system  and  associated services.  While WTU believes that the  Energy
Policy   Act  will  continue  to  make  the  wholesale  markets   more
competitive, WTU is unable to predict the extent to which  the  Energy
Policy Act will impact its operations.

       Increasing  competition  in  the  utility  industry  brings  an
increased  need  to stabilize or reduce rates.  The retail  regulatory
environment  is  beginning  to  shift  from  traditional   rate   base
regulation  to incentive regulation.  Incentive rate and  performance-
based  plans  encourage efficiencies and increased productivity  while
permitting  utilities  to share in the results.   Retail  wheeling,  a
major  industry issue which may require utilities to "wheel"  or  move
power  from  third parties to their own retail customer,  is  evolving
gradually.

      Wholesale  energy  markets, including the market  for  wholesale
electric power, have been extremely competitive since the enactment of
the  Energy Policy Act.  WTU competes in the wholesale energy  markets
with  other  public  utilities,  cogenerators,  qualified  facilities,
exempt wholesale generators and others for sales of electric power.

      Under  the  Energy  Policy Act, the FERC  has  approved  several
proposals by utility companies to sell wholesale power at market-based
rates  and provide to electric utilities "open access" to transmission
systems,  subject  to  certain requirements.  The  adoption  of  these
proposals  increases  marketing opportunities for electric  utilities,
but  also exposes them to the risk of loss of load or reduced revenues
due to competition with alternative suppliers.


<PAGE> 2-165
      WTU  believes that, compared to other electric utilities, it  is
well  positioned  to  meet  future  competition.   WTU  benefits  from
economies  of  scale  and  scope  by  virtue  of  its  size  and   its
relationship  to  the  CSW System.  WTU is also a relatively  low-cost
producer of electric power.  Moreover, WTU is taking steps to  enhance
its   marketing  and  customer  service,  reduce  costs,  improve  and
standardize   business   practices,   and   grow   through   strategic
acquisitions, in order to position itself for increased competition in
the future.

      WTU  is  unable  to predict the ultimate outcome  or  impact  of
competitive forces on the electric utility industry or on WTU.  As the
wholesale  and  retail  electricity markets become  more  competitive,
however,  the  principal factor determining success is  likely  to  be
price,  and to a lesser extent, reliability, availability of capacity,
and customer service.

Public Utility Regulatory Act
      PURA is the legal foundation for electric utility regulation  in
Texas.  PURA will expire on September 1, 1995, in accordance with  the
sunset  policy of the Texas Legislature, which applies  to  all  state
agencies,  unless the Texas Legislature reenacts PURA in  its  current
form  or in modified form.  Several proposals have been made to  amend
PURA which, among other things, provide for a market-driven integrated
resource  planning  process, pricing flexibility for  utilities  faced
with competitive challenges, incentive regulation and deregulation  of
the  wholesale bulk power market in ERCOT.  WTU is unable  to  predict
the  ultimate outcome of the 1995 session of the Texas Legislature and
in particular whether amendments to PURA will be adopted.

Regulatory Accounting
      Consistent with industry practice and the provisions of SFAS No.
71,  which  allows  for  the recognition and  recovery  of  regulatory
assets,   WTU  has  recognized  significant  regulatory   assets   and
liabilities.  Management believes that WTU will continue to  meet  the
criteria  for  following SFAS No. 71.  However, in the  event  WTU  no
longer  meets  the criteria for following SFAS No. 71, a write-off  of
regulatory  assets and liabilities would be required.  For  additional
information  regarding  SFAS  No. 71 reference  is  made  to  NOTE  1,
Summary  of  Significant Accounting Policies - Regulatory  Assets  and
Liabilities.

Consolidated Taxes
      The  Texas  Commission before 1992 allowed income  taxes  to  be
recovered  in  rates based on the federal income  tax  incurred  by  a
utility  as  if  it  were  a  stand-alone company.   This  stand-alone
approach  treated the regulated activities of a utility as a  separate
entity  and  considered  only those revenues  and  expenses  that  are
included  in  the utility's cost of service to calculate  the  federal
income tax liability for ratemaking purposes.

      Beginning  in 1992, the Texas Commission changed its  method  of
calculating  the federal income tax component of rates to the  "actual
tax  approach."   The actual tax approach is an evolving  concept  but
generally  seeks to reflect in rates the actual tax liability  of  the
utility  irrespective  of its relationship to the  utility's  cost  of
service.  The approach reduces rates by the tax benefits of deductions
which  are  not  considered for or included in setting rates  for  the
utility.

      The  Texas Commission is expected to use the actual tax approach
for calculating the recovery of federal income tax in the pending rate
case  for   WTU.   The  impact  of the  actual  tax  approach  on  the
prospective  rates for WTU cannot be determined since the  application
of the concept is unsettled.

      WTU  believes that the recovery of federal income taxes in rates
should  be  determined  on  the stand-alone  approach  for  ratemaking
purposes,  but there is no assurance this approach will be adopted  in
the pending WTU rate case.

<PAGE> 2-166
Environmental Matters
CERCLA and Related Matters
      The  operations of WTU, like those of other utilities, generally
involve  the  use and disposal of substances subject to  environmental
laws.   The CERCLA, the federal "Superfund" law, addresses the cleanup
of  sites  contaminated by hazardous substances.   Superfund  requires
that PRPs fund remedial actions regardless of fault or the legality of
past  disposal  activities.   PRPs include  owners  and  operators  of
contaminated  sites  and transporters and/or generators  of  hazardous
substances.   Many states have similar laws.  Theoretically,  any  one
PRP  can  be  held  responsible for the  entire  cost  of  a  cleanup.
Typically, however, cleanup costs are allocated among PRPs.

      WTU  is subject to various pending claims alleging it is  a  PRP
under federal or state remedial laws for investigating and cleaning up
contaminated  property.   WTU anticipates  that  resolution  of  these
claims,  individually or in the aggregate, will not  have  a  material
adverse  effect on WTU's results of operations or financial condition.
Although  the reasons for this expectation differ from site  to  site,
factors  that  are  the basis for the expectation for  specific  sites
include the volume and/or type of waste allegedly contributed by  WTU,
the  estimated  amount of costs allocated to WTU and the participation
of other parties.

Clean Air Act Amendments
      In  November 1990, the United States Congress passed the  Clean
Air  Act  which places restrictions on the emission of sulfur dioxide
from  gas-, coal- and lignite-fired generating plants.  Beginning  in
the  year 2000, the Electric Operating Companies will be required  to
hold  allowances  in order to emit sulfur dioxide.   The  EPA  issues
allowances to owners of existing generating units based on historical
operating  conditions.  Based on the CSW System facilities plan,  WTU
believes  that its allowances will be adequate to meet its  needs  at
least  through  2008.  Public and private markets are developing  for
trading  of  excess allowances.  WTU presently has  no  intention  of
engaging  in  trading of allowances, but may seek to  do  so  in  the
future  if  market  conditions  warrant  and  appropriate  regulatory
approvals are obtained.

      The  Clean Air Act also establishes a federal operating  source
permit program to be administered by the states.

      The  Clean  Air  Act also directs the EPA to issue  regulations
governing nitrogen oxide emissions and requires government studies to
determine  what controls, if any, should be imposed on  utilities  to
control  air  toxics emissions.  The impact that the  nitrogen  oxide
emission regulations and the air toxics study will have on WTU cannot
be determined at this time.

      As  a result of requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act,  WTU
expects  to  spend  $0.5  million for  annual  testing  of,  software
modifications  to, and maintenance of continuous emission  monitoring
equipment from 1995 through 1997.

EMFs
      Research  is  ongoing whether exposure to  EMFs  may  result  in
adverse  health effects.  Although a few of the studies to date  have
suggested certain associations between EMFs and some types of effects,
the   research   to   date  has  not  established  a  cause-and-effect
relationship  between  EMFs and adverse health  effects.   WTU  cannot
predict  the impact on WTU or the electric utility industry if further
investigations  or  proceedings were to  establish  that  the  present
electricity  delivery  system is contributing  to  increased  risk  or
incidence of health problems.

Results of Operations
Electric Operating Revenues
      Electric  operating  revenues in 1994 decreased  approximately
$2.5  million  or 1% when compared to 1993.  This decrease  was  due
primarily  to  a reduction in lower margin off-system  sales  of  $8
million resulting from decreased market place demand.  This decrease
was  partially offset by higher on system revenues of  $6.5  million
attributable to an increase in retail KWH sales of 3% resulting from
customer  growth  and  increased usage.  Also  contributing  to  the

<PAGE> 2-167
decrease was an interim rate reduction of approximately $5.7 million
on  an  annual basis effective October 1, 1994.  Revenues for  1993,
when  compared  to 1992, increased approximately $30.1  million,  or
10%.  The increase is attributed to a 10% increase in KWH sales  and
a  $9.1 million increase in fuel-related revenues.  The increase  in
KWH  sales  is attributable to a warmer summer in 1993 and increased
sales for resale to an affiliated company.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses
     Fuel expenses decreased approximately $3.8 million or 3% during
1994 when compared to 1993 and increased approximately $15.1 million
or  13%  when  compared to 1992.  The decrease in 1994 is  primarily
attributable to a 2% decrease in average unit fuel costs from  $1.91
in  1993  to  $1.88  in 1994 and a 2% decrease in  generation.   The
increase  in 1993 is due primarily to a 5% increase in average  unit
fuel  cost to $1.91 in 1993 from $1.82 in 1992 and a 7% increase  in
generation.  The change in unit fuel costs during both years is  due
primarily to changes in the price of natural gas on the spot market.

      Purchased power expenses decreased approximately $2.3  million
and  increased $4.3 million during 1994 and 1993, respectively, when
compared  to  the  prior years.  The change during both  periods  is
primarily attributable to increased economy purchases in 1993.

Expenses and Taxes
      Other  operating expenses increased approximately $4.9 million
and  $3.8  million during 1994 and 1993, respectively, when compared
to  prior  years.  The increase during 1994 reflects a reimbursement
in  1993  for the settlement of a dispute relating to a coal  supply
contract  which  lowered expenses in 1993.  Higher outside  services
for  fuel related issues and other employee related expenses in 1994
also contributed to the increase.  The increase during 1993 was  due
primarily to higher employee pensions and benefits.

      Restructuring  charges  reflect the original  accrual  of  $15
million  in  December  1993 which was subsequently  adjusted  by  $2
million in 1994, resulting in total restructuring charges for WTU of
$13 million at December 31, 1994.

       Maintenance   expense  in  1994  increased   over   1993   by
approximately  $1.7  million  or  13%  due  primarily  to  increased
production  maintenance of boiler and electric  plant.   Maintenance
increased  approximately  $1.3 million in 1993  compared  with  1992
because  of  higher production and general expenses  resulting  from
boiler plant maintenance.

      Depreciation and amortization expenses increased approximately
$1.2  million  and $3.6 million during 1994 and 1993,  respectively,
when  compared  to  prior  years  due  primarily  to  increases   in
depreciable property.

      Federal  income taxes increased approximately $4.3 million  or
32%  in  1994 when compared with 1993 due to higher pre-tax  income.
The  decrease  in 1993 compared to 1992 was largely attributable  to
lower  pre-tax income partially offset by an increase in the federal
corporate income tax rate to 35% from 34%.

      Other  income  increased approximately $2.3  million  in  1994
resulting  from  tax  benefits  received  under  WTU's  tax  sharing
agreement with CSW.

Interest on Long-Term Debt
     Interest on long-term debt decreased approximately $0.7 million
in  1994 when compared to the prior year due to WTU's refinancing of
higher  cost  debt  with  lower  cost debt  and  decreased  balances
outstanding.

Inflation
      Annual  inflation rates, as measured by the national  Consumer
Price  Index,  have averaged approximately 2.7% for  the  three-year
period  ending  December 31, 1994.  WTU believes that inflation,  at
these  levels, does not materially affect its results of  operations

<PAGE> 2-168
or   financial   condition.   However,  under  existing   regulatory
practice,  only  the  historical cost of plant is  recoverable  from
customers.  As a result, cash flows designed to provide recovery  of
historical  plant  costs may not be adequate  to  replace  plant  in
future years.

Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles
      In  1993,  WTU  changed it method of accounting  for  unbilled
revenue and implemented SFAS No. 112.  These accounting changes  had
a cumulative effect of increasing net income by $3.8 million.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
  Public Utility Regulation
  WTU  is  subject to regulation by the SEC under the Holding Company
  Act,  and  the  FERC under the Federal Power Act, and  follows  the
  Uniform  System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC.  WTU is subject
  to  further  regulation with regard to rates and other  matters  by
  the  Texas Commission.  WTU, as a member of the CSW System, engages
  in  transactions and coordinates its activities and operations with
  other members of the CSW System.

  The  more  significant accounting policies of  WTU  are  summarized
  below:

  Electric Utility Plant
  Electric  utility  plant  is  stated  at  the  original   cost   of
  construction,  which  includes  the cost  of  contracted  services,
  direct   labor,  materials,  overhead  items  and  allowances   for
  borrowed and equity funds used during construction.

  Depreciation
  Provisions for depreciation of electric utility plant are  computed
  using  the  straight-line  method, generally  at  individual  rates
  applied  to  the  various  classes of  depreciable  property.   The
  annual average consolidated composite rates were 3.2% in both  1994
  and 1993 and 3.1% in 1992.

  Electric Revenues and Fuel
  Prior  to January 1, 1993, electric revenues were recorded  at  the
  time  billings  were  made to customers on a  cycle-billing  basis.
  Electric  service provided subsequent to billing dates through  the
  end  of  each  calendar month became part of operating revenues  of
  the  next  month.   To conform to general industry  standards,  WTU
  changed  its method of accounting to accrue for estimated  unbilled
  revenues.   The  effect of this change on 1993 net  income  was  an
  increase  of $5.4 million included in cumulative effect of  changes
  in accounting principles.

  WTU  recovers  fuel  costs in Texas as a fixed  component  of  base
  rates whereby over-recoveries of fuel are payable to customers  and
  under-recoveries  of  fuel may be billed to customers  after  Texas
  Commission  approval.  The cost of fuel is charged  to  expense  as
  consumed.    WTU  recovers  fuel  costs  applicable  to   wholesale
  customers,  which are regulated by the FERC, through  an  automatic
  fuel adjustment clause.

  Accounts Receivable.
  WTU  sells  its  billed and unbilled accounts  receivable,  without
  recourse, to CSW Credit.

  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.
  For  its  regulated  activities, WTU follows  SFAS  No.  71,  which
  defines  the  criteria  for  establishing  regulatory  assets   and
  regulatory  liabilities.   Regulatory  assets  represent   probable
  future  revenue to the company associated with certain costs  which
  will  be  recovered from customers through the ratemaking  process.
  Regulatory   liabilities  represent  probable  future  refunds   to
  customers.   At December 31, 1994 and 1993,  WTU had  recorded  the
  following significant regulatory assets and liabilities:

             regulatory liabilities, net         $ 9,217      $10,545

  Deferred Plant Costs
  In  accordance with orders of the Texas Commission,  WTU   deferred
  operating, depreciation and tax costs incurred for Oklaunion  Power
  Station Unit 1.  This deferral was for the period beginning on  the
  date  when the plant began commercial operation until the date  the
  plant  was  included in rate base.  The deferred  costs  are  being
  amortized  and recovered through rates over the remaining  life  of
  the  plant.  See NOTE 9, Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings, for
  further discussion of WTU's deferred accounting.

  Statements of Cash Flows
  Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid debt
  instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less.
  Accordingly, temporary cash investments are considered cash
  equivalents.

  Reclassification
  Certain financial statement items for prior years have been
  reclassified to conform to the 1994 presentation.

  Accounting Changes
  Effective January 1, 1993, WTU adopted SFAS Nos. 106, 112 and  109.
  See   NOTE   2,  Federal  Income  Taxes,  for  further  information
  regarding  SFAS No. 109.  In addition, WTU also changed its  method
  of  accounting  for  unbilled revenues. See Electric  Revenues  and
  Fuel above for further information.

  The  adoption  of  SFAS No. 106 resulted in  an  increase  in  1993
  operating expenses of $1.9 million.  The adoption of  SFAS No.  112
  and  the  change in accounting for unbilled revenues are  presented
  as  a  cumulative  effect  of changes in accounting  principles  as
  shown below:

                         Pre-Tax      Tax         Net Income
                         Effect      Effect        Effect

    Unbilled revenues      8,347     (2,921)        5,426
    Total                $ 5,813    $(2,034)      $ 3,779

  Pro  forma  amounts  assuming that the  change  in  accounting  for
  unbilled   revenues   had  been  adopted  retroactively   are   not
  materially  different from amounts previously  reported  for  prior
  years.

2.Federal Income Taxes
  WTU  adopted  the provisions of SFAS No. 109 effective  January  1,
  1993. The implementation of SFAS No. 109 had no material effect  on
  WTU's  earnings.   As  a  result  of this  change,  WTU  recognized
  additional  accumulated  deferred income  taxes  and  corresponding
  regulatory  assets and liabilities to ratepayers in  amounts  equal
  to  future  revenues or the reduction in future  revenues  required
  when   the  income  tax  temporary  differences  reverse  and   are
  recovered  or  settled  in  rates.  As  a  result  of  a  favorable
  earnings  history,  WTU  did  not record  any  valuation  allowance
  against deferred tax assets at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

3.Long-Term Debt
  The  mortgage  indenture,  as  amended and  supplemented,  securing
  first  mortgage  bonds issued by WTU, constitutes  a  direct  first
  mortgage  lien  on substantially all electric utility  plant.   WTU
  may  offer  additional FMBs subject to market conditions and  other
  factors.

  Annual Requirements
  Series  O FMBs have annual sinking fund requirements, which may  be
  satisfied  by  the  application of net  expenditures  for  bondable
  property  in an amount equal to 166-2/3% of the annual requirements
  or  at  WTU's option, the redemption of 1% of the amount originally
  issued.    At   December   31,  1994,  the  annual   sinking   fund
  requirements  for the next five years, exclusive of maturities,  of
  WTU's  first  mortgage  bonds  are  $650,000.   Pursuant  to  these
  sinking  fund  requirements, WTU elected to redeem at par  $650,000
  Series O, FMBs in December 1994.

  Dividends
  WTU's  mortgage  indenture, as amended and  supplemented,  contains
  certain restrictions on the payment of common stock dividends.   At
  December   31,  1994,  $133  million  of  retained  earnings   were
  available for the payment of cash dividends to its parent, CSW.

  Reacquired long-term debt
  Reference  is  made  to  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF
  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  -  Liquidity  and
  Capital  Resources,  for further information related  to  long-term
  debt, including new issues and reacquisition.

4.Preferred Stock
  In  July  1993,  WTU redeemed 100,000 shares of its  7.25%  Series,
  $100  par  value, Preferred Stock, for $10 million,  in  accordance
  with  mandatory and optional sinking fund provisions.  The  capital
  required   for   this  transaction  was  provided   by   short-term
  borrowings from the CSW System money pool and internal sources.


<PAGE> 2-179
  In  July  1994,  WTU redeemed the remaining 47,000  shares  of  its
  7.25% Series, $100 par value, Preferred Stock.

5.Financial Instruments
  The  following  methods and assumptions were used to  estimate  the
  fair  value of each class of financial instruments for which it  is
  practicable to estimate fair value.

  Cash and temporary cash investments
  The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  Advances from affiliates
  The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
  maturity of those instruments.
  
  Long-term debt
  The fair value of the WTU's long-term debt is estimated based on
  the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
  current rates offered to WTU for debt of the same remaining
  maturities.
  
  Preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption
  The fair value of the WTU's preferred stock subject to mandatory
  redemption is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same
  or similar issues or on the current rates offered to WTU for
  preferred stock with the same or similar remaining redemption
  provisions.
  
  Current maturities of long-term debt
  The fair value of current maturities is estimated based on quoted
  market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates
  offered for long-term debt.
  
  The estimated fair values of WTU's financial instruments follow:

                                               1994                1993      
                                       Carrying    Fair     Carrying    Fair
                                        Amount     Value     Amount     Value
                                                     (thousands)
  Cash and temporary cash                                           
    investments                        $  2,501  $  2,501   $    706  $    706
  Current maturities of long-term debt      650       666     12,650    12,800
  Advances from affiliates               46,315    46,315     36,285    36,285
  Long-term debt                        210,047   228,802    176,882   225,082
  Preferred stock                            --        --      4,648     4,671

   The fair value does not affect WTU's liabilities unless the issues
are redeemed prior to their maturity dates.

6.Short-Term Financing
  WTU,   together  with  other  members  of  the  CSW   System,   has
  established  a  money pool to coordinate short-term borrowings  and
  to  make  borrowings outside the money pool through CSW's  issuance
  of  commercial paper.  Money pool balances are shown as advances to
  or  from  affiliates on the Balance Sheets.  At December 31,  1994,
  the  CSW  System had bank lines of credit aggregating $930  million
  to   back  up  its  commercial  paper  program.   Short-term   cash
  surpluses transferred to the money pool receive interest income  in
  accordance with the money pool arrangement.

<PAGE> 2-180
7.Benefit Plans
  Defined Benefit Pension Plan
  WTU,  together  with other members of the CSW System,  maintains  a
  tax   qualified,  non-contributory  defined  benefit  pension  plan
  covering  substantially  all  employees.   Benefits  are  based  on
  employees' years of credited service, age at retirement, and  final
  average  annual  earnings  with  an offset  for  the  participant's
  primary  Social Security benefit.  The CSW System's funding  policy
  is  based  on  actuarially  determined contributions,  taking  into
  account  amounts which are deductible for income tax  purposes  and
  minimum  contributions required by the ERISA.  Pension plan  assets
  consist primarily of common stocks and short-term and intermediate-
  term fixed income investments.

  Contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 1994,
  1993 and 1992 were $3.8 million, $3.9 million and $3.4 million,
  respectively.
  
  The approximate maximum number of participants in the plan during
  1994 were 1,300 active employees, 500 retirees and beneficiaries
  and 100 terminated employees.
  
  The components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions
  used in accounting for pensions follow:

                                         1994      1993       1992
                                               (thousands)
     Net Periodic Pension Cost                                 
         Service cost                  $ 3,082   $ 2,732   $ 2,569

         Net amortization and deferral  (9,556)       35    (2,836)
                                       $ 1,426   $ 1,095   $   765

     Discount rate                        8.25%     7.75%     8.50%
     Long-term compensation increase      5.46%     5.46%     5.96%
     Return on plan assets                9.50%     9.50%     9.50%

  At  December  31,  1994, the plan's net assets  were  approximately
  equal  to  the  total  actuarial present value of  the  accumulated
  benefit   obligation.  At  December   31,  1993  the   plan's   net
  assets   exceeded  the  total  actuarial  present  value   of   the
  accumulated  benefit obligation.  No reconciliation of the  funding
  status  of  the  plan  is  presented because  such  information  is
  unavailable.

  Health and Welfare Plans
  WTU  had  medical,  dental,  group life insurance,  dependent  life
  insurance,  and  accidental  death  and  dismemberment  plans   for
  substantially   all   active  WTU  employees   during   1994.   The
  contributions,  recorded on a pay-as-you-go  basis  for  the  years
  ended  December 31, 1994 and 1993 were approximately  $2.7  million
  and  $3.5  million, respectively.  Effective January  1993,   WTU's
  method  of  providing health benefits was modified to include  such
  benefits  as preferred provider options, managed prescription  drug
  and  mail-order  program and a mental health  and  substance  abuse
  program in addition to the self-insured indemnity plans.

  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
  WTU  adopted SFAS No. 106 January 1, 1993. The effect on  operating
  expense   in  1993  was  $1.9  million.   WTU  is  amortizing   its
  transition  obligation  over  twenty  years,  with  eighteen  years
  remaining.  In prior years, these benefits were accounted for on  a
  pay-as-you-go basis.

  A  reconciliation of the funded status of the plan to  the  amounts
  recognized on the consolidated balance sheets follow:

                                             December 31,
                                           1994        1993

   Accrued/(Prepaid) Cost               $    394    $    394

  The following assumptions were used in accounting for SFAS No.
  106:

                                           1994          1993
       Discount rate                       8.25%         7.75%
       Return on plan assets               9.50%         9.00%
       Tax rate for taxable trusts        39.60%        39.60%

  Health Care Cost Trend Rate Assumptions
  Pre-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.75% grading  down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.5% in 2001.

  Post-65  Participants:  1994 Rate of 11.25% grading down  .75%  per
  year to an ultimate rate of 6.0% in 2001.

  Increasing  the  assumed  health  care  cost  trend  rates  by  one
  percentage  point  in  each year would  increase  the  APBO  as  of
  December  31,  1994 by $3.5 million and increase the  aggregate  of
  the  service  and  interest costs components on net  postretirement
  benefits by $.5 million.

8.Jointly Owned Electric Utility Plant
  WTU  has a joint ownership agreement with other members of the  CSW
  System  and other non-affiliated entities.  Such agreements provide
  for  the  joint ownership and operation of Oklaunion Power Station.
  Each  participant provided financing for its share of the  project,
  which  was  placed in service in December 1986.  The statements  of
  income  reflect  WTU's portion of operating costs  associated  with
  jointly  owned plant in service.  WTU's share is 370 MW or a  54.7%
  interest  in  the  generating  station.   WTU's  total  investment,
  including  AFUDC  is $280 million and accumulated  depreciation  at
  December 31, 1994 is $59 million.

9.Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings
  Rate Proceeding - Docket No. 13369
  On August 25, 1994, WTU filed a petition with the Texas Commission
  and  with cities with original jurisdiction to review WTU's rates,
  proposed an interim across-the-board base rate reduction of  3.25%
  or,  approximately $5.7 million, effective October  1,  1994,  and
  sought  until February 28, 1995, the time to develop  and  file  a
  RFP.  WTU also requested the ability to "true-up", back to October
  1,  1994, any difference in revenue requirements upon final  order
  of  the Texas Commission, and proposed that any increases over the
  pre-October  1,  1994, base rates be implemented prospectively  on
  the effective date of the final order.
  
  As  discussed  below, WTU's fuel reconciliation  was  consolidated
  with  this proceeding in September 1994.  Reconcilable fuel  costs
  during  the reconciliation period were approximately $300 million.
  At   June   30,   1994,  the  fuel  cost  under-recovery   totaled
  approximately $5.1 million, including interest.  At  December  31,
  1994,  this  amount had become an over-recovery  of  approximately
  $0.2 million.  WTU is not seeking a change in fuel factors.
  
  On  February  28,  1995, WTU filed with the Texas  Commission  and
  cities  with  original  jurisdiction the  RFP  which  indicates  a
  revenue  deficiency of approximately $14.5 million.  However,  WTU
  simultaneously  filed  with the parties a settlement  proposal  to
  reduce  overall base rate revenue by 3.25%, effective  October  1,
  1994, an annual impact in the rate year beginning January 1,  1996
  of  approximately $5.9 million.  The settlement proposal  reflects
  WTU's  desire  to  maintain  competitive  rates,  recognizes   the
  importance  of competitive rates in the changing electric  service
  marketplace, and demonstrates WTU's strong commitment to the long-
  term success of WTU and its customers.
  
  Unless  a  settlement  accelerates the schedule,  WTU  anticipates
  hearings  in mid-1995 with a final order in the fourth quarter  of
  1995.    Management  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  the   rate
  proceeding,  the fuel reconciliation, or the settlement  proposal,
  but  believes  that the ultimate resolution of these matters  will
  not  have a material adverse effect on WTU's results of operations
  or financial condition.
  
  Fuel Reconciliation - Docket No. 13172
  On  June  30, 1994, WTU filed a petition with the Texas Commission
  to  reconcile  fuel  costs  for the period  January  1991  through
  February  1994.   Subsequently,  in  September  1994,  this   fuel
  reconciliation proceeding was consolidated into Docket  No.  13369
  described  above,  and  the  reconciliation  period  was  extended
  through June 1994.
  
  Rate Case Proceeding - Docket No. 7510
  In  November  1987, the Texas Commission issued a final  order  in
  WTU's  retail  rate  case providing for WTU to receive  an  annual
  increase  in  base  retail  revenues  of  $34.9  million.    Rates
  reflecting  the  final order were implemented  in  December  1987.
  WTU, along with certain intervenors in the retail rate proceeding,
  appealed the Texas Commission's final order to the District  Court
  seeking  reversal  of  various  provisions  of  the  final  order,
  including the inclusion of deferred accounting in rate base.
  
  The  appeals were consolidated and in September 1988, the District
  Court  affirmed  the  final  order of the  Texas  Commission.   In
  November  1988, certain intervenors filed appeals of the  District
  Court's judgment with the Court of Appeals.  In February 1990, the
  Court  of  Appeals  ruled that an intervenor had  improperly  been
  excluded  from  presenting  its  appeal  to  the  District  Court,
  reversed  the District Court's judgment and remanded the  case  to
  the District Court for further proceedings.
  
  In  October 1992, the District Court heard the remanded appeals of
  the  final order of the Texas Commission and in March 1993  issued
  an  order  affirming the Texas Commission's order in all  material
  respects  with the single exception of the inclusion  of  deferred
  Oklaunion  carrying  costs  in rate base.   In  its  treatment  of
 
<PAGE> 2-183
 deferred costs, the District Court followed a then-current opinion
  of the Court of Appeals which precluded recovery of deferred post-
  in-service  carrying costs.  In April 1993, WTU and other  parties
  filed  appeals,  and  oral argument was held  on  the  appeals  in
  December 1993 on the non-deferred accounting issues.  With respect
  to  the deferred accounting issues, the parties recognized certain
  Supreme   Court  of  Texas  decisions  regarding  other   deferred
  accounting cases would be influential in WTU's case.
  
  In June 1994, the Supreme Court of Texas issued its opinion in the
  three  other cases involving deferred accounting holding that  the
  Texas  Commission  has the authority to allow deferred  accounting
  treatment during the deferral period, including deferred  post-in-
  service  carrying  costs.  The Supreme Court of Texas  upheld  the
  Court  of Appeals in all respects except it reversed the Court  of
  Appeals  to the extent it disallowed carrying costs deferrals  and
  remanded  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  consideration  of  the
  unresolved   arguments  of  the  improperly  excluded  intervenor.
  Motions  for  rehearing were filed by certain parties  which  were
  denied  by  the Supreme Court of Texas.  These rulings  influenced
  the  Court  of  Appeals' decision in WTU's rate case  appeals,  as
  described below.
  
  On February 15, 1995, the Court of Appeals affirmed all aspects of
  the  District  Court  judgment relating to the Texas  Commission's
  allowance of non-Oklaunion depreciation rates and the surcharge of
  rate   case  expenses,  reversed  the  District  Court's  judgment
  relating to the exclusion of deferred Oklaunion carrying costs  in
  rate  base,  and  remanded the cause to the  Texas  Commission  to
  reexamine  the issue of deferred costs in light of the  remand  of
  Docket  No. 7289, as described below.  However, on March 3,  1995,
  WTU  filed a motion for rehearing at the Court of Appeals  seeking
  clarification of certain aspects of its order and arguing that the
  Court  of  Appeals  erred  in remanding  the  case  to  the  Texas
  Commission for it to determine to what extent deferred  costs  are
  necessary to preserve WTU's financial integrity because the  issue
  has been waived since it was not briefed or argued to the Court of
  Appeals.   WTU  expects other parties may also  file  motions  for
  rehearing.
  
  WTU's motion for rehearing may, if granted, prevent further review
  of  financial integrity issues with respect to deferred accounting
  in  any  remand  of  Docket No. 7510.   If  a  broader  remand  is
  permitted and if the Texas Commission concludes in Docket No. 7289
  that deferred accounting was necessary to preserve WTU's financial
  integrity  during the deferral period, the Texas  Commission  must
  decide  to  what  extent the deferred Oklaunion  costs,  including
  carrying   costs,  were  necessary  to  preserve  WTU's  financial
  integrity.   If WTU's deferred accounting treatment is  ultimately
  reversed  or  is  substantially reduced, WTU  could  experience  a
  material  adverse  impact  on its results  of  operations.   While
  management  can  give  no assurances as  to  the  outcome  of  the
  remanded  proceeding  or  the  motion  for  rehearing,  management
  believes that 100 percent of the Oklaunion deferred costs will  be
  determined  by  the  Texas Commission to have  been  necessary  to
  preserve  WTU's financial integrity during the deferral period  so
  that there will be no material adverse effect on WTU's results  of
  operations or financial condition.
  
  Deferred Accounting - Docket No. 7289
  WTU  received approval from the Texas Commission in September 1987
  to  defer  operating expenses and carrying costs  associated  with
  Oklaunion  incurred  subsequent to its  December  1986  commercial
  operation  date  until  December 1987 (the deferral  period)  when
  retail  rates  including  Oklaunion  in  WTU's  rate  base  became
  effective.    WTU  has  recorded  approximately  $32  million   of
  Oklaunion deferred costs, of which $25 million are carrying costs.
  The  deferred  costs  are being recovered and amortized  over  the
  remaining  life  of the plant.  In November 1987,  OPUC  filed  an
  appeal  in  the District Court challenging the Texas  Commission's
  final  order  authorizing WTU to defer the costs  associated  with
  Oklaunion.  In October 1988, the District Court affirmed the final
  order  of  the Texas Commission.  In December 1988, OPUC filed  an
  appeal of the District Court judgment in the Court of Appeals.  In
  September  1990, the Court of Appeals upheld the District  Court's
  affirmance  of the Texas Commission's final order and  in  October
  1990,  OPUC filed a motion for rehearing of the Court of  Appeals'
  decision,  which was denied in November 1990.  On further  appeal,
  the  Supreme Court heard oral argument in September 1993, in WTU's
  case  as  well as three other cases involving deferred  accounting

<PAGE> 2-184
  and  in June 1994 issued its opinions in these cases affirming the
  Texas   Commission's   authority  to  allow  deferred   accounting
  treatment, but establishing a financial integrity standard  rather
  than the measurable harm standard used by the Texas Commission.
  
  In  October  1994,  the Supreme Court of Texas  issued  a  mandate
  remanding  WTU's deferred accounting case to the Texas Commission.
  While no schedule has yet been established for the proceedings  on
  remand  at the Texas Commission, this remand may be considered  in
  tandem  with  WTU's pending rate case, Docket No. 13369.   In  the
  remanded  proceeding,  the Texas Commission  must  make  a  formal
  finding  that  the  deferral of Oklaunion costs was  necessary  to
  prevent WTU's financial integrity during the deferral period  from
  being jeopardized.
  
  If  WTU's deferred accounting treatment is ultimately reversed and
  not  favorably  resolved, WTU could experience a material  adverse
  impact  on  its  results of operations.  While  management  cannot
  predict  the  ultimate  outcome of these  proceedings,  management
  believes   that  WTU's  deferred  accounting  will  be  ultimately
  sustained  by  the Texas Commission on the basis of the  financial
  integrity  standard set forth by the Supreme Court  of  Texas,  so
  that there will be no material adverse effect on WTU's results  of
  operations or financial condition.
  
  FERC Order
  On April 4, 1994, the FERC issued an order pursuant to section 211
  of  the  Federal Power Act forcing a regional utility to  transmit
  power  to Tex-La on behalf of WTU.  The order was one of the first
  issued by FERC under that provision, which was added by the Energy
  Policy Act to increase competition in wholesale power markets.  On
  December  1, 1994, the FERC issued an order requiring  a  regional
  utility  to provide this transmission service at a cost which  was
  acceptable  to  Tex-La.  The FERC also ordered the  same  regional
  utility  to enter into an interconnection and remote control  area
  load  agreement  with  WTU  within 30 days.   This  agreement  was
  executed  on  January  3, 1995.  On January  5,  1995,  WTU  began
  selling  92 MW of power and energy to Tex-La.  Tex-La has  a  peak
  requirement of approximately 120 MWs.  WTU will serve Tex-La until
  facilities  are  completed to connect Tex-La to SWEPCO,  at  which
  time  SWEPCO will provide 85 MW and WTU will retain 35 MW  of  the
  Tex-La electric load.
  
  Other
  WTU  is party to various other legal claims, actions and complaints
  arising  in  the  normal course of business.  Management  does  not
  expect  disposition  of these matters to have  a  material  adverse
  effect on WTU's results of operations or financial condition.

10.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
  Construction
  It is estimated that WTU will spend approximately $37 million in
  construction expenditures during 1995.   Substantial commitments
  have been made in connection with this capital expenditure
  program.

  Fuel
  To  supply a portion of its fuel requirements WTU has entered  into
  various  commitments  for  the procurement  of  fuel.   WTU  has  a
  sale/leaseback agreement with Transok, an affiliated  company,  for
  full  capacity use of a natural gas pipeline to WTU's  Ft.  Phantom
  generating  plant.   The  lease agreement also  provides  for  full
  capacity  use of Transok's natural gas pipelines serving WTU's  San
  Angelo  and Oak Creek generating plants.  The initial terms of  the
  agreement are for twelve years with renewable options thereafter.

  The  following  unaudited quarterly information  includes,  in  the
  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments  necessary  for  a  fair

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To  the  Stockholders and Board of Directors of West Texas Utilities
Company:

      We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements
of   capitalization  of  West  Texas  Utilities  Company  (a   Texas
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central and South  West
Corporation)   as  of December 31, 1994 and 1993,  and  the  related
statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for  each  of
the  three  years  in  the period ended December  31,  1994.   These
financial  statements  are the responsibility of  WTU's  management.
Our  responsibility  is  to express an opinion  on  these  financial
statements based on our audits.

      We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing  standards.   Those standards  require  that  we  plan  and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the
financial  statements are free of material misstatement.   An  audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing  the accounting principles used and significant  estimates
made  by  management,  as well as evaluating the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.   We believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our  opinion, the financial statements referred  to  above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position  of
West Texas Utilities Company  as of December 31, 1994 and 1993,  and
the  results  of its operations and its cash flows for each  of  the
three  years  in the period ended December 31, 1994,  in  conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

      In  1993,  as discussed in NOTE 1, WTU changed its methods  of
accounting for unbilled revenues, postretirement benefits other than
pensions, income taxes and postemployment benefits.

      Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion  on
the  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole.   The  supplemental
Schedule  II and Exhibit 12 are presented for purposes of  complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part
of  the basic financial statements.  This schedule and exhibit  have
been  subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits  of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly state  in
all  material respects the financial data required to be  set  forth
therein  in  relation to the basic financial statements taken  as  a
whole.

Report of Management

      Management  is responsible for the preparation,  integrity  and
objectivity  of  the  financial statements of  West  Texas  Utilities
Company as well as other information contained in this Annual Report.
The  financial  statements  have been  prepared  in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting principles applied  on  a  consistent
basis and, in some cases, reflect amounts based on the best estimates
and judgments of management, giving due consideration to materiality.
Financial  information contained elsewhere in this Annual  Report  is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

      The   financial statements have been audited by the independent
accounting  firm,  Arthur Andersen LLP, which was given  unrestricted
access  to all financial records and related data, including  minutes
of   all  meetings  of  shareholders,  the  board  of  directors  and
committees of the board.  WTU believes that representations  made  to
the   independent  auditors  during  their  audit  were   valid   and
appropriate.   Arthur  Andersen  LLP's  audit  report  is   presented
elsewhere in this report.

       WTU  maintains  a  system  of  internal  controls  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  that transactions are executed  in  accordance
with  management's authorization, that the financial  statements  are
prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and that the assets of the companies are properly safeguarded against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The system  includes  a
documented  organizational structure and division of  responsibility,
established  policies and procedures including a  policy  on  ethical
standards which provides that WTU will maintain the highest legal and
ethical   standards,   and  the  careful  selection,   training   and
development of our employees.

      Internal auditors continuously monitor the effectiveness of the
internal  control  system  following  standards  established  by  the
Institute  of Internal Auditors.  Actions are taken by management  to
respond to deficiencies as they are identified.  The board, operating
through its audit committee, which is comprised entirely of directors
who  are not officers or employees of WTU provides oversight  to  the
financial reporting process.

     Due to the inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal
controls,  no internal control system can provide absolute  assurance
that  errors will not occur.  However, management strives to maintain
a  balance,  recognizing that the cost of such a  system  should  not
exceed the benefits derived.

      WTU   believes  that, in all material respects, its  system  of
internal  controls over financial reporting and over safeguarding  of
assets   against   unauthorized  acquisition,  use   or   disposition
functioned effectively during 1994.

  three-year  performance measurement period,  two  years  now  remain
  until maturation.

      Payouts  of  the  awards are contingent upon CSW  achieving  a
specified  level  of total stockholder return, relative  to  a  peer
group of utility companies, for the three-year period, or cycle, and
exceeding  a  certain defined minimum threshold.  Total  stockholder
return  is  calculated by dividing (i) the sum of (a) the cumulative
amount  of  dividends per share for the three-year period,  assuming
full  dividend reinvestment, and (b) the change in share price  over
the  three-year period, by (ii) the share price at the beginning  of
the  three-year period.  If the Named Executive Officer's employment
is  terminated  during the performance period for any  reason  other
than  death, total and permanent disability or retirement, then  the
award is canceled.  The first awards under LTIP were established  in
1992   for   a   three-year  cycle  through  1994.   The   Executive
Compensation Committee is scheduled to evaluate cycle I  performance
under the LTIP in March, 1995.

     The LTIP contains a provision accelerating awards upon a change
in  control of CSW.  If a change in control of CSW occurs,  (i)  all
options  and  SARs become fully exercisable, (ii) all  restrictions,
terms  and conditions applicable to all restricted stock are  deemed
lapsed  and satisfied and all performance units are deemed  to  have
been  fully earned, as of the date of the change in control.  Awards
which have been granted and outstanding for less than six months  as
of the date of change in control are not then exercisable, vested or
earned  on  an accelerated basis.  The LTIP also contains provisions
designed   to   prevent  circumvention  of  the  above  acceleration
provisions  generally  through coerced termination  of  an  employee
prior to the change in control of CSW.

      Executive  officers are eligible to participate  in  the  tax-
qualified  CSW Pension Plan like other employees of the registrants.
Certain  executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers,
are  also eligible to participate in the SERP, a non-qualified ERISA
excess  benefit plan.  Such pension benefits depend  upon  years  of
credited   service,  age  at  retirement  and  amount   of   covered
compensation earned by a participant.  The annual normal  retirement
benefits  payable under the pension and the SERP are based on  1.67%
of  "Average  Compensation" times the number of  years  of  credited
service, reduced by (i) no more than 50% of a participant's  age  62
or  later  Social  Security benefit and (ii)  certain  other  offset
benefits.

      "Average  Compensation" is the covered  compensation  for  the
plans and equals the average annual compensation, reported as salary

<PAGE> 3-16
in  the Summary Compensation Table, during the 36 consecutive months
of  highest  pay  during the 120 months prior  to  retirement.   The
combined  benefit levels in the table above, which include both  the
pension  and SERP benefits, are based on retirement at age  65,  the
years  of  credited service shown, continued existence of the  plans
without substantial change and payment in the form of a single  life
annuity.

      Respective years of credited service and ages, as of  December
31, 1994, for the Named Executive Officers are as follows:

         The Corporation shall maintain its principal office  in
Corpus  Christi, Texas, and may maintain offices at  such  other
places within or without the state as the Board of Directors may
from time to time appoint.


                           ARTICLE II

                              SEAL


         The  corporate  seal  of  the  Corporation  shall  have
inscribed  thereon  the name of the Corporation  and  the  words
"Incorporated 1945 Texas", and such seal may be facsimile.


                           ARTICLE III

                       STOCK AND TRANSFERS


        Section 1.  Each holder of fully paid shares of stock of
the   Corporation  shall  be  entitled  to  a   certificate   or
certificates representing such shares, certifying the number  of
shares owned by the shareholder and the designation of the class
of  stock  (and  series, if any) in which issued  and  otherwise
complying with any applicable law.  All such certificates  shall
be  signed  by  the  President or a Vice President  and  by  the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and shall
be  sealed  with  the  corporate seal of the  Corporation  or  a
facsimile  thereof.  The  signature of  the  President  or  Vice
President  and/or  the Secretary or Assistant Secretary  of  the
Corporation  upon any such certificate may be facsimile  if  the
certificate  is countersigned by a transfer agent or  registered
by  a  registrar, either of which is other than the  Corporation
itself or an employee of the Corporation, duly appointed by  the
Board of Directors.  In case any one or more of such officers of
the  Corporation who has signed or whose facsimile signature  or

<PAGE> 2
signatures have been placed or impressed or reproduced upon  any
such  certificate  shall  have ceased  to  be  such  officer  or
officers  of  the Corporation before such certificate  shall  be
actually issued, such certificate may be issued and delivered by
the  Corporation with the same effect as if he or they were such
officer or officers at the date of such issuance.

         Section 2.  Shares of stock may be transferred  in  the
manner provided by law; and the Corporation, by its officers  or
agents  appointed for that purpose, shall record upon the  books
of  the Corporation a transfer of its shares upon receipt  of  a
written  assignment  thereof, signed by the shareholder  or  his
legal  representatives and accompanied by the surrender  of  the
certificate representing the shares of stock so transferred.  No
transfer  shall affect the right of the Corporation to  pay  any
dividend due upon the stock or to treat the holder of record  as
the  holder  in fact until such transfer has been recorded  upon
the books of the Corporation or until a new certificate has been
issued  to  the person to whom it has been transferred.   If  an
outstanding  certificate of stock shall be lost,  destroyed,  or
stolen,  the  holder  thereof may have a  new  certificate  upon
producing  evidence, satisfactory to the Board of Directors,  of
such  loss,  destruction, or theft, and upon furnishing  to  the
Corporation a bond of indemnity, deemed sufficient by the  Board
of  Directors, to protect the Corporation against  claims  under
the outstanding certificate.

         Section 3.  The stock transfer books of the Corporation
may  be  closed  from time to time, by order  of  the  Board  of
Directors, for a stated period not to exceed, in any case, fifty
(50)  days, for the purpose of determining shareholders  of  the
Corporation entitled to notice of or to vote at any  meeting  of
shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to  receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination  of
shareholders  for  any other proper purpose, provided,  however,
that if the stock transfer books shall be closed for the purpose
of  determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a  meeting  of shareholders, such books shall be closed  for  at
least ten (10) days immediately preceding such meeting.  In lieu
of  closing the stock transfer books as aforesaid, the Board  of
Directors  may from time to time fix in advance a  date  as  the
record  date  for  any such determination of shareholders,  such
date  in  any case to be not more than fifty (50) days,  and  in
case  of a meeting of shareholders not less than ten (10)  days,
prior to the date on which the particular action requiring  such
determination  of  shareholders is  to  be  taken.   Whenever  a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders  has  been  made,  as  hereinabove  provided,  such
determination  shall  apply to any adjournment  thereof,  except
where the determination has been made through the closing of the
stock  transfer  books  and the stated  period  of  closing  has
expired.  If the stock transfer books shall not have been closed
and  no  record date shall have been fixed for the determination
of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment  of  a
dividend,  as hereinabove provided, the date on which notice  of
the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board  of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted,  as  the

<PAGE> 3
case may be, shall be the record date for such determination  of
shareholders.
                                
                           ARTICLE IV

                    MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS


        Section 1.  The annual meeting of the shareholders shall
be  held on the second Thursday in April of each year, if not  a
legal  holiday,  and  if  a  legal  holiday,  then  on  the  day
following,  at  the hour of 9 o'clock a.m. for the  election  of
directors and for the transaction of such other business as  may
come before it. Such meeting shall be held at the office of  the
Corporation  in  Corpus  Christi, Texas.   In  case  the  annual
meeting  shall not be duly called and held, the Secretary  shall
cause  a special meeting in lieu of and for the purpose of  such
annual meeting and all proceedings at such special meeting shall
have the same force and effect as at an annual meeting.

         Section 2.  Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called  by  the  Chairman, if there shall  be  one,  or  by  the
President or by a majority of the directors and shall be  called
by  the  Secretary  upon written application of  three  or  more
shareholders who are entitled to vote and who hold at least one-
tenth  part  in interest of the shares entitled to vote  at  the
meeting,  which  application shall state the  time,  place,  and
purpose  of  the  meeting, or in such other  manner  as  may  be
provided  in  Article VI of the Articles of  Incorporation  with
Amendments  of the Corporation, or as may from time to  time  be
provided by statute.

         Section  3.  A written notice, stating the place,  day,
and  hour  of the annual meeting shall be given by the Secretary
at  least  ten  days  and not more than fifty  days  before  the
meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat and to each
shareholder  who,  under  the  Articles  of  Incorporation  with
Amendments  or under the Bylaws, is entitled to such notice,  by
delivering such notice to him or by mailing it, postage prepaid,
and  addressed to such shareholder at his address as it  appears
on  the books of the Corporation.  Like notice shall be given of
all special meetings, except in cases where other special method
of  notice  may be required by statute, in all which  cases  the
statutory  method shall be followed. Notices of all meetings  of
shareholders shall state the purposes for which the meetings are
called.   Notice  of  meetings may in all  cases  be  waived  by
shareholders entitled to notice.

         Section 4.  At all meetings of shareholders, except  as
otherwise  provided  in  the  Articles  of  Incorporation   with
Amendments of the Corporation, a representation of the  majority
of  the  number of shares of stock outstanding and  entitled  to
vote  shall  be  necessary  to  constitute  a  quorum  for   the
transaction  of  any business, other than (a)  adjournment  from
time to time until a quorum shall be obtained, or (b) adjourning
sine  die,  and  for  any such adjournment a  majority  vote  of
whatever stock shall be represented shall be sufficient.

<PAGE> 4
         Section  5.  At all shareholders' meetings,  except  as
otherwise  provided  in  the  Articles  of  Incorporation   with
Amendments  of the Corporation, holders of record of stock  then
having voting power shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of stock held by them, respectively, upon any question or at any
election,  and such vote may, in all cases, be given  by  proxy,
duly  authorized in writing, and the vote of the  holders  of  a
majority  of  the shares entitled to vote and represented  at  a
meeting  at  which a quorum is present shall be the act  of  the
shareholders unless the vote of a greater number is required  by
law, the Articles of Incorporation with Amendments, or Bylaws.


                            ARTICLE V

                            DIRECTORS


         Section 1.  The property, business, and affairs of  the
Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors which shall
consist  of  that number of directors, not less than  three,  as
shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or by
the  shareholders at the annual or a special meeting;  provided,
however, that no decrease in the number of directors shall  have
the  effect  of  shortening the term of an  incumbent  director.
Such  directors shall be elected by the shareholders, by ballot,
at the annual meeting of shareholders, by vote of the holders of
a  majority  of  the  total number of shares  of  stock  of  the
Corporation  outstanding and entitled to vote  at  the  meeting,
present in person or represented by proxy; and each director  so
elected shall hold office until the next ensuing annual election
of  directors and until his successor shall be duly elected  and
qualified,  unless  sooner displaced in the manner  provided  by
law.   The  term  of  any director who is  an  employee  of  the
Corporation  (other than a President who retires)  shall  expire
concurrently with the termination of service of that director as
such  an  employee.  Directors need not be shareholders  of  the
Corporation.

          Section  2.   Vacancies  occurring  in  the  Board  of
Directors,  and newly created directorships resulting  from  any
increase  in  the  authorized  number  of  directors  determined
pursuant  to the Bylaws, may be filled by vote of a majority  of
the  directors then in office, though less than a quorum, unless
otherwise  provided  in  the  Articles  of  Incorporation   with
Amendments or by statute.  A director elected to fill a  vacancy
shall  be  elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor  in
office.  A directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in
the number of directors shall be for a term of office continuing
only  until  the next election of one or more directors  by  the
shareholders; provided that the board of directors may not  fill
more  than two such directorships during the period between  any
two   successive   annual  meetings  of  shareholders.    Unless
otherwise  provided  in  the  Articles  of  Incorporation   with
Amendments  or  by  statute, when one or  more  directors  shall
resign from the Board, effective at a future date, a majority of
the  remaining  directors then in office,  though  less  than  a
quorum  of said Board, shall have the power to fill such vacancy
or  vacancies,  the  vote  thereon  to  take  effect  when  such

<PAGE> 5
resignation  or  resignations shall become effective;  and  each
director so chosen shall hold office as herein provided for  the
filling of other vacancies.

        Section 3.  The Board of Directors may hold its meetings
and  may have one or more offices, and may keep the books of the
Corporation  (except such records and books as by  the  laws  of
Texas  are  required to be kept within that  state)  outside  of
Texas,  at  such places as they may from time to time determine.
In  addition  to  the  powers and authorities  by  these  Bylaws
expressly conferred upon them, the Board may exercise  all  such
powers  of  the  Corporation, and do all such  lawful  acts  and
things  as  are  not  by  law or by the Bylaws  required  to  be
exercised or done by the shareholders.

         Section  4.   Without prejudice to the  general  powers
conferred  by the last preceding clause, it is hereby  expressly
declared  that  the Board of Directors shall have the  following
powers, that is to say:

        1.   From  time  to  time to make and change  rules  and
    regulations,  not inconsistent with these  Bylaws,  for  the
    management of the Corporation's business and affairs.
    
        2.   From time to time, as and when and upon such  terms
    and conditions as it may determine, to issue any part of the
    authorized capital stock of the Corporation.
    
         3.    To   purchase,  or  otherwise  acquire  for   the
    Corporation,  any  property, right, or privilege  which  the
    Corporation  is  authorized to  acquire  at  such  price  or
    consideration, and generally on such terms or conditions  as
    it shall think fit.
    
         4.  At its discretion, to pay for any property or rights
    acquired by the Corporation,  either  wholly or  partly,  in
    money,  stock, bonds, debentures or other securities of  the
    Corporation.
    
         5.   To  borrow  money,  to  create,  make,  and  issue
    mortgages,  bonds,  deeds  of trust,  trust  agreements  and
    negotiable   or  transferable  instruments  and  securities,
    secured by mortgage or otherwise, and to do every other  act
    and  thing  necessary to effectuate the  same,  but  subject
    always  to  all  requirements of law, as to the  consent  or
    authorization  of  shareholders  or  otherwise,  in  respect
    thereof.
    
        6.  To remove or suspend, at its discretion, any and all
    officers, employees, and agents, permanently or temporarily,
    as it may think fit, and to determine and fix, and from time
    to  time change their duties, salaries, and emoluments,  and
    to require security in such instances and in such amounts as
    it thinks fit.

        7.   To  confer  by  resolution upon  any  committee  or
    officer of the Corporation, the power to choose, remove,  or
    suspend subordinate officers, employees, and agents.
    
        8.   To appoint any person or Corporation to accept  and
    hold in trust for the Corporation any property belonging  to
    the  Corporation, or in which it is interested, or  for  any
    other  purpose,  and to execute and do all  such  deeds  and
    things as may be requisite in relation to any such trust.
    
         9.   To  determine  who  shall  be  authorized  on  the
    Corporation's   behalf  to  sign  bills,  notes,   receipts,
    acceptances, endorsements, checks, drafts, bonds, mortgages,
    releases, contracts, and other papers and documents, subject
    always to any requirements of law in respect thereof.

         10.  To delegate, to the extent permitted from time  to
    time by the laws of the State of Texas, any of the power  of
    the  Board  in  the course of the current  business  of  the
    Corporation to any standing or special committee, or to  any
    officer,  or  agent, or to appoint any  persons  to  be  the
    agents  of  the Corporation with such powers (including  the
    powers  to  sub-delegate) and upon such terms  as  it  shall
    think fit.
    
    
                           ARTICLE VI

                      MEETINGS OF THE BOARD


         Section  1.  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors
of  the Corporation shall be held at such place and time as  may
be  designated from time to time by the Board.  Special meetings
of  the  Board may be called by the Chairman, if there shall  be
one, or by the President, or by a Vice President when acting  as
President, or by any two directors, upon not less than two days'
notice  to  each director, either personally, by  telephone,  by
telegraph or by mail.  Notice of any meeting of the Board may be
waived  in  writing by any director, either before or after  the
meeting,  and  shall  be  deemed to  have  been  waived  by  his
attendance at such meeting.

         Section  2.   A  majority of the authorized  number  of
directors  determined pursuant to the Bylaws shall constitute  a
quorum  for  the transaction of business at any meeting  of  the
Board of Directors, but a lesser number may adjourn from time to
time until a quorum shall be obtained or may adjourn sine die.


         Section  3.   The act of the majority of the  directors
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall  be  the

<PAGE> 7
act of the Board of Directors unless the act of a greater number
is  required by the Articles of Incorporation or the  Bylaws  or
law.   The  Board shall keep minutes of the proceedings  at  its
meetings.

         Section  4.   Directors, as such,  shall  receive  such
compensation and expenses of attendance, if any, as may be fixed
or allowed by resolution of the Board.  Nothing herein contained
shall  be  construed to preclude any director from  serving  the
Corporation  in  any  other capacity and receiving  compensation
therefor.

                           ARTICLE VII
                                
                            OFFICERS


         Section  1.   There shall be elected by  the  Board  of
Directors, at its first meeting (if practicable) held after  the
annual  election of directors in each year, a President, one  or
more  Vice  Presidents, a Secretary, a Treasurer, a  Controller,
and,  if  desired, one or more Assistant Secretaries,  Assistant
Treasurers,  and  Assistant Controllers.   The  Board  may  also
provide  for  and elect at any time, a Chairman and  such  other
officers,  and prescribe such duties for them, respectively,  as
in  the judgment of the Board may be required from time to  time
to  conduct  the business of the Corporation.  Any two  or  more
offices,  except  the offices of President and  Vice  President,
President and Secretary, and Chairman and any other office,  may
be  held  by the same person.  All officers elected or appointed
by  the Board shall hold their respective offices, unless sooner
removed,  until  the first meeting of the Board held  after  the
next  ensuing  annual  election of  directors  and  until  their
respective  successors, willing to serve, shall have  been  duly
elected or appointed and qualified.  Any of such officers may be
removed  from  their respective offices at the pleasure  of  the
Board.

        Section 2.  The Chairman of the Board, if there shall be

be prescribed by these Bylaws or by the Board of Directors.

         Section  3.  The President shall be the chief executive
officer  of the Company and have general authority over  all  of

direction of the Board of Directors.  He shall have general  and
active  management of the business and affairs of  the  Company,

execute  bonds,  mortgages, contracts and other  instruments  on
behalf   of   the  Company,  except  those  required   by   law,
governmental regulations, or indentures and other agreements  of
the  Company  to be otherwise signed and executed  or  expressly
required by the Board of Directors to be executed by some  other
officer  or agent of the Company.  He may suspend the  authority

<PAGE> 8
of  any  other  officer  or officers of  the  Company,  subject,
however,  to the pleasure of the Board of Directors at its  next
meeting.   He shall have authority to appoint and to remove  and
discharge  any and all agents and employees of the  Company  not
elected or appointed directly by the Board of Directors.  In any
absence  of  a Chairman of the Board he shall, if present,  have

the  office of President requiring attention, or in case of  his
death,  resignation,  or  removal from office,  the  powers  and
duties  of the President shall, except as the Board of Directors
may  otherwise  provide, temporarily devolve  upon  the  highest
ranking Vice President able to serve, and shall be exercised  by
such Vice President as acting President during such inability of
the  President, or until the vacancy in the office of  President
shall  be  filled.   In case of the absence, disability,  death,
resignation,  or  removal from office of the President  and  the
Vice  President, the Board of Directors shall elect one  of  its
members  to  exercise  the powers and duties  of  the  President
during  such absence or disability, or until the vacancy in  one
of said offices shall be filled.

President, or by a Vice President when acting as President.   He
shall  also have charge of the safekeeping of all stocks, bonds,
mortgages  and  other securities belonging to  the  Corporation,

powers  and duties as are commonly incidental to the  office  of
Treasurer, or as may be prescribed for him.  He may be  required
to  give  bond to the Corporation for the faithful discharge  of
his duties in such form and to such amount and with sureties  as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

         Section 7.  The Controller shall be responsible for the
installation  and supervision of all accounting records  of  the

                           COMMITTEES
                                
        Section 1.  The Board of Directors may from time to time

directors, each committee to have such powers, permitted by law,
as the Board may determine.

        Section 2.  Meetings of a committee may be called by the
chairman  of  the committee, by any two members of  a  committee
consisting  of  two or more members, by any  sole  member  of  a
committee  or  by  the  President.   Notice  of  each  committee
meeting,  stating the date, hour and place at which it  will  be
held, shall be given to each member of the committee personally,
by  telephone, by telegraph or by mail, at least two days before
the  day  of  such  meeting.  A majority of  the  members  of  a
committee  shall  constitute a quorum  for  the  transaction  of

         Section  4.   Notice  to a director  of  any  committee
meeting may be waived in writing by such director, either before

                      NOMINATING COMMITTEE


        a.  The  Nominating Committee of the Central  Power  and
    Light  Company Board of Directors shall be composed  of  all
    directors  who  are  not presently or formerly  officers  or
    employees of the Company or its affiliates, except that  the
    Chief  Executive  Officer of the  Company  shall  be  an  ex
    officio member of the Committee.
    
        b.  The Nominating Committee shall:

        1.   Seek  out  and recommend to the Board of  Directors
    qualified  candidates for election to the Board when,  under
    Article V of the Bylaws of the Company, a vacancy exists  or
    a new directorship is created;
    
         2.  Have and exercise all other powers as it shall deem
    necessary for the performance of its duties.


                           ARTICLE IX
                                
                         INDEMNIFICATION


         Section 1.  The Corporation shall indemnify any  person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened,  pending  or completed action, suit  or  proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative  (other
than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason
of  the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the  Corporation  or  is or was serving at the  request  of  the
Corporation  as  a  director or officer of another  corporation,
joint  venture,  trust  or  other enterprise,  against  expenses
(including  attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts  paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection  with such action, suit or proceeding if such  person
acted  in  good  faith  and in a manner  he  or  she  reasonably
believed  to be in or not opposed to the best interests  of  the
Corporation  and  is not determined by the Board  to  have  been
guilty  of misconduct in the performance of his or her  duty  to
the  Corporation.  Provided, however, that no  person  shall  be
indemnified for amounts paid in settlement, unless the terms and
conditions  of  such settlement have been consented  to  by  the
Corporation.  And  further provided that  with  respect  to  any
criminal  action  or proceeding, such person had  no  reasonable
cause  to  believe  that his or her conduct  was  unlawful.  The
termination  of  any  action, suit or  proceeding  by  judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or
she  reasonably  believed to be in or not opposed  to  the  best
interests  of the Corporation and, with respect to any  criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that  such

<PAGE> 12
conduct  was  unlawful;  provided, however,  that  no  indemnity
prohibited by law shall be made.

         Section 2.  The Corporation shall indemnify any  person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened,  pending or completed action or suit by  or  in  the
right  of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor  by
reason  of  the  fact that such person is or was a  director  or
officer  of the Corporation or is or was serving at the  request
of   the  Corporation  as  a  director  or  officer  of  another
corporation,  joint venture, trust or other enterprise,  against
expenses  (including  attorneys' fees) actually  and  reasonably
incurred  by  such  person in connection  with  the  defense  or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted  in  good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in  or
not  opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.  Provided
that  no indemnification shall be made in respect of any  claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged
to  be  liable for misconduct in the performance of his  or  her
duty  to  the Corporation unless and only to the extent  that  a
District Court of the State of Texas or the court in which  such
action  or  suit  was brought shall determine  upon  application
that,  despite the adjudication of liability but in view of  all
the  circumstances  of  the  case, such  person  is  fairly  and
reasonably  entitled to indemnity for such  expenses  which  the
Court  of  Chancery or such other court shall deem  proper;  and
further  provided that no indemnity prohibited by law  shall  be
made.

         Section 3.  The Corporation may indemnify, to the  same
extent  as  hereinabove provided, any person who is  or  was  an
employee  or agent of the Corporation, or is or was  serving  at
the  request  of  the  Corporation as an employee  or  agent  of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or  other
enterprise.  Any indemnification under this Section 3  shall  be
made  only  upon  the authorization of the Board  of  Directors,
which  may  occur at any time prior to, during, or  after  final
judgment  or order, in any action, suit or proceeding  to  which
such person is or is threatened to be made a party.  No right to
such indemnification is created by this Section 3.

         Section 4.  Any indemnification under Sections 1, 2 and
3  (unless  ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation
only  as  authorized in the specific case upon  a  determination
that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent
is  proper in the circumstances because such person has met  the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections  1  and  2.
Such  determination shall be made (i) by the Board of  Directors
by  majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors  who  were
not  parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such
a   quorum  is  not  obtainable,  or,  even  if  obtainable,  by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, if a  quorum  of
disinterested   directors   so  directs,   or   (iii)   by   the
stockholders.

         Section 5.  Expenses incurred by an officer or director
in  defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may
be  paid  by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition
of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of
Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by
or  on behalf of such director, or officer, to repay such amount

<PAGE> 13
unless  it  shall ultimately be determined that such  person  is
entitled  to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized  in
this  Article.   Such expenses incurred by other  employees  and
agents   with  respect  to  which  indemnification  is   claimed
hereunder  may also be advanced upon such terms and  conditions,
if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

         Section 6.  The Corporation may, as authorized  by  the
Board of Directors, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any  person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of  the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of  the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation,   partnership,  joint  venture,  trust   or   other
enterprise,  against any liability asserted against such  person
and  incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out
of  this  status  as such, whether or not the Corporation  would
have  the  power to indemnify such person against such liability
under the provisions of this Article.

         Section  7.  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
arising  under  the Securities Act of 1933 may be  permitted  to
directors,  officers and controlling persons of the  Corporation
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article or the laws
of   the   State   of  Texas,  in  the  event  any   claim   for
indemnification  against such liabilities (other  than  for  the
payment  by  the  Corporation of expenses, including  attorneys'
fees, actually and reasonably incurred by a director, officer or
controlling person of the Corporation in the successful  defense
of  any  action,  suit  or proceeding) is asserted  against  the
Corporation by such director, officer or controlling  person  in
connection  with  the  registration of any  security  under  the
Securities  Act  of 1933, the Corporation will,  unless  in  the
opinion   of  its  counsel  the  matter  has  been  settled   by
controlling   precedent,   submit  to   court   of   appropriate
jurisdiction  the question whether such indemnification  by  the
Corporation  is  against  public  policy  as  expressed  by  the
Securities  Act  of  1933  and will be  governed  by  the  final
adjudication of such issue.

         Section 8.  Each person who is or was or had agreed  to
become   a   Director,  officer,  employee  or  agent   of   the
Corporation,  or each such person who is or was serving  or  had
agreed to serve at the request of the Board of Directors  or  an
officer  of  the  Corporation as an employee  or  agent  of  the
Corporation  or  as a Director, officer, employee  or  agent  of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or  other
enterprise  (including the heirs, executors,  administrators  or
estate of such person), shall be indemnified (including, without
limitation, the advancement of expenses and payment of all loss,
liability  and expenses) by the Corporation to the  full  extent
permitted  by  the Texas Business Corporation Act or  any  other
applicable  laws as presently in effect or as may  hereafter  be
amended  (but  in the case of any such amendment,  only  to  the
extent  that such amendment permits the Corporation  to  provide
broader  indemnification  rights than said  laws  permitted  the
Corporation  to  provide  prior  to  such  amendment);  provided
however, that no person shall be indemnified for amounts paid in
settlement  unless the terms and conditions of  such  settlement
have  been consented to by the Corporation and provided  further
than   no  indemnification  for  employees  or  agents  of   the
Corporation  (other than Directors and officers)  will  be  made

<PAGE> 14
without the express authorization of the Corporation's Board  of
Directors.

such  as may by statute be specifically open to inspection),  or
any  of  them,  shall be open to inspection by the shareholders,

                           BYLAWS OF

               PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA

                  AS AMENDED AT APRIL 21, 1992




                           ARTICLE I

                      STOCK AND TRANSFERS


SECTION 1.  Each holder of fully paid stock shall be entitled  to
a  certificate  or certificates of stock stating  the  number  of
shares  owned  by  such stockholder.  All certificates  of  stock
shall  be signed by the President or a Vice President and by  the
Secretary  or  an Assistant Secretary and sealed with  the  seal,
which may be facsimile, of the Company and shall be countersigned
by  a  Transfer  Agent appointed by the Board of Directors.   All
certificates  of Preferred Stock shall also be countersigned  and
registered  by a Registrar, appointed by the Board of  Directors,
and  the  signatures of the President or Vice President  and  the
Secretary  or  Assistant Secretary upon all such certificates  of
Preferred Stock may be facsimiles, engraved or printed.  In  case
any  officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed upon a certificate of stock shall cease to be such officer
before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be issued
by  the  Company with the same effect as if such officer had  not
ceased to be such at the date of its issue.

SECTION  2.   The capital stock of the Company shall  be  divided
into such classes, with such respective designations, preferences
and voting powers, restrictions or qualifications thereof, as are
or  shall  be  from  time to time stated  and  expressed  in  the
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, and amendments thereto.
No  holder  of shares of stock of any class of the Company  shall
have  any  preemptive or preferential rights of  subscription  or
purchase  of  any  shares of any class of stock of  the  Company,
whether  now or hereafter authorized, and any and all  shares  of
capital  stock  of  any  class of the  Company,  whether  now  or
hereafter  authorized, may, in the discretion  of  the  Board  of
Directors, be offered and sold to the holders of any one or  more
classes  of  stock of the Company to the exclusion of  any  other
class  or classes, or may be issued and disposed of from time  to
time in such manner and to such persons, whether stockholders  or
not, and for such corporate purposes as may be determined by  the
Company's  Board of Directors and without first being offered  to
stockholders.

SECTION  3.   Shares of stock shall be transferable only  on  the
books of the Company, and, except as hereinafter provided, or  as
may  be  required  by  law, or by order  of  court  in  a  proper
proceeding, shall be transferred only upon the proper  assignment
and  surrender  of  the  certificates  issued  therefor.   If  an
outstanding  certificate of stock shall  be  lost,  destroyed  or
stolen,  the  holder  thereof may have  a  new  certificate  upon
producing  evidence, satisfactory to the Board of  Directors,  of
such  loss,  destruction  or theft, and upon  furnishing  to  the
Company  a bond of indemnity, deemed sufficient by the  Board  of
Directors,  to  protect  the Company  against  claims  under  the
outstanding certificate.


<PAGE> 2
SECTION  4.   The Board of Directors shall have power  to  fix  a
time,  not exceeding sixty days preceding the date of any meeting
of  stockholders,  or  the date fixed  for  the  payment  of  any
dividend or distribution or the date for the allotment of  rights
or  the  date when any change or conversion or exchange of shares
shall  be  made  or  go  into effect, as a record  date  for  the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice  of  and  to
vote  at such meeting or entitled to receive payments of any such
dividend, distribution, or
allotment of rights, or to exercise rights in respect to any such
change,  conversion or exchange of shares, and in such case  only
registered stockholders on the date so fixed shall be entitled to
receive  notice  of said meeting or to receive  payment  of  such
dividend,  distribution, or allotment of rights, or  to  exercise
such rights of change, conversion, or exchange of shares, as  the
case  may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares  on  the
books  of  the Company after any record date fixed as  aforesaid;
provided,  however, that the stock transfer books of the  Company
may be closed by order of the Board of Directors for a period not
exceeding  sixty  days for the purpose of holding  a  meeting  of
stockholders,  or  paying a dividend,  or  for  any  other  legal
purpose, as the Board of Directors shall deem advisable.

SECTION  5.  If default shall be made in the prompt payment  when
due  of any sum payable to the Company upon any subscription  for
stock  of the Company, and if such default shall continue  for  a
period  of thirty days, then all right under the subscription  in
and  to  the  stock subscribed for shall, upon the expiration  of
such  period, cease and determine and become and be forfeited  to
the  Company; provided that if at the expiration of such  thirty-
day period such right shall belong to the estate of the decedent,
it  may be forfeited only by resolution of the Board of Directors
declaring  forfeiture.   The Company shall,  within  thirty  days
after such forfeiture, cause such stock to be sold at private  or
public  sale, at its market value at the time of sale, and shall,
out  of  the  net  proceeds of sale and  upon  surrender  of  any
outstanding  stock subscription receipt issued  to  evidence  the
subscription,  pay  to the recorded holder of  such  receipt  the
amount  paid  on the subscription prior to forfeiture,  less  the
amount,  if  any, by which the total subscription  price  of  the
stock exceeded the net proceeds of sale.



                           ARTICLE II

                    MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS


SECTION 1.  The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be  held

the  registered office of the Company, or on such other  date  in
April  and  at such other time and place, within or  without  the
state of Oklahoma, as shall have been designated by resolution of
the  Board of Directors or by written consent of all stockholders
entitled  to vote at such meeting, and at such annual  meeting  a
Board  of Directors shall be elected and such other business  may
be  transacted  as may come before the meeting,  provided  notice
thereof, if required by statute, shall have been duly given.

SECTION 2.  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at
any  time  by the Chairman, if there shall be one, the President,
the  Board  of Directors, or by one or more stockholders  holding

SECTION  3.   Notice  of the time and place  of  each  annual  or
special  meeting of stockholders, shall be mailed to the address,

to vote at such meeting not less than ten days before the date of
the meeting, except in cases where other special method of notice
may  be  required by statute, in which cases the statutory method
shall  be followed.  The notice of a special meeting shall  state
the  purpose  of  the  meeting.  Notice of  any  meeting  of  the
stockholders may be waived by any stockholder.


SECTION  4.  Any meeting of the stockholders, whenever or however
called and held, shall be legal and its proceedings valid if  all
of the stockholders eligible under the Articles of Incorporation,
as  amended,  and the Bylaws to vote upon questions submitted  at
such  meeting are present either in person or by proxy, or  if  a
quorum  be  present in person or by proxy and  either  before  or
after  the meeting each of the stockholders entitled to vote  and
who was not present in person or by proxy at the meeting signs  a
written  waiver  of notice or a consent to the  holding  of  such
meeting or any approval of the minutes thereof.

SECTION  5.   At any stockholders' meeting, except  as  otherwise
provided  in  paragraph  (7) of Article VI  of  the  Articles  of
Incorporation,  as  amended, a majority of the stock  outstanding
eligible under the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and the
Bylaws  to  vote upon questions being submitted at  such  meeting
must  be  represented in order to constitute  a  quorum  for  the
transaction of business, but the stockholders represented at  any
meeting,  though less than a quorum, may adjourn the  meeting  to
some other day or sine die.

SECTION  6.  No notice of any adjourned meeting need be given  to
stockholders unless the adjournment be for thirty days  or  more,
in  which  case notice shall be given as of an original  meeting,
provided,  however, that at an adjourned meeting no business  may
be transacted other than that which might have been transacted at
the  original meeting unless notice thereof shall have been given
as in the case of an original meeting.

SECTION  7.  At all meetings of stockholders each share of  stock
eligible under the Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and the
Bylaws  to  vote upon questions being submitted at  such  meeting
shall  be  entitled to such vote or votes as from  time  to  time
shall  be  provided in the Article of Incorporation, as  amended,
and such stock may be voted by the holder thereof in person or by
his  duly  authorized  proxy  in  writing  duly  filed  with  the
Secretary of the Company.

SECTION 8.  The Chairman, if there shall be one, when present, or
in  his  absence  the  President of the  Company,  shall  act  as

Secretary, of each stockholders' meeting.

                          ARTICLE III

                       BOARD OF DIRECTORS


SECTION 1.  The number of directors of the Company shall be  such
number,  not less than eight nor more than fifteen, as the  Board
shall  by resolution determine from to time.  Except as otherwise
provided  in  paragraph  (7) of Article VI  of  the  Articles  of
Incorporation, as amended, the directors shall be elected at each
annual  meeting  of stockholders except that a  majority  of  the
directors at the time in office, including any director who shall
have  resigned from the Board effective at a future date,  though
less  than a quorum, may fill any vacancy occurring on the  Board
of  Directors  or any newly created directorship.  Each  director
shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting of the
stockholders and until his successor shall have been elected  and
qualified, or until his earlier resignation or removal.  The term
of  a  director  employed by the Company (other  than  the  Chief
Executive Officer upon retirement) shall expire concurrently with
the termination of such employment.

SECTION  2.   From  and  after October 28,  1987,  the  Board  of
Directors  shall not elect as a director or propose for  election

of  Directors.  Any of the above officers may be elected  by  the
Board  of  Directors at any time to fill vacancies or to  fill  a
newly  created  office.  The term "Vice President",  as  used  in

Company.   He  shall  have authority when neither  the  Board  of
Directors  nor the Executive Committee is in session  to  suspend
the  authority of any other officer or officers of  the  Company,
subject, however, to the pleasure of the Board of Directors or of
the  Executive  Committee at its next meeting, and  authority  to
appoint  and  to  remove and discharge any  and  all  agents  and

Board  of  Directors.  He shall also have such other  powers  and
duties as may at any time be prescribed by these Bylaws or by the
Board of Directors.

SECTION  3.   The Chairman of the Board shall, at his discretion,
preside  at all meetings of the stockholders and at all  meetings
of the Board of Directors.  In the absence of the Chairman of the

disability  of  the  President, or in the  event  of  his  death,
resignation, or removal from office, the powers and duties of the
President  shall  devolve  temporarily upon  the  Executive  Vice
President,  if  there  shall be one, or  if  there  shall  be  no
Executive  Vice President and only one Vice President, then  upon
such  Vice  President,  or if there shall be  no  Executive  Vice
President  and more than one Vice President, then upon such  Vice
President as shall be designated by the Chairman, if there  shall
be  one,  until  the next meeting of the Board of Directors;  and
such  Vice  President  upon whom the powers  and  duties  of  the
President  shall  devolve temporarily as herein  provided,  shall
have, exercise and perform all powers and duties of the President
during  such  absence or disability or until the vacancy  in  the

<PAGE> 8
office  of President shall be filled.  Each Vice President  shall
report  to  the  President,  or to  such  other  officer  as  the
President shall designate.

SECTION  5.   The  Secretary shall attend  all  meetings  of  the
stockholders, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee,
shall keep a true and faithful record thereof, and shall have the
custody  and care of the corporate seal, minute books  and  stock
books  of  the Company.  Except as may be otherwise  required  by
law, the Secretary shall sign and issue all notices required  for
meetings  of  stockholders,  the  Board  of  Directors  and   the
Executive Committee.  Whenever requested by the requisite  number
of stockholders or directors, the Secretary shall give notice, in
the name of the stockholders or directors making the request,  of
a  meeting  of  the stockholders, the Board of Directors  or  the
Executive  Committee, as the case may be.   The  Secretary  shall
sign  all  documents  and papers to which the  signature  of  the
Secretary may be necessary or appropriate, shall affix and attest
the  seal  of the Company to all instruments requiring the  seal,
and  shall  have  such other powers and duties  as  are  commonly
incidental to the office of secretary of a corporation or as  may
be  prescribed  by the Board of Directors or the Chief  Executive
Officer.

SECTION 6.  The Treasurer shall have charge of and be responsible
for  the  collection,  receipt, custody and disbursement  of  the
funds of the Company, and shall deposit its funds in the name  of
the  Company in such banks, trust companies or other depositories
as  the  Board of Directors may authorize.  Such funds  shall  be
subject  to  withdrawal only in such manner as may be  designated
from  time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.   The
Treasurer shall have the custody of such books and papers  as  in
the  practical  business  operations  of  the  Company  shall  be
convenient  or as shall be placed in the Treasurer's  custody  by
order  of the Board of Directors.  The Treasurer shall have  such
other  powers and duties as are commonly incidental to the office

                           ARTICLE VI

                         MISCELLANEOUS


SECTION  1.   The  corporate  seal  of  the  Company  shall  have
inscribed  thereon  the name of the Company,  between  concentric
circles,  and  the word "SEAL".  Such seal may  be  used  by  the
Company  by  causing it, or a facsimile thereof, to be imprinted,
impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

SECTION  2.  The funds of the Company shall be deposited  to  its
credit in such banks or trust companies as the Board of Directors
from time to time shall designate and shall be withdrawn only  on
checks  or drafts of the Company for the purposes of the Company.
All  checks, drafts, notes, acceptances and endorsements  of  the
Company  shall  be signed in such manner and by such  officer  or
officers  or  such  individual or individuals  as  the  Board  of
Directors  from time to time by resolution shall  determine.   If
and  to the extent so authorized by the Board of Directors,  such
signature  or signatures may be facsimile.  Only checks,  drafts,
notes,  acceptances  and endorsements signed in  accordance  with
such resolution or resolutions shall be the valid checks, drafts,
notes, acceptances or endorsements of the Company.

SECTION  3.  No debt shall be contracted, for other than  current
expenses,  unless  authorized by the Board of  Directors  or  the
Chairman,  and  no  bill shall be paid by  the  Treasurer  unless
previously  certified by the head of the department in  which  it
originated  and the Treasurer is otherwise satisfied  as  to  its
propriety  and  accuracy.  If the Treasurer is not so  satisfied,
the authority of the Chairman shall be secured before payment.

SECTION  4.   All dividends shall be declared by a  vote  of  the
Board of Directors.

SECTION 5.  The fiscal year of the company shall close at the end
of December annually.

SECTION  6.  (a)  The Corporation shall indemnify any person  who
was  or  is  a party or is threatened to be made a party  to  any
threatened,  pending  or completed action,  suit  or  proceeding,
whether  civil, criminal, administrative or investigative  (other
than  an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason
of  the fact that such person is or was a director or officer  of
the  Corporation  or  is or was serving at  the  request  of  the
Corporation  as  a  director or officer of  another  corporation,
joint  venture,  trust  or  other  enterprise,  against  expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement  actually and reasonably incurred by  such  person  in
connection  with such action, suit or proceeding if  such  person
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed
to  be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation
and  is  not  determined  by the Board to  have  been  guilty  of
misconduct  in  the  performance  of  his  or  her  duty  to  the

<PAGE> 10
Corporation.    Provided,  however,  that  no  person  shall   be
indemnified for amounts paid in settlement, unless the terms  and
conditions  of  such  settlement have been consented  to  by  the
Corporation.   And  further provided that  with  respect  to  any
criminal  action  or proceeding, such person  had  no  reasonable
cause  to  believe  that his or her conduct  was  unlawful.   The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of  nolo contendere or its
equivalent,  shall  not of itself create a presumption  that  the
person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or  she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of  the  Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action  or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such conduct was
unlawful; provided, however, that no indemnity prohibited by  law
shall be made.

(b)   The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is  a
party  or  is  threatened to be made a party to  any  threatened,
pending  or  completed action or suit by or in the right  of  the
Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason  of  the
fact  that  such  person is or was a director or officer  of  the
Corporation  or  is  or  was  serving  at  the  request  of   the
Corporation  as  a  director or officer of  another  corporation,
joint  venture,  trust  or  other  enterprise,  against  expenses
(including  attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred  by
such  person in connection with the defense or settlement of such
action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests  of  the Corporation.  Provided that no indemnification
shall  be  made in respect of any claim, issue or  matter  as  to
which  such  person shall have been adjudged  to  be  liable  for
misconduct  in  the  performance  of  his  or  her  duty  to  the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the District Court
or  the  court  in  which such action or suit was  brought  shall
determine  upon  application that, despite  the  adjudication  of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,  such
person  is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity  for  such
expenses which the District Court or such other court shall  deem
proper; and further provided that no indemnity prohibited by  law
shall be made.

(c)   The Corporation may indemnify, to the same extent as herein
above provided, any person who is or was an employee or agent  of
the  Corporation  or  is or was serving at  the  request  of  the
Corporation  as  an  employee or agent  of  another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture, trust  or  other  enterprise.   Any
indemnification under this Subsection (c) shall be made only upon
the  authorization of the Board of Directors, which may occur  at
any  time prior to, during, or after final judgment or order,  in
any  action,  suit or proceeding to which such person  is  or  is
threatened  to be made a party.  No right to such indemnification
is created by this Subsection (c).

(d)   Any  indemnification under Subsections  (a),  (b)  and  (c)
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only
as  authorized  in  the specific case upon a  determination  that
indemnification of the director, officer, employee  or  agent  is
proper  in  the  circumstances because such person  has  met  the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Subsections  (a)  and
(b).   Such  determination shall be made  (i)  by  the  Board  of
Directors  by  majority vote of a quorum consisting of  Directors
who  were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii)
if  such  a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable,  by
independent  legal counsel in a written opinion, if a  quorum  of
disinterested directors so directs, or (iii) by the stockholders.


<PAGE> 11
(e)   Expenses incurred by an officer or director in defending  a
civil  or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by  the
Corporation  in advance of the final disposition of such  action,
suit or proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the
specific  case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf  of
such  director, or officer, to repay such amount unless it  shall
ultimately  be  determined that such person  is  entitled  to  be
indemnified  by  the Corporation as authorized in  this  Section.
Such expenses incurred by other employees and agents with respect
to  which  indemnification  is  claimed  hereunder  may  also  be
advanced upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board  of
Directors deems appropriate.

(f)   The  Corporation  may,  as  authorized  by  the  Board   of
Directors,  purchase  and maintain insurance  on  behalf  of  any
person  who is or was a director, officer, employee or  agent  of
the  Corporation,  or is or was serving at  the  request  of  the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of  another
corporation,   partnership,  joint  venture,   trust   or   other
enterprise,  against any liability asserted against  such  person
and  incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising  out
of this status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
the  power to indemnify such person against such liability  under
the provisions of this Section.

(g)  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities  Act  of 1933 may be permitted to directors,  officers
and  controlling  persons  of  the Corporation  pursuant  to  the
foregoing provisions of this Section or the laws of the state  of
Oklahoma, in the event any claim for indemnification against such
liabilities  (other  than for the payment by the  Corporation  of
expenses,  including  attorneys' fees,  actually  and  reasonably
incurred  by  a  director, officer or controlling person  of  the
Corporation  in  the successful defense of any  action,  suit  or
proceeding) is asserted against the Corporation by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the registration
of any security under the Securities Act of 1933, the Corporation
will,  unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter  has  been
settled   by  controlling  precedent,  submit  to  a   court   of
appropriate  jurisdiction the question whether  such  indemnifica
tion by the Corporation is against public policy as expressed  by
the  Securities  Act of 1933 and will be governed  by  the  final
adjudication of such issue.


                          ARTICLE VII


Unless otherwise ordered by the Board of Directors, the President
shall  have  full power and authority on behalf of  the  Company,
either  in person or by proxy, at any meeting of stockholders  of
any  corporation in which the Company may hold Stock and, at  any
such  meeting, may possess and exercise all the rights and powers
incident  to  the  ownership of such Stock which,  as  the  owner
thereof,  the  Company  might  have possessed  or  exercised,  if
present.

by  a  majority  vote  of the entire Board of  Directors  at  any
regular  or  special meeting duly convened after  notice  of  the
purpose of such meeting, subject to the power of the stockholders
to  alter  or  repeal such Bylaws; provided  that  the  Board  of
Directors  shall not adopt, alter or repeal any Bylaw fixing  the
number, qualifications, classifications or terms of office of the
directors, or any of them.

                      Stock and Transfers

           Section  1.  Each holder of fully paid stock shall  be
entitled  to a certificate or certificates of stock, stating  the
number of shares owned by such stockholder and the designation of
the  class  (and  series,  if any) in which  issued.   All  stock
certificates shall be signed by the Chairman of the Company,  the
President,  or a Vice President of the Corporation, and  also  by
the  Treasurer,  the  Secretary, an Assistant  Treasurer,  or  an
Assistant  Secretary of the Corporation and shall be sealed  with
the  corporate  seal  of the Corporation or a facsimile  thereof;
provided,  that, however, if such certificates are  countersigned
by  a  Transfer  Agent  and/or registered  by  a  Registrar,  the
signature  of  any such Chairman of the Company, President,  Vice
President,   Treasurer,   Secretary,  Assistant   Treasurer,   or
Assistant Secretary may be facsimile.  Any such Transfer Agent or
Registrar  shall  be  a  person other  than  the  Corporation  or

the  Corporation who have signed or whose facsimile signature  or
signatures  have  been reproduced upon any  such  certificate  or
certificates shall have ceased to be such officer or officers  of
the  Corporation  before such certificate or  certificates  shall
have   been   issued  or  delivered  by  the  Corporation,   such

<PAGE> 2
certificate or certificates may be issued and delivered by

the Corporation with the same effect as if such former officer or
officers  remained  in office at the date  of  such  issuance  or
delivery.

          Section 2.  Shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable only on the books of the Corporation and, except (a)
as  may  be  required by law or by the order of a court  in  some
proper  proceeding, (b) as hereinafter provided, or  (c)  as  the
Board  of Directors may otherwise expressly provide by resolution
from  time to time, shall be transferred only upon the assignment
and   surrender   of  the  issued  certificate  or   certificates
representing  such shares.  Except as the Board of Directors  may
otherwise  provide by resolution from time to time, in the  event
any  issued  certificate  representing shares  of  stock  of  the
Corporation  shall  be  lost, destroyed  or  stolen,  the  holder
thereof  may have a new certificate for an equivalent  number  of
shares  of the same class issued to him in lieu of and to replace
such   lost,  destroyed  or  stolen  certificate  upon  producing
evidence,  satisfactory to the Board of Directors, of such  loss,
destruction  or  theft and upon furnishing to the  Corporation  a
bond  of  indemnity, deemed sufficient by the Board of Directors,
to  protect the Corporation against any loss, damage or liability
that may be sustained by reason of such lost, destroyed or stolen
certificate  and  the  issuance  and  delivery  of  such  new  or
replacement certificate.

           Section 3. The stock transfer books of the Corporation
may be closed by order of the Board of Directors for a period not
exceeding  fifty  days  preceding the  date  of  any  meeting  of
stockholders or the date for the payment of any dividend  or  the
date  for the allotment of rights or the date when any change  or
conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect.  In
lieu  of closing the stock transfer books as aforesaid, the Board
of  Directors is authorized, in its discretion, to fix in advance
a  date,  not  exceeding fifty days preceding  the  date  of  any
meeting  of  stockholders or the date  for  the  payment  of  any
dividend or the date for the allotment of rights or the date when
any  change or conversion or exchange of capital stock  shall  go
into  effect,  as  a  record date for the  determination  of  the
stockholders  entitled to notice of, and to  vote  at,  any  such
meeting  and  any  adjournment thereof, or  entitled  to  receive
payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights,
or  to  exercise  the  rights  in respect  of  any  such  change,
conversion  or exchange of capital stock, and in such  case  only
such  stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date
so  fixed  shall be entitled to such notice of, and to  vote  at,
such  meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive  payment
of  such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or  to
exercise  such  rights, as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any
transfer  of any stock on the books of the Corporation after  any
such record date fixed as aforesaid.

setting  forth the action so taken shall be signed by all members
of  the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, and  such
written  consent  shall  be  filed  with  the  minutes   of   the

may  be  fixed by resolution of the Board and shall be reimbursed
by  the  Corporation for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred  for

of  the  Board may be required from time to time to  conduct  the
business of the Corporation.  Any two or more offices, other than

expenses) by the Corporation to the full extent permitted by  the
General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware  or  any  other
applicable  laws as presently in effect, or as may  hereafter  be
amended  (but  in  the case of any such amendment,  only  to  the

     VI.  The total number of authorized shares of
capital stock of the corporation is 2,860,000 shares,
consisting of 60,000 shares of the par value of $100 each
and 2,800,000 shares of the par value of $22 each, and
divided into two classes, namely: (1) Preferred Stock,
consisting of 60,000 shares of the par value of $100 each
and designated "4.40% Cumulative Preferred Stock," and
(2) Common Stock, consisting of 2,800,000 shares of the
par value of $22 each.  Any increase hereafter authorized
in the total number of authorized shares of the par value
of $100 each of Preferred Stock may consist of shares having
such designation, dividend rate, redemption prices and
terms, price payable in respect thereof in the event of
the voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the corporation and provisions (if any) as to sinking
fund or conversion into other shares, as shall be
provided by the amendment to the Charter of the corporation
authorizing such increase.

     The preferences, rights, privileges and powers
and the restrictions, limitations or qualifications of
the shares of the par value of $100 each of Preferred
Stock (including the shares thereof designated "4.40%
Cumulative Preferred Stock" and the shares of all other
designations or series thereof that may be hereafter
authorized) and the rights and powers of the shares
of the par value of $22 each of Common Stock of the
corporation shall be as hereinafter set forth.


                              -3-


     The term "Preferred Stock, as hereinafter
used, except where the context otherwise indicates or
requires, shall mean and include only the shares of the
par value of $100 each of Preferred Stock, of all
designations or series, now or hereafter authorized.

     (1) The holders of shares of the Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each
share held, dividends upon the par value thereof at the
annual rate specified in the designation or series of
such share, payable quarter-yearly on the first day of
January, April, July and October in each year, when and
as declared by the Board of Directors, out of the surplus
or net profits of the corporation.  Such dividends shall
be cumulative (a) as to the shares initially issued of
any designation or series, from the date of issue or such
other date as may be provided in the resolution of the
Board of Directors authorizing the initial issue of shares
of such designation or series and (b) as to all other
shares of such designation or series, from the first day
of the dividend period in which issued, and such dividends
shall be paid, or declared and set apart for payment,
before any dividends shall be declared or paid on, or set
apart for, the Common stock, so that if, for any past
dividend period or the current dividend period, dividends
on the Preferred Stock shall not have been paid, or
declared and set apart for payment, the deficiency shall
be fully paid, or declared and funds set apart for the
payment thereof, before any dividends shall be declared
or paid on, or set apart for, the Common Stock.  No
dividend shall at any time be paid on, or set apart for,
any share of the Preferred Stock of any designation
or series unless at the same time there shall be paid
on, or set apart for, all shares of the Preferred Stock
then outstanding dividends in such amount that the
holders of all shares of the Preferred Stock shall receive,
or have set apart for them, a uniform percentage of the
full annual dividend to which they are, respectively,
entitled.  The term "dividend period", as used herein,
refers to each period of three consecutive calendar months
ending on the day next preceding the date on which
dividends, if declared, shall be payable.  The holders of
shares of the Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to
receive any dividends thereon other than the dividends at
the annual rate specified in the designation or series of
such shares.  All shares of the Preferred Stock at any time
authorized, regardless of the designation or series
thereof, shall constitute one class of stock and, excepting
only as to the designations thereof, the rates of dividends
payable thereon, the redemption prices and terms thereof,
the prices payable in respect thereof in the event of the
voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the


                             -4-


corporation and any provisions as to sinking fund or
conversion into other shares, shall be of equal rank and
confer equal rights upon the holders thereof.  All shares
of the Preferred Stock bearing the same designation at
any time outstanding shall constitute one series of Preferred
Stock; and all shares of any one designation or series of
Preferred Stock shall be alike in all respects. Whenever
full cumulative dividends as aforesaid upon the Preferred
Stock (of all designations or series) and upon any other
shares of stock having priority as to dividends over the
Common Stock, then outstanding, for all past dividend
periods and for the current dividend period shall have been
paid, or declared and set apart for payment, the Board
of Directors may declare dividends on the Common Stock of
the corporation, subject to the restrictions hereinafter
contained.

     (2) In the event of the involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the
holders of shares of the Preferred Stock then outstanding,
regardless of the designation or series thereof, shall
be entitled to be paid in full, out of the net assets
of the corporation, the par value of their shares plus
an amount equal to the accrued dividends on such shares,
and no more, before any amount shall be paid or distributed
to the holders of shares of the Common Stock.  In the
event of the voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, the holders of shares of the 4.40%
Cumulative Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled
to be said in full, out of the net assets of the corporation,
the then effective redemption price of such shares (including
an amount equal to the accrued dividends on such shares),
and no more, before any amount shall be paid or distributed
to the holders of shares of the Common Stock.  After payment
in full to the holders of all shares of the Preferred Stock
(of all designations or series) and of any other shares of
stock having priority as to assets over the Common Stock,
then outstanding, of the amounts to which they are
respectively entitled as herein provided, the remaining
assets and profits shall be divided among and paid or
distributed to the holders of shares of the Common Stock.

     (3) The corporation, on the sole authority of its
Board of Directors, shall have the right at any time or
from time to time to redeem and retire all or any part of
the Preferred Stock, or all or any part of the shares of
any one or more designations or series of the Preferred
Stock, upon and by the Payment to the holders of the shares
to be redeemed, or upon or by setting aside, as hereinafter
provided, for the benefit of such holders, the redemption
price or prices of the shares to be redeemed, which


                               -5-


redemption price in respect of shares of the 4.40% Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall be $107 per share plus accrued
dividends to the date of redemption if such date of
redemption is subsequent to March 31, 1964; provided that
not later than on the thirtieth day prior to the date fixed
for such redemption, nor earlier than on the ninetieth
day before such date of redemption, notice of the intention
of the corporation to redeem such shares, specifying the
shares to be redeemed and the date and place of redemption,
(a) shall be published in a newspaper of general circula-
tion published in the City of Abilene, Texas, and also in
a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Dallas, Texas, and in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of New York, New York, and (b) shall
be deposited in a United States post office or mail box
at any place in the United States addressed to each holder
of record of the shares to be redeemed, at his address as
the same appears upon the records of the corporation;
and provided, further, that in mailing such notice,
unintentiona1 omissions or errors in names or addresses
or other defects in such mailing shall not impair the
validity of the notice of, or the proceedings for, such
redemption.  In every case of the redemption of less than
all the outstanding shares of any particular designation
or series of the Preferred Stock, the shares of such
designation or series to be redeemed shall be chosen by
lot in such manner as may be prescribed by resolution of
the Board of Directors.  The corporation may deposit with
a bank or trust company, which shall be named in the
notice of redemption, shall be located in Abilene, Texas,
or in Dallas, Texas, or in Chicago, Illinois, and shall
then have capital, surplus and undivided profits of at
least $1,000,000, the aggregate redemption price of the
shares to be redeemed, in trust for the payment on or before
the redemption date to or upon the order of the holders
of such shares, upon surrender of the certificates for
such shares.  Such deposit in trust may, at the option
of the corporation, be upon terms whereby in case the holder
of any shares of the Preferred Stock called for redemption
shall not, within six years after the date fixed for the
redemption of such shares, claim the amount on deposit
with any bank or trust company for the payment of the
redemption price of said shares, such bank or trust company
shall, on demand, when requested by resolution of the
Board of Directors of the corporation or its successor,
pay to or upon the written order of the corporation or
its successor the amount so deposited, and thereupon such


                              -6-


bank or trust company shall-be released from any and all
further liability with respect to the payment of such
redemption price and the holder of said shares shall be
entitled to look only to the corporation or its successor
for the payment thereof.  Upon the giving of notice of
redemption and upon the deposit of the redemption price,
as aforesaid, or, if no such deposit is made, upon the
redemption date (unless the corporation defaults in making
payment of the redemption price as set forth in such notice),
such holders shall cease to be stockholders with respect
to said shares, and from and after the making of said
deposit and the giving of said notice, or, if no such
deposit is made, after the redemption date (the corporation
not having defaulted in making payment of the redemption
price as set forth in such notice), said shares shall no
longer be transferable on the books of the corporation, and
such holders shall have no interest in or claim against
the corporation with respect to said shares, but shall be
entitled only to receive said moneys on the date fixed for
redemption as aforesaid from said bank or trust company,
or from the corporation, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificates for said shares as aforesaid.
All shares of the Preferred Stock which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued.

     The term "accrued dividends", as used herein, shall
be deemed to mean, in respect of any share of the Preferred
Stock as of any given date, the amount of dividends payable
on such share, computed, at the annual dividend rate stated
in the designation or series of such share, from the date
on which dividends thereon became cumulative to and including
such given date, less the aggregate amount of all dividends
which have been paid or which have been declared and set
apart for payment on such share.  Accumulations of dividends
shall not bear interest.

     Nothing herein contained shall limit any legal right of
the corporation to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire
any shares of the Preferred Stock; provided, however, that
the corporation shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire less than all the outstanding shares of the Preferred
Stock, if, at the time of such redemption, purchase or other
acquisition, dividends payable on the Preferred Stock shall
be in default in whole or in part, unless prior to or
concurrently with such redemption, purchase or other
acquisition, all such defaults shall be cured, or unless
such redemption, purchase or other acquisition shall have
been ordered, approved or permitted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 or by any successor commission or other regulatory
authority of the United States of America then having


                               -7-


jurisdiction in the premises.  All shares of the Preferred
Stock so redeemed, purchased or acquired shall be cancelled
and retired and shall not be reissued.

     (4) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the
consent (given by vote at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders) of the record holders of at least two-thirds
of the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock then
outstanding, voting separately as a class:

          (A) create, authorize or issue any new stock
     which, after issuance, would rank prior to the
     Preferred Stock as to dividends or assets, or create,
     authorize or issue any security convertible into
     shares of any such new stock, except for the purpose
     of providing funds for the redemption of all the
     Preferred Stock then outstanding, in which case such
     new stock or security shall not be issued until such
     redemption shall have been authorized, notice of such
     redemption given and the aggregate redemption price
     deposited as provided in paragraph (3) of this
     Article VI; provided that any such new stock or
     security, the creation, authorization or issue of
     which shall have been consented to as herein provided,
     shall not be issued after the expiration of twelve
     months following the giving of such consent; or

          (B) amend, alter, change or repeal any of the
     express terms of the Preferred Stock then outstanding
     in a manner substantially prejudicial to the holders
     thereof; provided that (i) the increase or decrease
     in the authorized amount of the Preferred Stock or
     the creation, or increase or decrease in the authorized
     amount, of any new class of stock ranking on a parity
     with the Preferred Stock shall not, for the purposes
     of this subparagraph (B), be deemed to be prejudicial
     to the holders of the Preferred Stock, and (ii) if
     any such amendment, alteration, change or repeal
     would be substantially prejudicial to the holders of
     shares of one or more, but less than all, of the
     designations or series of the Preferred Stock at the
     time outstanding, the consent only of the record
     holders of at least two-thirds of the total number
     of outstanding shares of each such designation or
     series so prejudicially affected shall be required.

     (5) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the
consent (given by vote at an annual or special meeting of


                               - 8 -


stockholders) of the record holders of a majority of the
total number of shares of the Preferred Stock then outstanding,
voting separately as a class:

          (A) merge or consolidate with or into any other
     corporation or corporations or sell or otherwise
     dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of
     the corporation, unless such merger, consolidation,
     sale or other disposition, or the exchange, issuance
     or assumption of all securities to be exchanged, issued
     or assumed in connection with any such merger,
     consolidation, sale or other disposition, shall have
     been ordered, approved or permitted by the Securities
     and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility
     Holding Company Act of 1935 or by any successor
     commission or other regulatory authority of the United
     States of America then having jurisdiction in the
     premises; provided that the provisions of this
     subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a purchase or
     other acquisition by the corporation of franchises
     or assets of another corporation in any manner which
     does not involve a corporate merger or consolidation; or

          (B) issue or assume any unsecured notes, deben-
     tures or other securities representing unsecured
     indebtedness (herein called "unsecured obligations"),
     for purposes other than (i) the refunding of outstanding
     unsecured indebtedness or unsecured obligations thereto-
     fore incurred, issued or assumed by the corporation, or
     (ii) the reacquisition, redemption or other retirement
     of any indebtedness, if such transaction has been
     ordered, approved or permitted by the Securities
     and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility
     Holding Company Act of 1935 or by any successor
     commission or other regulatory authority of the
     United States of America then having jurisdiction
     in the premises, or (iii) the reacquisition, redemption
     or other retirement of all outstanding shares of the
     Preferred Stock or of stock ranking prior to or on
     a parity with the Preferred Stock,

if, immediately after such issue or assumption, the total
principal amount of unsecured obligations issued or assumed
by the corporation (including any such obligations then to
be issued or assumed), computed as hereinafter provided,
would exceed an amount equal to 10% of the sum of


                                 -9-


          (a) the total principal amount of all bonds or
     other securities representing secured indebtedness
     issued or assumed by the corporation and then to
     be outstanding, and

          (b) the aggregate amount of the capital and
     surplus of the corporation as then to be stated on
     the books of account of the corporation.

     In computing, for the purposes of this provision, the
total principal amount of unsecured obligations issued or
assumed by the corporation and outstanding or to be
outstanding as of the date of issue or assumption of any
such obligations then to be issued or assumed, there shall
be excluded, but in an amount not exceeding in the aggregate
10% of the sum of the amounts specified in clauses (a) and
(b) above, the sum of

          (x) the principal amount of all unsecured
     obligations the maturity or payment date of which
     is in excess of ten years from such date,

          (y) the principal amount of all unsecured
     obligations which had by their terms an original
     maturity in excess of ten years but which have
     become and are due and payable by their terms in
     ten years or less, but more than three years, from
     such date, or which are required to be retired,
     prior to their maturity, whether through a sinking
     fund or otherwise, in ten years or less, but more
     than three years, from such date, and

          (z) the principal amount of all unsecured
     obligations, the maturity or payment date of which
     is not later than November 1, 1982, and which had
     by their terms an original maturity not in excess
     of ten years, which principal amount is in excess of
     10% of the amount specified in clauses (a) and (b) above.

     And whenever the aggregate principal amount of unsecured
obligations outstanding at any such date, determined after
making the exclusions as above provided, shall exceed 10%
of the sum of the amounts specified in clauses (a) and (b)
above, no additional unsecured obligations shall be issued
or assumed by the corporation, except for the purposes set
forth in items (i), (ii) or (iii) above, until such aggre-
gate principal amount of outstanding unsecured obligations
shall have been reduced to 10% of the sum of the amounts
specified in clauses (a) and (b) above; or

                           -10-

     (C) issue, sell, or otherwise dispose of any shares of
the Preferred Stock (in addition to the initial issue of 60,000
shares of the Preferred Stock), or of any other class of stock
ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividends or
assets, for any purpose other than in exchange for or of effecting
the redemption or retirement of not less than an equal number
of shares of the Preferred Stock, or of stock ranking prior to
or on a parity with the Preferred Stock, then outstanding,
unless the gross income of the corporation to be available for
the payment of interest for a period of twelve full consecutive
calendar months ending within the fifteen calendar months imme-
diately preceding the issuance, sale or disposition of such stock,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practices [but in any event after deducting all taxes and
the greater of (a) the aggregate amount for said period
charged by the corporation on its books to income or
earned surplus for provision for depreciation of property,
or (b) an amount equal to 2.9% (or such other percentage
as may upon application by the corporation be approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any
successor authority, under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935) of the arithmetical average of the amount of
depreciable property of the corporation at the beginning,
and the amount thereof at the end, of such 12-month period,
in plant accounts of the corporation, with respect to which
bonds may at the time be authenticated under any indenture
securing first mortgage bonds of the corporation, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, and
provided that amounts included in plant acquisition adjustment
account, or accounts of similar purpose, shall not be
included in the amount of such property if adequate pro-
vision for the amortization of such amounts is made by
current charges to income or surplus) shall have been at
least one and one-half times the sum of (i) the annual
interest charges on all bonds, debentures, notes and other
securities representing indebtedness of the corporation,
and (ii) the annual dividend requirements on all outstand-
ing shares of the Preferred Stock and on all other classes
of stock, if any, ranking prior to or on a parity with
the Preferred Stock as to dividends or assets, including
the shares proposed to be issued; provided that there shall
be excluded from the foregoing computation interest charges
and dividend requirements on all indebtedness and shares
of stock which are to be retired in connection with the
issue of such additional shares of the Preferred Stock,
or other class of stock ranking prior to or on a parity
with the Preferred stock as to dividends or assets; and
provided, further, that in any case where such additional
shares of the Preferred Stock, or other class of stock
ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividends

                             -11-

or assets, are to be issued in connection with the ac-
quisition of additional property, the gross income of
the property to be so acquired, computed on the same
basis as the gross income of the corporation as above pro-
vided, may be included on a pro forma basis in making
the foregoing computation; or

     (D) issue, sell, or otherwise dispose of any shares of
the Preferred Stock (in addition to the initial issue of
60,000 shares of the Preferred Stock), or of any other
class of stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock
as to dividends or assets, unless the aggregate of (i)
the capital of the corporation applicable to the Common
Stock and (ii) the surplus of the corporation shall be
not less than the aggregate amount payable upon the in-
voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
corporation in respect of all shares of the Preferred
Stock and all shares of stock, if any, ranking prior to
or on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividends
or assets, which will be outstanding after the issue of
the shares proposed to be issued; provided, that if,
for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this sub-
paragraph (D) it becomes necessary to take into consideration
any earned surplus of the corporation, the corporation
shall not thereafter pay any dividends on shares of the
Common Stock which would result in reducing the corpora-
tion's Common Stock Equity (as in paragraph (6) hereinafter
defined) to an amount less than the aggregate amount
payable upon the involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the corporation in respect of all shares
of the Preferred Stock, and of any stock ranking prior to or
on a parity with the Preferred Stock as to dividends or
assets, at the time outstanding.

     No provision contained in this paragraph (5), nor in
paragraph (4) of this Article VI, is intended or shall be
construed to relieve the corporation from compliance with
any applicable statutory provision requiring the vote or
consent of the holders of a greater number of the outstanding
shares of the Preferred Stock.

     (6) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the corporation shall not declare or pay any
dividends on its Common Stock, except as follows:

          (a) if and so long as the Common Stock Equity
     on the last day of a calendar month ending within
     sixty days next preceding the date on which a dividend
     on Common Stock is proposed to be declared is, or as
     a result of the payment of such dividend would become,


                                -12-


     less than 20% of total capitalization, the corporation
     shall not (except as hereinafter provided) declare
     such dividend in an amount which, together with all
     other dividends on Common Stock paid within the
     year ending with and including the date on which
     such dividend is proposed to be payable, exceeds
     50% of the net income of the corporation available
     for dividends on the Common Stock for the twelve
     full consecutive calendar months ending within
     sixty days next preceding the month in which such
     dividend is proposed to be declared, provided,
     however, that if dividends (or additional dividends)
     on Common Stock could have been declared under the
     foregoing limitation in any previous year or years,
     but were not declared, then such dividend proposed
     to be paid may exceed 50% of the above specified net
     income of the corporation by a total amount equal
     to the aggregate amount of all dividends on Common
     Stock that could have been so declared but were not
     declared; and

           (b) if and so long as the Common Stock Equity
     on the last day of a calendar month ending within
     sixty days next preceding the date on which a dividend
     on Common Stock is proposed to be declared is, or
     as a result of the payment of such dividend would
     become, less than 25% but not less than 20% of total
     capitalization, the corporation shall not (except as
     hereinafter provided) declare such dividend in an
     amount which, together with all other dividends on
     Common Stock paid within the year ending with and
     including the date on which such dividend is proposed
     to be payable, exceeds 75% of the net income of the
     corporation available for dividends on the Common
     Stock for the twelve full consecutive calendar
     months ending within sixty days next preceding the
     month in which such dividend is proposed to be declared,
     provided, however, that if dividends (or additional
     dividends) on Common Stock could have been declared
     under the foregoing limitation of this paragraph in
     any previous year or years, but were not declared,
     then such dividend proposed to be paid may exceed
     75% of the above specified net income of the
     corporation by a total amount equal to the aggregate
     amount of all dividends on Common Stock that could
     have been so declared but were not declared; and

          (c) at any time when the Common Stock Equity
     is 25% or more of total capitalization, the corporation
     may not declare dividends on shares of the Common


                                -13-


     Stock which would reduce the Common Stock Equity
     below 25% of total capitalization, except to the
     extent provided or permitted in subparagraphs (a)
     and (b) above.

     "Net income of the corporation available for dividends
on Common Stock" shall be determined by deducting from
the total of operating revenues and other income
of the corporation for any given period, all operating
expenses for such period (including maintenance, repairs
and depreciation, taxes based on income and all other
taxes, all proper accruals, interest charges, amortization
charges, other proper income deductions and dividends paid
or accrued on outstanding shares of stock of the corporation
ranking prior to the Common Stock as to dividends, for
such period), all as determined in accordance with such
system of accounts as may be prescribed by regulatory
authorities having jurisdiction in the premises or, in
the absence of any such system of accounts, in accordance
with generally accepted accounting practices.

     For the purposes of this paragraph (6) and of subpara-
graph (D) of paragraph (5) hereof:

     The term "Common Stock Equity" shall mean the sum of
(a) the aggregate par value of, or stated capital represented
by, the outstanding shares (other than shares owned by the
corporation) of stock of the corporation ranking junior
to the Preferred Stock as to dividends or assets, (b) the
premium on such junior ranking stock, and (c) the surplus
(including earned surplus, capital or paid-in surplus and
surplus invested in plant) of the corporation, less, unless
the amounts or items are being amortized or are being
provided for by reserves, (1) any amounts recorded on the
books of the corporation for utility plant and other plant
in excess of the original cost thereof, (2) unamortized
debt discount and expense, capital stock discount and
expense and any other intangible items set forth on the
asset side of the balance sheet as a result of accounting
convention, (3) the excess, if any, of the aggregate
amount payable on involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of the corporation upon all
outstanding preferred stock of the corporation over the
aggregate par or stated value of such preferred stock and
any premiums thereon, (4) the excess, if any, for the
period beginning January 1, 1954, and ending December 31,
1976, of an amount equal to 15% of the gross operating
revenues derived by the corporation from the operation
of its properties for the period (excluding therefrom
non-operating income and revenues derived directly
from properties leased to the corporation),


after deducting from such revenues the aggregate cost of
electric energy and gas purchased for exchange or resale,
over the aggregate amount charged or provided by the cor-
poration on its books for maintenance, repairs and depre-
ciation for such period, and (5) the excess, if any, for
the period beginning January 1, 1977, to the end of a month
ending within ninety days next preceding the date as of
which Common Stock Equity is being determined, of an
amount equal to 2.9% annually (or such other percentage as may
upon application by the corporation be approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or any successor
authority, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935) of the arithmetical average of the amount of
depreciable property of the corporation at the beginning
and the amount thereof at the end, of each calendar year and
portion thereof contained in such period, in plant accounts
of the corporation, with respect to which bonds may at the
time be authenticated under any indenture securing first
mortgage bonds of the corporation, determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting practices (excluding amounts
included in plant acquisition adjustment account, or accounts
of similar purposes, if adequate provision for the amortization
of such amounts is made by current charges to income or surplus),
over the aggregate amount charged or provided by the corporation
on its books as charges for depreciation, retirements, renewals
and replacements and/or amortization for such period.

     For the purposes of this paragraph (6):

     (i) The term "total capitalization" of the corporation
shall mean the aggregate of (a) the principal amount of all
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes and other securities
representing indebtedness (whether secured or unsecured) of
the corporation maturing more than twelve months after the
date as of which total capitalization is being determined,
and (b) the par value of, or stated capital represented
by, the outstanding shares of the capital stock of all
classes of the corporation, all premiums in respect of such
stock, as carried on the books of the corporation, and
the amount of all surplus accounts of the corporation, after
deducting from such aggregate any amounts required to be
deducted, in the determination of Common Stock Equity,
pursuant to the provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of the
foregoing definition of "Common Stock Equity."

     (ii) The term "dividends on Common Stock" shall include
dividends on Common Stock (other than dividends payable
only in shares of Common Stock), distributions on, and
purchases or other acquisitions for value of, any Common
Stock of the corporation or other stock, if any, ranking





                                      -14-


                                         -15-


junior to the Preferred Stock as to dividends or assets.

     (7) (a) No holder of shares of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to vote, at any meeting of stockholders
of the corporation, for the election of directors or in
respect of any other matter, except as expressly provided
in paragraph (4) or (5) of this Article VI or in this
paragraph (7) or as may be required by law.  In such
excepted cases, each record holder of shares of the
Preferred Stock shall have one vote for each share of
the Preferred Stock held by him.  Each record holder of
shares of Common Stock shall, at all meetings of stockholders
of the corporation, have one vote for each share of Common
Stock held by him, except as otherwise provided in this
paragraph (7).

     (b) If and when dividends payable on the Preferred
Stock at any time outstanding shall be in default in
an amount equal to four full quarter-yearly dividends
or more per share, and thereafter until all dividends on
such Preferred Stock in default shall have been paid,
the record holders of shares of the Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class, shall be entitled, at each meeting
of stockholders at which directors are elected, to elect
the smallest number of directors necessary to constitute
a majority of the full Board of Directors of the corporation,
and, except as provided in the next following paragraph (c),
the holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a
class, shall be entitled to elect the remaining directors
of the corporation.  The terms of office, as directors, of
all persons who may be directors of the corporation at
the time shall terminate upon the election of a majority
of the Board of Directors by the holders of the Preferred
Stock, except that if the holders of the Common Stock shall
not have elected the remaining directors of the corporation,
then, and only in that event, the directors of the
corporation in office just prior to the election of a
majority of the Board of Directors by the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall elect the remaining directors of
the corporation.  Thereafter, while such default continues
and the majority of the Board of Directors is being elected
by the holders of the Preferred Stock, the remaining
directors, whether elected by directors as aforesaid, or,
whether originally or later elected by holders of the
Common Stock, shall continue in office until their
successors are elected by holders of the Common Stock and
shall qualify.

      (c) If and when all dividends then in default on
the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be paid (such


                                         1 6 -


dividends to be declared and paid, out of any funds legally
available therefor, as soon as reasonably practicable),
the holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be
divested of any special right with respect to the election
of directors, and the voting power of the holders of the
Preferred Stock and the holders of the Common Stock shall
revert to the status existing before the first dividend
payment date on which dividends on the Preferred Stock
were not paid in full, but always subject to the same
provisions for vesting such special rights in the record
holders of shares of the Preferred Stock in case of further
like defaults in the payment of dividends thereon as
described in the foregoing paragraph (b).  Upon termination
of any such special voting right upon payment of all
accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock,
the terms of office of all persons who may have been
elected directors of the corporation by vote of the holders
of the Preferred Stock as a class, pursuant to such special
voting right, shall forthwith terminate, and the resulting
vacancies shall be filled by the vote of a majority of
the remaining directors.  Dividends shall be deemed to have
been paid, as that term is used in this paragraph (c),
whenever such dividends shall have been declared and paid,
or declared and provision made for the payment thereof,
or whenever there shall be sufficient surplus or net profits
of the corporation legally available for the payment thereof
which shall have accrued since the date of the default
giving rise to such special voting right.

     (d) In case of any vacancy in the office of a director
occurring among the directors elected by the holders of
the Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, the
remaining directors elected by the holders of the Preferred
Stock, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or the
remaining director so elected if there be but one, may
elect a successor or successors to hold office for the
unexpired term or terms of the director or directors
whose place or places shall be vacant.  Likewise, in case
of any vacancy in the office of a director occurring among
the directors not elected by the holders of the Preferred
Stock, the remaining directors not elected by the holders
of the Preferred Stock, by affirmative vote of a majority
thereof, or the remaining director so elected if there
be but one, may elect a successor or successors to hold
office for the unexpired term or terms of the director or
directors whose place or places shall be vacant.

     (e) Whenever the right shall have accrued to the
record holders of the Preferred Stock to elect directors,
voting separately as a class, it shall be the duty of the


                                          -1 7 -


President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the
corporation forthwith to call and cause notice to be given
to the stockholders entitled to vote of a meeting to be
held at such time as the officers of the corporation may
fix, not less than forty-five nor more than sixty days
after the accrual of such right, for the purpose of electing
directors.  The notice so given shall be mailed to each
record holder of shares of the Preferred Stock at his last
known address appearing on the records of the corporation
and shall set forth, among other things, (i) that by reason
of the fact that dividends payable on the Preferred Stock
are in default in an amount equal to four full quarter-
yearly dividends or more per share, the record holders
of the Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class,
have the right to elect the smallest number of directors
necessary to constitute a majority of the full Board
of Directors of the corporation, (ii) that any record
holder of the Preferred Stock has the right, at any
reasonable time, to inspect, and make copies of, the list
or lists of record holders of the Preferred Stock maintained
at the principal office of the corporation or at the office
of any Transfer Agent of the Preferred Stock, and (iii)
either the entirety of this paragraph or the substance
thereof with respect to the number of shares of the
Preferred Stock required to be represented at any meeting,
or adjournment thereof, called for the election of
directors of the corporation.  At the first meeting of
stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors
during such time as the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall have the special right, voting separately as a class,
to elect directors, the presence in person or by proxy of
the record holders of not less than a majority of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be required to
constitute a quorum of such class for the election of
directors, and the presence in person or by proxy of the
record holders of not less than a majority of the out-
standing shares of Preferred Stock shall be required to
constitute a quorum of such class for the election of
directors; provided, however, that in the absence of a
quorum of the holders of Preferred Stock, no election
of directors shall he held, but the holders of a majority
of the Preferred Stock present in person or by proxy shall
have power to adjourn the election of the directors to a
date not less than fifteen nor more than fifty days from
the giving of the notice of such adjourned meeting
hereinafter provided for; and provided, further, that at
such adjourned meeting, the presence in person or by proxy
of the record holders of not less than 35% of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute
a quorum of such class for the election of directors.  In


                          -18-


the event such first meeting of stockholders shall be so
adjourned, it shall be the duty of the President, a Vice-
President or the Secretary of the corporation, within
ten days from the date on which such first meeting shall
have been adjourned, to cause notice of such adjourned
meeting to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote
thereat, such adjourned meeting to be held not less than
fifteen days nor more than fifty days from the giving of
such second notice.  Such second notice shall be given
in the form and manner hereinabove provided for with
respect to the notice required to be given of such first
meeting of stockholders, and shall further set forth that
a quorum was not present at such first meeting and that
the record holders of not less than 35% of the outstanding
shares of Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute
a quorum of such class for the election of directors at
such adjourned meeting.  If the requisite quorum of the
record holders of the Preferred Stock shall not be present
at said adjourned meeting, then the directors of the
corporation then in office shall remain in office until
the next annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation,
or special meeting in lieu thereof, and until their
successors shall have been elected and shall qualify.
Neither such first meeting nor such adjourned meeting
shall be held on a date within sixty days of the date of
the next annual meeting of stockholders of the corporation
or special meeting in lieu thereof.  At each annual
meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or special
meeting in lieu thereof, held during such time as the
record holders of the Preferred Stock, voting separately
as a class, shall have the right to elect a majority of
the Board of Directors, the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph (e) shall govern each annual meeting of
stockholders, or special meeting in lieu thereof, as if
said annual meeting or special meeting were the first
meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of electing
directors after the right of the record holders of the
Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, to elect
a majority of the Board of Directors, should have accrued,
with the exception that if, at any adjourned annual meeting
or special meeting in lieu thereof, the record holders of
not less than 35% of the outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock are not present in person or by proxy, all the
directors shall be elected by a vote of the record holders
of not less than a majority of the shares of Common Stock
of the corporation present or represented at the meeting.

     (f) In consideration of the issue, sale or delivery by
the corporation, and the purchase or other acquisition by
the holders thereof, of shares of the capital stock (both


                          -19-

preferred and common) of the corporation, each and every
present and future holder of shares of the capital stock
(both preferred and common) of the corporation shall be
conclusively deemed, by purchasing, acquiring or holding
such shares, to have expressly consented to all and singular
the terms and provisions of this paragraph (7) and to have
agreed that the voting rights of such holder, and the
restrictions and qualifications thereof, shall be as set
forth in this paragraph (7).

     (8) No share of stock or evidence of indebtedness
shall be deemed to be "outstanding", as that term is used
in this Article VI, if, prior to or concurrently with the
event in reference to which a determination as to the amount
thereof outstanding is to be made, the requisite funds for the
redemption, payment or other retirement thereof shall be deposi-
ted in trust for that purpose and, in the case of redemption,
the requisite notice for the redemption thereof shall be given
or the depositary of such funds shall be irrevocably authorized
and directed to give or complete such notice of redemption.

     (9) No holder of shares of stock of any class of the
corporation shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to
subscribe for, purchase or receive any shares of the
stock of any class of the corporation, or any rights or
options of the corporation which it may issue or sell,
whether out of the number of shares now authorized or
hereafter authorized.  Nor shall any holder of shares of
stock, of any class, of the corporation be entitled, as
a matter of right, to subscribe for, purchase or receive
any bonds, debentures or other obligations which the
corporation may issue or sell, which shall be convertible
into or exchangeable for stock of any class, or to which
shall be attached or appertain any warrant or warrants
(or other instrument or instruments) which shall confer upon
the holder or owner the right to subscribe for or purchase from
the corporation any shares of its capital stock of any class; and
all such additional issues of stock, rights, options, or of bonds,
debentures or other obligations convertible into or exchangeable
for stock, or to which such warrants shall be attached or
appertain, may be issued and disposed of as determined by the
Board of Directors to such persons (whether stockholders or not),
at such times, for such consideration and upon such terms,
permitted by the laws of the State of Texas, as the Board of
Directors in its absolute discretion may deem advisable.

     (10) The corporation reserves the right to increase
or decrease its authorized capital stock, or any class
or classes thereof or any designation or series of any
such class, or to reclassify the same, and to amend, alter,


                         -20-


change or repeal any provision contained in the Charter
(as amended) of the corporation or in any future
amendment to the Charter as then in effect, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, but subject
to such conditions and limitations as are hereinabove
prescribed; and all rights granted to or conferred
upon stockholders in the Charter (as amended) of the
corporation or any future amendment thereto, are granted
or conferred subject to this reservation.

     (11) Neither a consolidation or merger of the
corporation with or into any other corporation, nor a
merger of any other corporation into the corporation, nor
the purchase or other acquisition, redemption or other
retirement by the corporation of all or any part of the
outstanding shares of its preferred stock of any class,
shall be deemed a distribution of assets, or a liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, of the corporation within the
meaning of any of the provisions of the Charter (as amended)
of the corporation, as then in effect.

                      WEST TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY

pursuant to the provisions of Article 4.04 of the Texas Business
Corporation Act, adopts the-following Articles of Amendment to its
Restated Articles of Incorporation:

                              ARTICLE ONE

The name of the corporation is West Texas Utilities Company.

                              ARTICLE TWO

The following amendment to the Restated Articles of Incorporation was
adopted by the shareholders of the corporation on July 8, 1982.  The
amendment authorizes for a temporary period an increase in the
proportion of permitted unsecured debt of the Company and an increase in
the proportion of permitted unsecured debt that may mature within 10
years.

The amendment alters Subsection (5) (B) of Article VI of the Restated
Articles of Incorporation, and changes it to read as follows:

          "(5) So long as any shares of the Preferred Stock shall be
     outstanding, the corporation shall not, without the consent (given
     by vote at an annual or special meeting of stockholders) of the
     record holders of a majority of the total number of shares of the
     Preferred Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a class:



     "(B) issue or assume any unsecured notes, debentures or other
securities representing unsecured indebtedness (herein referred to as
'unsecured obligations'), for any purpose other than (i) the refunding
of outstanding unsecured indebtedness or unsecured obligations
theretofore incurred, issued or assumed by the corporation, or (ii) the
reacquisition, redemption or other retirement of any indebtedness, if
such transaction has been ordered, approved or permitted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 or by any successor commission or other regulatory
authority of the United States of America then having jurisdiction in
the premises, or (iii) the reacquisition, redemption or other
retirement of all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock or of stock
ranking prior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock, if:

          "(1) immediately after such issue or assumption, the
     total principal amount of all unsecured obligations issued or
     assumed by the corporation and then outstanding would exceed


     (a) 25% of the sum of the total principal amount of all bonds
     or other securities representing secured indebtedness issued
     or assumed by the corporation and then outstanding and the
     aggregate amount of the capital and surplus of the
     corporation as then stated on the books of account of the
     corporation (such sum being hereinafter referred to as 'total
     secured debt and capital'), or (b) the principal amount of all
     unsecured obligations maturing in less than ten years (herein
     referred to as 'short-term indebtedness'), issued or assumed
     by the corporation and then outstanding, computed as herein
     provided, would exceed 20% of the total secured debt and
     capital; or

          "(2) immediately after such issue or assumption, the
     total principal amount of unsecured obligations would exceed
     20% of total secured debt and capital, and either (a) the
     total secured debt and capital of the corporation would exceed
     $750,000,000, or (b) the sum of the capital and surplus of the
     corporation as then stated on the books of account of the
     corporation would be less than 40% of the sum of the
     corporation's total secured debt and capital and short-term
     indebtedness; or

          "(3) with respect to the period commencing on the earlier
     of (a) the date one year after the first day of commercial
     operation of the Company's Oklaunion generating station or (b)
     January 1, 1989 (the earlier of such dates being hereinafter
     referred to as the 'Termination Date'), immediately after such
     issue or assumption, the principal amount of all unsecured
     obligations of the corporation then outstanding would exceed
     20% of total secured debt and capital or the principal amount
     of all short-term indebtedness of the corporation then
     outstanding would exceed 10% of total secured debt and
     capital.

   "For purposes of this subparagraph (B), (i) with respect to any
   unsecured obligation originally having a single maturity of more
   than ten years, the principal amount of such obligation shall not
   be regarded as short-term indebtedness until such principal amount
   shall be due or required to be paid within three years and (ii)
   with respect to unsecured obligations having serial maturities or
   having sinking, purchase or similar periodic debt retirement
   provisions, the principal amount of the final maturity, any serial
   maturity or any periodic debt retirement maturity which originally
   was more than ten years shall not be regarded as short-term debt
   until such principal amount shall be due or required to be paid
   within three years."

                          ARTICLE THREE

The designation and number of outstanding shares of each class entitled
to vote thereon as a class were as follows:


                   Class                      Number of Shares
                   Common                         2,588,000
                   Preferred                         60,000

                                  Statement of
                Resolution Establishing Series of Shares 


To the Secretary of State
     of the State of Texas

     Pursuant to the provisions of Article 2.13 of the Texas
Business Corporation Act, the undersigned corporation submits the
following statement for the purpose of establishing and designat-
ing a series of shares and fixing and determining the relative
rights and preferences thereof:

     1.  The name of the corporation is: West Texas Utilities
         Company.

     2.  The following resolution, establishing and designating
         a series of shares and fixing and determining the relative 
         rights and preferences thereof, was duly adopted by a 
         committee of the Board of Directors of the corporation on 
         June 6, 1983, which committee was established by resolution 
         adopted by the Board of

Directors on    February 17, 1983:

     "RESOLVED, by a committee of the Board of Directors of
West Texas Utilities Company (the "corporation"), such committee
consisting of Messrs.  Churchill, King and Hooks, directors of the
corporation, and acting pursuant to authority granted by a resolu-
tion of the Board on February 17, 1983, as permitted by Article 2.36
of the Texas Business Corporation Act:

     1.  A series of the Preferred Stock of the corporation
is hereby created and established out of the authorized and
unissued shares of the Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share,
of the corporation, said series to consist of 250,000 shares, all
of which shares are hereby authorized to be issued by the corpo-
ration.


     2.  Said series shall be designated 10.16% Preferred
Stock.

     3.  The rate of dividend applicable to each of said
shares of said  series shall be 10.16% per annum on the par value
thereof.

     4.  The dividends on the shares of said series shall
be cumulative from the date of issue of said shares.

     5.  The shares of said series shall be subject to
redemption, in  whole at any time or in part from time to time,
upon the notice and in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the corpo-
ration; and the redemption prices applicable to each of the
shares of said series shall be the sum of $100.00, together with
all unpaid dividends thereon accrued to the date of redemption,
and, in addition, a premium of $10.16 per share if redeemed prior
to June 1, 1988; $6.77 per share if redeemed on or after June 1,
1988, and prior to June 1, 1993; $3.39 per share if redeemed on
or after June 1, 1993, and prior to June 1, 1998; and no premium
if redeemed on or after June 1, 1998; provided, that none of the
shares of said series may be redeemed, prior to June 1, 1988, if
such redemption is for the purpose of refunding or is in anticipa-
tion of the refunding of said shares through the use, directly or
indirectly, of funds obtained by the corporation through the
issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock or any other stock
ranking prior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock, or
through the incurrence of debt by the corporation, at a dividend
or interest cost, as the case may be, less than 10.236% per
annum.

     6.  In the event of the voluntary liquidation, dissolu-
tion or winding up of the corporation, the amount which the
holders of shares of the 10.16% Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid in full, out of the net assets of
the corporation and before any amount shall be paid or distributed
to the holders of shares of the Common stock, shall be the then
effective redemption price of such shares of Preferred Stock as
provided in paragraph 5 above (including an amount equal to the
accrued dividends on such shares), and no more.

     7.  The shares of said series shall be subject to the
terms, provisions and restrictions set forth in the Restated
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the corporation with
respect to the shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation,
shall be of equal rank with and, excepting only as to the rate of
dividend payable thereon, the voluntary liquidation prices and
the redemption prices thereof and the terms and conditions of




                               -2-


redemption applicable thereto and shall confer rights equal to
the rights conferred by all other shares of Preferred Stock of
the corporation.

     8.   During each 12 month period ending May 31 in each
year, beginning in 1989, as and for a sinking fund for the shares
of said series the corporation shall, subject to the restrictions
contained in this resolution, redeem and retire 7,500 shares of
said series (being 3% of the number of shares of said series
originally issued) at the sinking fund redemption price of $100
per share plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption (such
required redemptions being hereinafter referred to as the "sinking
fund requirement").  The sinking fund requirement shall be cumula-
tive so that if the corporation shall fail to satisfy in full the
sinking fund requirement in any such 12 month period, the amount
of the deficiency shall be added to the sinking fund requirement
for succeeding 12 month periods until such deficiency shall be
made good.  Such deficiency shall be made good as soon as practi-
cable.  In the event that the corporation is in arrears in the
sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period or periods,
and so long as the corporation shall remain in arrears in such
requirement, the corporation may not purchase, redeem or pay
dividends on any of its stock ranking junior to the shares of
said series.

     9.  The corporation may satisfy the whole or any part
of the sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period by
cancelling and retiring, prior to the end of such 12 month period,
shares of said series purchased by the corporation or shares of
said series redeemed by the corporation otherwise than pursuant
to paragraph 8 of this resolution.

     10.  The corporation may redeem through the sinking
fund during any such 12 month period not more than 7,500 additional
shares of said series.  Any redemption of such additional shares
so redeemed will not reduce the sinking fund requirement in any
subsequent 12 month period, and the right of the corporation to
apply such additional shares to the sinking fund requirement will
not be cumulative.

     11.  All shares of said series redeemed or purchased,
including those applied to meet the sinking fund requirement,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock but may not be reissued as
shares of said series.

     12.   No shares of said series shall be redeemed to
satisfy the sinking fund requirement unless, at the date such
shares are called for redemption, full dividends on all shares of




                              -3-


the Preferred Stock of the corporation for all prior periods shall have
been paid or declared and set apart for payment.  Nothing contained in
this resolution shall be deemed to require the corporation to redeem or
purchase shares of said series at a time when it may not legally do so."

     A true and correct certified copy of the resolution of the Board of
Directors of February 17, 1983, and the resolution of a committee of the
Board of Directors of June 6, 1983, both referred to herein, are
attached hereto as exhibits.

                   WEST TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY
         Resolution for Adoption by the Pricing Committee
                           June 6, 1983

     RESOLVED, by a committee of the Board of Directors of
West Texas Utilities Company (the "corporation"), such committee
consisting of Messrs.  Churchill, King and Hooks, directors of the
corporation, and acting pursuant to authority granted by a resolu-
tion of the Board on February 17, 1983, as permitted by Article 2.36
of the Texas Business Corporation Act:

     1.  A series of the Preferred Stock of the corporation
is hereby created and established out of the authorized and
unissued shares of the Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share,
of the corporation, said series to consist of 250,000 shares, all
of which shares are hereby authorized to be issued by the corpo-
ration.

     2.  Said series shall be designated "10.16% Preferred
Stock".

     3.  The rate of dividend applicable to each of said
shares of said series shall be 10.16% per annum on the par value
thereof.

     4.  The dividends on the shares of said series shall
be cumulative from the date of issue of said shares.

     5.  The shares of said series shall be subject to
redemption, in whole at any time or in part from time to time,
upon the notice and in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the corpo-
ration; and the redemption prices applicable to each of the
shares of said series shall be the sum of $100.00, together with
all unpaid dividends thereon accrued to the date of redemption,
and, in addition, a premium of $10.16 per share if redeemed prior
to June 1, 1988; $6.77 per share if redeemed on or after June 1,
1988, and prior to June 1, 1993; $3.39 per share if redeemed on
or after June 1, 1993, and prior to June 1, 1998; and no premium
if redeemed on or after June 1, 1998; provided, that none of the
shares of said series may be redeemed, prior to June 1, 1988, if
such redemption is for the purpose of refunding or is in anticipa-
tion of the refunding of said shares through the use, directly or
indirectly, of funds obtained by the corporation through the
issuance of any shares of Preferred Stock or any other stock


ranking prior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock, or
through the incurrence of debt by the corporation, at a dividend
or interest cost, as the case may be, less than 10.236% per
annum.

     6.  In the event of the voluntary liquidation, dissolu-
tion or winding up of the corporation, the amount which the
holders of shares of the 10.16% Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall be entitled to be paid in full, out of the net assets of
the corporation and before any amount shall be paid or distributed
to the holders of shares of the Common Stock, shall be the then
effective redemption price of such shares of Preferred Stock as
provided in paragraph 5 above (including an amount equal to the
accrued dividends on such shares), and no more.

     7.  The shares of said series shall be subject to the
terms, provisions and restrictions set forth in the Restated
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the corporation with
respect to the shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation,
shall be of equal rank with and, excepting only as to the rate of
dividend payable thereon, the voluntary liquidation prices and
the redemption prices thereof and the terms and conditions of
redemption applicable thereto and shall confer rights equal to
the rights conferred by all other shares of Preferred Stock of
the corporation.

     8.  During each 12 month period ending May 31 in each
year, beginning in 1989, as and for a sinking fund for the shares
of said series the corporation shall, subject to the restrictions
contained in this resolution, redeem and retire 7,500 shares of
said series (being 3% of the number of shares of said series
originally issued) at the sinking fund redemption price of $100
per share plus accrued dividends to the date of redemption (such
required redemptions being hereinafter referred to as the "sinking
fund requirement").  The sinking fund requirement shall be cumula-
tive so that if the corporation shall fail to satisfy in full the
sinking fund requirement in any such 12 month period, the amount
of the deficiency shall be added to the sinking fund requirement
for succeeding 12 month periods until such deficiency shall be
made good.  Such deficiency shall be made good as soon as practi-
cable.  In the event that the corporation is in arrears in the
sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period or periods,
and so long as the corporation shall remain in arrears in such
requirement, the corporation may not purchase, redeem or pay
dividends on any of its stock ranking junior to the shares of
said series.

     9.  The corporation may satisfy the whole or any part
of the sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period by




                             -2-


cancelling and retiring, prior to the end of such 12 month period,
shares of said series purchased by the corporation or shares of
said series redeemed by the corporation otherwise than pursuant
to paragraph 8 of this resolution.

     10.  The corporation may redeem through the sinking
fund during any such 12 month period not more than 7,500 additional
shares of said series.  Any redemption of such additional shares
so redeemed will not reduce the sinking fund requirement in any
subsequent 12 month period, and the right of the corporation to
apply such additional shares to the sinking fund requirement will
not be cumulative.

     11.  All shares of said series redeemed or purchased,
including those applied to meet the sinking fund requirement,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall become authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock but may not be reissued as
shares of said series.

     12.  No shares of said series shall be redeemed to
satisfy the sinking fund requirement unless, at the date such
shares are called for redemption, full dividends on all shares of
the Preferred Stock of the corporation for all prior periods
shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment.
Nothing contained in this resolution shall be deemed to require
the corporation to redeem or purchase shares of said series at a
time when it may not legally do so.

     13.  The offer to purchase 250,000 shares of the 10.16%
Preferred Stock submitted this day by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Incorporated for themselves and as Managers of t-he other Under-
writers listed in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement sub-
mitted by such Managers, for the purchase of said shares from the
corporation at $100 per share plus accrued dividends on such
shares from the date of issue to the date of delivery and payment,
subject to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement referred to
below and at a compensation of $0.74 per share of 10.16% Pre-
ferred Stock, is accepted by the corporation.

     14.  The action of Donald A. Shahan, Secretary and
Treasurer of the corporation, in (a) accepting on behalf of the
corporation the offer to purchase said shares of 10.16% Preferred
Stock upon the foregoing terms submitted this day by the Under-
writers named above, and (b) executing and delivering a counter-
part or counterparts of the Underwriting Agreement and thereby on
behalf of the corporation entering into an Underwriting Agreement,
is ratified and approved.






                               -3-


     15.  The form of stock certificates to represent shares
of said 10.16% Preferred Stock presented to and filed with the
minutes of this meeting is approved in substantially the form
presented; and the facsimile signatures of Glen D. Churchill and
Donald A. Shahan, President and Secretary, respectively, of the
corporation, which are impressed, imprinted or reproduced on said
certificates are approved and adopted by the corporation.

16.  The proper officers of the corporation, and each
of them, are hereby directed to execute and deliver other documents
on behalf of the corporation and to take all other actions neces-
sary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this resolution
and to cause the sale and issuance of the 10.16% Preferred Stock
on the terms indicated above.

     I, Donald A. Shahan, Secretary of West Texas Utilities
Company, a Texas corporation, do hereby certify that the above
and foregoing is a true and correct copy of a resolution adopted
by a committee of-the Board of Directors of this Company on
June 6, 1983, and is in full force and effect as of this date
with no changes or alterations of any type.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I hereby set my hand and affix the seal
of said corporation this 7th day of June, 1983.

                   ESTABLISHING SERIES OF SHARES

     RESOLVED, by a committee of the Board of Directors of
West Texas Utilities Company (the "corporation"), such
committee consisting of Messrs.  Glen D. Churchill, G. H. King
and Robert H. Alvis, directors of the corporation, and acting
pursuant to authority granted by a resolution of the Board on

     1.  A series of the Preferred Stock of the
corporation is hereby created and established out of the
authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock, par
value $100 per share, of the corporation, said series to
consist of 250,000 shares, all of which shares are hereby
authorized to be issued by the corporation.

     2.  Said series shall be designated "7-1/4% Preferred
Stock."

     3.  The rate of dividend applicable to each of said
shares of said series shall be 7-1/4% per annum on the par

     4.   The dividends on the shares of said series shall
be cumulative from the date of issue of said shares.

     5.  The shares of said series shall be subject to
redemption, in whole at any time or in part from time to time,
upon the notice and in the manner and with the effect provided
in the Restated Articles of Incorporation at the following
general redemption prices per share, plus in each case accrued
and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption: $107.25 if
redeemed prior to April 1, 1991; $102.72 if redeemed on or
after April 1, 1991 but prior to April 1, 1992; $101.82 if
redeemed on or after April 1, 1992 but prior to April 1, 1993;
$100.91 if redeemed on or after April 1, 1993 but prior to
April 1, 1994; and $100.00 if redeemed on or after April 1,
1994; provided, that none of the shares of said series may be
redeemed prior to April 1, 1991 if such redemption is for the
purpose of refunding or is in anticipation of the refunding of
said shares through the use, directly or indirectly, of funds
obtained by the corporation through the issuance of any shares
of Preferred Stock or any other stock ranking prior to or on a
parity with the Preferred Stock, or through the incurrence of
debt by the corporation, at a dividend or interest cost, as the
case may be, less than 7.30% per annum.

     6.  In the event of the voluntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the amount which
the holders of shares of the 7-1/4% Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall be entitled to be paid in full, out of the

shares), and no more.

     7.  The shares of said series shall be subject to the
terms, provisions and restrictions set forth in the Restated
Articles of Incorporation, as amended, of the corporation with
respect to the shares of Preferred Stock of the corporation,

of redemption applicable thereto, shall confer rights equal to
the rights conferred by all other shares of Preferred Stock of
the corporation.








                                -2-


     8.  During each 12 month period beginning April 1 in
each year, beginning in 1991, as and for a sinking fund for the
shares of said series the corporation shall, subject to the
restrictions contained in this Resolution, redeem and retire
50,000 shares of said series (being 20% of the number of shares
of said series originally issued) at the sinking fund
redemption price of $100 per share plus accrued dividends to
the date of redemption (such required redemptions being
hereinafter referred to as the "sinking fund requirement").
The sinking fund requirement shall be cumulative so that if the
corporation shall fail to satisfy in full the sinking fund
requirement in any such 12 month period, the amount of the
deficiency shall be added to the sinking fund requirement for
succeeding 12 month periods until such deficiency shall be made
good.  Such deficiency shall be made good as soon as
practicable.  In the event that the corporation is in arrears
in the sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period or
periods, and so long as the corporation shall remain in arrears
in such requirement, the corporation may not purchase, redeem
or pay dividends on any of its stock ranking junior to the
shares of said series.

     9.  The corporation may satisfy the whole or any part
of the sinking fund requirement for any such 12 month period by
cancelling and retiring, prior to the end of such 12 month
period, shares of said series purchased by the corporation or
shares of said series redeemed by the corporation otherwise
than pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Resolution.

     10.  The corporation may redeem through the sinking
fund during any such 12 month period not more than 50,000
additional shares of said series at the sinking fund redemption
price of $100 per share plus accrued dividends the date of
redemption.  Any redemption of such additional shares so
redeemed will not reduce the sinking fund requirement in any
subsequent 12 month period, and the right of the corporation to
apply such additional shares to the sinking fund requirement
will not be cumulative.

     11.  All shares of said series redeemed or purchased,
including those applied to meet the sinking fund requirement,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall become authorized and
unissued shares of Preferred Stock but may not be reissued as
shares of said series.








                                         -3-


     12. No shares of said series shall be redeemed to
satisfy the sinking fund requirement unless, at the date such
shares are called for redemption, full dividends on all shares
of the Preferred Stock of the corporation for all prior periods
shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment.
Nothing contained in this Resolution shall be deemed to require
the corporation to redeem or purchase shares of said series at
a time when it may not legally do so.


     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the corporation has caused this
Certificate to be signed by Lawrence B. Connors, its Secretary
and Director of Accounting and Finance this 10th day of March
