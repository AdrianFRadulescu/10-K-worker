Item 1.  Business

Introduction

         The consolidated financial statements of UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc.
include the accounts of UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. ("UCI"), its wholly owned
subsidiary, UCI Medical Affiliates of SC, Inc. ("UCI-SC") and Doctor's Care, PA
(the "P.A."), collectively the "Company". The financial statements of the P.A.
are consolidated with UCI because UCI-SC has unilateral control over the assets
and operations of the P.A. and, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority
ownership, consolidation of the P.A. with UCI is necessary to present fairly the
financial position and results of operations of UCI. UCI-SC provides non-medical
management and administrative functions for 25 medical clinics, operating as
Doctor's Care (the "Centers"). All medical services at the Centers are provided
by or under the supervision of the P.A., which has contracted with UCI-SC to
provide the medical direction of the Centers. The medical directors operate the
Centers under the financial and operational control of UCI-SC. However, medical
supervision of the Centers is provided solely by the P.A. The P.A. remits to
UCI-SC all medical service revenues generated by the Centers, net of expenses
incurred by the P.A. This compensation is recorded in the accompanying financial
statements as revenue. Control of the P.A. is perpetual and other than temporary
because of the nature of this relationship and the management's agreements
between the entities. The net assets of the P.A. are not material for any period
presented and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. For
the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995, the Company has shown a substantial
increase in revenues and in medical centers under management. This growth is a
direct result of actions taken by management to increase marketing efforts, to
expand the state-wide network in South Carolina and to focus on the field of
occupational and industrial medicine.

General

         UCI-SC provides nonmedical management and administrative services for
freestanding medical centers. The Company as of September 1995 owns a network of
medical centers consisting of 25 freestanding Centers located throughout South
Carolina.

         In order to comply with prohibitions against corporations, other than
medical professional associations, providing medical care; all medical services
at the Centers are provided by or under the supervision of the P.A., a South
Carolina professional association.

         The Centers are staffed by licensed physicians, other healthcare
providers and administrative support staff. The medical support staff includes
licensed nurses, certified medical assistants, laboratory technicians and x-ray
technicians.

         The Centers typically are open for extended hours (weekends and
evenings) and out-patient care only. When hospitalization or specialty care is
needed, referrals to appropriate specialists are made.

         The Company's Centers are broadly distributed throughout the state of
South Carolina. There are eleven primary care Centers in the Columbia region,
four in the Charleston region, four in the Myrtle Beach region and four in the
Greenville-Spartanburg region. In addition to these 23 Centers, the Company
operates a surgical practice and an orthopedic practice, both of which are
located in Columbia.

         The Company's business, by its nature, is subject to various risks,
including, but not limited to, difficulties in controlling health care costs,
uncertainty of future expansion, availability of primary care physicians and
possible negative effects of government regulation.

                                -3-

<PAGE>
         The health care industry is subject to extensive federal and state
regulation. Changes in healthcare legislation or reinterpretations of existing
regulations could significantly affect the business of the Company.

Medical Services Provided at the Centers

         The Company's Centers offer reasonably priced out-patient medical care,
without appointment, for treatment of acute and episodic medical problems. The
Centers provide a broad range of medical services which would generally be
classified as within the scope of family practice and occupational medicine. The
medical services are provided by licensed physicians, nurses and auxiliary
support personnel. The services provided at the Centers include, but are not
limited to the following:

 (bullet)      Routine care of general medical problems, including colds, flu,
               ear infections, hypertension, asthma, pneumonia and other
               conditions typically treated by primary care providers;

 (bullet)      Treatment of injuries,  such as simple  fractures,  dislocations,
               sprains, bruises and cuts;

 (bullet)      Minor surgery, including suturing of lacerations and removal of 
               cysts and foreign bodies;

 (bullet)      Diagnostic tests, such as x-rays, electrocardiograms, complete
               blood counts, urinalysis and various cultures; and,

 (bullet)      Occupational and industrial medical services, including drug
               testing, worker's compensation and physical examinations.

         At any of the Centers, a patient with a life-threatening condition
would be evaluated by the physician, stabilized and immediately transferred to a
nearby hospital.

Patient Charges and Payments

         The fees charged to a patient are determined by the nature of medical
services rendered. Management of the Company believes that the charges at its
Centers are significantly lower than the charges of hospital emergency
departments and are generally competitive with the charges of local physicians
and other providers in the area.

         The Company's Centers accept payment from a wide range of sources.
These include patient payments at time of service (by cash, check or credit
card), patient billing and assignment of insurance benefits (including Blue
Cross/Blue Shield, Medicare, Worker's Compensation and other private insurance).
Private pay billings represent the most significant source of revenues. The
Company also provides services for members of three of the largest health
maintenance organizations ("HMOs") operating in South Carolina - Companion
HealthCare Corporation, HealthSource South Carolina, Inc., and Maxicare South
Carolina (a division of Maxicare Southeast Health Plan, Inc.).

         Medical services traditionally have been provided on a fee-for-service
basis with insurance companies assuming responsibility for paying all or a
portion of such fees. The increase in medical costs under traditional indemnity
health care plans has been caused by a number of factors. These factors include:
(i) the lack of incentives on the part of health care providers to deliver
cost-effective medical care; (ii) the absence of controls over the utilization
of costly specialty care physicians and hospitals; (iii) a growing and aging
population which requires increased health care expenditures; and (iv) the
expense involved with the introduction and use of advanced pharmaceuticals and
medical technology.

         As a result of escalating health care costs, employers, insurers and
governmental entities all sought cost-effective approaches to the delivery of
and payment for quality health care services. HMOs and other managed health care
organizations have emerged as integral components in this effort. HMOs enroll

                                  -4-

<PAGE>

members by entering into contracts with employer groups or directly with
individuals to provide a broad range of health care services for a capitation
payment, with minimal or no deductibles or co-payments required of the members.
HMOs, in turn, contract with health care providers like the Company to
administer medical care to HMO members. These contracts provide for payment to
the Company on either a discounted fee-for-service or through capitation
payments based on the number of members covered, regardless of the amount of
necessary medical care required within the covered benefit period.

         Certain third party payors are studying various alternatives for
reducing medical costs, some of which, if implemented, could affect
reimbursement levels to the Company. The Company cannot predict whether changes
in present reimbursement methods or proposed future modifications in
reimbursement methods will affect payments for services provided by the Centers
and, if so, whether they will have an adverse impact upon the business of the
Company.

Competition and Marketing

         All of the Company's Centers face competition, in varying degrees, from
hospital emergency rooms, private doctor's offices and other competing
freestanding medical centers. Some of these providers have financial resources
which are greater than those of the Company. In addition, traditional sources of
medical services, such as hospital emergency rooms and private physicians, have
had, in the past, a higher degree of recognition and acceptance by patients than
Centers such as those operated by the Company. The Company's Centers compete on
the basis of accessibility, including evening and weekend hours, a
no-appointment policy, the attractiveness of its state-wide network to large
employers and third party payors, and on a basis of a competitive fee schedule.
In an effort to offset the competition's community recognition, the Company has
substantially increased its marketing efforts. Regional marketing
representatives have been added, focused promotional material has been developed
and a newsletter for employers promoting the Company's activities has been
initiated.

Government Regulation

         South Carolina prohibits the corporate practice of medicine. By virtue
of its relationship with the P.A., the Company believes that it is in full
compliance with this law.

         The health care industry is highly regulated, and there can be no
assurance that the regulatory environment in which the Company operates will not
change significantly in the future. Generally, regulation of health care
companies is increasing.

         Various proposals affecting federal and state regulation of the health
care industry, including limitations on Medicare and Medicaid payments, have
been introduced in the past, including provisions in legislation currently
pending.

Employees

     As of September 30, 1995 and 1994,  the Company had 301 and 202  employees,
respectively (270 and 170 , respectively, on a full-time equivalent basis).

Item 2.  Properties

         All but one of the Company's primary care Centers are leased. The
properties are generally located on well-traveled major highways, with easy
access. Each property offers free, off-street parking immediately adjacent to
the center. Four (4) Centers are leased from entities affiliated with the
Company's Chairman and one (1) center is leased directly from the Chairman.
Seven (7) Centers are leased from Companion HealthCare Corporation, a principal
shareholder of the Company. See additional information regarding these leases at
Item 13, "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

                                  -5-

<PAGE>

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

         The Company is party to various claims, legal activities and complaints
arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management and legal
counsel, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is
party.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     Item 7.  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations

         The following discussion and analysis provides information which the
Company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto.

     Results of  Operations  for the Year Ended  September  30, 1995 Compared to
Year Ended September 30, 1994

         For fiscal year 1995, revenues of $17,987,000 reflect an increase of
43% from the amount reported for fiscal year 1994. The following reflects
revenue trends from fiscal year 1991 through fiscal year 1995:

                            For the year ended September 30, (in thousands)

                               1995         1994        1993       1992     1991

         Revenues            $17,987     $12,540      $9,799     $8,330   $8,542
         Operating Costs      18,180      11,881       9,133      8,004    8,232
         Operating Margin       (193)        660         666        326      310


         The increase in revenue for fiscal year 1995 is attributable to a
number of factors. The Company engaged in a significant expansion, increasing
the number of primary care medical Centers from 19 to 25. The expansion included
the addition of two Centers each to the clusters in Columbia (bringing the total
to eleven plus two specialty practices in this region), Greenville (bringing the
total to four in this region) and Myrtle Beach (bringing the total to four in
this region).

         The Company, in fiscal year 1995, increased its services provided to
members of HMOs. In these arrangements, the Company, through Doctor's Care,
P.A., acts as the designated primary caregiver for members of the HMO who have
selected Doctor's Care as their primary care provider. In fiscal year 1994, the
Company began participating in an HMO operated by Companion HealthCare
Corporation ("Companion"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue Shield
of South Carolina. With its arrangement with Companion, the Company now
participates in three HMOs and is the primary care "gatekeeper" for more than
11,000 capitated lives. While HMOs do not, at this time, have a significant
penetration into the South Carolina market, the Company believes that HMOs and
other managed care plans will experience a substantial increase in market share
in the next few years, and the Company is therefore positioning itself for this
possibility.

         Increased revenues in fiscal year 1995 also reflect the Company's
heightened focus on occupational medicine and industrial health services.
Focused marketing materials, including quarterly newsletters for employers, were
developed to spotlight the Company's services for industry. The Company also
entered into an agreement with Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company
wherein the Company acts as the primary care provider for injured workers of
firms insured through Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company.
Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company is wholly owned by Blue Cross
Blue Shield of South Carolina and is therefore affiliated with Companion
HealthCare Corporation, a primary shareholder of the Company. See additional
related information at Item 13, "Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions."

         Patient encounters increased to 283,000 in fiscal 1995 from 216,000 in
fiscal 1994.

         Even with the positive effects of the factors mentioned above, revenues
were short of goals for the year, due in part to the increased competition from
hospitals and other providers in Greenville, Sumter and Myrtle Beach and to
certain short-term disruptions related to the practices acquired during the
year.

                                -9-

<PAGE>

         Operating losses of $193,000 were realized in fiscal 1995 as compared
to an operating margin of $660,000 in fiscal 1994. This is due, in part, to
start-up costs being incurred at the six Centers added in fiscal 1995. Operating
costs of $18,180,000 for fiscal 1995 exceeded management's budgets primarily in
the areas of personnel costs and medical supplies. Management has aggressively
addressed these areas, implementing significant cost cutting measures during the
latter part of the third quarter. These include very substantial and across the
board reductions in personnel costs, severe reductions in overtime and
aggressive negotiations with vendors to obtain more substantial discounts on
medical supplies.

         Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $579,000 in fiscal
1995, up from $320,000 in fiscal 1994. This increase reflects higher
depreciation expense as a result of significant leasehold improvements and
equipment upgrades at a number of the Company's medical centers, as well as an
increase in amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired from
the Company's purchase of existing practices in Surfside Beach, Columbia, and
Myrtle Beach. Interest expense increased from $164,000 in fiscal 1994 to
$505,000 in fiscal 1995 primarily as a result of the interest costs associated
with the indebtedness incurred in the Company's purchase of the Surfside Beach
Center and in the leasehold improvements.

         In the latter part of fiscal year 1994, the Company converted to a
centralized computer system acquired from Companion Technologies. Companion
Technologies is wholly owned by Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina and is
therefore affiliated with Companion HealthCare Corporation, a primary
shareholder of the Company. See additional related information at Item 13,
"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions." This conversion was
necessitated by the Company's expansion, the need for a centralized, specialized
billings and collections unit, and by the Company's recognition that increased
managed care participation required more exacting data. With billing done from a
centralized location rather than from each medical center, the Company believes
that both increased billing efficiency, and greater focus on collections, will
result. The new computer system will also cause a reduction in computer-related
expansion costs should the Company add additional Centers. In making this
conversion, the Company traded in its old computer equipment, giving rise to a
loss of approximately $69,000 in fiscal 1994.

         Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") which requires the
use of an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. The
effect of adopting SFAS 109 was to reduce income tax expense for 1994 by
approximately $612,000 or $.26 per share. Financial statements presented for
1993 and prior years reflected income taxes recorded under the deferred method
previously required by previous accounting standards. As part of the adoption of
SFAS 109, the Company has recognized a deferred tax asset relating to net
operating loss carry forwards which are available to offset future taxable
income. Under certain circumstances, a significant change in the Company's
ownership could severely limit utilization of the Company's net operating loss
carry forwards.

Financial Condition at September 30, 1995

         The Company grew significantly during the year ending September 30,
1995.

         Cash and cash equivalents have decreased from $210,000 at September 30,
1994 to $77,000 at September 30, 1995. Cash was utilized mainly for working
capital needs and to fund the expansion previously discussed.

         Accounts receivables increased notably from fiscal year 1994. This was
attributable to the opening of six additional primary care Centers and the
overall growth in patient visits to existing Centers.

         The increase in property and equipment is attributable to the purchase
of the Donaldson Center, the equipment needs of new Centers and the up-grading
of equipment at established Centers. The excess of cost over the net assets of
acquired businesses (goodwill) totaled $3,578,000 at September 30, 1995 compared
to $2,651,000 at the end of the previous fiscal year and reflects the medical
practices acquired.

                                 -10-

<PAGE>
         The current portion of debt increased in fiscal year 1995 to $1,245,000
from $543,000 at the end of fiscal year 1994. Long-term debt also increased.
These increases are primarily the result of indebtedness incurred in the
purchases of the Donaldson Center, in the purchase of Summit Medical, and in the
utilization of an operating line of credit.

         Accounts payable increased $1,186,000 during 1995 to $1,653,000 as a
result of the tight cash position of the Company and as a result of the
accelerated growth of the Company during this period. Overall, the Company's
current liabilities exceeded its current assets at September 30, 1995 by
$383,000; working capital needs were funded, in part, by the sale of stock to
Companion HealthCare (a private placement) for $600,000 on November 3, 1995 (see
Subsequent Events section below.)

         Liquidity and Capital Resources

         The Company requires capital principally to fund growth (acquire new
Centers), for working capital needs and for the retirement of indebtedness. The
Company's capital requirements and working capital needs have been funded
through a combination of external financing (including bank debt and proceeds
from the sale of common stock to Companion HealthCare Corporation), internally
generated funds and credit extended by suppliers.

         Operating activities used $460,000 of cash during fiscal year 1995,
compared with $744,000 used during fiscal year 1994. The decrease in operating
cash used during fiscal 1995 is mainly the result of growth in accounts payable
and accrued expenses. Some of these payables were reduced via utilization of the
$600,000 from the November 3, 1995 common stock sale to Companion HealthCare
(see Subsequent Events section below).

         Investing activities used $642,000 of cash during fiscal year 1995
compared with $120,000 in 1994 as a result of expansion efforts. Continued
growth is anticipated during 1996. (See "Subsequent Events" for acquisition
activity in the first quarter of fiscal year 1996.)

         The Company received $1,240,000 during fiscal 1995 in cash resulting
from two private placements of stock with Companion HealthCare Corporation which
was used in part to manage the Company's rapid growth and in part to reduce
debt. Should additional needs arise, the Company may consider additional capital
sources to obtain funding. There is no assurance that any additional financing,
if required, will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.

Earnings and Balance Sheet Analysis for Fiscal Year 1994 Compared to 1993

         Total revenues for fiscal year 1994 increased by 28% to $12,540,000
from $9,799,000 for fiscal year 1993. The Company expanded from 14 to 19 Centers
during this year and was able to hold gross profit margin at about $660,000 for
both years. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" was adopted at the start of fiscal 1994 with the result of
reducing income tax expense for 1994 by approximately $612,000.

Subsequent Events

         In January 1995, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement for
a medical practice in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The acquisition is expected
to become effective prior to December 31, 1995, after certain conditions
precedent occur.

         On November 3, 1995, Companion purchased 218,180 shares of newly issued
common stock of the Company for $2.75 a share, or $599,995. Subsequent to the
transaction, Companion's ownership in the Company was approximately 45%.
Companion has the option to purchase as many shares as may be necessary for
Companion to maintain ownership of 47% of the outstanding common stock of the
Company in the event that the Company issues additional stock to other parties
(excluding shares issued to employees or directors of the Company).

                                  -11-

<PAGE>

         On December 1, 1995, the Company acquired a medical practice in
Greenville, South Carolina. The Company entered into an employment agreement
with the physician who had been the sole shareholder of the acquired medical
practice. The Company also entered into lease agreements for the facility
occupied by and the computer system used by the acquired medical practice.

         Reference is made to the Index to Financial Statements on Page 20 .

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and 
         Financial Disclosure

         On July 27, 1995, the Company notified Scott and Holloway, LLP
(formerly Moore Kirkland Scott & Beauston) that it would not be retained as the
Company's independent accountants for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1995.
The Company's decision not to retain Scott and Holloway, LLP was approved by the
Board of Directors at a meeting held on July 26, 1995 and was not the result of
any prior, existing or expected disagreement with the Company. The reports of
Moore Kirkland Scott & Beauston on the financial statements of the Company for
the fiscal years ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 contained no adverse opinion
or disclaimer of opinion. The reports were modified because of an uncertainty as
to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as a consequence of
losses incurred from continuing operations. This modification has been
subsequently rescended and an unqualified opinion for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 1994 and 1993 has been issued. In connection with its audits of
financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30,
1994 and 1993, and the interim period through July 27, 1995, the Company had no
disagreement with Moore Kirkland Scott & Beauston on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Moore
Kirkland Scott & Beauston, would have caused them to make reference to the
subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their report on the
financial statements for such periods.

         Scott and Holloway, LLP has furnished the Company with a letter
addressed to the SEC stating that they agree with the statements made by the
Company with respect to their dismissal.

         On July 26, 1995, the Company engaged Price Waterhouse LLP as its
independent accountants to audit the Company's financial statements for the
fiscal year ending September 30, 1995. The decision to engage Price Waterhouse
LLP was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting held on
July 26, 1995. During the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 1994 and
1993, the Company did not consult with Price Waterhouse LLP regarding any
matters (a) which were, or should have been, subject to SAS 50, or (b)
concerning the subject matter of a disagreement or reportable event with the
Company's former independent accountants (as described in Regulation S-B, Item
304(a)(2)).

Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant

Directors

The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides for a
classified Board of Directors so that, as nearly possible, one-third of the
Company's Board of Directors is elected each year to serve a three-year term.
Currently, the Board of Directors consists of five directorships with staggered
terms expiring at the Annual Meetings of Shareholders in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
The Company's Bylaws provide the Board of Directors with the power and authority
to determine the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.
At a meeting of the Board of Directors on July 26, 1995, the Board of Directors
voted to increase the size of the Board from three members to the current five
members, with such increase to be effective immediately prior to the election of
directors at the Annual Meeting, which was held September 13, 1995. To give
effect to such increase, the Board of Directors approved the addition of one
directorship to each of the classes of directors whose terms expire at the
Annual Meetings of Shareholders

Existing Stock Option Plans

         Pursuant to the Company's Incentive Stock Option Plan adopted in 1994,
(the "1994 Plan"), "incentive stock options", within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code, may be granted to employees of the Company. The
1994 Plan provides for the granting of options for the purchase of 750,000
shares at 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
Options granted under the 1994 Plan vest at a rate of 33% in each of the three
years following the grant. Vested options become exercisable one year after the
date of grant and can be exercised within ten years of the date of grant,
subject to earlier termination upon cessation of employment. During the year
ended September 30, 1995, no options were exercised. At September 30, 1995,
there were stock options outstanding under the 1994 Plan for 242,000 shares, all
of which were granted in the year ended September 30, 1995.

         The Incentive Stock Option Plan adopted in 1984 (the "1984 Plan")
expired under its terms in December 1993. During the year ended September 30,
1995, no options were exercised and 5,100 options expired. At September 30,
1995, there were stock options outstanding under the 1984 Plan for 15,500 shares
at $.25 per share, all of which were exercisable.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

         The following table sets forth certain information known to the Company
regarding the beneficial ownership of the common stock of the Company as of
September 30, 1995. Information is presented for (i) shareholders owning more
than five percent of the outstanding common stock, (ii) each director and
executive officer of the Company, individually, and (iii) all directors and
executive officers of the Company, as a group. Except as otherwise specified,
each of the shareholders named in the table has indicated to the Company that
such shareholder has sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of common stock beneficially owned by that shareholder. Beneficial ownership
reflected in the table below is determined in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with
respect to securities. Shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of
options currently exercisable or convertible, or exercisable or convertible
within sixty days, are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership
of the person holding such options, but are not deemed outstanding for computing
the percentage ownership of any other person.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

Agreements with Doctor's Care

         General. All of the Company's operations are conducted through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, UCI-SC, which operates a network of twenty-five
freestanding primary care medical Centers located throughout South Carolina, all
of which conduct business under the name "Doctor's Care." In order to comply
with prohibitions of providing medical care, all medical services at these
medical facilities are provided by or under the supervision of Doctor's Care,
P.A., a South Carolina professional association (the "P.A.").

         Facilities Agreement. Pursuant to a Facilities Agreement between UCI-SC
and the P.A. (the "Facilities Agreement"), UCI-SC supplies to the P.A. the
facilities, equipment and assets of the Centers, as well as such non-medical
personnel as are reasonably required by the P.A. in the operation of the
Centers. In exchange, the P.A. provides the necessary staffing for the
performance of medical services at the Centers, including a physician to serve
as Executive Medical Director having overall responsibility for the operations
of the Centers. Pursuant to an employment agreement between M.F. McFarland, III,
M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company ("Dr. McFarland") and
the P.A., Dr. McFarland serves as Executive Medical Director of the Centers. In
September 1994, the Facilities Agreement was renewed for an additional five year
term. In January 1995, the Facilities Agreement was modified to provide UCI-SC
with certain rights to terminate the Facilities Agreement (a) upon the death of
Dr. McFarland, (b) upon Dr. McFarland ceasing to own, either directly or
indirectly, a controlling interest in the P.A., or (c) upon Dr. McFarland
becoming a "disqualified person" as defined by the South Carolina Business
Corporation Act of 1988, as amended.

         Refund Agreement. Pursuant to a Facilities Fee Refund Agreement (the
"Refund Agreement"), entered into among UCI-SC and the P.A., the P.A. was
entitled to receive a refund of a portion of the fees payable to UCI-SC under
the Facilities Agreement with respect to certain Centers. This agreement was
terminated effective October 1, 1995. During the year ended September 30, 1995,
UCI-SC accrued total refunds payable to the P.A. under the Refund Agreement of
$177,000 and made payments of $200,000 against accumulated payables. During the
year ended September 30, 1994, UCI-SC accrued total refunds payable to the P.A.
under the Refund Agreement of $131,000 and made payments of $213,500 against
accumulated payables. At September 30, 1995 and 1994, UCI-SC had a refund
payable to the P.A. of approximately $276,000 and $299,000, respectively.

Facility Leases

         UCI-SC leases seven Centers from Companion HealthCare Corporation under
operating leases with fifteen year terms expiring in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Each
of these leases has a five year renewal option, and a rent guarantee by the P.A.
One of the leases has a purchase option allowing UCI-SC to purchase the facility
at fair market value after February 1, 1995. Total lease payments made by UCI-SC
under these leases during the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 1995,
1994 and 1993 were $271,100, $205,901 and zero, respectively.

    Several of the Centers operated by UCI-SC are leased from entities owned or
controlled by certain principal shareholders and/or members of the Company's
management. The Doctor's Care-Northeast Center is leased from a partnership in
which Dr. McFarland is a general partner. The lease was renewed in October 1994
for a five year term. The lease has two five year renewal options and provides
UCI-SC with an option to purchase the facility at its fair market value after
October 1995. Total lease payments made by UCI-SC under the lease during the
Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $45,600,
$42,696 and $39,554, respectively, plus utilities and real estate taxes. During
the year ended September 30, 1995, the Doctor's Care-Lexington and the Doctor's
Care-Forest Acres Centers were leased from a general partnership in which Dr.
McFarland and Dr. Stout are general partners. The Doctor's Care-Lexington lease
was renewed in October 1994 for a five year term. In August 1995, the Doctor's
Care-

                                 -17-

<PAGE>

Forest Acres facility was sold to an unrelated third
party who leases it to the Company. The Doctor's Care-Lexington lease has a five
year renewal option and provides UCI-SC with an option to purchase the property
at its fair market value at any time during the lease term. Total lease payments
made by UCI-SC under these two leases during the Company's fiscal years ended
September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $90,000, $75,166 and $78,012,
respectively, plus utilities and real estate taxes. The Doctor's Care-West
Columbia and the Doctor's Care-Beltline Centers are leased from a general
partnership in which Dr. McFarland and Dr. Stout are general partners. These two
leases expire in October 1998 and provide for a five year renewal option. Total
lease payments made by UCI-SC under these two leases during the Company's fiscal
years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $84,000, $87,000 and $78,000,
respectively, plus utilities and real estate taxes. In connection with its
agreement to lease these two Centers, UCI-SC guaranteed the lessor's mortgage
debt relating to the two Centers. At September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the
outstanding balance of such debt was $382,697, $386,110 and $395,000,
respectively. The Doctor's Care-West Wateree Center is leased directly from Dr.
McFarland. Total lease payments made by UCI-SC under this lease during the
Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, were $24,666,
$23,333 and $21,522, respectively.

Other Transactions with Related Companies

         Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina ("Blue Cross") owns 100% of
Companion HealthCare Corporation, which owns approximately 45% of the Company's
outstanding common stock. During the Company's fiscal year ended September 30,
1994, UCI-SC purchased a new billing and accounts receivable system from
Companion Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Cross for an
aggregate purchase price of $504,000. The terms of the purchase agreement are
believed to have been no more or less favorable to UCI-SC than the terms that
would have been obtainable through arm's-length negotiations with unrelated
third parties for a similar billing and accounts receivable system, which
includes computer equipment. The Company has the option to purchase the
equipment at the end of the five year lease term for $1. The lease obligation
recorded at September 30, 1995 is $464,361 which includes lease addenda.

         During the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 1994, UCI-SC
entered into an agreement with Company Property and Casualty Insurance Company,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Cross, pursuant to which UCI-SC acts as the
primary care provider for injured workers of firms carrying worker's
compensation insurance through Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company
("CP&C"). Additionally, during the Company's fiscal year ended September 30,
1995, UCI-SC entered into a financing arrangement with CP&C for the purchase of
the Doctor's Care-Donaldson facility, which consists of a note payable in
monthly installments of $4,546 (including 11% interest) from April 1, 1995 to
March 1, 2010, collateralized by certain accounts receivable. The terms of the
agreement with Companion Property and Casualty Insurance Company are believed to
be no more or less favorable to UCI-SC than those that would have been
obtainable through arm's-length negotiations with unrelated third parties for
similar arrangements.

         During the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 1994, UCI-SC began
providing services for a health maintenance organization ("HMO") operated by
Companion HealthCare Corporation, pursuant to which UCI-SC, through the P.A.,
acts as the designated primary care provider for members of the HMO who have
selected the P.A. as their primary care provider. The terms of the agreement
with Companion HealthCare Corporation are believed to be no more or less
favorable to UCI-SC than those that would have been obtainable through arm's
- -length negotiations with unrelated third parties for similar arrangements.

         The employees of the Company are offered health, life, dental and
disability coverage at group rates from Blue Cross and its subsidiaries. The
group rates offered to the employees of the Company are believed to be no more
or less favorable to the Company than those that would have been obtainable
through arm's-length negotiations with unrelated third parties for similar
services.

                        Report of Independent Accountants

November 21, 1995

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. at September 30, 1995, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. The financial statements of
UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. at September 30, 1994 and for each of the two years
in the period then ended were audited by other independent accountants whose
report dated January 26, 1995 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements with an explanatory paragraph that the Company prospectively changed
its method of accounting for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 1994.
This change is described in Notes 1 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

                          UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc.
                   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

                               September 30, 1995

1.       Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. include
the accounts of UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. ("UCI"), its wholly owned
subsidiary, UCI Medical Affiliates of SC ("UCI-SC") and Doctor's Care, PA ("the
P.A."), collectively the "Company". The financial statements of the P.A. are
consolidated with UCI because UCI-SC has unilateral control over the assets and
operations of the P.A. and, notwithstanding the lack of technical majority
ownership, consolidation of the P.A. with UCI is necessary to present fairly the
financial position and results of operations of UCI. UCI-SC provides non-medical
management and administrative functions for 25 medical clinics, operating as
Doctor's Care (the "Centers"). All medical services at the Centers are provided
by or under the supervision of the P.A., which has contracted with UCI-SC to
provide the medical direction of the Centers. The medical directors operate the
Centers under the financial and operational control of UCI-SC. However, medical
supervision of the centers is provided solely by the P.A. The P.A. remits to
UCI-SC all medical service revenues generated by the Centers, net of expenses
incurred by the P.A. This compensation is recorded in the accompanying financial
statements as revenue. Control of the P.A. is perpetual and other than temporary
because of the nature of this relationship and the management agreements between
the entities. The net assets of the P.A. are not material for any period
presented and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Medical Supplies Inventory

The inventory of medical supplies and drugs is carried at the lower of average
cost or market.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is provided principally by the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to twenty years.

Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense. Major renewals
or betterments, which prolong the life of the assets, are capitalized.


                                 -28-

<PAGE>


1.       Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Upon disposal of depreciable property, the asset accounts are reduced by the
related cost and accumulated depreciation. The resulting gains and losses are
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Intangible Assets

The excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired (goodwill) is amortized on
the straight-line method over periods from 15 to 30 years. Subsequent to an
acquisition, the Company continually evaluates whether later events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining balance of goodwill
may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision.
When external factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible
impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related business segment's
discounted cash flows over the remaining life of the goodwill and compares it to
the business segment's goodwill balance to determine whether the goodwill is
recoverable or if impairment exists, in which case an adjustment is made to the
carrying value of the asset.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized at estimated net amounts to be received from employers,
third party payors, and others at the time the related services are rendered.
Capitation payments from payors are paid monthly and are recognized as revenue
during the period in which enrollees are entitled to receive services.

Earnings Per Share

The computation of income per common and common equivalent share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus (in
periods in which they have a dilutive effect) the effect of common shares
issuable from stock options, using the treasury stock method.

Income Taxes

The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), as of October 1,
1993. Under the liability method specified by SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which are
anticipated to be in effect when these differences reverse. The deferred tax
(benefit) provision is the result of the net change in the deferred tax assets
to amounts expected to be realized. Financial statements for the year ended
September 30,1993 reflect income taxes recorded under the deferred method
required under previous accounting standards.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or
less at acquisition date to be cash equivalents.

Reclassifications

Certain 1994 and 1993 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 1995
presentation.

2.       Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consists of the following at September 30:

</TABLE>

At September 30, 1995 and 1994, capitalized leased equipment included above
amounted to approximately $1,651,000 and $647,000, net of accumulated
amortization of $203,000 and $18,000, respectively. Depreciation and
amortization expense equalled $384,638, $196,756 and $114,949 for the years
ended September 30, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

4.       Income Taxes

Effective October 1, 1993, the Company prospectively adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). As permitted under SFAS 109, prior years' financial
statements have not been restated. As of October 1, 1993, the Company had a net
deferred tax asset of $2,718,407, which was fully offset by a valuation
allowance.

The components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes for the years ended
September 30 are as follows:

4.       Income Taxes (continued)

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of certain
items of income and expense, and the changes in the valuation allowance
attributable to deferred tax assets.

The principal sources of temporary differences and the related deferred tax
effects as of September 30, were as follows:

                                              1995           1994

                                           =============    ==============

The sources of significant timing differences for the year ended September 30,
1993 which gave rise to deferred taxes and their effects were as follows:

                                             1993
                                         -------------------

At September 30, 1995 and 1994, the Company's deferred tax assets (liabilities)
and the related valuation allowances are as follows:

                                         1995           1994

6.       Employee Benefit Plans

Pursuant to the Company's incentive stock option plan adopted in 1994, (the
"1994 Plan"), "incentive stock options", within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code, may be granted to employees of the Company. The 1994
Plan provides for the granting of options for the purchase of 750,000 shares at
100% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options granted
under the 1994 Plan vest at a rate of 33% in each of the three years following
the grant. Vested options become exercisable one year after the date of grant
and can be exercised within ten years of the date of grant, subject to earlier
termination upon cessation of employment. During the year ending September 30,
1995, no options were exercised. At September 30, 1995, there were stock options
outstanding under the 1994 plan for 242,000 shares, all of which were granted in
the year ended September 30,1995.

The incentive stock option plan adopted in 1984 (the "1984 Plan") expired under
its terms in December 1993. During the year ending September 30, 1995, no
options were exercised and 5,100 options expired. At September 30, 1995, there
were stock options outstanding under the 1984 Plan for 15,500 shares at $.25 per
share, all of which were exercisable.

The Company has an employee savings plan ( the "Savings Plan") that qualifies as
a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the Savings Plan, participating employees may defer a portion of their
pretax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit.
Effective in June 1995, the Company discontinued its matching contribution.
Prior to that date, the company matched 50% of each employee's contributions up
to a maximum of 2.5% of the employee's earnings. The company's matching
contributions were $71,463, $50,805 and $35,788 in fiscal years 1995, 1994, and
1993, respectively.

7.       Stockholders' Equity

On June 30, 1994, the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to, and a
restatement of, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to provide for a 1 for
5 reverse stock split. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 4,000,000 to
10,000,000 ( as adjusted for the reverse stock split as discussed above) and
increased the par value per share of common stock from one cent ($.01) to five
cents ($.05). In addition, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
authorized the Company to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value
preferred stock to be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors is
authorized, without further action by the stockholders, to designate the rights,
preferences, limitations and restrictions of and upon shares of each series,
including dividend voting, redemption and conversion rights. All references in
the financial statements to average number of shares outstanding and related
prices, per share amounts, common stock and stock option plan data have been
restated to reflect the split .

At September 30, 1995, 257,500 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance
under the Company's incentive stock option plans.

8.       Lease Commitments

HealthCare Corporation. During the Company's fiscal year ended September 30,
1994, UCI-SC purchased a new billing and accounts receivable system from

The employees of the Company are offered health, life, dental and disability
coverage at group rates from Blue Cross and its subsidiaries.

10.      Concentration of Credit Risk

In the normal course of providing health care services, the Company may extend
credit to patients without requiring collateral. Each individual's ability to
pay balances due the Company is assessed and reserves are established to provide

                          UCI MEDICAL AFFILIATES, INC.

         UCI MEDICAL AFFILIATES, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing

integrates and further amends the original Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of this corporation filed on February 1, 1984, in the following manner:

                  The Article numbered FOURTH of the original Restated
         Certificate of Incorporation is amended so as to read in its entirety
         as follows:

                  "FOURTH: After giving effect to Section Seven herein, the
         total number of shares of stock which the corporation shall have
         authority to issue is as follows: Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of

         participating, optional or other rights of the Common Stock and
         Preferred Stock of the corporation, and the qualifications, limitations
         or restrictions thereof, and the authority with respect thereto
         expressly granted to the Board of Directors of the corporation to fix
         any such provisions not fixed by this Certificate:

                  I.       Common Stock

                           Authority is hereby expressly granted to and vested
                  in the Board of Directors of this corporation to provide for
                  the issue of Common Stock. The holders of record of shares of
                  Common Stock shall be entitled to unlimited voting rights
                  equating to one (1) vote per outstanding share of Common Stock
                  on all matters upon which shareholders are entitled to vote.
                  Shares of Common Stock shall have distribution, dividend, and
                  liquidation rights granted by law or declared by resolution or
                  resolutions of the Board of Directors from time to time,
                  except that in the absence of the establishment of liquidation

                  Stock shall be entitled to receive the net assets of this
                  corporation upon dissolution. The distribution, dividend, and
                  liquidation rights associated with the shares of Common Stock
                  will be subordinated only to the comparable distribution,
                  dividend, or liquidation rights associated with shares of
                  certain series of Preferred Stock, if any, but only to the

                  relative, participating, operational or other rights, if any,
                  of each series of Preferred Stock and the qualifications,
                  limitations or restrictions, if any, of such preferences
                  and/or rights (collectively the "Series Terms"), shall be such

                                    (10) Any other designations, powers,
                           preferences, and rights, including, without
                           limitation any qualifications, limitations, or
                           restrictions thereof.

                           Any of the Series Terms, including voting rights, of
                  any series may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable
                  outside the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
                  and the Preferred Stock Series Resolution, provided that the
                  manner in which such facts shall operate upon such Series
                  Terms is clearly and expressly set forth in the Amended and
                  Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in the Preferred
                  Stock Series Resolution,

                           Subject to the provisions of this Article Four,
                  shares of one or more series of Preferred Stock may be
                  authorized or issued from time to time as shall be determined
                  by and for such consideration as shall be fixed by the Board
                  of Directors or a designated committee thereof, in an
                  aggregate amount not exceeding the total number of shares of
                  Preferred Stock authorized by this Amended and Restated
                  Certificate of Incorporation. Except in respect of series
                  particulars fixed by the Board of Directors or its committee
                  as permitted thereby, all shares of Preferred Stock shall be
                  of equal rank and shall be identical. All shares of any one
                  series of Preferred Stock so designated by the Board of
                  Directors shall be alike in every particular, except that
                  shares of any one series issued at different times may differ
                  as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be
                  cumulative."

                  The following addition is added to the original Restated
         Certificate of Incorporation so as to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "SEVENTH: Pursuant to a 1 for 5 reverse stock split, the
         amount of the total authorized Common Stock of this corporation is
         decreased and the number and par value are by these means changed so
         that the authorized Common Stock of this corporation, which, prior to
         the filing of this amendment, was Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of
         Common Stock, having a par value of one cent ($.01) per share,
         amounting in the aggregate to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000),
         shall be Four Million (4,000,000) shares of Common Stock, having a par
         value of five cents ($.05) per share, amounting in the aggregate to Two
         Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) ; provided however, immediately
         after the effectuation of such reverse stock split, the authorized
         Common Stock of this corporation shall be increased so that the
         authorized Common Stock of this corporation shall be Ten Million
         (10,000,000) shares of Common Stock, having a par value of five cents
         ($.05) per share, amounting in the aggregate to Five Hundred Thousand
         Dollars ($500,000).

                  At the time this amendment becomes effective, each five (5)
         prior issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock of this
         corporation, par value one cent ($.01) per share, shall thereby and
         thereupon be combined into one (1) share of validly issued, fully paid
         and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of this corporation, par value
         five cents ($.05) per share. Each person at that time holding of record
         any issued and outstanding share of Common Stock of this corporation
         shall receive upon surrender thereof to the corporation's authorized
         agency a stock certificate or certificates to evidence and represent
         the number of shares of post reverse stock split Common Stock of this
         corporation to which he is entitled after this reverse split; provided,
         however, that this corporation shall not issue fractional shares of
         Common Stock in connection with this reverse stock split, but, in lieu
         thereof, this corporation shall make a cash payment at the rate of
         seventy cents ($.70) and for each share of prior Common Stock to the
         holders thereof who would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional
         shares except for the provisions hereof upon surrender of certificates
         representing those shares to the corporation's authorized agent. The
         ownership of such fractional interests shall not entitle the holder
         thereof to any voting, dividend or other right except the right to
         receive payment therefor as described above.

                                  -45-

                  EIGHTH: A director of the corporation shall not be personally
         liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
         breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for such liability as is
         expressly not subject to limitation under the General Corporation Law
         of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be
         amended to further limit or eliminate such liability.

                  NINTH: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and
         Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of this
         corporation, the terms of the members of the Board of Directors shall
         be staggered in the manner set forth in this Article Nine, in lieu of
         electing the whole number of directors annually. Commencing on the
         effective date of this Article Nine, the directors shall be divided by
         the Board of Directors into three (3) classes, each class to be as
         nearly equal in number as possible. The term of office of directors of
         the first class shall expire at the first annual meeting of
         shareholders after their election, that of the second class shall
         expire at the second annual meeting after the election, and that of the
         third class shall expire at the third annual meeting after their
         election. At each annual meeting after such classification, the number
         of directors equal to the number of the class whose terms expires at
         the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the
         third such succeeding annual meeting. The provisions of this Article
         Nine shall apply only when the Board of Directors consists of three or
         more members; if the Board of Directors consists of less than three
         members, the terms of each such member shall expire at the next annual
         meeting of the shareholders of the corporation.

                  TENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Board of
         Directors, when evaluating any offer by another party to (i) make a
         tender or exchange offer for any equity security of this corporation
         outside of the ordinary course of business, (ii) merge or consolidate
         this corporation with any other corporation, (iii) purchase or
         otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets
         of this corporation, or (iv) undertake any similar extraordinary
         corporate transactions with this corporation, may be its discretion, in
         connection with exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the
         best interests of this corporation and its shareholders, give due
         consideration to: (aa) all relevant factors, including without
         limitation the social, legal, and economic effects on the employees,
         customers, suppliers, and other constituencies of this corporation and
         its subsidiaries, on the communities and geographical areas in which
         this corporation and its subsidiaries operate or are located, and on
         any of the businesses and properties of this corporation or any of its
         subsidiaries, as well as such other factors as the directors deem
         relevant; and (bb) all features of the consideration being offered, not
         only in relation to the then current market price for the corporation's
         outstanding shares of capital stock, but also in relation to the then
         current value of the corporation in a freely negotiated transaction and
         in relation to the Board of Director's estimate of the future value of
         this corporation (including the unrealized value of its properties and
         assets) as an independent going concern."

         3. The text of the original Restated Certificate of Incorporation as
amended or supplemented heretofore is further amended hereby to read as herein
set forth in full:

               "AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

                  The following is a statement of fixing certain of the
         designations and powers, voting powers, preferences, and relative,
         participating, optional or other rights of the Common Stock and
         Preferred Stock of the corporation, and the qualifications, limitations
         or restrictions thereof, and the authority with respect thereto
         expressly granted to the Board of Directors of the corporation to fix
         any such provisions not fixed by this Certificate:

                  I.       Common Stock

                           Authority is hereby expressly granted to and vested
                  in the Board of Directors of this corporation to provide for
                  the issue of Common Stock. The holders of record of shares of
                  Common Stock shall be entitled to unlimited voting rights
                  equating to one (1) vote per outstanding share of Common Stock
                  on all matters upon which shareholders are entitled to vote.
                  Shares of Common Stock shall have distribution, dividend, and
                  liquidation rights granted by law or declared by resolution or
                  resolutions of the Board of Directors from time to time,
                  except that in the absence of the establishment of liquidation

                  corporation upon dissolution. The distribution, dividend, and
                  liquidation rights associated with the shares of Common Stock
                  will be subordinated only to the comparable distribution,
                  dividend, or liquidation rights associated with shares of
                  certain series of Preferred Stock, if any, but only to the

                  relative, participating, operational or other rights, if any,
                  of each series of Preferred Stock and the qualifications,
                  limitations or restrictions, if any, of such preferences
                  and/or rights (collectively the "Series Terms"), shall be such
                  as are stated and expressed in a resolution or resolutions
                  providing for the creation or revision of such Series Terms (a
                  "Preferred Stock Series Resolution") adopted by the Board of
                  Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors to which

                  The powers of the Board of Directors with respect to the
                  Series Terms of a particular series (any of which powers,

                  Directors be specifically delegated to one or more of its
                  committees, except as prohibited by law) shall include, but

                  Directors shall be alike in every particular, except that
                  shares of any one series issued at different times may differ
                  as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be
                  cumulative.

                  FIFTH:  The corporation shall have perpetual existence.

                  SIXTH:  In  furtherance  and not in  limitation  of the powers
                          conferred  by  statute,  the  corporation's  Board of
                          Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, or
                          repeal by Bylaws of the corporation.

                  SEVENTH: Pursuant to a 1 for 5 reverse stock split, the amount
         of the total authorized Common Stock of this corporation is decreased
         and the number and par value are by these means changed so that the
         authorized Common Stock of this corporation, which, prior to the filing
         of this amendment, was Twenty Million (20,000,000) shares of Common
         Stock, having a par value of one cent ($.01) per share, amounting in
         the aggregate to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), shall be Four
         Million (4,000,000) shares of Common Stock, having a par value of five
         cents ($.05) per share, amounting in the aggregate to Two Hundred
         Thousand Dollars ($200,000); provided however, immediately after the
         effectuation of such reverse stock split, the authorized Common Stock
         of this corporation shall be increased so that the authorized Common
         Stock of this corporation shall be Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of
         Common Stock, having a par value of five cents ($.05) per share,
         amounting in the aggregate to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

                  At the time this amendment becomes effective, each five (5)
         prior issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock of this
         corporation, par value one cent ($.01) per share, shall thereby and
         thereupon be combined into one (1) share of validly issued, fully paid
         and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of this corporation, par value
         five cents ($.05) per share. Each person at that time holding of record
         any issued and outstanding share of Common Stock of this corporation
         shall receive upon surrender thereof to the corporation's authorized
         agency a stock certificate or certificates to evidence and represent
         the number of shares of post reverse split; provided, however, that
         this corporation shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock in
         connection with this reverse stock split, but, in lieu thereof, this
         corporation shall make a cash payment at the rate of seventy cents
         ($.70) and for each share of prior Common Stock to the holders thereof
         who would otherwise by entitled to receive fractional shares except for
         the provisions hereof upon surrender of certificates representing those
         shares to the corporation's authorized agent. The ownership of such
         fractional interests shall not entitle the holder thereof to any
         voting, dividend or other right except the right to receive payment
         therefor as described above.

                  EIGHTH: A director of the corporation shall not be personally
         liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
         breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for such liability as is
         expressly not subject to limitation under the General Corporation Law
         of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be
         amended to further limit or eliminate such liability.

                  NINTH: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and
         Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of this
         corporation, the terms of the members of the Board of Directors shall
         be staggered in the manner set forth in this Article Nine, in lieu of
         electing the whole number of directors annually. Commencing on the
         effective date of this Article Nine, the

                                -49-

<PAGE>

         directors shall be divided by
         the Board of Directors into three (3) classes, each class to be as
         nearly equal in number as possible. The term of office of directors of
         the first class shall expire at the first annual meeting of
         shareholders after their election, that of the second class shall
         expire at the second annual meeting after the election, and that of the
         third class shall expire at the third annual meeting after their
         election. At each annual meeting after such classification, the number
         of directors equal to the number of the class whose terms expires at
         the time of such meeting shall be elected to hold office until the
         third such succeeding annual meeting. The provisions of this Article
         Nine shall apply only when the Board of Directors consists of three or
         more members; if the Board of Directors consists of less than three
         members, the term of each such member shall expire at the next annual
         meeting of the shareholders of the corporation.

                  TENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Board of
         Directors, when evaluating any offer by another party to (i) make a
         tender or exchange offer for any equity security of this corporation
         outside of the ordinary course of business, (ii) merge or consolidate
         this corporation with any other corporation, (iii) purchase or
         otherwise acquire all or substantially all of the properties and assets
         of this corporation, or (iv) undertake any similar extraordinary
         corporate transactions with this corporation, may in its discretion, in
         connection with exercise of its judgment in determining what is in the
         best interests of this corporation and its shareholders, give due
         consideration to: (aa) all relevant factors, including without
         limitation the social, legal, and economic effects on the employees,
         customers, suppliers, and other constituencies of this corporation and
         its subsidiaries, on the communities and geographical areas in which
         this corporation and its subsidiaries operate or are located, and on
         any of the businesses and properties of this corporation or any of its
         subsidiaries, as well as such other factors as the directors deem
         relevant; and (bb) all features of the consideration being offered, not
         only in relation to the then current value of the corporation in a
         freely negotiated transaction and in relation to the Board of
         Director's estimate of the future value of this corporation (including
         the unrealized value of its properties and assets) as an independent
         going concern."

         4. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was duly
adopted by the stockholders in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

             ARTICLE VI - INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

         Section 1. General Indemnity. The Corporation shall indemnify any
person who was or is a party or who is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including any action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation, or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such
suit, action or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that in
the case of an action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation, such person
shall be indemnified only to the extent of his expenses (including attorney's
fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or
settlement thereof, and no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the
Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the court in which such action
or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which
the court shall deem proper.

         The termination of any action, suit or proceeding (other than an action
by or in the right of the Corporation) by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which he 

                                -57-

<PAGE>

reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest
of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. To the extent that a
director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this
provision, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by him in connection therewith.

         Any indemnification hereunder (unless required by law or ordered by a
court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper
in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this provision. Such determination shall be made by (a) the Board of
Directors, by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not
obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so
directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the
stockholders of the Corporation.

         The indemnification provided herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which a person indemnified may be entitled under any
statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in
another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director or officer of this Corporation and shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

         The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of
another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and
incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against
such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware or of these Bylaws.

         The Corporation's indemnity of any person who is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation, or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise,
shall be reduced by any amounts such person may collect as indemnification (a)
under any policy of insurance purchased and maintained on his behalf by the
Corporation or (b) from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.

                               ARTICLE VII - STOCK

         Section 1. Certificates of Stock. Each stockholder shall be entitled to
a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, the Chairman of
the Board of Directors and/or the President, and by the Secretary, an Assistant
Secretary, the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, certifying the number of
shares owned by him. Any and all of the signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile.

         Section 2. Transfers of Stock. Transfers of stock shall be made only
upon the transfer books of the Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation
or by the transfer agent designated to transfer shares of the stock of the
Corporation. Except where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 3
of this Article, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved
shall be surrendered for cancellation before a new certificate is issued
therefor. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the
Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper
evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the
duty of the Corporation or its agent to issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto.

                                -58-

<PAGE>

         Section 3. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event of the
loss, theft or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in
its place upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
the certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed. When authorizing the issuance
of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates to give the
Corporation a bond, with acceptable surety in such sum as it may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                             ARTICLE VIII - NOTICES

         Section 1. Notices. Whenever notice is required to be given to any
stockholders, director, officer, or agent, such requirements shall not be
construed to mean personal notice. Unless otherwise stated herein, such notice
may in every incident be effectively given by depositing a writing in the United
States Mail, in a prepaid envelope or by dispatching a prepaid telegram,
addressed to such stockholder, director, officer or agent at his or her address
as the same appears in the books of the Corporation.

The time when such notice is dispatched shall be the time of the giving of the
notice.

         Section 2. Waiver. Whenever any notice is required to be given under
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or otherwise
required by law, a written waiver thereof, signed by the stockholder, director,
officer or agent, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice
is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to be given to
such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be
specified in such a waiver.

                           ARTICLE IX - MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 1. Facsimile Signatures. In addition to the provisions for the
use of facsimile signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in these Bylaws,
facsimile signatures of an officer or officers of the Corporation may be used
whenever and as authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

         Section 2. Corporate Seal. The Board of Directors may provide a
suitable seal, containing the name of the Corporation, which seal shall be in
charge of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. Duplicates of the seal may be
kept and used by persons so designated by the Board.

         Section 3. Reliance Upon Books, Reports and Records. Each director,
each member of any committee designated by the Board of Directors, and each
officer of the Corporation shall, in the performance of his duties, be fully
protected in relying in good faith upon the books of account or other records of
the Corporation, including reports made to the Corporation by any of its
officers, by an independent certified public accountant, or by an appraiser
selected with reasonable care.

     Section  4.  Fiscal  Year.  The  fiscal  year of the  Corporation  shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

thereof or by a majority of the voting stockholders at any regular or special
meeting thereof at which a quorum is present, provided notice of the proposed

                         FACILITIES FEE REFUND AGREEMENT

Parties: UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. (UCI), UCI Medical Affiliates of
South Carolina, Inc. (UCISC) and Doctor's Care, P.A. (PA).

Fee Refund: UCISC shall refund to PA 25% of the annual pre-tax profits arising
directly out of the operations of the Northeast (NE) and Columbia East (CE)
Clinics from the fee paid to UCISC under the Facilities Agreement dated 8 May,
1984. In addition, PA shall receive a refund of 35% of the annual pre-tax
profits after a reduction of $82,000 for NE and $88,000 for CE. With respect to
NE, the additional 35% of pre-tax profit above $82,000 will not be effective
until five years after the merger of NE with UCISC.

UCISC shall also refund, from the fee paid to it under the Facilities Agreement,
35% of the annual pre-tax profits arising directly out of the operations of
Clinics other than NE and CE after a reduction of $180,000 for the Seven Oaks
Clinic (SO) and a 20% return on investment for any new Clinic (including the
cost of all assets acquired and working capital advanced until the Clinic can
fund its own operations).

These calculations shall be made annually within 120 days after the close of
UCISC's fiscal year, and shall be based on financial statements prepared by
UCISC's regularly employed CPA.

Payment of any facilities fee refund shall be made by UCISC within 30 days
following the annual determination of pre-tax profits of the respective Clinics.
For any period less than 12 months, the formula for determining annual pre-tax
profits and reductions before which PA becomes eligible for the additional 35%
refund, shall be prorated.

Amendment of 24 September, 1984: The refund amounts shall be paid to PA based on
the pre-tax profits of the respective Clinics regardless of the fee paid over to
UCISC under the Facilities Agreement. Billings generated by a particular clinic
will be used to the extent necessary to pay wages, salaries and other
compensation to Professionals and other medically related personnel employed at
existing clinics and clinics opened after the execution of this Agreement.

Term: The rights of PA under the Agreement shall continue for the duration of
the Facilities Agreement (five years from Closing Date of Assets Purchase
Agreement).

     Notices: All notices,  requests,  demands and other communications shall be
in writing to be deemed duly given.

     Assignment:  The rights of PA under the  Agreement  are not  assignable  in
whole or in part without the reasonable written consent of UCISC.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     This  Employment  Agreement is made as of the 1st day of October,  1995, by
and between UCI Medical  Affiliates of South  Carolina,  Inc., a South  Carolina
Corporation (UCI), and M. F. McFarland,  III, M. D. ("McFarland"). 

     WHEREAS,  UCI  desires to employ  McFarland,  and  McFarland  desires to be
employed by UCI, in accordance  with the terms and  conditions  hereinafter  set
forth:

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein set
forth, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

     1. Employment.  UCI hereby agrees to employ McFarland to perform the duties
described  in Section 3 below  subject to and in  accordance  with the terms and
conditions hereof, and McFarland hereby accepts such employment.

     2. Term.  The  employment  shall  commence  on the date  hereof,  and shall
continue for a period of Five (5) years unless earlier  terminated in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement.

     3. Duties of McFarland.

                  A. In accepting employment by UCI, McFarland shall undertake
and assume the responsibility of performing for and on behalf of UCI the duties
of the President and Chief Executive Officer of UCI in Columbia, South Carolina.
Except with his written consent, McFarland shall not be permanently assigned to
(i) any position of lower professional status, or (ii) a location outside of
Richland or Lexington Counties, South Carolina.

                  B. Other than McFarland's duties as an employee of Doctor's
Care, P.A., McFarland shall be a full-time employee of UCI, and shall devote his
full working time and efforts to his duties hereunder. McFarland shall perform
all of his duties hereunder to the best of his ability and shall not, directly
or indirectly, engage or participate in any activities in conflict with the best
interests of UCI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, McFarland
shall not engage in any activity for compensation or pecuniary gain other than
his employment hereunder, his association with Doctor's Care, P.A., and passive
investing for the account of himself or members of his household. McFarland
agrees that his total compensation for his service to UCI shall be described in
Section 4 of this Agreement.

              McFarland has entered into a separate Employment Agreement with
respect to his association with Doctor's Care, P.A. His compensation for
services to Doctor's Care, P.A. is described in Section 4 of that Agreement.
McFarland agrees that his total compensation for his service to Doctor's Care,
P.A. is set forth in Section 4 of that Agreement.

     4.  Compensation.  As  compensation  for the  services  to be  rendered  by
McFarland for UCI under this Agreement, McFarland shall be compensated by UCI on
the following basis:

     A. Base Salary. During the term of this Agreement,  McFarland shall receive
from UCI an annual salary of One Hundred  Fifty-Seven  Thousand Five Hundred and
No/100 ($157,500),  payable in pay periods as determined by UCI, but in no event
less frequently than monthly, subject to an annual increase upon approval by the
Board of Directors.

                                 -73-

<PAGE>
     B.  Dues.  During  the term of this  Agreement,  UCI  shall pay all dues of
McFarland as a member of one private club not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars and
No/100  ($500.00) per month for the purpose of entertainment of UCI's clients in
connection with the performance of McFarland's duties.

     C.  Vacation. During the term of this Agreement, McFarland shall be
entitled to a total of thirty (30) business days of paid leave to attend
conventions and professional meetings and vacation time each calendar year.
Such vacation and leave days are to be taken at such time or times as
McFarland may reasonably request, subject to UCI's convenience and prior
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Vacation and leave
time may cumulate year-to-year up to a maximum of 60 days.

     D.  Automobile.  During the term of this  Agreement,  UCI shall  provide to
McFarland the use of one (1) automobile.

     E.  Reimbursement for Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, UCI
shall reimburse McFarland for all reasonable expenses in an aggregate amount
equal to, or less than Seven Thousand five hundred dollars and No/100
($7,500.00) per annum incurred by McFarland for the benefit of UCI in the
performance of his duties hereunder. Reimbursement for aggregate expenses each
calendar year in excess of such amount shall require the prior written approval
of the Board of Directors of UCI.

     F.  Other Benefits. During the term of McFarland's employment with UCI,
McFarland shall receive from UCI such other benefits (e.g. health insurance
coverage, life insurance coverage, participation in pension plans, and
participation in stock option plans, etc.) reasonably comparable to, and no
worse than, those benefits, if any, generally provided to other senior
executives of UCI. Additionally, during his employment with UCI, McFarland will
be provided at UCI's costs, with a term life insurance policy that at the time
of McFarland's death will pay One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) to his spouse or
other designated beneficiary(s).

     G.  Incentive Bonus. On or about the end of UCI's fiscal year, the Board
shall determine what, if any, Incentive Bonus payment shall be made to
McFarland. This Incentive Bonus payment, if any, shall be based on two
variables: UCI's Net Income (Loss) for the previous fiscal year and the Gross
Revenue for the same year, as set forth in Addendum A, which is attached hereto.
The attached Addendum specifies the total Incentive Bonus, if any, to be paid to
McFarland under differing scenarios based on UCI's Net Income (Loss) and Gross
Revenue for the previous year. The Board, in making its decision as to what, if
any, Incentive Bonus shall be paid to McFarland, shall be governed by Addendum
A, and shall have no authority to alter or deviate from the amount, if any, of
the Inventive Bonus payment mandated by the Net Income/Gross Revenues grid in
Addendum A. In the event UCI pays McFarland an Incentive Bonus, payment shall be
in the form of cash.

     H.  Discretionary Bonus. On or about the end of UCI's fiscal year, the
Board shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether or not McFarland is to
be awarded a discretionary bonus, not to exceed 10% of his annual base salary.
This Discretionary Bonus, if any, shall be in addition to, and distinct from
any other compensation or bonus payment to McFarland, provided, however,
nothing contained herein shall be construed in any way to obligate UCI to pay
a Discretionary Bonus to McFarland. The factors to be reviewed by the Board
in determining whether or not a Discretionary Bonus, if any, shall be paid to
McFarland shall include the following:

     1.  McFarland's  ability and success in recruiting  and  retaining  quality
physicians.

     2.  McFarland's  ability and success in recruiting  and retaining a quality
senior management team.

     3. McFarland's ability and success in positioning UCI for implementation of
managed care.

                                   -74-

<PAGE>

     4. McFarland's ability and success in developing a long-term strategic plan
for UCI.

In the event UCI pays McFarland a Discretionary Bonus, payment shall be in the
form of cash.

              5. Confidentiality and Secrecy. McFarland acknowledges that in and
as a result of his employment hereunder, he will be making use of, acquiring,
and/or adding to confidential information of a special and unique nature and
value relating to UCI business, including without limitation technological
know-how, copyrights, proprietary information, trade secrets, systems,
procedures, manuals, confidential reports, records, operational expertise, lists
of customers and projects, the nature and type of services rendered by UCI, the
equipment and methods used and preferred by UCI customers, and the fees paid by
inducement to UCI to enter into this Agreement and to pay to McFarland the
compensation stated in Section 4 herein, McFarland covenants and agrees that
during the term of his employment hereunder, and for five (5) years after the
termination thereof, he shall not, directly or indirectly, make use of, or
disclose to any person, any confidential information of UCI or its affiliates.
McFarland agrees that he will never disclose trade secrets of UCI and assigns
his rights to confidential information as "work made for hire" to UCI.

              6. Covenants Against Competition. In view of the unique value to
UCI of the services of McFarland for which UCI has contracted hereunder, because
of the confidential information to be obtained by or disclosed to McFarland, as
herein above set forth, and because McFarland's employment hereunder will result
in McFarland's development of a unique relationship with customers, suppliers
and employees as a material inducement to UCI to enter into this Agreement and
to pay to McFarland the compensation stated in Section 4 hereof, McFarland
covenants and agrees as follows:

                  A. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of two (2) years after the termination of McFarland's employment hereunder for
any reason, McFarland shall not directly or indirectly solicit or divert
employment of any employee of UCI's business or employ any person previously
employed by UCI or its affiliates.

                  B. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of two (2) years after the termination of McFarland's employment whereunder for
any reason, McFarland shall not directly or indirectly solicit, divert, or
convert, or assist another person or entity to solicit, divert or convert, the
customers of UCI or its affiliates to any other company or entity.

                  C. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of two (2) years after the termination of McFarland's employment with UCI,
McFarland shall not within the geographic area specified below engage in any
business or perform any services, directly or indirectly, in competition with
the business of UCI or its affiliates or have any interest, whether as a
proprietor, partner, employee, stockholder (directly or beneficially),
principal, agent, consultant, director, officer or in any other capacity or
manner whatsoever, in any enterprise that shall so engage, except that McFarland
shall be permitted to own for investment purposes only, directly or
beneficially, up to (but not more than) 2% in the aggregate of the stock of a
competing corporation which is publicly-traded on a national stock exchange or
the NASDAQ National Market System, so long as McFarland is not a controlling
person of, or a member of a group that controls, such corporation and McFarland
is not otherwise affiliated in any capacity with such corporation. The
restrictions to this Section 6(C) shall apply everywhere within a five (5) mile
radius of (i) any primary or urgent care facility owned or operated by UCI or an
affiliate, and (ii) each other location where UCI or any affiliate maintains an
office, in existence as of the date of such termination.

              7.  Reasonableness, Enforceability and Remedies.

                  A. McFarland has carefully read and considered the provisions
of Section 5, 6 and 7, and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions set
forth in these Sections, including, but not limited to, the time period of
restriction and geographic limitations set forth in Section 6, are fair and
reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the interest of UCI
and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and affiliates.

                               -75-

<PAGE>

                  B. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any of
the provisions of Sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof or any parts thereof shall be held
to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions or parts thereof shall
nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or
unenforceable portions or parts had not been included therein. In the event that
any provision of Sections 5 and 6 hereof relating to the time period and/or
geographic restrictions and/or related aspects shall be declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum restrictiveness such court deems
reasonable and enforceable, the time period and/or geographic restrictions
and/or related aspects deemed reasonable and enforceable by the court shall
become and thereafter be the maximum restriction in such regard, and the
restriction shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent deemed reasonable by
such court.

                  C. McFarland acknowledges that the services he is to render
are of a special and unusual character with a unique value to UCI and its
affiliates, the loss of which cannot adequately be compensated by damages in an
action at law. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by McFarland of any
of the provisions of Section 5 or 6 hereof, UCI or its affiliates, in addition
to and not in limitation of, any other rights, remedies, or damages available to
UCI or its affiliates under this Agreement, shall be entitled to a permanent
injunction in order to prevent or restrain any such breach by McFarland or by
McFarland's partners, agents, representatives, servants, employees, consulting
clients, and/or any and all persons directly or indirectly acting for or with
him.

                  D. McFarland covenants and agrees that if he shall violate any
of his covenants or agreements under Section 5 or 6 hereof, UCI or its
affiliates shall be entitled to: (i) an accounting and repayment of all profits,
compensation, commissions, remuneration, or other benefits that McFarland
directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of, growing
out of, or in connection with, any such violation; (ii) recover actual damages
incurred by UCI or its affiliates as a result of any such violation; (iii) any
injunctive relief to which UCI or its affiliates is or may be entitled by law,
in equity, or under this Agreement; and (iv) exercise its other rights
respecting a breach of this Agreement as set forth herein.

     E. McFarland's  obligations  under Section 5 and 6 hereof shall survive any
termination of employment hereunder.

              8.  Termination

                  A. For Cause by UCI. Notwithstanding any other provisions
hereof, UCI may terminate McFarland's employment under this Agreement

felony; incompetence in the performance of material duties on behalf of UCI;
violation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; willful or recurring
insubordination; failure to attempt, in good faith, to comply with reasonable
instructions of UCI; if McFarland's license to practice medicine in the State of
South Carolina is revoked or otherwise terminated; or if McFarland fails to
follow accepted medical practices or is guilty of misconduct under the
principles of medical ethics of the American Medical Association. All
compensation (including without limitation the Base Salary, and all
prerequisites and fringe benefits) to which McFarland would otherwise be
entitled shall be discontinued and forfeited as of the effective date of such
termination.

                  B. Without Cause by UCI. UCI may terminate this Agreement
"without cause" at any time upon written notice to McFarland. In the event of
such termination, McFarland shall be paid a lump sum severance payment equal to
two (2) times his last 2 years of Base Salary plus Incentive and Discretionary
Bonuses. All other compensation (including without limitation any prerequisites
and fringe benefits, if any) to which McFarland would otherwise be entitled (for
periods after the effective date of such termination) shall be discontinued and
forfeited as of the effective date of such termination.

     C. Termination by McFarland.  McFarland may with or without cause terminate
this  Agreement upon (60) days prior written notice to UCI. In the event of such

prerequisites and fringe benefits, if any) to which McFarland would otherwise be
entitled  (for periods  after the effective  date of the  termination)  shall be
discontinued and forfeited as of the effective date of such termination.

                  D. Disability. In the event of McFarland's disability during
employment under this Agreement, then employment under this Agreement shall
terminate. For purposes of this Agreement, except as provided herein below,
"disability" shall mean the inability of McFarland, due to sickness or other
incapacity, to perform his duties under his Agreement for a period in excess of
one hundred and eighty (180) substantially consecutive days. Such termination
shall become effective at UCI's election upon the expiration of such one hundred
and eighty (180) day period of disability. Upon termination of employment under
this Agreement due to McFarland's disability, McFarland shall be entitled to
payment of his Base Salary up to the date of termination.

     E. Death.  In the event  McFarland dies during this term of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall terminate and UCI shall pay to McFarland's  estate all Base
Salary accrued but unpaid through the date of McFarland's death.

     9. Burden of Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of UCI, McFarland,  UCI's affiliates, and their respective heirs,
personal and legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

     10.  Assignment.  This  Agreement and any rights  hereunder are personal to
McFarland and shall not be assigned or otherwise transferred by McFarland.

     11. Governing Law/Jurisdiction. The construction and interpretation of
this Agreement shall at all times and in all respects be governed by the laws
of the State of South Carolina. McFarland and UCI hereby (i) agree that any

litigation, action or proceeding based upon improper venue or inconvenient
forum, and (iii) irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in
any such litigation, action or proceeding. For all purposes of this Agreement,
McFarland and UCI hereby further agree that service of process upon McFarland
and UCI may be affected pursuant to United States mail.

     12. Usage. The section and paragraph headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Terms such as "hereof", "herein",

contest clearly requires otherwise.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     This Employment Agreement is made as of the 1st day of October 1995, by and
between  Doctor's  Care,  P.A.,  a  South  Carolina   professional   corporation
("Employer"), and M.F. McFarland, III, M.D. ("McFarland") .

         WHEREAS, Employer is a South Carolina professional association and is
authorized to engage in the practice of medicine in South Carolina through
individuals so licensed in South Carolina; and

         WHEREAS, Employer desires to employ McFarland, and McFarland desires to
be employed by Employer, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereinafter
set forth:

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein set
forth, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

     1.  Employment.  Employer hereby agrees to employ  McFarland to perform the
duties  described in Section 3 below subject to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions hereof, and McFarland hereby accepts such employment.

     2. Term.  The  employment  shall  commence  on the date  hereof,  and shall
continue  for a  period  of  five  ( 5 )  years  unless  earlier  terminated  in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement.

         3.       Duties of McFarland.

                  A. In accepting employment by Employer, McFarland shall
undertake and assume the responsibility of performing for and on behalf of
Employer the duties of the President of Employer in Columbia, South Carolina.
Except with his written consent, McFarland shall not be permanently assigned to
(i) any position of lower professional status, or (ii) a location outside of
Richland or Lexington Counties, South Carolina.

                  B. Other than McFarland's duties as an employee of UCI Medical
Affiliates of South Carolina, Inc., during the term of this Agreement McFarland
shall be a full-time employee of Employer, and shall devote his full working
time and efforts to his duties hereunder. McFarland shall perform all of his
duties hereunder to the best of his ability and shall not, directly or
indirectly, engage or participate in any activities in conflict with the best
interests of Employer, and will conduct all activities in strict loyalty to
Employer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, McFarland shall not
engage in any activity for compensation or pecuniary gain other than his
employment hereunder, his employment with UCI Medical Affiliates of South
Carolina, Inc., and passive investing for the account of himself or members of
his household.

     4.  Compensation.  As  compensation  for the  services  to be  rendered  by
McFarland for Employer under this  Agreement,  McFarland shall be compensated by
Employer on the following basis:

                                  -81-

<PAGE>

     A. Base Salary. During the term of this Agreement,  McFarland shall receive
from Employer an annual salary of One Hundred Fifty-Seven  Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars and No/100  ($157,500.00 ). Dollars payable in pay periods as determined
by the Employer, but in no event less frequently than monthly.

                  B. Vacation. During the term of this Agreement, McFarland
shall be entitled to a total of thirty (30) business days of paid leave to
attend conventions and professional meetings and vacation time each calendar
year. Such vacation and leave days are to be taken at such time or times as
McFarland may reasonably request, subject to the Employer's convenience and
prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Vacation and
leave time may cumulate year to year up to a maximum of 60 days.

     C. Other  Benefits.  During  the term of this  Agreement,  McFarland  shall
receive from Employer such other benefits (e.g., health insurance coverage, life
insurance  coverage,  participation in pension plans, and participation in stock
option  plans,  etc.  )  reasonably  comparable  to,  and no worse  than,  those
benefits, if any, generally provided to other senior executives of Employer.

         The compensation stated above is intended to be the total compensation
paid to McFarland.

         5. Confidentiality and Secrecy. McFarland acknowledges that in and as a
result of his employment hereunder, he will be making use of, acquiring, and/or
adding to confidential information of a special and unique nature and value
relating to Employer's business, including without limitation technological
knowhow, copyrights, proprietary information, trade secrets, systems,
procedures, manuals, confidential reports, records, operational expertise, lists
of customers and projects, the nature and type of services rendered by Employer,
the equipment and methods used and preferred by Employer's customers, and the
fees paid by them (all of which are deemed for all purposes confidential and
proprietary). As a material inducement to Employer to enter into this Agreement
and to pay to McFarland the compensation stated in Section 4 herein, McFarland
covenants and agrees that during the term of his employment hereunder, and for
five (5) years after the termination thereof, he shall not, directly or
indirectly, make use of, or disclose to any person, any confidential information
of Employer or its affiliates.

         6. Covenants Against Competition. In view of the unique value to
Employer of the services of McFarland for which Employer has contracted
hereunder, because of the confidential information to be obtained by or
disclosed to McFarland, as hereinabove set forth, and because McFarland's
employment hereunder will result in McFarland's development of a unique
relationship with customers, suppliers and employees, as a material inducement
to Employer to enter into this Agreement and to pay to McFarland the
compensation stated in Section 4 hereof, McFarland covenants and agrees as
follows:

                  A. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of two (2) years after the termination of McFarland's employment hereunder for
any reason, McFarland shall not directly or indirectly solicit or divert
employment of any employee of Employer's business or employ any person
previously employed by Employer or its affiliates.

                  B. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of two (2) years after the termination of McFarland's employment hereunder for
any reason, McFarland 

                                 -82-

<PAGE>

shall not directly or indirectly solicit, divert, or convert, or assist
another  person or entity  to  solicit,  divert or  convert,  the  customers  of
Employer or its affiliates to any other company or entity.

                  C. During McFarland's employment hereunder, and for a period
of one (1) year after the termination of McFarland's employment with Employer
for any reason, McFarland shall not within the geographic area specified below
engage in any business or perform any services, directly or indirectly, in
competition with the business of Employer or its affiliates or have any
interest, whether as a proprietor, partner, employee, stockholder (directly or
beneficially), principal, agent, consultant, director, officer, or in any other
capacity or manner whatsoever, in any enterprise that shall so engage; except
that McFarland shall be permitted to own for investment purposes only, directly
or beneficially, up to (but not more than) 2% in the aggregate of the stock of a
competing corporation which is publicly-traded on a national stock exchange or
the NASDAQ National Market System, so long as McFarland is not a controlling
person of or a member of a group that controls, such corporation and McFarland
is not otherwise affiliated in any capacity with such corporation. The
restrictions of this Section 6(C) shall apply everywhere within a five (5) mile
radius of (i) any primary or urgent care facility owned or operated by Employer
or an affiliate, and (ii) each other location where Employer or any affiliate
maintains an office, in existence as of the date of such termination.

         7.       Reasonableness, Enforceability and Remedies.

                  A. McFarland has carefully read and considered the provisions
of Section 5,6, and 7, and , having done so, agrees that the restrictions set
forth in these Sections, including, but not limited to, the time period of
restriction and geographic limitations set forth in Section 6, are fair and
reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the interest of
Employer and its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and affiliates.

                  B. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any of
the provisions of Sections 5, 6, or 7 hereof or any parts thereof shall be held
to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions or parts thereof shall
nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or
unenforceable portions or parts had not been included therein. In the event that
any provision of Sections 5 or 6 hereof relating to the time period and/or
geographic restrictions and/or related aspects shall be declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum restrictiveness such court deems
reasonable and enforceable, the time period and/or geographic restrictions
and/or related aspects deemed reasonable and enforceable by the court shall
become and thereafter be the maximum restriction in such regard, and the
restriction shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent deemed reasonable by
such court.

                  C. McFarland acknowledges that the services he is to render
are of a special and unusual character with a unique value to Employer and its
affiliates, the loss of which cannot adequately be compensated by damages in an
action at law. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by McFarland of any
of the provisions of Sections 5 or 6 hereof, Employer or its affiliates, in
addition to and not in limitation of, any other rights, remedies, or damages
available to Employer or its affiliates under this Agreement, shall be entitled
to a permanent injunction in order to prevent or restrain any such breach by
McFarland or by McFarland's partners, agents, representatives, servants,
employers, employees, consulting clients, and/or any and all persons directly or
indirectly acting for or with him.

                                -83-

<PAGE>

                  D. McFarland covenants and agrees that if he shall violate any
of his covenants or agreements under Section 5 or 6 hereof, Employer or its
affiliates shall be entitled to: (i) an accounting and repayment of all profits,
compensation, commissions, remuneration, or other benefits that McFarland
directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of, growing
out of, or in connection with, any such violation; (ii) recover actual damages
incurred by Employer or its affiliates as a result of any such violation; (iii)
any injunctive relief to which Employer or its affiliates is or may be entitled
at law, in equity, or under this Agreement; and (iv) exercise its other rights
respecting a breach of this Agreement as set forth herein.

     E. McFarland's  obligations under Sections 5 and 6 hereof shall survive any
termination of employment hereunder.

         8.       Termination.

                  A. For Cause By Employer. Notwithstanding any other provision
  hereof, Employer may terminate McFarland's employment under this Agreement
  immediately at any time for "cause". For purposes hereof the term "cause"
  shall include, but not be limited to, the commission of any of the following
  by McFarland: dishonesty; theft; unethical business conduct; indictment for a
  felony; incompetence in the performance of material duties on behalf of
  Employer; violation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement; willful or
  recurring insubordination; failure to attempt, in good faith, to comply with
  reasonable instructions of Employer; McFarland's license to practice medicine
  in the State of South Carolina is revoked or otherwise terminated; or
  McFarland fails to follow accepted medical practices or is guilty of
  misconduct under the principles of medical ethics of the American Medical
  Association. All compensation (including without limitation the Base Salary,
  and all perquisites and fringe benefits) to which McFarland would otherwise be
  entitled shall be discontinued and forfeited as of the effective date of such
  termination.

                  B. Termination By McFarland. McFarland may with or without
cause terminate this Agreement upon sixty(60) days prior written notice to
Employer. In the event of such termination, all compensation (including without
limitation the Base Salary and any perquisites and fringe benefits, if any) to
which McFarland would otherwise be entitled (for periods after the effective
date of the termination) shall be discontinued and forfeited as of the effective
date of such termination.

                  C. Disability. In the event of the McFarland's disability
during employment under this Agreement, then employment under this Agreement
shall terminate. For purposes of this Agreement, except as provided herein
below, "disability" shall mean the inability of McFarland, due to sickness or
other incapacity, to perform his duties under this Agreement for a period in
excess of one hundred eighty (180) substantially consecutive days. Such
termination shall become effective at Employer's election upon the expiration of
such one hundred eighty (180) day period of disability. Upon termination of
employment under this Agreement due to McFarland's disability, McFarland shall
be entitled to payment of his Base Salary up to the date of termination.

     D. Death.  In the event  McFarland dies during the term of this  Agreement,
this Agreement shall terminate and Employer shall pay to McFarland's  estate all
Base Salary accrued but unpaid through the date of McFarland's death.

                                   -84-

inure to the benefit of Employer,  McFarland,  Employer's affiliates,  and their
respective heirs, personal and legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

     10.  Patients and Records.  Employer and  McFarland  agree that all patient
lists,  records,  and charts are the  property  of the  Employer,  and that upon
termination of this  Agreement,  McFarland  shall not be entitled to receive any
patient lists, records, or charts.

     11.  Assignment.  This  Agreement and any rights  hereunder are personal to
McFarland and shall not be assigned or otherwise  transferred by McFarland.

     12.  Governing Law/Jurisdiction. The construction and interpretation of
this Agreement shall at all times and in all respects be governed by the laws of
the State of South Carolina. McFarland and Employer hereby (i) agree that any

waives any objection which it might have now or hereafter to any such
litigation, action or proceeding based upon improper venue or inconvenient
forum, and (iii) irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any
such litigation, action or proceeding. For all purposes of this Agreement,

Stout agrees that he will never disclose trade secrets of UCI and assigns his
rights to confidential information as "work made for hire" to UCI.

              6. Covenants Against Competition. In view of the unique value to
UCI of the services of Stout for which UCI has contracted hereunder, because of
the confidential information to be obtained by or disclosed to Stout, as herein
above set forth, and because Stout's employment hereunder will result in Stout's
development of a unique relationship with customers, suppliers and employees as
a material inducement to UCI to enter into this Agreement and to pay to Stout
the compensation stated in Section 4 hereof, Stout covenants and agrees as
follows:

                  A. during Stout's employment hereunder, and for a period of
two (2) years after the termination of Stout's employment hereunder for any
reason, Stout shall not directly or indirectly solicit or divert employment of
any employee of UCI's business or employ any person previously employed by UCI
or its affiliates.

                  B. During Stout's employment hereunder, and for a period of
two (2) years after the termination of Stout's employment whereunder for any
reason, Stout shall not directly or indirectly solicit, divert, or convert, or
assist another person or entity to solicit, divert or convert, the customers of
UCI or its affiliates to any other company or entity.

                  C. During Stout's employment hereunder, and for a period of
two (2) years after the termination of Stout's employment with UCI, Stout shall
not within the geographic area specified below engage in any business or perform
any services, directly or indirectly, in competition with the business of UCI or
its affiliates or have any interest, whether as a proprietor, partner, employee,
stockholder (directly or beneficially), principal, agent, consultant, director,
officer or in any other capacity or manner whatsoever, in any enterprise that
shall so engage, except that Stout shall be permitted to own for investment
purposes only, directly or beneficially, up to (but not more than) 2% in the
aggregate of the stock of a competing corporation which is publicly-traded on a
national stock exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System, so long as Stout
is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, such
corporation and Stout is not otherwise affiliated in any capacity with such
corporation. The restrictions to this Section 6(C) shall apply everywhere within
a five (5) mile radius of (i) any primary or urgent care facility owned or
operated by UCI or an affiliate, and (ii) each other location where UCI or any
affiliate maintains an office, in existence as of the date of such termination.

              7.  Reasonableness, Enforceability and Remedies.

                  A. Stout has carefully read and considered the provisions of
Section 5, 6 and 7, and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions set forth
in these Sections, including, but not limited to, the time period of restriction
and geographic limitations set forth in Section 6, are fair and reasonable and
are reasonably required for the protection of the interest of UCI and its
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, and affiliates.

     B. In the event that,  notwithstanding the foregoing, any of the provisions
of Sections 5, 6 and 7 hereof or any parts thereof shall beheld to be invalid or
unenforceable,  the remaining  provisions  or parts  thereof shall  nevertheless
continue  to be valid and  enforceable  as though the  invalid or  unenforceable
portions or parts had not been included therein. In the event that any provision
of Sections 5 and 6 hereof

                               -89-

<PAGE>

relating to the time period and/or geographic restrictions and/or related
aspects shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the
maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the time
period and/or geographic restrictions and/or related aspects deemed reasonable
and enforceable by the court shall become and thereafter be the maximum
restriction in such regard, and the restriction shall remain enforceable to the
fullest extent deemed reasonable by such court.

     C. Stout  acknowledges  that the  services he is to render are of a special
and unusual character with a unique value to UCI and its affiliates, the loss of
which cannot  adequately be  compensated  by damages in an action at law. In the
event of a breach  or  threatened  breach by Stout of any of the  provisions  of
Section  5 or 6  hereof,  UCI or  its  affiliates,  in  addition  to and  not in
limitation of, any other rights,  remedies,  or damages  available to UCI or its
affiliates under this Agreement,  shall be entitled to a permanent injunction in
order to prevent or restrain  any such  breach by Stout or by Stout's  partners,
agents, representatives, servants, employees, consulting clients, and/or any and
all persons directly or indirectly acting for or with him.

                  D. Stout covenants and agrees that if he shall violate any of
his covenants or agreements under Section 5 or 6 hereof, UCI or its affiliates
shall be entitled to: (I) an accounting and repayment of all profits,
compensation, commissions, remuneration, or other benefits that Stout directly
or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of, growing out of, or
in connection with, any such violation; (ii) recover actual damages incurred by
UCI or its affiliates as a result of any such violation; (iii) any injunctive
relief to which UCI or its affiliates is or may be entitled by law, in equity,
or under this Agreement; and (iv) exercise its other rights respecting a breach
of this Agreement as set forth herein.

     E.  Stout's  obligations  under  Section 5 and 6 hereof  shall  survive any
termination of employment hereunder.

              8.  Termination

                  A. For Cause by UCI. Notwithstanding any other provisions
hereof, UCI may terminate Stout's employment under this Agreement immediately at

Stout's license to practice medicine in the State of South Carolina is revoked

or is guilty of misconduct under the principles of medical ethics of the
American Medical Association. All compensation (including without limitation the

otherwise be entitled shall be discontinued and forfeited as of the effective
date of such termination.

                  B. Disability. In the event of Stout's disability during

of disability. Upon termination of employment under this Agreement due to
Stout's disability, Stout shall be entitled to payment of his Salary up to the
date of termination.

     C. Death. In the event Stout dies during this term of this Agreement,  this
Agreement  shall  terminate and UCI shall pay to Stout's  estate all Base Salary
accrued but unpaid through the date of Stout's death.

     9. Burden of Benefit. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of UCI, Stout,  UCI's  affiliates,  and their  respective  heirs,

                      his full-time professional skill and attention to the
                      performance of services in the practice for the benefit of
                      Employer at Doctor's Care Beltline or such other clinic
                      within the Columbia, South Carolina area as shall be
                      reasonably assigned by Employer. Employee's duty schedule
                      shall be determined by Employer and Employee shall provide
                      such emergency evening and weekend coverage as shall be
                      needed and be reasonably assigned to Employee by Employer.

                  B.  Employee shall not engage in any outside professional

                      profession in Employer's interest, will faithfully adhere
                      to the principles and ethics of the profession, and will
                      carefully avoid any and all personal acts, habits and

                      indirectly, 

                                   -94-

                      Employee's professional reputation or that of
                      any other Employee of Employer, or which might otherwise
                      be detrimental to any interest of Employer.

                      report fees, speaker feets, etc., shall be the property of
                      Employer. Accordingly, Employee acknowledges that
                      Employee's employment renders him an agent and servant of
                      Employer and does not confer upon Employee any ownership
                      interest in or professional claim upon any fees charged by
                      Employer for Employee's services, whether said fees are
                      collected during Employee's employment or after
                      termination thereof.

                           this Agreement, Employer shall pay the Employee an

                           ($ 160,000.00) per year, payable bi-weekly.

                  (B)      Changes in Compensation. From time to time, increases
                           in the Employee's salary may be made, said increases
                           to be reflected on the "Schedule of Compensation"

                           Employee's compensation arrangement with respect to
                           the payment of a bonus for superior performance;
                           provided however that the decision to make bonus
                           payments, if any, shall be at the sole discretion of
                           Employer.

         (4)      Fringe Benefits. As further consideration for the performance

                  Employer and also for inclusion in any group-term life
                  insurance plan maintained by Employer. However, Employee
                  understands that the decision to maintain any such plans shall
                  be in sole discretion of Employer.

                  (A) Health Insurance  Coverage.  Employer,  shall provide for 
                  Employee such health  coverage as provided to other  employees

                  the  same  basis  as is  provided  to  other  senior

                  to four weeks paid vacation. All above leave shall be taken on
                  reasonable prior notice and at such time or times as shall be
                  agreed to by Employer and that does not interfere with proper
                  operation of the Practice. In addition, Employee is entitled
                  to one week of paid leave for Continuing Medical Education.

         (6)      Inability to Perform Essential Services. If Employee is unable
                  to perform the essential professional services contemplated by
                  this agreement as a result of illness or incapacity, Employee
                  shall continue to receive those benefits which become payable
                  to Employee under contracts, if any, provided for Employee by
                  Employer. Anything to the contrary contained herein
                  notwithstanding if Employee is not able to resume the
                  performance of such essential professional duties within
                  ninety (90) days of the date Employee was first unable to
                  perform such duties, Employee may be deemed, at the sole
                  discretion of the Employer, to have terminated this Agreement
                  and Employer shall have the right to pursue all remedies set
                  forth herein related to such a termination.

                  (A)      Facilities. Employer shall provide and pay for
                           suitable office space and facilities, furniture,
                           fixtures, equipment, supplies, employees and
                           assistants necessary and appropriate for the proper
                           performance of the duties of Employee.

Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000)  in coverage  shall be through the South  Carolina
Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriters  Association ("JUA"); the excess coverage
shall be  provided  through  the  South  Carolina  Patients'  Compensation  Fund
("PCF").  Employee  understands that the amount of coverage  provided by JUA and
PCF may not be  adequate  to protect  Employee  against  all claims and that the
responsibility of securing additional insurance coverage, if any, is solely that
of Employee.

     (C) License Fees,  Memberships and Dues. Employer shall either pay or, upon
proof of payment by the Employee, reimburse up to $300, to Employee for the cost
of professional license fees, and the cost of reasonable professional membership

                           income tax purposes.

                  this Agreement.

                           indirectly, plan, operate, organize or otherwise be
                           involved in any primary or urgent care facility of a
                           type similar to those operated by Employer other than
                           on behalf of Employer. Employee further agrees that
                           so long as this Agreement is in effect, Employee will

                           business activity competitive with the work Employee
                           performs for Employer.

                               -98-

     B.  Restrictive  Covenant.  In addition to (but not in  limitation  of) the
restrictions  of  Section  14 (A),  for the period of  Employee's  retention  by
Employer  plus a period of two (2) years after  termination  of this  Agreement,
Employee shall not,  directly or indirectly  engage in, or assist another person
or entity to engage in, any sales of products and services furnished (or similar
business  operated) by Employer in competition  with Employer  within a five (5)

Sections  14 ^A and B, for the  period  of  Employee's  retention  by  Employer,

as the  holder  for  investment  purposes  only  of up to 2% of the  outstanding
capital stock of any  corporation  which is publicly  traded on a national stock
exchange  or the NASDAQ  National  Market  System,  so long as Employee is not a
controlling  person of, or a member of a group that controls,  such  corporation
and Employee is not otherwise  affiliated in any capacity with such corporation)

association  or  contract  of  employment  or agency,  as the case may be,  with
Employer.

         (15)     Remedy for Violation. Employer and Employee agree that
                  remedies at law are inadequate and that Employer may seek
                  injunctive relief in the event of violation of this covenant.
                  In addition, it is agreed that the actual damages occasioned
                  by any breach of the covenants by Employee not to solicit
                  and/or perform services except as provided above will not be
                  susceptible to exact determination and Employer shall be
                  entitled to liquidated damages in an amount equal to three (3)
                  times the gross fees billed by Employer to any such patients
                  solicited or treated in violation of this covenant during the
                  two (2) year (twenty four (24) month) period immediately
                  preceding the violation of this covenant.

     (16) Binding  Agreement.  This  Agreement  shall be binding on the parties,
their distributees, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

                  that should they default in any of the obligations contained
                  herein, the defaulting party shall pay all costs and expenses,
                  including a reasonable attorney's fee which may arise or

                          UCI MEDICAL AFFILIATES, INC.
                        1994 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN

         1. Purpose. The purposes of this 1994 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
"Plan") are to: (1) closely associate the interests of the employees of UCI
Medical Affiliates, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") with
the shareholders of the Company by reinforcing the relationship between
employees' rewards and shareholder gains; (2) provide selected employees,
officers and directors with an equity ownership in the Company commensurate with
Company performance, as reflected in increased shareholder value; (3) maintain
competitive compensation levels; and, (4) provide an incentive to employees for
continuous employment with the Company. The stock options granted under the Plan
are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of
Internal Revenue Code Section 422.

         2. Amount of Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock to be
subject to options granted on and after April 20, 1994 pursuant to the Plan
shall not exceed 250,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01
per share. In the event that options granted under this Plan shall lapse without
being exercised in whole or in part, other options may be granted covering the
shares not purchased under such lapsed options.

     3. Stock Option  Committee.  The Board of Directors shall from time to time
appoint  a  Committee  (the  "Committee"),  which  may also be the  Compensation
Committee of the Board of  Directors,  to serve under this Plan.  The  Committee
shall consist of two or more directors.

         4. Eligibility and Participation. Options may be granted pursuant to
the Plan to any officer or employee of the Company. From time to time the
Committee shall select the officers and employees to whom options may be granted
by the Board of Directors and shall determine the number of shares to be covered
by each option so granted. Future as well as present officers and employees
(including officers and employees who are directors but who are not members of
the Committee) shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Directors who are
members of the Committee or who are not officers or employees of the Company are
not eligible to participate in the Plan. No option may be granted under the Plan
after April 20, 2004.

         5. Option Agreement. The terms and provisions of options granted
pursuant to the Plan shall be set forth in an agreement, herein called Option
Agreement, between the Company and the grantee receiving the same. The Options
may be in such form, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as shall be
approved by the Board of Directors and may include provisions regarding the
timing of the exercisability of the Options.

         6. Price. The purchase price per share of Common Stock purchasable
under options granted pursuant to the Plan shall not be less than 100 percent of
the fair market value at the time the options are granted. The purchase price
per share of Common Stock purchasable under options granted pursuant to this
Plan to a person who owns more than 10 percent of the voting power of the
Company's voting stock shall not be less than 110 percent of the fair market
value of such shares, at the time the options are granted. For the purposes of
the preceding sentence (a) the optionee shall be considered as owning the stock
owned directly or indirectly by or for himself, the stock which the optionee may
purchase under outstanding options and the stock owned, directly or indirectly,
by or for his brothers and sisters (whether of the whole or half blood), spouse,
ancestors, and lineal descendants and (b) stock owned directly or indirectly, by
or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as being
owned proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.
For all purposes of this Plan, the fair market value of the Common Stock of the
Company shall be determined in good faith at the time of the grant of any option
by decision of the Stock Option Committee. In making such determination, the
Stock Option Committee shall not take into account the effect of any
restrictions on the Common Stock other than restrictions which, by their terms,
will never lapse. The full purchase price of shares purchased shall be paid upon
exercise of the option. Under certain circumstances such purchase price per
share shall be subject to adjustment as referred to in Section 10 of this Plan.

                                  -113-

<PAGE>

         7. Option Period. No option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be
exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date the option is first
granted. No option granted pursuant to the Plan to a person then owning more
than 10 percent of the voting power of the Company's voting stock shall be
exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date the option is first
granted. For the purposes of the preceding sentence (a)the optionee shall be
considered as owning the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for himself,
the stock which the optionee may purchase under outstanding options and the
stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for his brothers and sisters (whether
of the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants and (b)
stock owned directly or indirectly, by or for a corporation, partnership,
estate, or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by or for
its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries. The expiration date stated in the
Option Agreement is hereafter called the Expiration Date.

         8. Termination of Employment. The Option Agreement shall provide that
upon the occurrence of the optionee ceasing for any reason to be employed by the
Company (such occurrence being a "termination of employment"), any unexercised
option shall terminate and become null and void immediately upon such
termination of employment, except in a case where the termination of employment
is by reason of retirement, disability or death. Upon a termination of
employment by reason of retirement, disability or death, the Option Agreement
shall provide that an outstanding and unexercised option may be exercised during
a time not exceeding the following periods:

     (a) the  one-year  period  following  the date of such  termination  of the
employee's employment in the case of a disability (within the meaning of Section
22(e)(3) of the Code),
     (b) the one-year period following the date of an employee's death, and

         (c) the three-month period following the date of such termination in
         the case of retirement on or after attainment of age 65, or in the case
         of disability other than as described in (a) above.

In no event, however, shall any such period extend beyond the Expiration Date.

         9. Assignability. The Option Agreement shall provide that the option
granted thereby shall not be transferable or assignable by the optionee
otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to
a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or
the Rules thereunder. During the lifetime of the optionee, the option granted
shall be exercisable only by the optionee.

         10. Adjustment in Case of Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, etc. The
Option Agreement may contain such provisions as the Board of Directors may
approve as equitable concerning the effect upon options granted and the option
price due to (a) stock dividends upon, or subdivisions, split-ups, combinations,
consolidations or reclassifications of, the securities purchasable under the
option, or (b) proposals to merge or consolidate the Company or to sell all or
substantially all of its assets, or to liquidate or dissolve the Company.

         11. Stock for Investment. The Option Agreement shall provide that the
optionee shall upon each exercise of a part or all of the option granted
represent and warrant this his purchase of stock pursuant to such option is for
investment only, and not with a view to distribution involving a public
offering. At any time the Board of Directors of the Company may waive the
requirement of such a provision in any Option Agreement entered into under this
Stock Option Plan of the Company. The Option Agreement may also provide such
additional restrictions and requirements concerning the exercise of options and
issuance of shares as the Company determines in its discretion are necessary to
meet all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to obtain such approvals
as may be required by any governmental agencies, including state and Federal
securities agencies and national securities exchanges.

                                 -114-

<PAGE>

         12. Amendment of the Plan. The Board of Directors of the Company may
from time to time alter, amend, suspend or discontinue the Plan and make rules
for its administration, except that the Board of Directors shall not amend the
Plan in any manner which would have the effect of preventing options issued
under the Plan from being "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, nothing in this Plan shall be deemed
to prevent the Board of Directors from issuing non-qualified stock options to
any officer or employee.

     13. Options Discretionary.  The granting of options under the Plan shall be
entirely  discretionary  with the Stock Option Committee and nothing in the Plan
shall be deemed to give any officer or employee any right to  participate in the
Plan or to receive options.

         14. Limitation as to Amount. No person to whom options are granted
hereunder shall receive options, first exercisable during any single calendar
year, for shares, the fair market value of which (determined at the time of
grant of the options) exceeds $100,000. Accordingly, no optionee shall be
entitled to exercise options in any single calendar year, for shares of Common
Stock the value of which (determined at the time of grant of the options)
exceeds $100,000.

         15. Stockholder Approval. The Plan will be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for approval by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of stock of the Company. If the Plan is not approved by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company by April
20, 1995, then the Plan shall terminate and any options granted hereunder shall
be void and of no further force or effect.

                        INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

                         GRANT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION

                       Date of Grant: ____________, 19 ___

         THIS GRANT, dated as of the date of grant first stated above (the "Date
of Grant"), is delivered to UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), to __________________________ (the "Grantee"), who is an
officer or employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has
adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the UCI Medical Affiliates, Inc. 1994
Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"); and,

         WHEREAS, the Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options
by the Board to officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to
purchase shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the "Stock"), in accordance
with the terms and provisions thereof; and,

         WHEREAS, the Board considers the Grantee to be a person who is eligible
for a grant of incentive stock options under the Plan, and has determined that
it would be in the best interest of the Company to grant the incentive stock
options documented herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

1. Grant of Option. Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
the Company, with the approval and at the direction of the Board, hereby grants
to the Grantee, as of the Date of Grant, an option to purchase up to _____
shares of Stock at a price of $______ per share, the fair market value on the
date hereof. Such option is hereinafter referred to as the "Option" and the
shares of Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Option are hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the "Option Shares". The Option is intended by the
parties hereto to be, and shall be treated as, an incentive stock option (as
such term is defined under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the
"Code")).

2. Installment Exercise. Subject to such further limitations as are provided
herein, the Option shall become exercisable in three (3) installments, the
Grantee having the right hereunder to purchase from the Company the following
number of Option Shares upon exercise of the Option, on and after the following
dates, in cumulative fashion:

     (a) on and  after  the  first  anniversary  of the  Date  of  Grant,  up to
one-third (ignoring fractional shares) of the total
number of Option Shares;

         (b) on and after the second anniversary of the Date of Grant, up to an
additional one-third (ignoring fractional shares) of the total number of Option
Shares; and,

     (c) on and after the third  anniversary of the Date of Grant, the remaining
Option Shares.

3.       Termination of Option.

         (a) The Option and all rights hereunder with respect thereto, to the
extent such rights shall not have been exercised, shall terminate and become
null and void after the expiration of ten (10) years from the Date of Grant (the
"Expiration Date").

         (b) Upon the occurrence of the Grantee's ceasing for any reason to be
employed by the Company (such occurrence being a "termination of the Grantee's
employment"), the Option, to the extent not previously exercised, shall
terminate and become null and void immediately upon such termination of the

                                   -116-

<PAGE>

Grantee's employment, except in a case where the termination of the Grantee's
employment is by reason of retirement, disability or death, the Option may be
exercised during the following periods, but only to the extent that the Option
was outstanding and exercisable on any such date of retirement, disability or
death:

         (i) the one-year period following the date of such termination of the
         Grantees employment in the case of a disability (within the meaning of
         Section 22(e)(3) of the Code),

         (ii) the six-month period following the date of issuance of letters
         testamentary or letters of administration to the executor or
         administrator of a deceased Grantee, in the case of the Grantee's death
         during his employment by the Company, but not later than one year after
         the Grantee's death, and

         (iii) the three-month period following the date of such termination in
         the case of retirement on or after attainment of age 65, or in the case
         of disability other than as described in (i) above.

In no event, however, shall any such period extend beyond the Expiration Date.

         (c) In the event of the death of the Grantee, the Option may be
exercised by the Grantee's legal representative(s), but only to the extent that
the Option would otherwise have been exercisable by the Grantee.

         (d) A transfer of the Grantee's employment between the Company and any
subsidiary of the Company, or between any subsidiaries of the Company, shall not
be deemed to be a termination of the Grantee's employment.

         (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions set forth herein or in the
Plan, if the Grantee shall (i) commit any act of malfeasance or wrongdoing
affecting the Company, (ii) breach any covenant not to compete or employment
contract with the Company, or (iii) engage in conduct that would warrant the
Grantee's discharge for cause (excluding general dissatisfaction with the
performance of the Grantee's duties, but including any act of disloyalty or any
conduct clearly tending to bring discredit upon the Company), any unexercised
portion of the Option shall immediately terminate and be void.

4.       Exercise of Options.

         (a) Subject to such further limitations as are provided herein, the
Option shall be exercisable at any time and from time to time during the period
commencing one (1) year from the Date of Grant and ending ten (10) years (five
(5) years for 10 percent shareholders as described in the Plan) from the Date of
Grant. The Grantee may exercise the Option with respect to all or any part of
the number of Option Shares then exercisable hereunder by giving the Secretary
of the Company written notice of intent to exercise. The notice of exercise
shall specify the number of Option Shares as to which the Option is to be
exercised and the date of exercise thereof, which date shall be at least five
days after the giving of such notice unless an earlier time shall have been
mutually agreed upon.

         (b) Full payment (in U.S. dollars) by the Grantee of the option price
for the Option Shares purchased shall be made on or before the exercise date
specified in the notice of exercise in cash, or, with the prior written consent
of the Secretary, in whole or in part through the surrender of previously
acquired shares of Stock at their fair market value on the exercise date.

     On  the  exercise  date  specified  in  the  Grantee's  notice  or as  soon
thereafter  as is  practicable,  the Company  shall cause to be delivered to the
Grantee,  a  certificate  or  certificates  for the  Option  Shares  then  being
purchased (out of theretofore unissued Stock or reacquired Stock, as the Company
may elect) upon full payment of such Option Shares.  The Grantee shall upon each
exercise of a part or all of the option  granted  represent and warrant that his
purchase of stock pursuant to such option is for investment only, and not with a
view to distribution  involving a public offering. The obligation of the Company
to deliver Stock shall, however, be subject to the condition that if at any time
the Board shall determine in its discretion that

                                 -117-

<PAGE>

the listing, registration or qualification of the Option or the Option
Shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the
consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or
desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the Option or the issuance
or purchase of Stock thereunder, the Option may not be exercised in whole or in
part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall
have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the
Board.
(c) If the Grantee fails to pay for any of the Option Shares specified
in such notice or fails to accept delivery thereof, the Grantee's right to
purchase such Option Shares may be terminated by the Company. The date specified
in the Grantee's notice as the date of exercise shall be deemed the date of
exercise of the Option, provided that payment in full for the Option Shares to
be purchased upon such exercise shall have been received by such date.

5. Adjustment of and Changes in Stock of the Company. In the event of a
reorganization, recapitalization, change of shares, stock split, spin-off, stock
dividend, reclassification, subdivision, consolidation or combination of
shares,, merger, consolidation, rights offering, or any other change in the
corporate structure or shares of capital stock of the Company, the Board may
make such adjustment as it deems appropriate in the number and kind of shares of
Stock subject to the Option or in the option price; provided, however, that no
such adjustment shall give the Grantee any additional benefits under the Option.

6. No Rights of Stockholders. Neither the Grantee nor any personal
representative shall be, or shall have any of the rights and privileges of, a
stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock purchasable or
usable upon the exercise of the Option, in whole or in part, prior to the date
of exercise of the Option.

7. Non-Transferability of Option. During the Grantee's lifetime, the Option
hereunder shall be exercisable only by the Grantee or any guardian or legal
representative of the Grantee, and the Option shall not be transferable except,
in case of the death of the Grantee, by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, or the Rules thereunder, nor shall the Option be
subject to attachment, execution or other similar process. In the event of (a)
any attempt by the Grantee to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise
dispose of the Option, except as provided for herein, or (b) the levy of any
attachment, execution or similar process upon the rights or interest hereby
conferred, the Company may terminate the Option by notice to the Grantee and it
shall thereupon become null and void.

8. Employment Not Affected. Neither the granting of the Option nor its exercise
shall be construed as granting to the Grantee any right with respect to
continuance of employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Except as
may otherwise be limited by a written agreement between the Company and the
Grantee, the right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to terminate
at will the Grantee's employment with it at any time (whether by dismissal,
discharge, retirement or otherwise) is specifically reserved by the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company, as the employer, and is acknowledged by the
Grantee.

9. Amendment of Option. The Option may be amended by the Board or the Committee
at any time (i) if the Board or the Stock Option Committee determines, in its
sole discretion, that amendment is necessary or advisable in the light of any
addition to or change in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or in the regulations
issued thereunder, or any federal or state securities law or other law or
regulation, which change occurs after the Date of Grant and by its terms applies
to the Option; or (ii) other than in the circumstances described in clause (i),
with the consent of the Grantee.

10. Notice. Any notice to the Company provided for in this instrument shall be
addressed to it in care of its Secretary at its executive offices at 6168 St.
Andrews Road, Columbia, South Carolina 29212, and any notice to the Grantee
shall be addressed to the Grantee at the current address shown on the payroll

                                    -118-

<PAGE>

records of the Company. Any notice shall be deemed to be duly given if and when
properly addressed and posted by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid.

11. Incorporation of Plan by Reference. The Option is granted pursuant to the
terms of the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and
the Option shall in all respects be interpreted in accordance with the Plan. The
Stock Option Committee shall interpret and construe the Plan and this
instrument, and its interpretations and determinations shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties hereto and any other person claiming an interest
hereunder, with respect to any issue arising hereunder or thereunder.

     12. Governing Law. The validity, construction, interpretation and effect of
this  instrument  shall  exclusively be governed by and determined in accordance
with the law of the State of South Carolina,  except to the extent  preempted by
federal law, which shall to such extent govern.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused its duly authorized officers
to execute and attest this Grant of Incentive Stock Option, and the Grantee has
placed his or her signature hereon, effective as of the Date of Grant.
