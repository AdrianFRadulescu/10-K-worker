          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial Condition

Liquidity

   The liquidity  requirements of  the Company  are met primarily by cash flows
from operations of the life insurance subsidiaries and accumulated funds at the
subsidiary level.  These internal sources of liquidity are complemented by such
external sources  as available  bank  lines  of  credit  and  revolving  credit
agreements and  the ability  of the  Company to  utilize  capital  markets  for
intermediate and long-term financing.

   Premium and  investment income  as well  as maturities and sales of invested
assets provide  the primary  sources of  cash available  at the  life insurance
subsidiaries, while  cash is  applied by such subsidiaries to payment of policy
benefits and  loans, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions),
and operating  expenses, as  well as  purchases of  new investments.   Net cash
provided from  operating activities of the life insurance subsidiaries amounted
to approximately $205 million in 1994.  Cash dividends paid by all consolidated
subsidiaries to the parent company amounted to $45.7 million, $61.2 million and
$47.7 million  in 1994,  1993, and  1992, respectively.   Additionally,  during
1993, securities  with market  value of  $21.6 million  were transferred from a
life insurance subsidiary to the parent company and subsequently contributed to
another life insurance subsidiary in connection with the combination of the two
subsidiaries' operations.   In  addition to the 1992 cash dividends, securities
with market  value of  $26.3 million  were transferred  from a  life  insurance
subsidiary to the parent company following the combination of operations of two
of the  Company's life  insurance subsidiaries.  All of the aforementioned cash
dividends to the parent company came from the life insurance subsidiaries.  The
greater amount  of cash  dividends received  in 1993  versus the  preceding and
following year  reflected capital  made available  at the subsidiary level from
the combination  of operations  of certain  life insurance  subsidiaries, and a
portion of  the incremental  amount received  in  1993  was  applied  to  repay
corporate borrowings.   It  should be  noted that payment of dividends from the
life insurance  subsidiaries for  application toward  liquidity  needs  at  the
parent company  level (including  overhead costs,  interest on indebtedness and
dividends on  preferred and  common stocks)  may require regulatory approval in
cases where  such dividends exceed certain guidelines generally based on income
before capital  gains and  losses and  Equity Capital as reported to regulatory
authorities  on  the  basis  of  statutory  accounting  practices  ("Regulatory
Operating Income" and "Regulatory Equity Capital") and, at a further threshold,
may require  payment of additional taxes under provisions of federal income tax
law applicable  to life  insurance companies.   The life insurance subsidiaries
reported Regulatory Operating Income of $41.9 million, $88.9 million, and $56.6
million in  1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively and Regulatory Equity Capital of
$542.7 million,  $549.4 million,  and $525.3  million as  of December 31, 1994,
1993 and  1992, respectively.  The 1994 decrease in Regulatory Operating Income
resulted primarily  from the  statutory financial  statement impact  of  a  44%
increase in  term insurance  sales in  1994, as indicated in Note 1 of Notes to
Financial Statements.   In  determining the  timing and amount of such dividend
payments, management  considers, among other factors, insurance industry rating
agency criteria which are based primarily upon the statutory financial position
of life  insurance companies.   Historically,  these self imposed criteria have
been more restrictive in terms of dividend availability than the aforementioned
regulatory or tax considerations.  Investment advisory and service fees paid by
the  life  insurance  subsidiaries,  and  portfolio  investment  income,  which
totalled  $8.3   million  and  $4.6  million  respectively  in  1994,  comprise
additional sources of liquidity at the parent company.

   In addition  to the  liquidity factors  at the  subsidiary level  previously
discussed,  cash   requirements  at   the  parent   company  for   interest  on
indebtedness, dividends  on preferred and common stocks, and overhead costs are
a key factor in the Company's overall liquidity situation.  On a pre-tax basis,
interest and  overhead amounted  to $70.6  million,  $66.1  million  and  $68.1
million in  1994, 1993  and 1992,  respectively, while dividends totalled $28.8
million, $27.4  million and  $25.8 million, respectively.  The major portion of
the 1994  increase in  interest and overhead was attributed to interest expense
and came  primarily  from  higher  interest  rates  applicable  to  short  term
corporate borrowings.  The Company's common stock repurchase program, which was
<PAGE>4

reactivated during  the fourth  quarter of  1994, was also a factor in its cash
requirements.   In October  1994, the  Board of Directors extended this program
through November  1995 and  authorized repurchase  of up  to one million common
shares.   During the fourth quarter of 1994, 170,700 shares were repurchased by
the Company  at a total cost of $5.4 million, for an average cost of $31.64 per
share.

   On a  consolidated basis, net cash provided by operating activities amounted
to $177.9  million, $98.3  million and  $62.5 million  in 1994,  1993 and  1992
respectively.   These reported amounts reflect fluctuations in accounts payable
and receivable  and amounts due to policyholders that result from random timing
differences in securities transaction settlements, claims payments, and similar
matters.   Excluding the  impact of  these fluctuations,  net cash  provided by
operating activities would be approximately $166 million, $152 million, and $59
million in  1994, 1993  and 1992,  respectively.   The 1994  increase  reflects
various factors  including increased  premium income  associated  with  greater
sales of  individual life  insurance products  and written  premiums on  credit
insurance products.   Factors  in the  1993  increase  include  the  growth  of
investment income  that year  arising from  a $546  million increase in annuity
account balances  during 1992,  and the  negative impact  on 1992 cash flows of
approximately $18 million net payments to the Internal Revenue Service relating
to settlement of prior year tax returns.

   Cash flows  from operating  activities for  1994 included $73.0 million from
the change  in liability  for future  policy benefits,  versus $53.0 million in
1993, with  increased sales  of traditional  individual life insurance products
and written  premiums on  credit insurance  coverages  the  major  contributing
factors.   Interest credited  to policyholder  account  balances  increased  to
$194.0 million  in 1994  versus $183.7 million in 1993, reflecting the increase
in policyholder account balances relating to individual annuities and universal
life insurance  contracts.  The impact of previous reductions in credited rates
of interest  on  certain  contracts,  primarily  during  1993,  was  a  partial
offsetting factor.   As discussed under "Results of Operations," credited rates
of interest  on substantially  all of the Company's individual annuity products
were increased  during the  second half  of 1994.   The portion of policyholder
account balances  relating  to  individual  annuities  was  approximately  $1.8
billion at December 31, 1994 versus $1.7 billion at December 31, 1993, with the
remainder relating  to universal  life insurance  contracts.    Interest  rates
credited on  these universal  life and  individual  annuity  contracts  may  be
adjusted periodically  by the  Company.   Subject to  any applicable  surrender
charges,  the  Company's  universal  life  insurance  products  and  individual
annuities may  be surrendered  by the holder.  A cash surrender value, based on
contractual terms, is also available to the policyholder upon surrender of many
of the  Company's traditional  individual life  insurance policies  under which
cash values are accumulated.  Such surrenders are influenced by various factors
including  economic   conditions,  available  alternative  investment  returns,
competition  for  investment  and  insurance  funds,  and  perceived  financial
strength of  the insurer.   These  contracts are  generally  supported  by  the
Company's investment  portfolios, which  are primarily  comprised of investment
grade, publicly  traded corporate  bonds.   Substantially all  of the Company's
interest sensitive  life insurance and annuity contracts provide for imposition
of a  surrender charge  in the  event of  policy surrender  during a  specified
initial period  commencing with  contract inception,  typically ten  to fifteen
years for  universal life  insurance and  five to  seven years  for  individual
annuities, with the significance of this charge often subject to reduction over
the applicable  period or during the later portion thereof.  As of December 31,
1994, approximately  9% of  the Company's deferred annuity contracts and 16% of
its universal  life insurance policies, based on policyholder account balances,
were beyond  the contractual  period during which a significant charge could be
imposed in  the event  of termination.  The Company's investment portfolios are
continually monitored  to determine  whether  the  distribution  of  investment
maturities is  considered appropriate for expected levels of policy surrenders.
The Company's  fixed maturity investments may be sold prior to maturity as part
of the  Company's asset  / liability  management strategy and are classified as
"available for  sale" as  discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.
Adjustments to  the investment maturity distribution, if necessary, may also be
accomplished by  actions concerning  the investment  of incoming  funds  and/or
reinvestment of  the proceeds  of securities  matured or redeemed.  The Company
monitors its surrenders on a monthly basis.  Any material deviation or emerging
trend is traced to the product line and agency of record, and remedial action
<PAGE>5

is taken  where appropriate.    If  an  acceleration  of  surrenders  of  these
contracts were  experienced, the  cash flow  requirements associated  with such
surrenders could  conceivably require the Company to liquidate a portion of the
underlying security  investments prior  to maturity,  at then-prevailing market
prices.  Any additional cash flow requirements would be met through the sources
of liquidity described earlier.

   Current year  Federal income  tax payments  amounted to $54.5 million, $60.7
million and  $57.3 million  in 1994,  1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company
and certain  subsidiaries also  made payments  to the  Internal Revenue Service
during 1994  and 1992  amounting to  approximately $6  million and $18 million,
respectively, relating  to settlement  of prior  year tax  returns.   Since the
latter payments  were associated  with previously  recorded liabilities,  these
settlements had no impact on reported results of operations.

   Net cash  used in  investing activities  amounted to  $456.7 million, $492.8
million, and $705.6 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The 1994 and
1993 decreases  resulted primarily  from declines  in individual  annuity sales
which, as  discussed below,  also resulted  in reduced  levels of  increase  in
policyholder account  balances.   The Company's  investment management policies
include continual  evaluation of securities market conditions and circumstances
relating to  particular investment  holdings which  may result  in selection of
fixed maturity or other investments for sale prior to maturity.  Securities may
also be  sold as  part of  the Company's asset/liability management strategy as
indicated above  in response to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment
risk, and  similar factors.   The approximately $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and
$800 million  disposals of  fixed maturity  investments included  in cash flows
from investing  activities for 1994, 1993 and 1992 included, respectively, $209
million, $928 million and $497 million (adjusted cost) of securities which were
called for  redemption by  the respective  issuers  prior  to  maturity.    The
majority of  the 1994  redemptions were  experienced during  the first quarter.
The remainder  of the  1994 disposals  of fixed  maturities came primarily from
sales of  certain lower  yielding securities with the objective of reinvestment
of proceeds  in securities  of similar  quality, with higher available interest
rates, and  sales of  certain securities  in accordance  with asset / liability
management strategies  to maintain  an  appropriate  relationship  between  the
maturity distribution  of investment  securities and  prospective  future  cash
flows relating  to policyholder  account balances.   Substantially  all of  the
proceeds from  fixed maturities  sold or  redeemed were  directed to investment
grade fixed  maturity investments.  The net impact of these transactions is not
anticipated to  result  in  a  material  adverse  impact  on  consolidated  net
investment income  of the  Company.  Purchases of fixed maturity investments in
1994, 1993  and 1992  amounted to  approximately $1.5 billion, $1.8 billion and
$1.6 billion,  respectively, reflecting  both reinvestment of the proceeds from
fixed maturity disposals and investment of funds corresponding to the increases
in policyholder  account balances.    Valuation  reserves  are  maintained  for
investments with  a reduction  in value  determined to be other than temporary.
As indicated  in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements, net unrealized losses
on the Company's fixed maturities portfolio, with adjusted cost of $5.2 billion
as of  December 31,  1994, amount  to approximately  $252 million at that date.
This amount reflects gross unrealized gains of $39 million and gross unrealized
losses of  $291 million.   Based  on current evaluation of the paying status of
the Company's  fixed maturity  investments and  anticipated continuation of the
aforementioned investment  policies,  the  sales  of  selected  fixed  maturity
investments and  retention of certain securities with current market value less
than book value are not anticipated to result in a material adverse impact upon
the Company's  net cash  flows.   As discussed  in Note 1 of Notes to Financial
Statements, the  Company's $319.6  million consolidated  investment in mortgage
loans as  of December  31,  1994  is  characterized  by  a  broad  geographical
distribution.   The Company  invests principally  in commercial mortgages which
comprise substantially all of the total investment in mortgages at December 31,
1994.   Commercial mortgage investments are generally made with a loan-to-value
ratio not in excess of 75% and emphasize fully occupied general purpose retail,
office and  industrial real  estate having  broad user  appeal on a diversified
national basis.   Investment  in real  estate is  limited typically to selected
commercial real estate which is substantially pre-leased or where the prospects
of finding a user upon completion are unusually attractive.  As of December 31,
1994 and  1993, consolidated  invested assets  included $30.4 million and $25.0
million book  value of  real estate acquired through foreclosure, respectively.
Consolidated net investment income included a net credit of $465 thousand and a
net charge of $1.2 million in 1994 and 1993, respectively, relating to such
<PAGE>6

properties.   It is the Company's general policy to determine the estimated net
realizable value  of foreclosed  real estate  based upon appraisals relating to
the underlying  mortgage loans which are continually reviewed and/or updated by
management based  upon market  conditions furnished  by  third  party  property
managers or  brokers.   The Company maintains reserves so that these assets are
carried at  the lower  of cost  or estimated  net realizable  value.   Based on
current evaluation  of real  estate properties  held as a result of foreclosure
and anticipated  continuation of the Company's policies relating to disposal of
such properties,  the retention  of these  properties until  disposal at  terms
believed to reflect their estimated net realizable values is not anticipated to
result in  a material adverse impact upon consolidated net investment income or
the liquidity of the Company.

   Net cash  flows provided  by consolidated  financing activities  amounted to
$270.4 million,  $380.3 million,  and $641.2  million in  1994, 1993  and 1992,
respectively.   The reduced  levels of  cash flows from financing activities in
1994 and  1993 reflect  the impact  of decreased  individual annuity  sales  on
changes in  policyholder account  balances as well as a volume-related increase
in the  dollar amount  of surrenders of individual annuity contracts, which are
charged to  these balances.   The  increase in  policyholder  account  balances
amounted to  $269.5 million,  $416.7 million,  and $647.5 million in 1994, 1993
and 1992,  with gross  premiums on  single premium annuities of $244.8 million,
$344.7 million and $524.8 million in those years, respectively.  The decline in
annuity sales  reflects previous  management actions  with objectives including
diversification of  sales mix and production sources.  Gross surrender benefits
on individual  deferred annuities  amounted to  approximately $173  million and
$119 million  in 1994  and 1993,  respectively.   Sales of  interest  sensitive
permanent life  insurance policies,  with  new  annualized  premiums  of  $60.2
million, $55.8 million and $55.0 million in 1994, 1993, and 1992, respectively,
and the  increase in accumulated values on contracts in force were also factors
in  the  growth  in  policyholder  account  balances.    Premium  receipts  for
substantially all  of the  Company's interest  sensitive  individual  life  and
annuity contracts  are not  included  in  reported  revenues  but  are  instead
directly credited  to  the  liability  for  policyholder  account  balances  as
required by FASB Statement No. 97.

   Cash  flows  from  financing  activities  for  1994  reflect  a  refinancing
transaction in  which the Company borrowed $100 million in May 1994, classified
as notes  payable, under  a revolving  credit agreement  commenced at that time
with The Bank of New York (as agent) which provides for term loan borrowings of
up to $150 million.  The proceeds of this borrowing were utilized to repay $100
million "current  maturities of  long-term  debt"  under  a  previous  two-year
revolving credit facility which expired in May 1994.  Subsequently, the Company
borrowed the  remaining $50 million available under this agreement and utilized
these proceeds  to repay  a similar  amount of  short-term variable  rate  bank
borrowings.    See  Note  2  of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.   The aggregate  1994 increase  of approximately  $31  million  in
outstanding long-term  and short-term debt relates primarily to working capital
requirements.     Cash  flows   from  financing  activities  for  1993  include
refinancing transactions  in which  the Company  issued a total of $300 million
principal amount  of debt  securities under  shelf registration  statements and
utilized the  proceeds to  repay $200  million long  term debt and $100 million
short term  variable rate  bank debt.   The  $112.4 million  decrease in  notes
payable included  in 1993  cash flows  from financing  activities reflects  the
noted refinancing  of short  term variable  rate  bank  debt  as  well  as  the
application of  a  portion  of  dividends  received  from  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries by  the parent  company to  repay short  term bank  borrowings  as
discussed earlier.

   As of  December 31,  1994, the  Company had lines of credit with seven banks
amounting to  $60 million, all of which was unused.  However, at that date, the
Company had  outstanding short-term  borrowings with  three  banks,  negotiated
independently of  such lines  to take  advantage of  more  favorable  available
interest rates,  in the  aggregate amount  of $46.5  million, as  well as  $150
million borrowings under a revolving credit agreement with The Bank of New York
as discussed  above.   Also at that date, the Company had available a revolving
credit agreement  with  Chemical  Bank  which  provides  short  term  borrowing
facilities up to $100 million, under which no borrowings were outstanding.  The
Company's short  term borrowings  were utilized  primarily for  working capital
requirements.

Capital Resources

   Long term  debt at  December 31,  1994 includes  a $150 million non-callable
issue of  6.75% Notes  due 1998 and a $150 million non-callable issue of 6.375%
Notes due  2000, both issued in early 1993 under shelf registration statements.
The Company  has filed  an additional shelf registration statement which, as of
December 31,  1994, permits the issuance of up to $150 million principal amount
of debt  securities subject  to management's discretion as to timing and amount
of issues  thereunder.   The Company's remaining long term debt at December 31,
1994 consists  of a  $50 million  issue of  9.15% Notes  due 1999 which permits
repayment at  the option  of the Company prior to maturity, commencing in 1996.
While it  is currently anticipated that the major portion of the long term debt
will be  repaid using  the net  proceeds of  debt and/or  equity or combination
securities to be issued at future dates, determination of the timing and amount
of such  repayments and  securities issues will be dependent upon future market
conditions, future cash flows, and other unforeseen circumstances.

  For  the  years  ended  December  31,  1994,  1993  and  1992,  respectively,
consolidated interest  expense amounted  to $35.6  million, $32.4  million, and
$33.8 million,  with $24.4  million, $26.7  million, and  $25.9 million of such
interest expense  relating to  long term debt.  Dividends paid on the Company's
outstanding stock  issues for such years were $28.8 million, $27.4 million, and
$25.8 million,  substantially all  relating to  common stock.  The increases in
such dividends  reflected increases  in common  stock dividends  per share from
$1.14 in  1992 to  $1.21 in  1993 and  $1.26 in  1994.   The 1994  increase  in
interest expense came primarily from higher interest rates applicable to short-
term borrowings.   The  decrease in  consolidated interest  expense in  1993 as
compared  to  1992  resulted  primarily  from  more  favorable  interest  rates
applicable to  short-term borrowings  in 1993  and long-term  debt  refinancing
transactions early that year.

  The Company  has  outstanding  Standby  Letters  of  Credit  with  two  banks
representing contingent  obligations to  fund  various  trusts  established  in
connection with  certain employment  contracts  of  management  employees,  the
Company's Supplemental  Retirement Plan, Retirement Plan for Outside Directors,
and Retirement  Plan, in  the event  of a  Change in Control (as defined in the
trust agreements), totalling $88 million.  Additionally, in connection with the
application by  a life  insurance subsidiary for an additional state license to
transact business, USLIFE Corporation has agreed to guarantee that subsidiary's
maintenance of  the state's minimum capital and surplus requirements (amounting
to $4.4  million as  of December  31, 1994) for a ten year period commencing at
the effective date of such license.


Results of Operations


     1994 Compared to 1993

     For the year ended December 31, 1994, net income amounted to $96.2 million
versus $97.2  million for 1993.  The $96.2 million net income for 1994 included
net capital  loss transactions with an after-tax impact of $902 thousand, while
1993 results  included net  capital gains  with an  after-tax  impact  of  $5.5
million.   The 1994  net capital losses came primarily from disposal of certain
real estate  investments.   The net  capital gains  reported for 1993 reflected
$54.5 million  pre-tax gains  on disposals of fixed maturity investments, which
were partially  offset by  pre-tax losses  of approximately  $10.7  million  on
disposal of  certain real estate, mortgage and joint venture investments and by
additions to valuation reserves for certain investments with loss exposure.  As
discussed under  "Financial Condition," the major portion of disposals of fixed
maturity investments  during 1993  related to  securities which were called for
redemption by  the respective  issuers prior  to maturity.    Consolidated  net
income for 1993 also includes a gain of $1.5 million (after applicable taxes)
<PAGE>8

from sale  of a  subsidiary's home office property and a charge of $2.0 million
to recognize  the cumulative  impact of  the change in corporate Federal income
tax rates enacted in August 1993 as required by FASB Statement No. 109.

     Excluding the transactions discussed above (capital gains and losses, 1993
recognition of  cumulative impact  of income  tax rate  change, and  1993  home
office property  sale), consolidated after-tax income amounted to $97.1 million
for 1994  versus $92.1  million for  1993, an increase of $5.0 million or 5.4%.
On a  similar basis,  after-tax  income  of  the  life  insurance  subsidiaries
increased $7.6  million or  6.0%.  The improvement in life insurance subsidiary
results came  primarily from an increase in pre-tax profits from the individual
life and  annuity product  line, accompanied by alleviation of certain expenses
that negatively  impacted 1993 group health results from "association" business
as discussed  below.   Also on  a similar  basis, after-tax  corporate  charges
(including the operating results of USLIFE's servicing units) amounted to $37.1
million in  1994 versus  $34.5  million  for  1993,  resulting  in  a  negative
comparative impact  of $2.6  million on after-tax consolidated results.  Higher
interest rates  applicable to  short term corporate borrowings in 1994 were the
primary cause  of this  negative variance.   Corporate  charges reflect,  among
other factors, interest expense associated with financing of repurchases of the
Company's common stock under the treasury stock repurchase program.

     Pre-tax income of the life insurance subsidiaries, excluding capital gains
and losses and the 1993 home office sale as discussed above, was $204.7 million
in 1994 versus $192.9 million in 1993.  The major portion of the life insurance
subsidiaries' pre-tax  income is  attributed to  the individual  life insurance
and annuity  product line.   The  life insurance subsidiaries also offer credit
and group  life insurance  products, including  mortgage life  insurance.   The
indicated  pre-tax income includes a pre-tax profit of $11.8 million attributed
to all  health insurance  coverages in  1994,  versus  $9.3  million  in  1993.
Employer  /   association  group  health  insurance,  primarily  consisting  of
employer-employee cases  that are  often written in conjunction with group life
insurance, accounted  for approximately  84% and  87% of total health insurance
premiums in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The remainder of the Company's health
insurance business  consists  of  credit  disability  insurance,  "other  group
health" insurance  (primarily mortgage  disability coverages),  and  individual
health and  disability coverages  including specialty products and cases issued
on group  conversions.   A discussion  of the  Company's various product lines,
excluding the  impact of  capital gains and losses and the 1993 subsidiary home
office property sale which are previously discussed, follows.

     Individual life and annuity pre-tax profits, including income attributable
to capital  and surplus,  amounted to  $186.3 million  in  1994  versus  $177.1
million in  1993.   The increase  of approximately  $9 million  or 5% reflected
improved mortality  experience,  gains  from  investment  income  margins,  and
voluntary policy  termination  (persistency)  experience.    Investment  income
margins are  affected by changes in rates of return available to the Company on
portfolio investments,  and adjustments  that may  be made  by the  Company  on
credited rates of interest on certain contracts, as discussed below.

     A pre-tax  profit of  $1.1 million  was reported for credit life insurance
coverages for  1994, versus  $1.3 million for 1993, as less favorable mortality
experience in 1994 offset the impact of increased premium income.

     Pre-tax profits  from the Company's group life insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.5 million  in 1994 versus $5.2 million in 1993.  Pre-tax income
from employer  / association  life insurance  products increased  approximately
$650 thousand,  from $4.6  million in  1993 to $5.2 million in 1994, reflecting
improved mortality  experience and reduced expense levels.  A negative variance
of about  $300 thousand  from the  Company's other  group life insurance lines,
including mortgage life insurance and specialty coverages, partially offset the
improved employer / association group life results.

     The individual  health and  disability product  line  reported  a  pre-tax
profit of  $721 thousand  for 1994,  versus a pre-tax loss of $290 thousand for
1993.   This product  line consists primarily of certain specialty products and
coverages issued upon conversion of certain group health insurance products.
<PAGE>9

The improved  results in  1994 came  primarily from  more  favorable  morbidity
experience on certain specialty products included in this line.

     Pre-tax profits  from the  credit disability product line amounted to $5.2
million for  1994, versus  $5.0 million  in  1993,  reflecting  more  favorable
morbidity experience during 1994.

     Pre-tax profits  from  the  Company's  group  health  insurance  lines  of
business amounted to $5.9 million in 1994 versus $4.6 million in 1993.  Pre-tax
income from  employer /  association health  insurance products  increased from
$4.6 million  in 1993  to $5.6 million in 1994.  The favorable variance of $1.0
million came  primarily from a decrease in legal and other expenses relating to
an  association   group  health   marketing  organization  which  had  declared
bankruptcy.  These expenses, which were the major contributing factor in a $4.3
million pre-tax  loss for  1993 ascribed  to "association" products included in
the employer  / association  group health  line, were  subsequently  mitigated.
Residual expenses  relating to  this matter are not expected to have a material
adverse impact  on consolidated  results  of  operations.    The  benefit  from
mitigation of  these expenses  was offset by the impact of a decline in premium
revenues on  employer / association health insurance products from $429 million
in 1993  to $397  million in  1994, primarily  attributed to  small group major
medical lines.  Since the major portion of the Company's major medical business
has consisted primarily of "indemnity" coverages, a shift in market emphasis to
managed care  products arising  from legislation  in New  York and  New  Jersey
resulted in  a reduction  in new sales as well as erosion of business in force.
The Company's  decision in  late 1993 to restrict major medical sales to states
where it  has a significant amount of in-force business also contributed to the
decline in  revenues.   The Company has initiated expense reduction measures to
alleviate the  impact of  reduced group health revenues on pre-tax profits from
these lines.   Additionally,  the Company  has refined  its  "ancillary"  group
products, such  as  long-term  disability  and  dental  insurance,  with  goals
including an  increase in  the proportion  of  group  business  from  non-major
medical lines,  and is  introducing new  managed care  products and networks in
several states  with the  objective  of  improving  its  competitive  position.
Profitability of  the Company's  group health insurance lines is dependent upon
various factors  including the ability of the Company to match premiums charged
to benefit costs and to maintain underwriting standards so that premium charged
is consistent  with risk  assumed on  an  overall  basis,  as  well  as  market
acceptance of products currently offered and those being introduced.

     Total revenues  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries in  1994 amounted  to
$1.630 billion,  an increase  of $46.8  million or 3.0% over 1993, primarily on
increases of  $43.4 million  (or 3.9%)  and $16.8 million (or 3.9%) in premiums
and considerations  and net  investment income,  respectively.    Other  income
decreased $1.3  million to  $17.0 million  in 1994, reflecting the inclusion in
1993 results of $2.3 million income from the sale of a subsidiary's home office
property.   The increase in premiums and considerations came primarily from the
individual life  insurance and  annuity product line and from increased written
premiums on  the Company's  credit insurance  products.   A decrease  of  $31.0
million in  employer / association group insurance premiums, reflecting reduced
sales and  erosion of  in-force business on major medical products as discussed
above, was a partial offset.  Premiums and other considerations from individual
life insurance  and annuity  products  amounted  to  $434.2  million  in  1994,
compared to  $388.1 million  in 1993,  with the  increase  from  both  interest
sensitive and  traditional products  and reflecting  a larger  base of in-force
business as  well as  increased sales of traditional life insurance products in
1994.  Net investment income of the life insurance subsidiaries increased $16.8
million, as noted above, reflecting a larger investment base in 1994.  The pre-
tax annual  yield declined from 8.35% in 1993 to 7.92% in 1994, as a decline in
market interest rates resulted in redemptions of higher yielding securities out
of the  Company's investment  portfolio particularly  during 1993  and into the
first quarter  of 1994, and the reinvestment of proceeds from these securities,
as well  as funds  provided from operations, at lower available interest rates.
In this  connection, it  should be  noted that the Company's interest sensitive
life insurance  and annuity  contracts are  subject to  periodic adjustment  of
credited interest  rates which  are determined by management based on available
market interest  rates and  portfolio rates of return.  Investment income gains
represent the  spread between  interest earned  on the investment portfolio and
interest credited to policyholders.  These gains, on certain products,
<PAGE>10

benefited during  1993  as  reductions  in  credited  rates  of  interest  were
implemented as  contractually permitted  while reductions  in investment income
arising from  redemptions by  the respective  issuers were experienced over the
course of  the year.   These  gains tended  to stabilize  rather than  increase
during most  of 1994  due to  realization of  the full impact of the investment
income reductions  associated with the earlier redemptions.  Although available
interest rates  on securities  investments have risen during the latter portion
of 1994,  the impact  on yields  has not  yet been fully realized. During 1993,
interest rates  credited on   the  Company's universal life insurance contracts
typically ranged  from 6.5%  to 7.5% at the beginning of the year and from 6.0%
to 7.0%  at the end of the year, reflecting periodic rate decreases during that
year.   Rates were  essentially unchanged  on these  policies during  1994.  In
1993, interest  rates credited  on the  Company's deferred  annuity  contracts,
exclusive of  first year  increments on certain products, typically ranged from
4.5% to  5.0%.   Credited rates of interest on the Company's deferred annuities
at the  beginning of  1994, on  a similar  basis, typically ranged from 4.5% to
4.8% .  Recognizing the rise in available interest rates during the second half
of 1994, first year credited interest rates offered on substantially all of the
Company's deferred  and immediate  annuity contracts were increased during that
period, with  the amount  of increase  varying based  on the  type of contract.
Credited renewal rates of interest were also increased on these contracts, with
effective dates either at contract anniversary or January 1, 1995 based on type
of  contract.    At  January  1,  1995,  giving  effect  to  the  various  rate
adjustments, the rates offered on these contracts typically ranged from 4.8% to
5.5% excluding  first year  increments.   The prospective  impact of these rate
adjustments  on  reported  results  will  be  dependent  upon  various  factors
including future  sales, surrender  levels, and investment portfolio yield.  In
the event  of future  general increases  in market  interest rates,  the market
value of  certain of  the Company's  investments including  its fixed  maturity
portfolio would  be expected to decrease, and the contribution to the Company's
earnings from  the  difference  between  interest  earned  on  investments  and
interest credited  on these  products could be adversely affected, depending on
the timing  and extent of adjustments in credited rates of interest on in-force
business and in the investment portfolio in response to such changes.

     Total benefits  and expenses  of the life insurance subsidiaries increased
$49.4 million  or 3.6%  over 1993.  Benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries
amounted to  $727.9 million  in 1994,  versus $737.7  million  in  1993.    The
decrease  came   primarily  from   reduced  group   health  insurance   volume,
particularly in major medical business, relating to policy lapses and a reduced
level of  sales as  previously discussed.   Interest  credited to  policyholder
account balances  increased $10.3  million (or  5.6%), reflecting the increased
volume of universal life-type and individual annuity contracts in 1994 with the
impact of earlier reductions in credited rates of interest on certain contracts
a partial  offsetting factor.   An  increase in future policy benefits of $79.3
million was  recorded for  1994, versus  $39.8 million for 1993, with the $39.4
million variance  primarily  associated  with  the  increases  in  premiums  on
traditional individual  life and  credit insurance  coverages.  Amortization of
deferred policy  acquisition costs  amounted to  $159.7 million  in 1994 versus
$151.9 million  in 1993,  reflecting various  factors including  the  increased
volume  of   individual  life  and  annuity  business  in  force  during  1994.
Commissions, insurance taxes and licenses, and general expenses totalled $261.9
million in  1994, approximating  the $260.4 million recorded in 1993, as volume
related increases in commissions and expenses on the individual life and credit
insurance product  lines were essentially offset by expense reductions relating
to group health insurance products as previously discussed.

     At December  31, 1994, consolidated invested assets included approximately
$232  million   (adjusted  cost)   of  less  than  investment  grade  corporate
securities, based  on  ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and
insurance regulatory  authorities.   Such investments  had an  aggregate market
value of  approximately $228  million at December 31, 1994 and, based on market
value, represent  approximately 3%  of consolidated  total assets at that date.
See Note  1 of  Notes to  Financial Statements  for further information.  These
securities generally  provide higher  yields and  involve greater  risk of loss
from borrower  default than  investment grade  securities because their issuers
typically have higher levels of indebtedness and are more vulnerable to adverse
economic conditions  than other  issuers.   The Company's results of operations
historically have  not reflected  a material adverse impact from investments in
such securities.
<PAGE>11

     1993 Compared to 1992

     For the year ended December 31, 1993, net income amounted to $97.2 million
versus $69.6  million (before  a $38.0 million charge for "cumulative effect of
accounting change" as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements) for
1992.   The $97.2  million net  income  for  1993  included  net  capital  gain
transactions with  an after-tax  impact of  $5.5 million,  while  1992  results
included an  after-tax charge  of $1.7  million from similar transactions.  The
net capital  gains reported  for 1993  reflected $54.5 million pre-tax gains on
disposals of fixed maturity investments, which were partially offset by pre-tax
losses of  approximately $10.7  million on  disposal of  certain  real  estate,
mortgage and  joint venture  investments and by additions to valuation reserves
for certain  investments with  loss exposure.   The net capital losses reported
for 1992  reflected  the  disposal  of  certain  real  estate  investments  and
additions to  valuation reserves  for certain  investments with  loss  exposure
which, together,  more than offset pre-tax capital gains of approximately $23.2
million from  disposals of  fixed maturity  investments.   As  discussed  under
"Financial Condition,"  the  major  portion  of  disposals  of  fixed  maturity
investments during  1993 and  1992 related  to securities which were called for
redemption by  the respective  issuers prior  to maturity.    Consolidated  net
income for  1993 also  includes a gain of $1.5 million (after applicable taxes)
from sale  of a  subsidiary's home office property and a charge of $2.0 million
to recognize  the cumulative  impact of  the change in corporate Federal income
tax rates  enacted in  August 1993  as required  by FASB Statement No. 109.  In
addition to  this charge,  it is  estimated that the increased rates negatively
impacted second  half 1993  net income  by approximately  $850 thousand.    Net
income for  1992 reflects  a charge equivalent to $10.6 million on an after-tax
basis to  establish a  reserve for amounts receivable from an Association Group
Health marketing organization which declared bankruptcy.

     Excluding the transactions discussed above (capital gains and losses, 1993
recognition of  cumulative impact  of income  tax rate  change and  home office
property sale,  and 1992  charges for  "cumulative effect of accounting change"
and receivables),  consolidated after-tax  income amounted to $92.1 million for
1993 versus  $81.9 million for 1992, an increase of $10.2 million or 12.5%.  On
a similar basis, after-tax income of the life insurance subsidiaries other than
the aforementioned  items increased  $8.1 million  or 6.9%.  The improvement in
life insurance  subsidiary results  came primarily  from an increase in pre-tax
profits from  the individual  life and  annuity product line and a reduction in
pre-tax losses  from "other  group health" coverages, as discussed below.  Also
on a  similar basis,  after-tax  corporate  charges  (including  the  operating
results of  USLIFE's servicing  units) amounted to $34.5 million in 1993 versus
$36.6  million  for  1992,  resulting  in  a  positive  comparative  impact  of
approximately $2  million on  after-tax consolidated results.  Results for 1993
benefited from  lower interest  costs attributable to refinancings of long term
debt and  more favorable  interest rates  applicable to  short  term  corporate
borrowings, as  well as  capital made  available at  the corporate  level as  a
result of the combination of operations of certain life insurance subsidiaries.
In June  1993 the  Company utilized  the proceeds  of its $150 million issue of
6.375% Notes due 2000 to repay short term variable rate bank debt which, at the
time of  repayment, had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.6%.
The impact  of the  latter  refinancing  partially  offset  the  reductions  in
interest expense  from long  term debt  refinancing  transactions.    Corporate
charges  reflect,   among  other  factors,  interest  expense  associated  with
financing of repurchases of the Company's common stock under the treasury stock
repurchase program.

     Pre-tax income  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries for  1993,  excluding
capital gains  and losses  and the  subsidiary home  office sale  as previously
discussed, was  $192.9 million.  For 1992, pre-tax income of the life insurance
subsidiaries excluding  capital gains and losses and the charge for "cumulative
effect of  accounting change"  was $161.4 million, reflecting the $16.0 million
pre-tax impact  of the aforementioned receivables charge.  The major portion of
the life insurance subsidiaries' pre-tax income is attributed to the individual
life insurance  and annuity product line.  A pre-tax profit of $9.3 million was
attributed to  all health insurance coverages in 1993, versus a pre-tax loss of
$19.3 million  in 1992  which resulted  primarily from  the receivables charge.
Employer-employee group health insurance coverages, which are generally written
as a corollary to employer-employee group life insurance, accounted for
<PAGE>12

approximately 86%  and 87% of total health insurance premiums in 1993 and 1992,
respectively.    Employer-employee  group  insurance  coverages  are  discussed
further below.   The  remainder of  the  Company's  health  insurance  business
consists  of  credit  disability  insurance,  "other  group  health"  insurance
(primarily association  group health),  and individual  health  and  disability
coverages.   As indicated  above, the  increase in  life  insurance  subsidiary
after-tax income for 1993 versus 1992 is primarily attributed to an increase in
pre-tax profits  from the  individual life  and  annuity  product  line  and  a
reduction in  pre-tax losses from "other group health" coverages.  A discussion
of the  Company's various  product lines, excluding the impact of capital gains
and losses  and the  1993  subsidiary  home  office  property  sale  which  are
previously discussed, follows.

     Individual life and annuity pre-tax profits, including income attributable
to capital  and surplus,  amounted to  $177.1 million  for 1993  versus  $169.3
million for  1992.   The increase  of $7.8  million or 4.6% reflected favorable
mortality experience during the first nine months of 1993 and a continuation of
gains from investment income margins.

     A pre-tax  profit of  $1.3 million  was reported for credit life insurance
coverages for  1993,  versus  $3.2  million  in  1992,  reflecting  unfavorable
mortality experience during the second and third quarters of 1993.  Credit life
insurance business  in three  key states, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania,
contributed to  this unfavorable  mortality experience.    Since  these  states
require rate  modifications based  on experience over a three-year interval, it
is anticipated that the rating formulas should permit rate adjustments over the
next several years that take into account the current year experience.

     Pre-tax profits  from the Company's group life insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.2 million  for 1993 versus $8.2 million for 1992, a decrease of
$3.0 million.  The negative variance was attributed primarily to less favorable
results from  association group  life insurance coverages and certain specialty
coverages, such  as mortgage life insurance, included in the "other group life"
line.    Pre-tax  profits from  employer-employee group life insurance products
were $4.1  million for  1993 versus  $4.6  million  in  1992,  reflecting  less
favorable mortality experience in 1993.

     The individual  health and disability product line reported a pre-tax loss
of $290  thousand for  1993, versus  a pre-tax  loss of $461 thousand for 1992.
This  product  line  consists  primarily  of  certain  specialty  products  and
coverages issued upon conversion of certain group health insurance products.

     Pre-tax profits  from the  credit disability product line amounted to $5.0
million for  1993, versus  $1.9 million  in  1992,  reflecting  more  favorable
morbidity experience during 1993.

     Total pre-tax  income from  group health  insurance coverages  amounted to
$4.6 million  for 1993,  consisting of  a pre-tax  profit of  $8.9 million from
employer-employee group  health insurance  products and  a pre-tax loss of $4.3
million from  "other group health" products, primarily association group health
insurance.  For 1992, a pre-tax loss of approximately $4.8 million was reported
for group  health insurance  coverages (in addition to the aforementioned $16.0
million receivables  charge), consisting  of a  pre-tax profit  of $7.3 million
from employer-employee  group health  insurance products  and a pre-tax loss of
$12.0 million  from "other  group health"  products.   The increase  in pre-tax
income from  employer-employee group  health insurance coverages reflected more
favorable morbidity  experience in  1993 which  more than  offset the impact of
terminations on  a certain  block of business affected by recent legislation as
discussed below.   Premium income from employer-employee group health insurance
coverages amounted  to approximately  $425 million for 1993 versus $437 million
for 1992.   Premiums  charged for  these products  are subject to periodic rate
adjustments by  the Company which considers, among other factors, trends in the
costs of  benefits provided  in setting  such rates.   Profitability  of  these
products is dependent upon various factors including the ability of the Company
to match  premiums charged  to increases in benefit costs through periodic rate
adjustments and  to maintain  underwriting standards so that premium charged is
consistent with  risk assumed  on an  overall basis.  New York State "community
rating - open enrollment" legislation applicable to insured group medical plans
with less  than fifty  employees, which  became effective  as of April 1, 1993,
prohibits the use of individual underwriting techniques for group major medical
<PAGE>13

business, which  is included  in the  Company's employer-employee  group health
product line.   The  legislation permits carriers to use pre-existing condition
exclusions to  protect against  adverse selection, but prohibits the use of age
and sex  factors in  rating, and  requires that  average rates  be used for the
aforementioned plans.     All affected  in-force business  had to be renewed in
accordance with  the new requirements as of April 1, 1993, and consequently the
Company suspended new business sales of these products in New York State during
the first  quarter to  prepare for  the renewal  process and resumed such sales
effective on the latter date.  This process resulted in an unusually high level
of policy  lapses and  negative impact  on premium  income during  1993 for the
affected coverages in New York State.  Since group life insurance is often sold
in conjunction  with these  medical  sales,  there  was  a  similar  impact  on
employer-employee group  life insurance  products.   In response to current and
anticipated health  insurance reform,  the Company  announced in  December 1993
that it  would restrict  its sales  of new major medical business to 21 states,
including New  York, in which it has a significant amount of in-force business,
while continuing  renewals of this business in all states.  The decrease in the
pre-tax loss  for "other  group health"  products (primarily  association group
health) from  $12.0 million in 1992 to $4.3 million in 1993 reflected a decline
in expenses  attributed to  this line as well as improved morbidity experience.
Legal and  other expenses relating to the aforementioned marketing organization
bankruptcy was  the  major  contributing  factor  in  the  1993  pre-tax  loss,
primarily incurred during the first half of the year,  and a significant factor
in the  1992 loss.   The  1992 loss  for this product line also reflected legal
expenses relating  to a  reinsurance dispute  concerning certain  group medical
insurance programs  previously written by a subsidiary of the Company, in which
settlements were subsequently reached with the reinsurers involved.

     Total revenues  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries in  1993 amounted  to
$1.583 billion,  an increase  of $69.0  million or 4.6% over 1992, primarily on
increases of  $25.0 million  (or 2.3%)  and $29.3 million (or 7.3%) in premiums
and considerations  and net  investment income,  respectively.    Other  income
increased $1.7 million to $18.3 million in 1993, reflecting $2.3 million income
from the  sale of  a subsidiary's home office property during the third quarter
of 1993.   The  increase in premiums and considerations came primarily from the
individual life  insurance and  annuity product line and from increased written
premiums on  the Company's  credit insurance  products.   A decrease  of  $12.8
million in employer-employee group insurance premiums, reflecting the impact of
recent state  legislation as  discussed above,  was a partial offset.  Premiums
and other  considerations from  individual life  insurance and annuity products
amounted to  $388.1 million  in 1993,  compared to $366.7 million in 1992, with
the  increase  from  both  interest  sensitive  and  traditional  products  and
reflecting a  larger base  of in-force  business.   Although the pre-tax annual
yield on  investments declined  from 8.76%  in  1992  to  8.35%  in  1993,  net
investment income  increased  $29.3  million  as  noted  above  with  a  larger
investment base  in 1993.   This  decrease in  pre-tax annual  yield reflects a
continuing decline  in market  interest rates  which has  resulted in  calls of
higher yielding securities out of the investment portfolio and the reinvestment
of proceeds  from these  securities, as well as funds provided from operations,
at lower  available current rates.  In this connection, it should be noted that
the Company's  liability for  policyholder account  balances, amounting to $3.3
billion at  December 31, 1993, relates to interest sensitive life insurance and
annuity contracts  that are subject to periodic adjustment of credited interest
rates.   Credited interest  rates are determined by management based on factors
including available  market interest  rates  and  portfolio  rates  of  return.
Interest rates  credited on the Company's deferred annuity contracts, exclusive
of first  year increments  on certain  products, typically  ranged from 6.8% to
5.0% during 1992 and from 5.0% to 4.5% in 1993.  Interest rates credited on the
Company's universal life insurance contracts typically ranged from 8.5% to 6.5%
in 1992  and from  7.5% to 6.0% in 1993, reflecting periodic decreases in these
credited rates during both 1993 and 1992.

     Total benefits  and expenses  of the life insurance subsidiaries increased
$22.3 million  or 1.6% over 1992, reflecting the inclusion of the $16.0 million
receivables  charge   in  1992   results.     Benefits  to   policyholders  and
beneficiaries amounted  to $737.7  million in  1993, versus  $740.6 million  in
1992.   The decrease  reflects various  factors including reduced volume in the
employer-employee group health line relating to policy lapses attributed to the
impact of  recent state  legislation as  previously discussed and the impact of
favorable mortality  and voluntary  policy termination experience on individual
life coverages.  Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased
<PAGE>14

$10.2 million (or 5.9%), reflecting the increased volume of universal life-type
and individual  annuity contracts  in 1993  with the  impact of  reductions  in
credited rates  of interest  on certain  contracts a partial offsetting factor.
An increase  in future  policy benefits of $39.8 million was recorded for 1993,
versus $34.8  million for  1992,  with  the  $5.0  million  variance  primarily
associated with  the increase in written premiums on credit insurance coverages
as noted  above.  Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amounted to
$151.9 million  in 1993  versus $131.8  million  in  1992,  reflecting  various
factors including  the increased volume of individual life and annuity business
in force  during 1993.  Excluding the impact of the 1992 receivables charge, an
aggregate increase  of $6.2 million or 2.5% in commissions, insurance taxes and
licenses, and  general expenses  reflected the  increased individual  life  and
annuity volume,  with reduced  legal and  other expenses relating to the "other
group health" product line a partial offset.

Life Insurance

  General

     In 1994,  USLIFE's life insurance business was conducted by four operating
life insurance  subsidiaries (the  "Life Insurance  Subsidiaries"): The  United
States Life  Insurance Company  In The City of New York ("United States Life"),
All American  Life Insurance  Company ("All  American Life"), The Old Line Life
Insurance Company  of  America  ("Old  Line  Life"),  and  USLIFE  Credit  Life
Insurance Company ("USLIFE Credit Life").

     The  Life   Insurance  Subsidiaries   are  all  domestic  stock  insurance
corporations with  strong regional  identifications.  United States Life is the
oldest stock life insurance company in America, having been incorporated in New
York in  February, 1850.   While  authorized to do business in all fifty states
and the  District of Columbia, its business is heavily concentrated in New York
and adjacent eastern states.  All American Life was incorporated in Illinois in
1950, and is licensed to do business in all states, except New York, and in the
District of  Columbia.   Approximately 36%  of its business in 1994 was derived
from the central and southwestern regions of the United States.  Old Line Life,
incorporated in Wisconsin in 1910, is authorized to do business in all states,

<PAGE>16

except New  York, and in the District of Columbia; its business is concentrated
heavily in  Wisconsin, California,  New Jersey  and the north central region of
the United  States.   USLIFE Credit  Life, whose  predecessors date  from 1890,
derives most  of its  business from  its  home  state  of  Illinois  and  other
midwestern and northwestern states.


  Types of Insurance Written

     The Life Insurance Subsidiaries offer a broad portfolio of individual life
insurance and  annuity policies.  Also, through United States Life, part of the
sales forces  of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries offer  group life and health
insurance policies  with particular  emphasis on  small groups.  Group life and
health insurance  policies are  also offered  to associations.   Several of the
Life Insurance  Subsidiaries also  offer products designed for funding pension,
profit-sharing and  other qualified  plans.  In addition, through USLIFE Equity
Sales Corp.,  equity products  are available  for the  noninsurance portion  of
these plans.   Credit  insurance is  offered principally  through USLIFE Credit
Life.

     Individual life  policies  are  offered  by  all  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries,  except   USLIFE  Credit   Life,  on   a  non-participating   and
participating  basis.     Participating  insurance  is  insurance  whereby  the
policyholder is  entitled to receive policy dividends reflecting the difference
between the premium charged and actual experience, the premium being calculated
to provide  a margin  over the  anticipated cost  of insurance  protection.  On
December 31,  1994, 2%  of individual life insurance in force was participating
and premiums  on participating  policies  represented  7%  of  individual  life
insurance premium  income in  1994.   See "Participating Policies" in Note 1 of
Notes to  Financial Statements.   All  group business,  other than  credit life
insurance, is  on a  non-participating basis  but  approximately  12%  of  such
business is  subject to  experience ratings  under which  the policyholder  may
receive refund  credits depending  on experience.   Substantially  all  of  the
credit life insurance in force is non-participating.

     The following tabulations set forth the classes of life insurance in force
at December  31, and  the amount  of new  life insurance  paid for  and premium
income in each of the years 1990 through 1994.

     Universal life  insurance represents  approximately 36%,  37% and  37%  of
total individual  life insurance  in force at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.   Universal life  insurance policies  permit the  policyholder to
vary the  timing and  amount of  premium payments,  within contractual  limits.
Premium payments  under these  policies  are  credited  to  the  policyholder's
account balance,  from which  amounts are  assessed for risk and administrative
charges.   These charges  are subject  to periodic  adjustment by  the Company.
Interest is  credited to  the policyholder's account balance at rates which are
subject to  periodic adjustment by the Company.  The remainder of the Company's
individual life  insurance in  force consists primarily of whole life insurance
and term  insurance coverages.   These  contracts generally  provide for  fixed
premium payments  and death  benefits.   Whole life  policies provide insurance
over the entire life of the insured, with the face amount payable only upon the
death of the insured, and typically provide for the accumulation of a surrender
value based  on contractual  terms which  may be payable to the policyholder or
utilized to purchase a different form of insurance in the event that the policy
is terminated  prior to  death of the insured.  Term insurance policies provide
insurance over  a specified period of time, with the face amount payable if the
insured dies  during the  policy term.   Inasmuch as term policies generally do
not provide for maturity benefits or accumulation of significant cash surrender
values, premiums  per dollar  of death  benefit are  often initially lower than
those of  whole life  policies.   The 1994 increase in face value of individual
insurance issued  came primarily from increased term insurance sales.  Sales of
universal  life   insurance  and  traditional  permanent  life  insurance  also
increased in  1994 as  compared to  1993.   The 1993  increase in face value of
individual insurance  issued reflects  increased sales  of both  universal  and
traditional products  as compared  to the  prior year.    The  face  amount  of
individual life  insurance terminated, in the aggregate, by lapse and surrender
amounted to  $8.2 billion,  $7.9 billion,  and $7.7  billion in  1994, 1993 and
1992, respectively.   The  relative consistency  of  these  terminations  as  a
percentage of  beginning of  year in-force business reflected a continuation of
favorable voluntary  policy termination ("persistency") experience.  Subject to
any applicable  surrender  charges,  the  Company's  universal  life  insurance
products and  individual annuities  may be  surrendered by  the holder.  A cash
surrender  value,  based  on  contractual  terms,  is  also  available  to  the
policyholder upon  surrender of  many of  the Company's  traditional individual
life insurance  policies  under  which  cash  values  are  accumulated.    Such
surrenders are  influenced by  various factors  including economic  conditions,
available  alternative  investment  returns,  competition  for  investment  and
insurance funds,  and perceived  financial strength  of  the  insurer.    These
contracts are  generally supported  by the  investment portfolios  of the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries,  which are  primarily comprised  of  investment  grade,
publicly traded  corporate bonds.   Substantially all of the Company's interest
sensitive life  insurance and  annuity contracts  provide for  imposition of  a
surrender charge  in the  event of  policy surrender during a specified initial
period commencing  with contract  inception, typically ten to fifteen years for
universal life insurance and five to seven years for individual annuities, with
the significance of this charge often subject to reduction over the applicable
<PAGE>19

period  or  during  the  later  portion  thereof.    The  Company's  investment
portfolios are  continually monitored  to determine whether the distribution of
investment maturities  is considered  appropriate for expected levels of policy
surrenders.  The adjusted cost and estimated market value of the Company's debt
security investments, by contractual maturity, are set forth in Note 1 of Notes
to Financial  Statements.  As discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial  Condition and  Results of  Operations herein, the Company's fixed
maturity investments  may be  sold prior  to maturity  as part of the Company's
asset /  liability management  strategy and  are classified  as "available  for
sale."   Adjustments to the investment maturity distribution, if necessary, may
also be  accomplished by  actions concerning  the investment  of incoming funds
and/or reinvestment  of the  proceeds of  securities matured  or redeemed.  The
Company monitors  its surrenders on a monthly basis.  Any material deviation or
emerging trend is traced to the product line and agency of record, and remedial
action is  taken where  appropriate.   The 1994 and 1993 increases in aggregate
volume of group and credit insurance issued were primarily attributed to credit
life insurance  and reflected  various factors  including new  credit insurance
accounts and new volume on certain cases transferred to USLIFE Credit Life from
another subsidiary.   The  greater amount  of group and credit insurance volume
attributed to  "increase, net"  in 1994  versus 1993  relates primarily  to net
increases in face amount of employer/association business on previously written
cases.




  Accident and Health Insurance

</TABLE>


     Group health business is often written as a corollary to the sale of group
life insurance.   Premiums  charged for  group health  insurance  products  are
subject to  periodic rate  adjustments by  the Company  which considers,  among
other factors,  trends in the costs of benefits provided in setting such rates.
Profitability of these products is dependent upon various factors including the
ability of  the Company to match premiums charged to increases in benefit costs
through periodic  rate adjustments  and to  maintain underwriting  standards so
that premium  charged is consistent with risk assumed on an overall basis.  The
1994 increase  in pre-tax  income from  the group  health insurance  lines came
primarily  from  a  decrease  in  legal  and  other  expenses  relating  to  an
association group  health marketing organization which had declared bankruptcy.
The benefit  from mitigation  of these  expenses was  offset by the impact of a
decline in premiums on employer/association health products as discussed below.
The 1992  loss from  group health insurance coverages reflects a pre-tax charge
of $16.0  million to  establish a  reserve  for  amounts  receivable  from  the
aforementioned marketing  organization.   The remainder  of the loss from these
coverages in  1992 resulted  primarily from  charges to  reflect the  impact of
settlement of  a reinsurance dispute concerning certain group medical insurance
programs previously  written by  a subsidiary  of the  Company as well as legal
expenses and  other costs  relating both  to the  reinsurance dispute  and  the
marketing organization in bankruptcy.

     Premium revenues  from the  group  accident  and  health  line  have  been
declining  since   1992.    This  decline  is  primarily  attributed  to  state
legislation in New York and New Jersey and the Company's decision, announced in
December 1993,  to withdraw  from group major medical business in approximately
30 states where the amount of in-force business was judged insufficient to

<PAGE>20

justify  the   expense  of   continued  presence.    The  aforementioned  state
legislation has  required the  Company to  redesign its  portfolio  of  medical
coverage products  in the  affected states  as well  as seek  out managed  care
partners in  order to  offer competitive  products.   In late 1994 and in early
1995 the  Company introduced  two managed  care products in the New York market
which, management believes, will facilitate resumption of its sales efforts and
alleviate the  premium erosion.   A similar product is awaiting approval in New
Jersey.   During 1993 and 1994, a number of modifications and improvements were
made to the Company's "stand-alone" group life, long term disability and dental
insurance products, with goals including an increase in the proportion of group
insurance business  from non-major-medical lines.  Several product enhancements
were also introduced for products sold through associations.  In general, these
initiatives have  resulted in increasing sales of non-major-medical business in
both the  employer and association markets.  However, premium growth to date in
these areas  has not been sufficient to fully compensate for the reduced volume
of major medical business.

     The individual  accident and  health product  line consists  primarily  of
certain specialty  products and  coverages issued  upon conversion  of  certain
group health  insurance products.   The pre-tax loss recorded in 1992 reflected
poor morbidity  experience on  specialty products  included in  this line.  The
1993 loss  was primarily  attributed to  results on coverages issued upon group
health conversions.   The  improved results  in 1994  came primarily  from more
favorable morbidity  experience on  certain specialty products included in this
line.

     Credit disability  insurance is  written in  conjunction with  credit life
insurance and covers the continuation of loan payments to a lender in the event
the borrower  becomes disabled.  The credit disability pre-tax profits reported
above include  net capital  gains of approximately $700 thousand, $2.5 million,
and $1.5  million in  1994, 1993,  and 1992,  respectively.    Excluding  these
transactions, pre-tax  income increased  from $1.9  million  in  1992  to  $5.0
million in  1993 and  $5.2  million  in  1994  with  more  favorable  morbidity
experience in the latter two years the primary factor.




  Investments and Investment Results

     Investments are  subject to  the direction  and control  of the  Boards of
Directors or  Executive Committees  of each  of the  respective Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries.   Many investments  are made  upon the  recommendation of  USLIFE
Realty Corporation  or USLIFE  Real Estate  Services Corporation  (see  "Realty
Investment" below)  with respect  to real  estate and  mortgages, and  upon the
recommendation of  the parent  company with respect to securities, all of which
furnish such  investment advice  to  the  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries.    All
investments must  comply with  applicable insurance laws and regulations, which
prescribe the  nature, quality  and percentages of various types of investments
which may be made by insurance companies.  The major portion of funds available
for investment  in recent  years has  been invested  in  bonds  and  redeemable
preferred stocks ("fixed maturities"), and in short term investments, including
corporate commercial paper and money market instruments.

     Commencing December  31, 1992, fixed maturities which may be sold prior to
maturity as  a result of the Company's investment strategies were classified as
available for  sale and  carried at  the lower  of aggregate  adjusted cost  or
market value  as of  the balance  sheet date.   As  discussed below,  valuation
reserves are  maintained for  fixed maturities  and other  investments  with  a
reduction in value determined to be other than temporary.  Effective January 1,
1994, the  Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for  Certain Investments  in Debt  and  Equity  Securities,"  which
requires the  Company's fixed  maturity investments  to be  carried  at  market
value.  Common stocks and non-redeemable preferred stocks ("equity securities")
are carried at market.  See Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements for further
information.

     The mortgage portfolios of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31,
1994 had  an aggregate  principal amount  of  approximately  $330  million  and
consisted of approximately 300 loans.  The mortgage portfolio of the Life


<PAGE>21

Insurance Subsidiaries  is characterized  by a broad geographical distribution,
with approximately  7% of total book value at December 31, 1994 relating to the
New England  region of  the United States, 18% from the middle-Atlantic states,
20% from the north-central states, 16% from the south-Atlantic states, 11% from
the south-central  states, 13%  from the  mountain states,  and  15%  from  the
Pacific states.  Based on book value, approximately 39% of these mortgage loans
at that  date are  secured by  office buildings,  24% by industrial / warehouse
properties, 25%  retail, and  the remainder  secured by apartments, one to four
family residential,  hotel /  motel, medically  oriented,  or  other  specialty
properties.   At December  31, 1994,  the average principal balance of mortgage
loans contained  in the  portfolio was  $1.1 million,  with a  weighted average
yield of  10.1% on principal balance.  The average maturity was approximately 7
years.   The largest principal balance of any single mortgage loan at that date
was $12.1  million.   The Company regards delinquent mortgage loans to be those
on which  interest due  is unpaid  for 60  days or  more  or  the  loan  is  in
foreclosure.    The  book  value  of  delinquent  mortgage  loans  amounted  to
approximately 2.9% and 7.3% of the mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 1994
and 1993,  respectively.   On December  31, 1994  property held  as a result of
foreclosure of loans amounted to $30 million.

     The fixed  maturities portfolios  of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries  at
December 31,  1994 were  predominantly comprised of investment grade securities
(based  on  ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and  insurance
regulatory authorities).   At  December 31,  1994, invested  assets of the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  included approximately  $215 million (adjusted cost) of
less than  investment grade  fixed maturity securities, based on these ratings.
The latter  investments had  an aggregate  market value  of approximately  $212
million  as  of  December  31,  1994  and  based  on  market  value,  represent
approximately 3%  of total  assets of  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries at that
date.   These securities  generally provide  higher yields  and involve greater
risk of  loss from  borrower default  than investment  grade securities because
their issuers  typically have  higher  levels  of  indebtedness  and  are  more
vulnerable to  adverse economic  conditions than other issuers.  The results of
operations of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries historically have not reflected a
material adverse  impact from  investment in  such securities.   Certain bonds,
representing less  than 1% of the total fixed maturities portfolio for the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries,  have defaulted  in interest.   Quality  ratings of the
fixed maturities  portfolio of  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31,
1994 with  respect to  each National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners
(NAIC) credit classification are as follows:

     The  Company's  management  of  the  investment  portfolios  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries includes identification and evaluation of holdings which
are non-performing  or have otherwise indicated performance which could imperil
future investment  income or recovery of invested amounts.  A valuation reserve
(established  through   income  statement  charges)  is  maintained  for  those
investments where  a  reduction  of  value  is  determined  to  be  other  than
temporary.   In 1994,  net additions  to the  valuation reserve  for securities
investments (on a pre-tax basis) were $2.6 million, and a total of $6.4 million
was released  from the  reserves for  real estate,  mortgage  loans  and  other
investments due to disposal of certain investments for which reserves were
<PAGE>22

previously established.   In  1993, net  additions to the valuation reserve for
securities investments (on a pre-tax basis) amounted to $7.6 million, and $25.0
million was added to such reserves relating to real estate, mortgage loans, and
other long  term investments.   In 1992, net additions to the valuation reserve
for securities  investments (on a pre-tax basis) amounted to $153 thousand, and
$23.0 million  was added  to such  reserves relating  to real  estate, mortgage
loans, and  other long  term investments.  Total pre-tax portfolio reserves for
the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  amounted to  $121.4 million  at December  31,
1994.   The Company  believes that  adequate  reserves  for  losses  have  been
established.

     The following  table shows  the investment  results of  the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries for the periods indicated.

     (1) Does  not include  adjustments for  net unrealized gains and losses on
securities.    See  Note  1  of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.

     (2) Net  investment income  is after  deduction of investment expenses but
before realized capital gains or losses and federal income taxes.

     (3) Calculated  on the  basis of  a formula  prescribed  by  the  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners  which computes  the yield  on the mean
asset values during the year.

     (4) The  1992 net  realized loss  reflected the  disposal of  certain real
estate  properties   and  additions  to  the  valuation  reserves  for  certain
investments which,  in the aggregate, more than offset $23.3 million gross pre-
tax capital gains from disposals of fixed maturity investments.

The investment  management policies  of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries include
continual evaluation of securities market conditions and circumstances relating
to particular  investment holdings  which may  result  in  selection  of  fixed
maturity or  other investments for sale prior to maturity.  Securities may also
be sold  as part  of the  Company's asset  / liability  management strategy  in
response to  changes in  interest rates, resultant prepayment risk, and similar
factors.  The net yield on cash and invested assets declined from 8.76% in 1992
to 8.35%  in 1993  and 7.92%  in 1994,  as a  decline in  market interest rates
during 1992 and 1993 resulted in calls of higher yielding securities out of the
investment portfolio and the reinvestment of proceeds from these securities, as
well as  funds provided  from operations,  at lower  available interest  rates.
These security redemptions prior to maturity substantially abated following the
first quarter  of 1994,  with  increases  in  market  interest  rates  on  debt
securities prevailing  during  the  latter  portion  of  the  year.    In  this
connection, it  should be  noted that  the Company's liability for policyholder
account balances,  amounting to  $3.6 billion  and $3.3 billion at December 31,
1994 and  1993, respectively,  relates to interest sensitive life insurance and
annuity contracts  that are subject to periodic adjustment of credited interest
rates.   Credited interest  rates are determined by management based on factors
including available  market interest  rates  and  portfolio  rates  of  return.
Interest rates  credited on  the  Company's  interest  sensitive  products  are
sensitive to changes in interest rates earned on the Company's investments.  As
discussed in  Management's Discussion  and Analysis  of "Results of Operations"
herein, the  interest rates  credited on  the Company's  deferred  annuity  and
universal life  products declined in 1992 and 1993, and interest rates credited
on the major portion of the Company's deferred annuity contracts were increased

<PAGE>23

beginning during  the latter  portion of  1994.   Credited rates of interest on
interest-sensitive contracts  generally follow  the pattern  of yields  on  the
assets supporting the related liabilities, while traditional contracts (such as
permanent and  term coverages)  are  not  subject  to  credited  interest  rate
adjustments.   As discussed  under  "Regulation"  herein,  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries have  complied for  statement years  1994 and  1993 with valuation
actuary testing  requirements, promulgated  by the  NAIC, which apply specified
rules to  assess the  impact of various interest rate scenarios on the adequacy
of assets  to meet  policyholder liabilities.  These tests did not disclose any
failure of  the Company's  assets to  support its  policy liabilities under the
NAIC specified testing scenarios.


  Reserves and Reinsurance

     In accordance  with applicable  law, the  Life Insurance Subsidiaries have
set up  and carry actuarial reserves to meet their obligations on their various
policies.   These reserves  are amounts  which, together  with  additions  from
premiums to  be received  and interest  on such reserves compounded annually at
certain assumed  rates, are  calculated to  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries'  policy obligations as they mature.   The liability for
policy benefits  relating to  cash values  of interest  sensitive  products  is
accumulated based  on credited  rates of interest which are subject to periodic
adjustment.   The statutory  reserves of  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are
certified by internal actuaries as permitted by state insurance departments and
are not  specifically examined  by independent  actuaries.   The Life Insurance
Subsidiaries generally  reinsure risks  over $1.5  million as  well as selected
risks of lesser amounts.  See Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.


  Employees and Agents

     At December  31, 1994,  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries had approximately
1,500 regular employees at their home and regional offices, and individual life
insurance policies  were sold  principally  through  approximately  500  active
general agencies  located throughout  the United  States.   As discussed below,
services are also furnished to the Life Insurance Subsidiaries by the Company's
Realty Investment,  Securities Investment, and Corporate Services subsidiaries,
and by USLIFE Corporation.

     With few  exceptions,  the  general  agents  and  producers  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  are independent  contractors and  are compensated  on a
commission basis  within limitations set by applicable insurance laws.  Service
fees and  expense reimbursement  allowances are  paid to  general agents,  also
within the  limitations of  applicable insurance  laws.   A large percentage of
producers also sell for other companies.


  Home Offices

     The home  office of  United States  Life is  located in  a  portion  of  a
building at 125 Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038.  In December 1986 United
States Life  sold this  building and leased back portions of the premises which
are utilized  as its  principal executive  offices as  well  as  the  principal
executive offices  of USLIFE,  USLIFE Equity  Sales Corporation,  USLIFE Realty
Corporation, USLIFE Advisers, Inc. and an office of USLIFE Systems Corporation.
The leases  for space occupied by United States Life and other USLIFE companies
expire in  1996.   Present annual  base rent  for all  such companies  is  $3.7
million, subject  to adjustment,  tax and escalation clauses.  Certain of these
leases provide  for renewal options for two successive ten year terms, based on
fair rental  value at  the time  of renewal.  The group insurance operations of
United States  Life, certain  other clerical  and  administrative  units  which
provide support  services for  that company  and certain  other Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries, and  several corporate  units are  located in  a building at 3600
Route 66,  Neptune, New  Jersey 07754.   This  building is rented under a lease
expiring in  2003 with renewal options for two additional five year terms and a
further option  relating to rental of additional office space.  The annual base
rent under this lease is approximately $2.3 million, subject to adjustment, tax
and escalation  clauses.   See Note  8 of  Notes to  Financial  Statements  for
further information regarding the Company's lease commitments.

In addition,  subsidiaries of  USLIFE own or lease other properties which house
insurance and  related service  operations.  Management believes its facilities
are adequate for present needs in all material respects.
<PAGE>24

  Regulation

     The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision
by the supervisory agency of each state or other jurisdiction in which they are
licensed to  do business.  These supervisory agencies have broad administrative
powers relating  to  the  granting  and  revocation  of  licenses  to  transact
business, the  licensing of  agents, the  approval  of  policy  forms,  premium
levels, the  form and content of mandatory financial statements (see "Insurance
Accounting" in  Note 1  of Notes  to Financial  Statements), capital,  surplus,
reserve requirements  and the  types of  investments which  may be  made.   The
National Association  of Insurance  Commissioners ("NAIC")  recommended in 1992
certain  new   regulatory  reporting   requirements  for  insurance  companies,
including "valuation actuary" and "risk-based capital" requirements.  Under the
valuation  actuary   requirement,  the   company  must   provide  an  actuary's
certification of  the adequacy  of  reserves  for  future  liabilities,  taking
account of  the assets  that support  them,  under  various  possible  economic
scenarios.   As indicated  under "Investments and Investment Results," the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries have satisfactorily complied with these requirements for
statement years  1994, 1993  and 1992.   The  risk-based capital  requirements,
effective with  statement year  1993,   require the company to demonstrate that
capital and  surplus meet  or exceed formula-driven standards based on exposure
to specific  categories of  risk.   Companies that do not meet a standard of at
least a  200% ratio  of "Total  Adjusted Capital"  to "Authorized Control Level
Risk-Based Capital,"  as defined  by regulatory  authorities, are identified as
candidates for  various levels  of regulatory  action, ranging  from  increased
surveillance to state insurance department control.  At December 31, 1994, each
of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries exceeded  the required  risk-based capital
ratios, with  each ratio  (as defined)  in excess of 400%.   The Life Insurance
Subsidiaries have  not experienced  and do  not anticipate an adverse impact on
their operations  as a  consequence of  the valuation  actuary  and  risk-based
capital  requirements.     As  specified  by  the  NAIC,  Insurance  Regulatory
Information System  ("IRIS") ratios  of certain key statutory data are computed
for the  Life Insurance Subsidiaries on an annual basis.  These ratios revealed
no  material   exceptions  for   statement  year  1994.    The  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries may  be required,  under the  solvency or  guaranty  laws  of  the
various states  in which they are licensed, to pay assessments up to prescribed
limits to  fund policyholder  losses  or  liabilities  of  insolvent  insurance
companies.   The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are required  to  file  detailed
reports with  each supervisory  agency, and their books and records are subject
to examination  by each.   In accordance with the insurance codes in the states
in which  they are  domiciled and  the rules  and  practices  of  the  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners,  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are
examined periodically  by examiners  of the  states in which they are domiciled
and by  representatives (on  an "association"  or "zone"  basis) of  the  other
states in  which they  are licensed  to do business.  All of the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries have been examined at least as of December 31, 1990.

     Annual  financial   statements  prepared   in  accordance  with  statutory
accounting practices  for each  of the  Company's Life  Insurance Subsidiaries,
filed with  insurance departments  in  the  states  where  the  Company's  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  are domiciled  or licensed  to do business, require the
inclusion of  an interest  maintenance reserve  ("IMR") and  an asset valuation
reserve ("AVR"),  according to  regulations prescribed  by  the  NAIC.    These
regulations apply  to all invested assets and require that investment gains and
losses resulting from changes in interest rates be distinguished from gains and
losses resulting  from changes  in creditworthiness.    The  IMR  captures  all
investment gains  and losses  resulting from  changes  in  interest  rates  and
provides for  subsequent amortization of such amounts into statutory net income
on a basis reflecting the remaining lives of the assets sold.  The AVR captures
investment gains  and losses  related to  changes in  creditworthiness  and  is
adjusted each  year based  on  a  formula  related  to  the  quality  and  loss
experience of  the Company's  investment portfolio.   The AVR requires reserves
for mortgage loans, other invested assets and short-term investments as well as
fixed maturity  and equity  security investments.   The  AVR and  IMR  are  not
recorded under  generally accepted  accounting principles and consequently have
no impact  on reported  financial position  or results  of  operations  of  the
Company.  The Company has not experienced any significant adverse impact on its
overall operations as a result of these regulatory accounting requirements and,
based on  the current  composition of  the investment  portfolios of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries,  the Company  does not currently anticipate significant
adverse impact.

     Most states have enacted legislation or adopted administrative regulations
covering such  matters as the acquisition of control of insurance companies and
transactions between insurance companies and the persons controlling them.  The
<PAGE>25

National  Association   of  Insurance   Commissioners  has   recommended  model
legislation on  these subjects which has been adopted, with variations, by many
states.     The  nature  and  extent  of  the  legislation  and  administrative
regulations now  in effect  vary from  state to  state, and in most states they
require administrative  approval of  the acquisition of control of an insurance
company incorporated  in the  state,  whether  by  tender  offer,  exchange  of
securities, merger or otherwise, and require the filing of detailed information
regarding the  acquiring parties  and the plan of acquisition.  Every insurance
company which  is authorized  to do business in the state and is a member of an
"insurance holding  company system,"  other  than  a  company  incorporated  in
another state  subject to  substantially similar  disclosure  requirements  and
standards, is  generally required  to  register  as  such  with  the  insurance
regulatory authorities  and file  periodic reports concerning its relationships
with the insurance holding company and other affiliates of the holding company.
Material transactions between registered insurance companies and members of the
holding company  system are  required to  be "fair  and reasonable" and in some
cases are  subject to  administrative approval,  and the  books,  accounts  and
records of  each party  are required  to be  so maintained  as to  clearly  and
accurately disclose the precise nature and details of the transactions.  Notice
to or  approval by  regulatory authorities is frequently required for dividends
paid by  insurance companies,  and their  surplus  following  any  dividend  is
required to  be reasonable  in relation to outstanding liabilities and adequate
for financial  needs.   See "Insurance  Accounting"  in  Note  1  of  Notes  to
Financial Statements  for  further  information  regarding  dividends.    Broad
examination and  enforcement powers  are conferred  on regulatory  authorities.
Each of  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries is required to register as a member of
an insurance  holding company system with the insurance supervisory authorities
in at  least one  state.  USLIFE does not presently anticipate that legislation
and regulation  such as  that described  above  will  materially  restrict  its
activities.

     Acquired Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS),  which  has  received  wide
publicity because  of its  serious public health implications, presents special
concerns to  the life  insurance industry.   Morbidity  and mortality risks are
accepted  by   insurers  based   on  methods   of  classification  designed  to
appropriately relate  premiums charged  to such  risks and, in this connection,
steps have  been taken  toward strengthening  the  Company's  underwriting  and
selection process.   The  Company's  own  mortality  and  morbidity  experience
reflects no  significant adverse impact as a result of any acceleration of AIDS
claims.   The Company is continuing to monitor developments in this area but is
necessarily unable  to predict the long term impact of this problem on the life
insurance industry generally or on the Company.


  Competition

     The insurance  business is highly competitive, and there are approximately
1,800 stock  and mutual  companies some  of which  are  larger  than  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  (individually and  in the  aggregate).   Although  most
insurance companies  are stock  companies, mutual  companies account for nearly
40% of the life insurance in force in the United States and hold a still larger
percentage of  the admitted  assets.   The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries believe
that their  premium rates  and policies are generally competitive with those of
other life insurance companies.

     If the  aggregate volume  of insurance  in force  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries were considered to be that of one company, such company would have
ranked 19th  among the  companies listed  in surveys  contained in the June 27,
1994 edition  of the  National Underwriter,  Life and Health Insurance Edition.
In addition  to competition  among life insurance companies, the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries also  compete increasingly  with other financial institutions such
as commercial  banks and  securities brokerage organizations.  Competition from
such financial  institutions as well as other insurance companies is considered
by the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries in  determining the  rates of return to be
offered on  interest sensitive  products.   See discussion under "Additions and
Terminations."

     USLIFE Realty  Corporation ("Realty")  was incorporated  in 1954.   Realty
manages  a   portfolio  of  real  estate,  mortgage  loan,  and  joint  venture
investments (approximately  $1 million  at  December  31,  1994),  enters  into
mortgage and  real estate  standby commitments  for fees  which may include the
receipt of  equity interests  and participates  in real  estate joint  ventures
relating to properties being built for investment or sale.

     USLIFE Real  Estate Services  Corporation ("Services") was incorporated in
1969.  Services, a subsidiary of Realty, is an approved mortgagee for placement
and servicing  of FHA  insured mortgages.   Services provides investment advice
and management services for the combined mortgage and real estate portfolios of
the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries as well as certain other services for the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries,  such as  originating mortgage loans, arranging standby
commitments for  fees and  participations in  real estate  equity  developments
which frequently  include participation  in the  profits or  ownership  of  the
underlying enterprises.   Investment  decisions, both  as to overall investment
objectives such  as diversification,  yield and  risk, and  as to  the specific
investment,  remain   the  responsibility  of  the  individual  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries.   USLIFE Real  Estate Services Corporation also provides services
relating to  mortgage  portfolios  of  non-affiliated  companies  amounting  to
approximately $5 million at December 31, 1994.

its shareholders.   Income  Fund made  a public  offering of  its securities in
December 1972  and had  net assets of approximately $52 million at December 31,
1994.   Advisers' services  to Income  Fund are  furnished under  an investment
advisory contract  which, as  required by  the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
provides that its continuance is subject to specific approval at least annually
by a  majority of  the directors  of Income  Fund, including  a majority of its
directors who  are not  parties to  such agreement or interested persons of any
such party,  or by  vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting

Item 2.  Properties.

     Descriptions of properties of USLIFE and its subsidiaries are set forth in
Item 1.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

    Reference is  made to  Part II,  Item I, Legal Proceedings, in Registrant's
Quarterly Report  on Form  10-Q for  the quarter  ended June  30,  1994  for  a
description of  a  federal  court  action  entitled  USLIFE  Savings  and  Loan
Association v. Louis Wilcox, et al., which is incorporated by reference herein.
There have  been no material developments in this matter since the date of that
report.

   Reference is  made to  Part II,  Item I,  Legal Proceedings, in Registrant's
Quarterly Report  on Form  10-Q for  the quarter ended September 30, 1994 for a
description of  a purported  class action  entitled Hoban v. USLIFE Credit Life
Insurance Company,  All American Life Insurance Company and Security of America
Life Insurance  Company, which is incorporated by reference herein.  There have
been no material developments in this matter since the date of that report.

  On November 17, 1994, a purported class action (Smith et al. v. USLIFE Credit
Life Insurance  Company, et  al.) was filed in the United States District Court
for the  Northern  District  of  Illinois.    The  Complaint  alleges  that  in
connection with  purchases by  plaintiffs of single premium term life insurance
from  mortgage   lenders  in   connection  with   mortgage  loans,   defendants
misrepresented the  type of insurance offered as credit life insurance and sold
the term  life insurance  at premiums  in excess  of those permitted for credit
life insurance.  The Complaint further alleges that upon prepayment of mortgage
loans plaintiffs did not receive refunds of unearned premiums, which they would
have been  entitled to  receive had  they purchased credit life insurance.  The
Complaint contains  claims for  damages  for  breach  of  contract,  breach  of
fiduciary duty, unfair and deceptive acts and practices, fraud, restitution and
unjust enrichment  and civil claims under the Federal RICO statute.  On January
10, 1995,  defendants filed  motions to  dismiss the Complaint for, among other
reasons, failure to state a legally cognizable claim.

  At this  point in  time the  outcome  of  these  suits  is  not  predictable.
However, in  the opinion  of management, the ultimate resolution of these suits
is not  likely to  have a  material adverse  affect on  the consolidated Equity
Capital of the Company.

     For the  purposes of  complying with the amendments to the rules governing
Form S-8  (effective July  13, 1990)  under the  Securities Act  of  1933,  the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into registrant's Registration Statements on Form S-8
Nos. 33-40793  (filed June 23, 1991), 33-13999 (filed May 11, 1987) and 2-77278
(filed April 30, 1982):

     Insofar as  indemnification for  liabilities under  the Securities  Act of
1933 may  be permitted  to directors,  officers and  controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant  to the  foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant
has been  advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification  is against  public policy  as expressed in the Securities
Act of  1933 and  is, therefore,  unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
indemnification against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant of  expenses incurred  or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of  the registrant  in the  successful defense  of any  action, suit  or
proceeding) is  asserted by  such director,  officer or  controlling person  in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion  of  its  counsel  the  matter  has  been  settled  by  controlling
precedent, submit  to a  court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
                                       

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  USLIFE Corporation:

     We have  audited the  accompanying consolidated  balance sheets  of USLIFE
Corporation and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related
statements of  consolidated income,  equity capital, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1994.  These consolidated
financial statements  are the  responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with generally  accepted auditing
standards.   Those standards  require that  we plan  and perform  the audit  to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.   An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the  amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates made  by management,  as well  as evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement presentation.   We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all  material respects,  the financial  position of  USLIFE
Corporation and  subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of
their operations  and their  cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period  ended   December  31,  1994,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

     As discussed  in Note  1 to  the consolidated  financial  statements,  the
Company changed its method of accounting for debt and equity securities in 1994
to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement
of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt  and Equity  Securities."   As discussed  in  Notes  1  and  5  to  the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting
for postretirement benefits other than pensions in 1992 to adopt the provisions
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.  106, "Employers'  Accounting for  Postretirement Benefits  Other
Than Pensions."

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1.  Significant Accounting Policies


Changes in Accounting Principles

     Effective January  1, 1994,  the Company  adopted Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards  No. 115  ("SFAS 115"),  entitled "Accounting  for Certain
Investments in  Debt and  Equity Securities."   SFAS  115  requires  that  debt
securities  which  may  be  sold  as  part  of  the  Company's  asset/liability
management strategy be classified as "available for sale" and carried at market
value in  the Consolidated  Balance Sheet, commencing with the date of adoption
of the  Statement.   The  Company's  portfolio  of  debt  securities  had  been
similarly classified as "available for sale" prior to the adoption of SFAS 115,
but was carried at lower of aggregate adjusted cost or market value pursuant to
previous accounting  standards.   Since the  aggregate market  value  of  these
securities  exceeded   their  adjusted   cost  at   December  31,   1993,  this
classification had  no impact  on Equity  Capital at  that date.  The Company's
equity securities portfolio had been carried at market value in accordance with
previous accounting  standards prior  to the adoption of SFAS 115 and continues
to be carried at market value as required by the Statement.

     As required  by SFAS  115, the  net impact  of the  initial adjustment  to
market value  of these  securities, less  corresponding adjustments to deferred
policy acquisition  costs (required  where market  value differs  from cost for
certain securities),  certain policyholder  liabilities,  and  deferred  income
taxes, was  recorded through  a direct credit to "Net unrealized gains (losses)
on securities" included in Equity Capital as follows:


                                                                   (Amounts in
                                                                    Thousands)

Impact of adoption of SFAS 115:

  Unrealized gain on debt securities at January 1, 1994.........    $380,343
  Less:
    Adjustment of deferred policy acquisition costs.............      99,889
    Increase in certain policyholder liabilities................      16,706

                                                                    ________

  Adjustment to Equity Capital before federal income tax........     263,748
  Adjustment of deferred federal income tax liability...........      92,312
                                                                    ________

  Net adjustment to Equity Capital at January 1, 1994...........    $171,436
                                                                    ========



     SFAS 115  requires that  unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, other  than those relating to a reduction in value determined to be
other than  temporary, be  recorded as  direct  charges  and  credits  to  "Net
unrealized  gains   (losses)  on   securities"  included   in  Equity  Capital.
Consequently, the  recognition of  these unrealized  gains and  losses  has  no
impact on net income.

     Under both  SFAS 115 and previous accounting standards, valuation reserves
(established through  income statement charges) are maintained as an adjustment
to cost  for investments,  including "available  for sale"  securities, with  a
reduction in  value determined to be other than temporary.  The cost and market
value  of   the  Company's   investments  in  securities  are  presented  under
"Investments in Securities" below.

     Also in  1994, the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.   112,  ("SFAS   112")  entitled   "Employers'  Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits."   SFAS  112  requires  advance  recognition  of  non-
retirement benefits  such as  severance pay  and health  insurance continuation
when certain  conditions are  met.   The adoption  of SFAS  112 did  not have a
material impact  on the  Company's reported  financial position   or results of
operations.   Financial statements  of previous  years were  not restated  as a
result of the adoption of SFAS 112.

     Effective as  of the  first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial  Accounting Standards  No. 113  ("SFAS 113"), entitled "Accounting
and Reporting  for Reinsurance  of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts."
SFAS 113  requires that  assets and liabilities relating to reinsured contracts
be reported  on a  gross basis  rather than net of the impact of reinsurance as
permitted under  previous accounting standards.  The Statement also establishes
guidelines for  determining whether  risk is  transferred under  a  reinsurance
contract and  requires reinsurance  contracts which  do not qualify under these
guidelines to  be accounted for as deposits.  As a result of the implementation
of SFAS  113, reinsurance  receivables amounting  to approximately $137 million
and $135 million are included in consolidated total assets at December 31, 1994
and 1993,  respectively, including approximately $122 million and $118 million,
respectively, which  would have been offset to various liability accounts under
previous accounting  standards.   Other than the required gross presentation of
reinsurance assets  and liabilities, SFAS 113 did not have a material impact on
the Company's  reported financial position or results of operations.  Financial
statements of  previous years  were not restated as a result of the adoption of
SFAS 113.  See Note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements for further information
regarding the Company's reinsurance contracts.

     Effective  January   1,  1992,  the  Company  implemented  new  accounting
standards for  non-pension postretirement  benefits required  by  Statement  of
Financial Accounting  Standards No.  106  ("SFAS  106"),  entitled  "Employers'
Accounting for  Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and recognized the
initial liability  required by  SFAS 106  by means  of a one-time charge to net
income for  "cumulative effect  of accounting change." As required by SFAS 106,
this  charge,  which  amounted  to  $38.0  million  or  $1.67  per  share,  was
retroactively recorded  in the  first quarter  of 1992.  See Note 5 of Notes to
Financial   Statements    for   further   information   regarding   non-pension
postretirement benefits.

     Also in  1992, the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No.  109 ("SFAS  109"), entitled  "Accounting for  Income Taxes," and
restated, as  appropriate, the financial statements of previous years presented
to retroactively  give effect to the accounting standards required by SFAS 109.
See Note  4 of  Notes to Financial Statements for further information regarding
Federal income taxes.


Future Accounting Changes


     In May  1993, the  Financial Accounting  Standards Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement of  Financial Accounting  Standards No.  114, entitled "Accounting by
Creditors for  Impairment of  a  Loan."    Certain  accounting  and  disclosure
requirements contained in Statement No. 114 were modified by FASB Statement No.
118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and
Disclosures," issued  in October  1994.   These statements  must be  adopted by
calendar year  enterprises no  later than  1995 and will require a writedown to
fair value,  as defined  by Statement  No. 114,  for certain mortgage loans and
similar investments  where impairment  results in  a change in repayment terms.
Based on  current evaluation  of the  Company's investments that are covered by
these Statements,  they will  not have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's
reported financial  position or  results of operations.  The Company will adopt
these Statements in the first quarter of 1995.

all of  its subsidiaries  (the "Company").   All  subsidiaries are  100 percent
owned.     All  material  intercompany  accounts  and  transactions  have  been
eliminated.

Investments in Securities

     The Company's  investment management policies include continual monitoring
and evaluation  of securities  market conditions  and circumstances relating to
its investment  holdings which  may result  in the selection of investments for
sale prior  to maturity.   Securities may also be sold as part of the Company's
asset/liability management  strategy in  response to changes in interest rates,
resultant prepayment  risk, and  similar factors.   Accordingly,  the Company's
entire Fixed  Maturity portfolio  is classified as "available for sale".  These
securities are  carried in  the accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  at
market value as of December 31, 1994 and at lower of aggregate adjusted cost or
market value  at December  31, 1993.   The  Company's investments  in preferred
stocks (other  than redeemable  preferred stocks)  and common  stocks  ("Equity
Securities") are  carried at  market value  in  the  accompanying  consolidated
balance sheets at December 31, 1994 and 1993.  The cost and market value of the
Company's consolidated investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities at
December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 are presented below:

  (a) Excluding marketable equity securities at January 1, 1994.

  (b) Included in "Net unrealized loss on securities" at December 31, 1994.

     The classification of the Company's Fixed Maturity portfolio as "available
for sale"  had no  impact on  Equity Capital at December 31, 1993 or 1992, when
these securities were carried at the lower of aggregate adjusted cost or market
value, since  the aggregate  market value  of these  securities exceeded  their
adjusted cost at those dates.

     Valuation reserves  (established through  income  statement  charges)  are
maintained as  an adjustment  to cost for investments, including "available for
sale" securities,  with a  reduction in  value  determined  to  be  other  than
temporary.

     At December  31, 1994, consolidated invested assets included approximately
$232 million  (based on  adjusted cost) of less than investment grade corporate
securities, based  on  ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and
insurance regulatory  authorities.   Such investments  had an  aggregate market
value of  approximately $228  million at December 31, 1994 and, based on market
value, represent  approximately 3%  of consolidated  total assets at that date.
Approximately $21  million (at market) of these investments (adjusted cost, $22
million) are classified as problem securities at that date and, of that amount,
approximately $21  million (at  market) represented  securities in  default  at
December 31, 1994.  Also at December 31, 1994, the book value of mortgage loans
included in  consolidated total assets which were 60 days or more delinquent or
in foreclosure  was approximately  $9 million,  and the  book value of property
acquired through foreclosure of mortgage loans was approximately $30 million.

Other Investments

     Real estate  is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or net realizable
value.   Depreciation is  calculated on a straight line basis with useful lives
varying based  on the type of building.  Policy loans and mortgages, other than
those with a decline in value determined to be other than temporary, are stated
at the aggregate of unpaid principal balances.  Other long term investments are
stated at the lower of cost or their estimated net realizable value.


Insurance Accounting

     Amounts for  the life  insurance subsidiaries  are reported  to regulatory
authorities on  the basis  of statutory  accounting  practices  and  have  been
presented herein  in conformity  with generally  accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").

(a) Amounts  shown exclude after-tax capital gains (losses) of $(10.9) million,
$(1.3) million  and $(15.5)  million on  a regulatory basis and $(0.9) million,
$7.1 million,  and $(1.4)  million on  a GAAP  basis in  1994, 1993  and  1992,
respectively.   GAAP income  above also excludes an after-tax charge in 1992 of
$21.5 million  for "cumulative  effect of  accounting change"  relating to  the
adoption of  FASB Statement  No. 106 which had no impact on 1992 regulatory net
income.  Both regulatory and GAAP after-tax income shown above for 1992 reflect
a charge  equivalent to  $10.6  million  on  an  after-tax  basis  relating  to
receivables from  an Association  Group  Health  marketing  organization  which
declared bankruptcy.

     The 1994 decrease in regulatory after-tax income resulted primarily from a
44% increase  in term insurance sales (based on annualized premiums). Statutory
accounting practices  require acquisition  costs  on  new  business  (including
commissions and  underwriting and  issue costs)  to be  charged to expense when
incurred.   Additionally, statutory  reserves initially  established  for  term
policies exceed the corresponding amounts required under GAAP.

     As a  result of  the appropriate  adjustments, Equity  Capital of the life
insurance subsidiaries  prepared in accordance with GAAP exceeds that which was
prepared on  a regulatory  basis by  $784.3 million,  $826.5 million and $779.0
million, respectively, at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  It should be noted
that the  dividend paying  capability of  the life  insurance  subsidiaries  is
generally limited  by income before capital gains and losses and Equity Capital
as reported  on a  regulatory basis.   Notice  to  or  approval  by  regulatory
authorities is  frequently required  for dividends paid by insurance companies.
Loans to or advances from the life insurance subsidiaries to the parent company
may also  be subject  to regulatory  approval requirements  or limitations.  At
December 31,  1994, the  portion of the aggregate $1.327 billion Equity Capital
of the  life insurance subsidiaries which was not available for transfer to the
parent company  by dividend,  loan, or  advance or  available for such transfer
only with  approval of  a third party ("Restricted Net Assets"), as a result of
the aforementioned  regulatory requirements,  amounted to $1.284 billion.  Cash
dividends paid  by all consolidated subsidiaries to the parent company totalled
$45.7 million, $61.2 million and $47.7 million for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1993  and 1992, respectively.  Additionally, during 1993, securities with
market value of $21.6 million were transferred from a life insurance subsidiary
to the  parent company  and subsequently  contributed to another life insurance
subsidiary  in  connection  with  the  combination  of  the  two  subsidiaries'
operations.  In addition to the 1992 cash dividends, investment securities with
market value  of $26.3  million  were  transferred  by  dividend  from  a  life
insurance subsidiary to the parent company.

Life Insurance

  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

     The costs  of acquiring new business (principally commissions) and certain
costs of issuing policies (such as medical examinations and inspection reports)
and certain  agency and  marketing expenses,  all of  which vary  with and  are
primarily related  to the  production of new business, have been deferred.  For
traditional life  insurance policies,  these costs are being amortized over the
premium-paying periods  of the  related policies  in proportion to the ratio of
the  annual   premium  revenue   to  the  total  anticipated  premium  revenue.
Anticipated premium revenue was estimated using the same assumptions which were
used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits.  For universal life-
type policies,  these costs  are being amortized over the lives of the policies
in relation  to  the  incidence  of  gross  profits  arising  principally  from
investment, mortality  and expense  margins.  Deferred policy acquisition costs
are reviewed  to determine  that the unamortized portion of such costs does not
exceed recoverable amounts, after considering anticipated investment income.

     Details with respect to consolidated deferred policy acquisition costs and
premium income  for life  insurance  and  annuities  and  accident  and  health
insurance for the three years ended December 31, 1994 are as follows:

Future Policy Benefits

     Liabilities for  future  policy  benefits  relating  to  traditional  life
insurance policies  have been computed by the net level premium method based on
estimated  future  investment  yield,  mortality  and  termination  experience.
Interest rate  assumptions for  most non-interest sensitive life insurance have
ranged from  2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent on issues of 1959 and prior, to 5-1/2 to 5-
7/8 percent  on issues of 1967 and subsequent years.  (On certain products, the
rate ranges  as  high  as  8-3/4  percent.)    Mortality  has  been  calculated
principally on  an experience multiple applied to select and ultimate tables in
common usage  in the  industry.   Estimated terminations  have been  determined
principally based on industry tables.



Universal Life-Type and Investment Contracts

     Revenues for  universal  life  insurance,  other  interest-sensitive  life
insurance, and  investment contracts  include policy charges for administration
and cost  of insurance,  and surrender  charges assessed  against  policyholder
account balances  during the  period.   Premiums received on these products are
treated as  policyholder deposits  rather than  revenues.   The  liability  for
policyholder account  balances represents  the accumulated amounts which accrue
to the  benefit of policyholders, and reflects interest credited at rates which
are subject  to periodic  adjustment.   Charges to  expense relating  to  these
policies and  contracts include  such interest  credited as  well  as  benefits
during the period in excess of related policy account balances.


Participating Policies

     Participating policies  subject  to  profit  limitations  approximate  2.2
percent of  the individual life insurance in force at December 31, 1994 and 6.6
percent of  individual life  insurance premium  income in 1994.  The portion of
earnings  therefrom   that  inures   to  the   benefit  of   the  participating
policyholders is not available to shareholders.  Undistributed earnings payable
to participating  policyholders are included as a liability in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

     All participating policies approximate 2.3 percent of the total individual
life insurance in force at December 31, 1994 and 6.9 percent of individual life
insurance  premium   income  in   1994.     The  provisions  for  dividends  to
policyholders in  the statements  of consolidated income include dividends paid
or payable on participating policies.


Liability for Unpaid Claims

     The liability  for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is based on
the estimated amount payable on claims reported prior to the balance sheet date
which have  not yet  been settled,  claims reported  subsequent to  the balance
sheet date  which have  been incurred  during the  period then  ended,  and  an
estimate (based on prior experience) of incurred but unreported claims relating
to such period.

     Activity in  the liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses
for the Company's health and disability coverages is summarized as follows:

   (a) Substantially  all of  the Company's incurred claims and claim

Liability for Guaranty Fund Assessments

     The Company's  life insurance  subsidiaries may  be  required,  under  the
solvency or  guaranty laws of the various states in which they are licensed, to
pay assessments  up  to  prescribed  limits  to  fund  policyholder  losses  or
liabilities of  insolvent insurance  companies.   Certain states  permit  these
assessments, or  a portion  thereof, to  be recovered  as an  offset to  future
premium taxes.   Assessments  are recognized based on notification of liability
by regulatory  authorities, including  provision  for  certain  future  amounts
payable, and, when subject to credit against future premium taxes and judged to
be recoverable, may be capitalized and amortized on a basis consistent with the
credits to be realized under applicable state law.


Other Assets

     Included  in   other  assets  is  the  unamortized  portion  of  goodwill,
representing the  excess of  cost over  the value  of net  assets  acquired  in
subsidiary acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method.  Such amounts are
being amortized  by straight-line  basis charges  to  income  over  forty  year
periods which  began at  the respective  dates of  acquisition of  the acquired
subsidiaries.   Amortization of  goodwill amounted  to approximately $2 million
for each of the three years ended December 31, 1994.

Income Taxes

     Deferred income  taxes arise as a result of applying enacted statutory tax
rates to  the temporary  differences between  the financial  statement carrying
value and  the tax  basis of  assets and  liabilities.  Such differences result
primarily from  amounts capitalized for policy acquisition costs and calculated
for future policy benefit liabilities.

     The Company  and its  subsidiaries file  a consolidated Federal income tax
return and  have elected  to include  the life insurance and non-life insurance
subsidiaries in  the consolidated  tax  return.    Taxes  on  income  for  life
insurance and  non-life insurance  subsidiaries are  recorded in the individual
income accounts  of the  subsidiaries and  are remitted  to the  Company  on  a
separate return basis.  The provision for taxes in the Statements of

<PAGE>61

Consolidated Income  for the three years ended December 31, 1994 represents the
tax for all companies on a consolidated return basis.

Income Per Share

     Income per  share was computed by dividing the income applicable to common
and common  equivalent shares  by the  weighted average  number of  common  and
common equivalent  shares outstanding  during each  year.  The weighted average
number of  common and  common equivalent  shares was  determined by  using  the
average number of common shares outstanding during each year, net of reacquired
(treasury) shares from the date of acquisition; by converting the shares of the
Series A and Series B Preferred Stock to their equivalent common shares, and by
calculating the  number of  shares issuable  on exercise  of those common stock
options with  exercise prices  lower than the market price of the common stock,
reduced by  the number  of shares  assumed to  have  been  purchased  with  the
proceeds from  the exercise of the options.  Income before cumulative effect of
accounting  change  and  net  income  were  adjusted  to  deduct  the  dividend
requirements on  Series C  Preferred Stock  for periods  when  that  issue  was
outstanding.   Fully diluted  income per  share is the same as income per share
data indicated.   The following table sets forth the computations of income per
share for the three years ended December 31, 1994:

Statement of Cash Flows

     For the  years ended  December 31,  1994,  1993  and  1992,  respectively,
interest paid  (net of  amounts capitalized)  amounted to  $34.8 million, $32.6
million, and  $34.7 million,  and Federal  income taxes  paid amounted to $60.5
million, $60.7  million and  $75.7 million.  The major portion of the disposals
of fixed  maturity investments  relate to  securities sold or redeemed prior to
their maturity dates.  The $1.1 billion disposals of Fixed Maturity investments
by the Company for the year ended December 31, 1994 included approximately $209
million (adjusted  cost) of  securities which were called for redemption by the
respective issuers prior to maturity.  The $1.2 billion disposals of Fixed
<PAGE>62

Maturity investments  in 1993  included  approximately  $928  million  of  such
redemptions.   Certain prior  year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation.


Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk

     The Company's  investments in  Fixed Maturities  and Equity Securities are
comprised of a diverse portfolio represented by approximately 500 issuers, with
no issuer  accounting for  more than  1% of  the Company's  total investment in
these securities, based on market value, at December 31, 1994.

     The Company's  investment in  mortgage  loans  at  December  31,  1994  is
characterized by  a broad  geographical distribution,  with approximately 7% of
total book  value relating  to the New England region of the United States, 18%
from the  middle-Atlantic states,  20% from  the north-central states, 16% from
the south-Atlantic  states, 11%  from the  south-central states,  13% from  the
mountain states,  and 15%  from the  Pacific states.    Based  on  book  value,
approximately 39%  of the  Company's mortgage loans at that date are secured by
office buildings,  24% by  industrial /  warehouse properties,  25% retail,  1%
apartments, 2%  one to  four family  residential, and  the remainder secured by
hotel / motel, medically oriented, or other specialty properties.

     The Company's  reinsurance receivables  and other  recoverable amounts  at
December 31,  1994 relate  to approximately  150 reinsurers.   Two major United
States  insurance   companies,  rated   "A"  (excellent)  and  "A+"  (superior)
respectively by  A. M. Best Company, a recognized insurance rating agency, each
account for  approximately 10%  of the  reinsurance receivable  and recoverable
amounts at that date.  Other than these companies, no single reinsurer accounts
for more  than 6%  of total  reinsurance receivable  and recoverable amounts at
December 31,  1994.   The Company  monitors  the  financial  condition  of  its
reinsurers  in   order  to   minimize  its  exposure  to  loss  from  reinsurer
insolvencies.

     In the  ordinary course  of  investment  operations,  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries may,  in return  for commitment  fees, extend  standby commitments
which represent  contingent obligations  to replace  certain borrowings  in the
event of  default by  unaffiliated borrowers.  The life  insurance subsidiaries
historically have not provided permanent financing on the major portion of such
commitments.   The  life  insurance  subsidiaries  also  may  extend  permanent
financing commitments for investments in mortgage loans, with specified closing
dates typically  within 90  to 120  days after  approval and interest rates and
other terms  (based on the credit policies utilized for investments in mortgage
loans) determined  at the  commitment date.   There were no outstanding standby
commitments or material permanent financing commitments at December 31, 1994.


Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of the indicated classes of financial instruments:

Cash and Short-term Investments

     The carrying amounts of these assets approximate their fair value.

Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

     Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes.

Mortgage Loans

     The fair  value of mortgage loans, other than those which are more than 60
days delinquent  or in  foreclosure, is  estimated by  discounting the expected
future cash  flows.   The rates used for this purpose are the estimated current
rates that  would be applied to the loans in a purchase or sale transaction, on
an aggregate or bulk basis grouped by maturity range, considering the
<PAGE>63

creditworthiness of  the borrowers  and  the  general  characteristics  of  the
collateral.   For purposes  of this  calculation, the  fair value of loans with
stated interest  rates greater  than the  estimated applicable  market rate was
adjusted to reflect the impact of prepayment options or other contractual terms
upon market  value.   For mortgage  loans which are classified as delinquent or
are in  foreclosure, fair  value is  based on estimated net realizable value of
the underlying collateral.

Policyholder Account Balances Relating to Investment Contracts

     The fair  value of  the Company's  liabilities under investment contracts,
primarily  deferred   annuities,  is   estimated  using  discounted  cash  flow
calculations based  on interest  rates being offered by the Company for similar
contracts at the balance sheet date.

Long-term Debt

     The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on rates
believed to  be currently  available to  the Company  for borrowings with terms
similar to  the remaining  maturities of the outstanding debt.  For outstanding
debt securities  with fixed  interest rates  in excess of current market rates,
repayment on  call dates  prior to  stated maturity was assumed for purposes of
fair value estimation.

     The estimated  fair values  of the  Company's financial instruments are as
follows:

     In accordance  with the requirements of Statement No. 107 of the Financial
Accounting Standards  Board, the  financial instruments presented above exclude
accounts relating  to the  Company's  insurance  contracts  and  certain  other
classes of  assets and  liabilities.   The Company  has not utilized derivative
financial instruments  such as  futures, forward,  swap, or option contracts as
defined in  Statement of  Financial Accounting  Standards No.  119, "Disclosure
about  Derivative   Financial  Instruments   and  Fair   Value   of   Financial
Instruments," for periods presented herein.

<PAGE>64

The estimated  fair values  of the Company's policy loan assets at December 31,
1994 and  1993 are not materially different from the respective carrying values
at those dates.  No material carrying value or fair value amounts were ascribed
to the  Company's outstanding  standby commitments  at December  31, 1993.   It
should be  noted that  fair value estimates based on assumed discount rates and
assumptions and  estimates of  the timing  and amount  of future cash flows are
significantly affected by the assumptions used.


Note 2.  Notes Payable

     Notes payable  at December 31, 1994 includes $150 million borrowings under
a revolving  credit agreement  between the Company and The Bank of New York (as
agent) which  commenced on  May 13,  1994.  The credit agreement expires on May
12, 1995,  at which  time all  borrowings thereunder  must mature,  subject  to
extension of  the agreement  for a  period of  364 days  at the  option of  the
various participating banks and the Company.  The credit agreement provides for
term borrowings  in segments  of up  to six months with interest indexed to the
LIBOR borrowing  rate or  based on  certain alternative  interest rates  at the
option of  the Company.  USLIFE has the option to prepay amounts borrowed under
the credit  agreement, in  whole or  in part,  and to reborrow loans thereunder
provided the  total amount  of outstanding  borrowings  does  not  exceed  $150
million.

     Also included in this item are short term borrowings against bank lines of
credit or pursuant to certain bank revolving credit agreements, and other short
term bank  borrowings.  The Company has lines of credit of $60.0 million with 7
banks and  a revolving short term bank credit agreement which provide term loan
borrowing facilities  up to  a maximum  of $100  million.   The lines of credit
provide for annual review and renewal at the option of each bank.  The interest
rates and  terms of  loans under  the lines  of credit and the revolving credit
agreements are determined bilaterally on the date of borrowing.  Although there
are no  formal requirements  to maintain compensating balances, the Company has
carried balances which generally approximate 5 to 10 percent of the lines.

     The following  table sets  forth summary information with respect to short
term borrowings of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 1994.

     The Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993, enacted  in August 1993,
increased the  Federal corporate  income tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactively
to January  1, 1993.  This rate increase resulted in additional tax expense for
the first  half of  1993 amounting  to $666 thousand, and the effect of the tax
rate change  upon net  deferred tax  liabilities as  required by  Statement  of
Financial Accounting  Standards No.  109 ("SFAS  109") was  $1.322 million.  In
accordance with  SFAS 109,  the $1.988 million aggregate catch-up impact of the
rate change was included in Federal income tax expense for the third quarter of
1993.

     The significant  components of  deferred income  tax expense for the years
ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 are as follows:

     Federal income  tax returns  have been  examined and  settled for all life
insurance subsidiaries  and their  predecessors through 1980.  The consolidated
Federal income  tax returns  of the Company and non-life insurance subsidiaries
have been  examined and  settled through  1980.   The life-nonlife consolidated
Federal income  tax returns  of the  Company and  all  subsidiaries  have  been
examined and  settled for  1981 through  1988.   The Company  believes that its
recorded income tax liabilities are adequate for all open years.

     Under the  provisions of  prior  tax  law  applicable  to  life  insurance
companies, one  half of  the excess  of the  gain from  operations  of  a  life
insurance company  over its taxable investment income was not taxed but was set
aside in  a special  "Policyholders' Surplus Account".  Under provisions of the
Tax Reform Act of 1984, this account is "frozen" as of December 31, 1983 and is
subject  to  tax  under  conditions  set  forth  pursuant  to  prior  tax  law.
Policyholder Surplus  may be  taxable at  the time  of its  distribution to the
company's shareholders  or under  certain  other  specified  conditions.    The
Company does  not believe  that any  significant portion  of the amount in this
account will  be taxed  in the foreseeable future.  However, should the balance
at December 31, 1994 become taxable, the tax computed at present rates would be
approximately $47.8 million.

     At  December  31,  1994,  the  Company  has  nonlife  net  operating  loss
carryforwards for  Federal income  tax purposes  of approximately $76.4 million
which are  available to  offset future  Federal taxable income, if any, through
2009.

Note 5.  Retirement Plans

     The Company  and its subsidiaries have a qualified noncontributory defined
benefit pension  plan covering  substantially  all  employees.    Benefits  are
generally based  on years  of service,  the employee's  compensation during the
last three  years of employment, and an average of Social Security covered wage
bases.  It is the Company's policy to fund pension costs in accordance with the
requirements of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Based on
such standards,  contributions amounting to $4.5 million, $4.5 million and $4.2
million were  made for  the years  ended December  31,  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.  Substantially all of the Plan assets are invested in the general
investment account  of a  life insurance  subsidiary of  the Company  through a
deposit administration  insurance contract.   As  a result  of compensation and
benefit limitations under Federal tax law applicable to the Company's qualified
defined benefit  pension plan, the "excess" portion of the pension benefits for
certain employees  is provided  under an  unfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan
for which  eligibility requirements  and certain other provisions were modified
during 1993.   Additionally,  the Company  has an  unfunded Retirement Plan for
Outside Directors  which provides pension benefits to non-employee Directors of
USLIFE Corporation subject to specified eligibility requirements.  Benefits are
based on years of service and the annual retainer at time of retirement.

     Pension expense  for all  of the  above pension  plans amounted  to $7.848
million,  $5.212   million  and   $4.774  million   in  1994,  1993  and  1992,
respectively.   The net periodic pension cost for these plans in 1994, 1993 and
1992 included the following components:

     The unrecognized net asset relating to the qualified pension plan is being
recognized over  a 14  year period which began January 1, 1987.  As required by
Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions," an  additional minimum  pension  liability  is  recognized  for  the
Company's non-qualified  plans to reflect the excess of the accumulated benefit
obligations over  the liability  already recognized as unfunded accrued pension
cost.   Such minimum  pension liability of $7.564 million and $8.276 million in
1994 and  1993, respectively,  has been  offset with an intangible asset in the
consolidated balance  sheets.  The unrecognized net loss and unrecognized prior
service  cost   relating  to   the  Company's  pension  plans  are  subject  to
amortization on a straight-line basis over the estimated average future service
period of  active employees  expected  to  receive  benefits  under  the  plan.
Assumptions used  in the actuarial computations for the Company's pension plans
were as follows:

     In  addition   to  providing   pension  benefits,   the  Company  and  its
subsidiaries provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired
employees under  a defined  benefit plan.   Employees  may become  eligible for
these benefits  if they  have accumulated ten years of service and reach normal
or early  retirement age  while working  for the  Company.   The plan  provides
benefits supplemental  to Medicare  after retirees  are eligible  for  Medicare
benefits.   The postretirement benefit plan contains cost-sharing features such
as deductibles  and coinsurance,  and contributions  of  certain  retirees  are
subject to annual adjustment.  It is the Company's current policy to fund these
benefits, which  are  provided  through  an  insurance  contract  with  a  life
insurance subsidiary of the Company, on a "pay as you go" basis.

     Effective as  of  January  1,  1992,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting   Standards   No.   106,   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postretirement Benefits  Other Than Pensions."  Statement No. 106 requires that
an  employer's   obligation  for   non-pension  plan  benefits  provided  after
retirement be recognized by income statement charges during the service periods
of eligible  employees rather  than on  a cash basis as permitted by previously
established accounting standards.  The Company elected to recognize the initial
obligation under  the Statement,  representing  the  present  value  of  future
benefits attributed  to service  already rendered  by eligible  employees as of
January 1,  1992, by  means of  a one-time  charge to net income for cumulative
effect of  the accounting  change.  This initial obligation, and the consequent
charge, amounted to $57.6 million before applicable taxes.  Excluding this one-
time charge,  the cost  of non-pension  postretirement benefits  for  1992  was
approximately $2 million.

     During 1993,  the Company's non-pension postretirement benefit program was
modified in  several respects,  including the establishment of a maximum dollar
cap on  amounts to  be paid  by the Company for future increases in the cost of
retiree health  benefits.   These plan  amendments resulted  in an unrecognized
reduction in  prior service  cost, which  is being amortized over the remaining
average  service  period  to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.   Excess gains  or losses  are being  amortized over  the average
remaining service  period to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.

     The funded  status of the non-pension postretirement benefit program as of
December 31, 1994 and 1993 is reconciled to accrued postretirement benefit cost
as follows:

     The  non-pension  postretirement  benefit  cost  for  the  year  1992  was
comprised primarily of "interest cost."


     For measurement purposes, a 12 percent annual rate of increase in the per-
capita cost  of covered  health benefits (ie., health care cost trend rate) was
assumed for  1994; the  rate was  assumed to decrease gradually to 6 percent by
the year  1997 and  remain at that level thereafter.  An 11 percent annual rate
of increase  in claims  reimbursed by  Medicare for  retirees over  age 65  was
assumed for  1994; the  rate was  assumed to decrease gradually to 6 percent by
the year  1997 and  remain at  that level  thereafter.  The assumed health care
cost trend  rate does  not have a significant effect on the amounts reported in
accordance with  Statement No.  106 due to the maximum dollar cap adopted.  For
example, increasing  the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage
point in  each year  would  increase  the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit
obligation as  of December  31, 1994  by approximately  $57  thousand  and  the
aggregate of  the service  and interest  cost components  of 1994  net periodic
postretirement benefit  cost by  $10 thousand.    The  discount  rate  used  in
determining the  accumulated postretirement  benefit obligation  was  8.25%  at
December 31, 1994 and 7.5% at both December 31, 1993 and 1992.

authorization  of   the  Board   of  Directors   without  further  approval  of
shareholders.   The Board  has broad  powers to  fix the  terms of  such issues
subject to  the limit  that the  aggregate of  all amounts which may be paid to
holders  of  all  of  the  series  of  Preferred  Stock  upon  the  involuntary

election of  directors and  on  all  other  matters  submitted  to  a  vote  of
shareholders and  to such dividends and distributions as may be declared by the
Board of  Directors out  of funds  legally available.   At  December 31,  1994,
53,275 shares  of Common  Stock were  reserved for  issuance upon conversion of
Preferred Stock.   The  Company sponsors, through certain of its life insurance
subsidiaries, savings  plans for  selected general  agents and  producers  (the
"Agents Plans")  providing for distribution of Common shares to participants if
specified qualification and vesting requirements are satisfied.  As of December
31, 1994,  participant interests  relating to  7,406 Common  shares had  vested
under the  Agents Plans.   On July 10, 1986 the Company issued, to shareholders
of record  on that  date, one  Common Stock Purchase Right (a "Right") for each
share of  Common Stock owned on that date.  Until the Rights become exercisable
they will  be represented  by the stock certificates for all outstanding Common
Stock including  newly issued  shares.   Upon the  occurrence of certain events
specified in  a Rights  Agreement dated  as of  June 24,  1986 and  amended and
restated as  of September  27, 1994  between  the  Company  and  Chemical  Bank
(successor by  merger to  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company) as Rights Agent,
the Rights  will become  exercisable, separate  certificates  representing  the
Rights will  be issued,  and each Right will entitle the holder to purchase one
half of  a share  of the  Common Stock  for $160.   Under certain circumstances
specified in  the Rights  Agreement each  Right  will  entitle  the  holder  to
purchase, for  one half  of its then market value, publicly traded common stock
of any corporation which acquires the Company; each Right will also entitle the
holder, with certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, to purchase
<PAGE>72

$150 worth of the Common Stock for $75.  As of December 31, 1994 the Rights had
not become exercisable.

     The Company  also sponsors a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
which enables  holders of  the Company's  Common Stock to invest cash dividends
and optional  cash payments in additional shares of the Common Stock.  In 1994,
1993 and  1992, respectively,  26,574, 25,689  and 29,523  shares of the Common
Stock had  been sold  pursuant to  the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan.


     Treasury Stock

     At December 31, 1994, there were 15,493,148 shares of Common Stock held in

cost of $7.2 million, and 376,114 Common shares, with an aggregate cost of $7.1
million, were  utilized for certain employee, director, and agent benefit plans
and  for   the  Dividend   Reinvestment  and  Stock  Purchase  Plan  of  USLIFE

Note 7.  Stock Options and Long-Term Incentive Plans

     In May,  1991, the  Company adopted  a stock  option plan (the "1991 Stock
Option Plan") for key employees to replace the previous stock option plan under
which options  could no longer be granted.  Under the 1991 Stock Option Plan, a
maximum of  1,050,000 shares  of the  Company's common stock may be issued upon
the exercise  of stock  options which may be granted pursuant to the Plan.  The
1991  Stock   Option  Plan  also  provides  for  "Reload"  options,  which  are
automatically granted  to a  participant upon  the exercise of an option if the
participant uses  previously owned shares to pay for the option shares.  Reload
options will  be for  the number  of previously-owned shares delivered upon the
employee's exercise  of an  option.   Under the  1991 Stock  Option  Plan,  the
purchase price  of shares  subject to each option will be not less than 100% of
their fair  market value  at the time of the grant of the option.  In May 1994,
the Plan  was amended to limit the number of options that may be granted to any
one individual during any one-year period to 75,000.  No options may be granted
under the 1991 Stock Option Plan after May 20, 2001.

In May  1994, the  Company adopted  a  stock  option  plan  (the  "Non-Employee
Director Stock  Option Plan")  for directors of USLIFE who are not employees of
the Company  or its  subsidiaries or  affiliates.   The Plan provides that each
eligible director  will automatically  be granted  options  to  purchase  2,000
shares of  USLIFE common  stock, commencing  at the  date of the Company's 1994
Annual Meeting  of Shareholders  and on  the date  of  each  subsequent  Annual
Meeting.   A maximum  of 250,000  shares of  the Company's  common stock may be
issued upon  the exercise  of stock options which may be granted under the Non-
Employee Director Stock Option Plan.  No options may be granted under this Plan
after May 17, 2004.
<PAGE>73

     No option granted under the Company's stock option plans is exercisable in
whole or  in part  in less than six months from the date of grant.  Each option
may be  exercisable in  one or  more installments  as provided therein.  To the
extent such  options are  not exercised,  installments accumulate  to the total
granted and  are exercisable in whole or in part at any time during the term of
the option.   This term is set forth in the option but in no event is an option
exercisable, in  whole or  in part,  after the expiration of ten years from the
date of  grant.   The 1991  Stock Option  Plan provides  that in the event of a
Change in  Control (as  defined in  the Plan),  all outstanding options granted
under that  Plan which  have been held for at least six months from the date of
grant shall become immediately exercisable.

     As of  December 31,  1994, the  Company had  outstanding  options  to  its
employees (including  officers) and  non-employee  directors  for  purchase  of
shares of its Common Stock as follows:

     As  of   December  31,  1994,  options  for  924,438  common  shares  were
exercisable under  all stock  option plans  at $19.75  to $43.63 per share.  At
December 31,  1994, up  to 1,748,813  common shares  could be  issued under the
Company's stock  option plans.  Common shares may be issued under the Company's
stock option plans from shares in treasury or authorized but unissued shares.

     The Company  has a  Book Unit  Plan for  certain key employees.  Under the
terms of  the Plan,  the Board  of Directors may award, at its sole discretion,
one or  more units  to employees  it has selected to become participants in the
Plan.   No more  than 600,000  units shall be outstanding under the Plan at any
time.   The value  of units  granted prior to 1994 shall be the amount by which
the book value per share, as of its award date, has been increased or decreased
by (a) the sum of the increases or decreases in the book value per share of the

<PAGE>74

Company's common  stock, excluding  the impact  of "mark-to-market" adjustments
required by  FASB Statement No. 115 to recognize unrealized gains and losses on
debt and  equity securities, plus (b) dividend equivalents for subsequent years
up to  and including  its valuation date.  In May 1994, the Plan was amended to
limit the number of book units that may be granted to any one individual during
a one-year  period to  no more  than  75,000  and  further,  to  eliminate  the
inclusion of cumulative dividends paid to shareholders in calculating the value
of book  units awarded in 1994 and thereafter.  Accordingly, approximately $1.7
million, $2.1  million, and $1.4 million were charged to expense in 1994, 1993,
and 1992, respectively.

     A summary of units outstanding under the Book Unit Plan follows:

</TABLE>

     The Company  also has  a Restricted  Stock Plan for certain key employees.
Under the  terms of  the Plan,  a committee of the Board of Directors may award
restricted shares of common stock of the Company, up to an aggregate maximum of
1,050,000 shares,  to designated  Participants.   The shares, when awarded, are
initially non-transferable  and subject  to forfeiture  in the  event that  the
Participant ceases to be an employee of USLIFE or any of its subsidiaries other
than by  reason of  death, permanent  disability, retirement,  or certain other
specified circumstances.   These  restrictions generally terminate with respect
to 20%  of the number of shares awarded on March 1 of each of the five calendar
years following  the year  of award,  at which  time the  appropriate number of
unrestricted shares  are distributed  to the  Participant.  For certain awards,
restrictions terminate  with respect  to one-third  of  the  number  of  shares
awarded on  the first,  second, and third anniversaries of the award date, with
similar distribution.  In May 1994, the Plan was amended to limit the number of
shares that  may be granted to any one individual during any one-year period to
75,000, and  to provide  for forfeiture of awards to certain key officers under
the Plan  in the  event that performance goals based on the Company's "Earnings
Per Share  from Continuing  Operations,"  as  defined  in  the  Plan,  are  not
satisfied.   Upon  award  of  shares  under  the  Plan,  deferred  compensation
equivalent to  the market  value of  the shares on the award date is charged to
Equity Capital.   Such deferred compensation is subsequently amortized by means
of charges  to expense  over the  period during  which the  restrictions lapse.
During 1994,  a total  of 204,274 shares were awarded under the Plan, and 5,332
previously awarded  shares were  forfeited pursuant  to the  terms of the Plan.
During 1993,  a total  of 18,356  shares were  awarded under  the Plan.   As of
December 31,  1994, there  were 223,348  previously awarded  shares outstanding
under the  Plan as  to which  the restrictions  had not  yet lapsed.    Expense
charges recognized  in 1994, 1993 and 1992 relating to these awards amounted to
approximately $2.0 million, $2.1 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.

     In May  1994, the Company adopted an Annual Incentive Plan (the "Incentive
Plan") for  certain key  executive officers.   Under the Incentive Plan, annual
bonuses for  participating key  officers  will  depend  on  the  attainment  of
performance goals  based on  levels of  income from  the  Company's  core  life
insurance  businesses,  as  defined  in  the  Plan.    The  Incentive  Plan  is
administered by  the Executive Compensation and Nominating Committee, which may
authorize awards  of up  to  75%  of  a  Participant's  base  salary  based  on
attainment of performance goals established by the Committee.  These awards are
payable in  cash no  later than  April  30  after  each  plan  year,  following
certification by  the Committee  that the performance goals have been met.  The
Incentive Plan provides that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in
the Plan),  the amount  of awards  will be  calculated as  if  all  performance
targets have  been met  to produce  the maximum award and payment of the awards
will be accelerated to the date on which the Change in Control occurs.

Note 8.  Leases

     In December,  1986 a  subsidiary of  the  Company  sold  its  home  office
building located  at 125  Maiden Lane,  New York,  New York,  and  leased  back
portions of  the premises  which are  utilized as  the  subsidiary's  principal
executive offices  as well as the headquarters of the Company and several other
subsidiaries.   A $16.9  million portion  of the gain arising from the sale and
leaseback transaction  (net  of  related  taxes)  was  deferred  and  is  being
amortized by  credits to  income in  proportion  to  rental  payments  made  in
accordance with  the lease  commitments over  a ten year period.  Additionally,
several subsidiaries  lease office  space  at  other  locations  generally  for
periods ranging  from five  to fifteen  years, and certain subsidiaries utilize
leased furniture  and office  equipment.   Certain of  the operating leases for
office premises  provide for  renewal options  for periods ranging from five to
twenty years based on fair rental value at time of renewal, and further options
relating to  rental of additional office space.  The minimum rental commitments
for  all   such  non-cancelable  operating  leases  as  of  December  31,  1994
approximate $13.5 million in 1995, $13.0 million in 1996, $7.2 million in 1997,
$6.1 million  in 1998,  $5.5 million in 1999, and a total of $13.9 million from
2000 to  2003.   Total rental  expense amounted to approximately $13.1 million,
$13.5 million,  and $12.4  million for  the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993
and 1992, respectively.



Note 9.  Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

     The Company  has outstanding  Standby Letters  of Credit  with  two  banks
representing contingent  obligations to  fund  various  trusts  established  in
connection with  certain employment  contracts  of  management  employees,  the
Company's Supplemental  Retirement Plan, Retirement Plan for Outside Directors,
and Retirement  Plan, in  the event  of a  Change in Control (as defined in the
trust agreements), totalling $88 million.  Additionally, in connection with the
application by  a life  insurance subsidiary for an additional state license to
transact business, USLIFE Corporation has agreed to guarantee that subsidiary's
maintenance of  the state's minimum capital and surplus requirements (amounting
to $4.4  million at  December 31, 1994) for a ten year period commencing at the
effective date of such license.

     The Company  and certain  of its  subsidiaries are involved in litigation,
which originated  in 1981,  with a former officer of a former subsidiary of the
Company.   Allegations in  the former  officer's lawsuit  include breach of the
covenant of  good faith  and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, infliction
of emotional  distress and  malicious prosecution.   Judgment  was rendered  in
favor of the Company.  That judgment is being appealed.  No contingent loss has
been accrued  for this litigation because the amount of loss, if any, cannot be
reasonably estimated,  nor is it probable in the opinion of management that the
ultimate outcome  of this  litigation will result in a liability to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries.

     In June  1993, a  purported class  action was  filed against  three of the
Company's subsidiaries alleging that the class members were entitled to premium
refunds on  policies of credit life and disability insurance purchased from the
three subsidiaries.   In  October, 1994,  the case was dismissed with prejudice
with leave  to reinstate  after a  decision is  rendered by  another court in a
similar case  raising the  same issues raised by defendants' motion to dismiss.
No contingent  loss has  been accrued for this litigation because the amount of
loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

     In November, 1994, a purported class action was filed against three of the
Company's subsidiaries alleging that in connection with purchases by plaintiffs
of single  premium  term  life  insurance  from  mortgage  lenders,  defendants
misrepresented the  type of insurance offered as credit life insurance and sold
the term  life insurance  at premiums  in excess  of those permitted for credit
life insurance.  Allegations include claims for damages for breach of contract,
breach of  fiduciary duty,  unfair and  deceptive acts  and  practices,  fraud,
restitution and  unjust enrichment  and civil  claims under  the  Federal  RICO
statute.   No contingent  loss has been accrued for this litigation because the
amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.
<PAGE>76

     In addition  to the  aforementioned legal proceedings, the Company and its
subsidiaries are parties to various routine legal proceedings incidental to the
conduct of  their business.   Based on currently available information, in  the
opinion of  management it is not probable that the ultimate resolution of these
suits will result in a material liability on the part of the Company.


Note 10.  Reinsurance

     The life  insurance subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of
the risks they underwrite and assume portions of risks on policies underwritten
by other  companies.   The life insurance subsidiaries generally reinsure risks
over $1.5  million as  well as  selected risks  of lesser  amounts.    In  this
connection, $7.8  billion, representing  6 percent  of total  life insurance in
force as  of December  31, 1994,  was ceded  to other  carriers.    Reinsurance
contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders, and
the Company is contingently liable with respect to insurance ceded in the event
any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations which have been assumed.

The Company's  consolidated financial  statements for 1994 and 1993 reflect the
adoption of  Statement of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 113 ("SFAS 113"),
"Accounting and  Reporting for  Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration
Contracts." Pursuant  to the  standards  of  SFAS  113,  amounts  paid  for  or
recoverable under  reinsurance contracts, including amounts previously reported
as a  reduction of  various liability  accounts  as  permitted  under  previous
accounting standards, are included in total assets as reinsurance receivable or
recoverable  amounts.    The  cost  of  reinsurance  related  to  long-duration
contracts is  accounted for  over the life of the underlying reinsured policies
using assumptions  consistent with  those used  to account  for the  underlying
policies.  Financial statements of previous years were not restated as a result
of the adoption of SFAS 113.

The effect  of reinsurance  on premiums,  other considerations, and benefits to
policyholders and beneficiaries, is as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                 Shareholders

         SECTION 1.  ANNUAL MEETING.  A meeting of shareholders shall be held
annually for the election of directors and the transaction of other business on
the third Tuesday in May or on such other date as may be fixed from time to
time by the Board of Directors.
         SECTION 2.  Special Meetings.  Special Meetings of the shareholders
may be called by the Board of Directors or, subject to the control of the
Board, by the Chairman.
         SECTION 3.  Place of Meetings.  Meetings of shareholders shall be held
at such place, within or without the State of New York, as may be fixed by the
Board of Directors.  If no place is so fixed, such meetings shall be held at
the office of the Corporation in the State of New York.
         SECTION 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of each meeting of
shareholders shall be given in writing and shall state the place, date and hour
of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Notice of a special meeting shall indicate that it is being issued by or at the
direction of the person or persons calling or requesting the meeting.
         If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if
taken, entitle objecting shareholders to receive payment for their shares, the
notice shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect.
         A copy of the notice of each meeting shall be given, personally or by
first class mail, not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the
<PAGE>2

date of the meeting, to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting.  If
mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, with
postage thereon prepaid, directed to the shareholder at his address as it
appears on the record of shareholders, or, if he shall have filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him be mailed to
some other address, then directed to him at such other address.
         When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, it shall not be
necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to
which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting any business may be
transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.
However, if after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record
date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each shareholder of record on the new record date entitled to notice
under the preceding paragraphs of this SECTION 4.
         SECTION 5.  Waiver of Notice.  Notice of meeting need not be given to
any shareholder who submits a signed waiver of notice, in person or by proxy,
whether before or after the meeting.  The attendance of any shareholder at a
meeting, in person or by proxy, without protesting prior to the conclusion of
the meeting the lack of notice of such meeting, shall constitute a waiver of
notice by him.
         SECTION 6.  Inspectors of Election.  The Board of Directors, in
advance of any shareholders' meeting, may appoint one or more inspectors to act
at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If inspectors are not so appointed,
the person presiding at a shareholders' meeting may, and on the request of any
shareholder entitled to vote thereat shall, appoint two inspectors.  In case
any person appointed fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by
appointment made by the Board in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by
the person presiding thereat.  Each inspector, before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
<PAGE>3

execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and
according to the best of his ability.
         The inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and
the voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence
of a quorum, and the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes,
ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in
connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or
consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the
election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.  On request of the person
presiding at the meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the
inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter
determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.  Any
report or certificate made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated and of the vote as certified by them.
         SECTION 7.  List of Shareholders at Meeting.  A list of shareholders
as of the record date, certified by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or
by a transfer agent, shall be produced at any meeting of shareholders upon the
request thereat or prior thereto of any shareholder.  If the right to vote at
any meeting is challenged, the inspectors of election, or persons presiding
thereat, shall require such list of shareholders to be produced as evidence of
the right of the persons challenged to vote at such meeting, and all persons
who appear from such list to be shareholders entitled to vote thereat may vote
at such meeting.
         SECTION 8.  Qualification of Voters.  Unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation, every shareholder of record shall be entitled at
every meeting of shareholders to one vote for every share standing in his name
on the record of shareholders.
         Treasury shares as of the record date and shares held as of the record
date by another domestic or foreign corporation of any type or kind, if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held as of the record date by the Corporation, shall not
<PAGE>4

be shares entitled to vote or to be counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares.
         Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator,
committee, or other fiduciary, except a trustee, may be voted by him, either in
person or by proxy, without transfer of such shares into his name.  Shares held
by a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, only after the
shares have been transferred into his name as trustee or into the name of his
nominee.
         Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign
corporation of any type or kind may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as
the by-laws of such corporation may provide, or, in the absence of such
provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.
         A shareholder shall not sell his vote or issue a proxy to vote to any
person for any sum of money or anything of value except as permitted by law.
         SECTION 9.  Quorum of Shareholders.  The holders of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
shareholders for the transaction of any business, provided that when a
specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class or series,
voting as a class, the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or
series shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such specified item of
business.
         When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken
by the subsequent withdrawal of any shareholders.
         The shareholders who are present in person or by proxy and who are
entitled to vote may, by a majority of votes cast, adjourn the meeting despite
the absence of a quorum.
         SECTION 10.  Proxies.  Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting
of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy.
<PAGE>5

         Every proxy must be signed by the shareholder or his attorney-in-fact.
No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable
at the pleasure of the shareholder executing it, except as otherwise provided
by law.
         The authority of the holder of a proxy to act shall not be revoked by
the incompetence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless,
before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of such
incompetence or of such death is received by the Secretary or any Assistant
Secretary.
         SECTION 11.  Vote or Consent of Shareholders.  Directors shall, except
as otherwise required by law, be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a
meeting of shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote in the
election.
         Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of directors,
is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall, except as otherwise
required by law, be authorized by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of
shareholders by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon.
         Whenever shareholders are required or permitted to take any action by
vote, such action may be taken without a meeting on written consent, setting
forth the action so taken, signed by the holders of all outstanding shares
entitled to vote thereon.  Written consent thus given by the holders of all
outstanding shares entitled to vote shall have the same effect as a unanimous
vote of shareholders.
         SECTION 12.  Fixing Record Date.  For the purpose of determining the
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any  meeting of shareholders
or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to or dissent from any
proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of determining shareholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any rights, or
for the purpose of any other action, the Board of Directors may fix, in
advance, a date as the record date for any such determination of
<PAGE>6

shareholders.  Such date shall not be more than fifty nor less than ten days
before the date of such meeting, nor more than fifty days prior to any other
action.
         When a determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of
or to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this
section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless the
Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
         SECTION 13.  Nomination of Directors by Shareholders.  Notice of all
nominations by shareholders for the office of director shall be given in
writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at least sixty but not more than
ninety days prior to the date of the annual meeting of shareholders or any
other meeting at which directors are to be elected.  Such notice shall contain
information about the nominee called for by Item 401 of Regulation S-K under
The Securities Act of 1933 and The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as Item 401
may hereinafter provide on the date such notice is given, together with such
additional information about the nominee's background as the Secretary of the
Corporation may reasonably require.  No person nominated by a shareholder for
the office of director shall be eligible for election to that office unless
nominated in accordance with this Section 13 of Article I.
         SECTION 14.  Shareholder Proposals.  Any shareholder desiring to
submit a proposal for corporate action at an annual or special meeting of
shareholders must submit a written proposal together with a concise written
supporting statement to the Secretary of the Corporation at least sixty days
prior to the date of said meeting.  No proposal submitted by a shareholder for
corporate action shall be considered at an annual or special meeting unless
such proposal is submitted in accordance with this Section 14 of Article I.
<PAGE>7

                                  ARTICLE II
                              Board of Directors
                                       
         SECTION 1.  Power of Board and Qualification of Directors.  The
business of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board of Directors.  Each
director shall be at least twenty-one years of age.
         SECTION 2.  Number of Directors.  The number of directors constituting
the entire Board of Directors shall be the number, not less than three, fixed
from time to time by a majority of the total number of directors which the
Corporation would have, prior to any increase or decrease, if there were no
vacancies, provided, however, that no decrease shall shorten the term of an
incumbent director.  The number of directors constituting the entire Board
shall be 19 except that from and after May 16, 1995 the number of directors
constituting the entire Board shall be 17.
         SECTION 3. Election and Term of Directors.  The Board of Directors
shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class
III.  Such classes shall be as nearly equal in number as the then total number
of directors constituting the entire Board permits.  At the 1978 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders, or any special meeting in lieu thereof, five Class I, five
Class II and six Class III directors shall be elected to initial terms expiring
at the next succeeding annual meeting, the second succeeding annual meeting and
the third succeeding annual meeting, respectively, and until their respective
successors are elected and qualified.  At each annual meeting of shareholders
after 1978, the directors chosen to succeed those in the class whose terms
expire shall be elected by shareholders for terms expiring at the third
succeeding annual meeting after election and until their respective successors
are elected and qualified.  Newly created directorships or any decrease in
directorships resulting from increases or decreases in the number of directors
shall be so apportioned among the classes of directors as to make all the
classes as nearly equal in number as possible.
<PAGE>8

         Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 8 of this Article II,
whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock
issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or
series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of shareholders, the
election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such
directorships shall be governed by any terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be
divided into classes pursuant to this Section 3 unless expressly provided by
such terms.
         SECTION 4.  Quorum of Directors and Action by Board.  A majority of
the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business, and, except where otherwise provided in these by-laws, the vote of a
majority of the directors present at a meeting at the time of such vote, if a
quorum is then present, shall be the act of the Board.
         Any one or more members of the Board of Directors may participate in a
meeting of the Board by means of a conference telephone or similar
communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to
hear each other at the same time, and participation by such means shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.
         SECTION 5.  Meetings of Board.  An annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held in each year directly after the annual meeting of
shareholders.  Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as may
be fixed by the Board.  Special meetings of the Board may be held at any time
upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or any two directors.
         Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such places as may
be fixed by the Board for annual and regular meetings and in the notice of
meeting for special meeting.  If no place is so fixed, meetings of the Board
shall be held at the office of the Corporation in New York, New York.
         No notice need be given of annual or regular meetings of the Board of
Directors.  Notice of each special meeting of the Board shall be given to each
director either by mail not later than noon, New York time, on the third
<PAGE>9

day prior to the meeting or by telegram, written message or orally to the
director not later than noon, New York time, on the day prior to the meeting.
Notices are deemed to have been given: by mail, when deposited in the United
States mail; by telegram at the time of filing; and by messenger at the time of
delivery.  Notices by mail, telegram or messenger shall be sent to each
director at the address designated by him for that purpose, or, if none has
been so  designated, at his last known residence or business address.
         Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any
director who submits a signed waiver of notice whether before or after the
meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its
commencement, the lack of notice to him.
         A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any
meeting of the Board of Directors.
         Unless the Board of Directors otherwise provides, each committee
designated by the Board may make, alter and repeal rules for the conduct of its
business.  In the absence of a provision by the Board of Directors or a
provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a majority of the
entire authorized number of members of such committee shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of the members present
at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then present or the
unanimous written consent of all members thereof shall be the act of such
committee, any one or more members of such committee may participate in a
meeting of such committee by means of a conference telephone or similar
communications equipment allowing all persons participating in the meeting to
hear each other at the same time and participation by such means shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of
Directors conducts its business pursuant to Article II of these by-laws.
         SECTION 6.  Resignations.  Any director of the Corporation may resign
at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors or to the
Chairman of the Board or to the Secretary of the Corporation.  Such
<PAGE>10

resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein; and unless
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective.
         SECTION 7.  Removal of Directors.  Any one or more of the directors
may be removed for cause by action of the Board of Directors or by vote of the
shareholders.
         SECTION 8.  Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.  Newly created
directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and
vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors for any reason except the removal
of directors by shareholders shall be filled by vote of a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum exists.  Vacancies
occurring as a result of the removal of directors by shareholders shall be
filled by the shareholders.  A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be
elected to hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor.
         SECTION 9.  Executive and Other Committees of Directors.  The Board of
Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, may
designate from among its members an executive committee and other committees,
each consisting of three or more directors, and each of which, to the extent
provided in the resolution, shall have all the authority of the Board, except
that no such committee shall have authority as to the following matters:
         (1) The submission to shareholders of any action        
             that needs shareholders' approval;
         (2) The filling of vacancies in the Board or in any
             committee;
         (3) The fixing of compensation of the directors for
             serving on the Board or on any committee;
         (4) The amendment or repeal of the by-laws, or the
             adoption of new by-laws;
         (5) The amendment or repeal of any resolution of the
             Board which, by its terms, shall not be so amendable
             or repealable; or
<PAGE>11

         (6)  The removal or indemnification of directors.
         The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member or
members at any meeting of such committee.
         Unless a greater proportion is required by the resolution designating
a committee, a majority of the entire authorized number of members of such
committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the
vote of a majority of the members present at a meeting at the time of such
vote, if a quorum is then present, shall be the act of such committee.
         Each such committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of
Directors.
         SECTION 10.  Compensation of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall
have authority to fix the compensation of directors for services in any
capacity.
         SECTION 11.  Interest of Director in a Transaction.  Unless shown to
be unfair and unreasonable as to the Corporation, no contract or other
transaction between the Corporation and one or more of its directors, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, firm, association or other
entity in which one or more of the directors are directors or officers, or are
financially interested, shall be either void or voidable, irrespective of
whether such interested director or directors are present at a meeting of the
Board of Directors, or of a committee thereof, which authorizes such contract
or transaction and irrespective of whether his or their votes are counted for
such purpose.  In the absence of fraud any such contract or transaction may be
conclusively authorized or approved as fair and reasonable by:
         (1) The Board of Directors, or a duly empowered committee thereof, by
             a vote sufficient for such purpose without counting the vote or
             votes of such interested director or directors (although he or
             they may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at the
             meeting which authorizes such contract or transaction), if the
             fact of such common
<PAGE>12

             directorship, officership or financial interest is disclosed or
             known to the Board or committee (as the case may be); or
         (2) The shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors,
             if such common directorship, officership or financial interest is
             disclosed or known to such shareholders.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no loan, except advances in connection
with idemnification, shall be made by the Corporation to any director unless it
is authorized by vote of the shareholders without counting any shares of the
director who would be the borrower.
         SECTION 12.  Indemnification.  Except to the extent expressly
prohibited by the New York Business Corporation Law, the Corporation shall
indemnify each person made or threatened to be made a party to or called as a
witness in or asked to provide information in connection with any pending or
threatened action, proceeding, hearing or investigation, whether civil or
criminal, and whether judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative, or legislative,
and whether or not for or in the right of the Corporation or any other
enterprise, by reason of the fact that such person or such person's testator or
intestate is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation who also serves or served at the request
of the Corporation any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity, against judgments,
fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including
attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with such action or proceeding, or any
appeal therein, provided that no such indemnification shall be made if a
judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that
his or her acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated,
or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other
advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled, and provided further
that no such indemnification shall be required with respect to any settlement
or other nonadjudicated disposition of any threatened or
<PAGE>13

pending action or proceeding unless the Corporation has given its prior consent
to such settlement or other disposition.
         The Corporation shall advance or promptly reimburse, upon request of
any person entitled to indemnification hereunder, all expenses, including
attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred in defending any action or proceeding in
advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of a written undertaking
by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if such person is
ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification or, where
indemnification is granted, to the extent the expenses so advanced or
reimbursed exceed the amount to which such person is entitled, provided,
however, that such person shall cooperate in good faith with any request by the
Corporation that common counsel be utilized by the parties to an action or
proceeding who are similarly situated unless to do so would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between or among such parties.
         Nothing herein shall limit or affect any right of any person otherwise
than hereunder to indemnification or expenses, including attorneys' fees, under
any statute, rule, regulation, certificate of incorporation, by-law, insurance
policy, contract or otherwise.
         No elimination of this by-law, and no amendment of this by-law
adversely affecting the right of any person to indemnification or advancement
of expenses hereunder shall be effective until the 60th day following notice to
such person of such action, and no elimination of or amendment to this by-law
shall deprive any person of his or her rights hereunder arising out of alleged
or actual occurrences, acts or failures to act prior to such 60th day.  The
provisions of this paragraph shall supersede anything to the contrary in these
by-laws.
         The Corporation shall not, except by elimination or amendment of this
by-law in a manner consistent with the preceding paragraph, take any corporate
action or enter into any agreement which prohibits, or otherwise limits the
rights of any person to, indemnification in accordance with the provisions of
this by-law.  The indemnification of any person provided by this
<PAGE>14

by-law shall continue after such person has ceased to be a director or officer
of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of such person's heirs,
executors, administrators and legal representatives.
         The Corporation is authorized to enter into agreements with any of its
directors, officers or employees extending rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses to such person to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, but the failure to enter into any such agreement shall not
affect or limit the rights of such person pursuant to this by-law.  It is
hereby expressly recognized that all directors and officers of the Corporation,
by serving as such after the adoption hereof, are acting in reliance hereon and
that the Corporation is estopped to contend otherwise.  Additionally, it is
hereby expressly recognized that all persons who serve or served as directors,
officers or employees of corporations which are subsidiaries or affiliates of
the Corporation (or other entities controlled by the Corporation) and are
directors or officers of the Corporation are conclusively presumed to serve or
have served as such at the request of the Corporation and, to the extent
permitted by law, are entitled to indemnification hereunder, but that no such
person shall have any rights hereunder or in connection herewith, except to the
extent that indemnification hereunder is permitted by law.
         In case any provision in this by-law shall be determined at any time
to be unenforceable in any respect, the other provisions shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, and the affected provision shall be given the
fullest possible enforcement in the circumstances, it being the intention of
the Corporation to afford indemnification and advancement of expenses to its
directors and officers, acting in such capacities or in the other capacities
mentioned herein, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
         For purposes of this by-law, the Corporation shall be deemed to have
requested a director or officer of the Corporation to serve an employee benefit
plan where the performance by such person of his or her duties to the
Corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such
<PAGE>15

person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan, and excise
taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to
applicable law shall be considered indemnifiable expenses.  For purposes of
this by-law, the term "Corporation" shall include any legal successor to the
Corporation, including any corporation which acquires all or substantially all
of the assets of the Corporation in one or more transactions.
         A person who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the
defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding of the character described
in the first paragraph of this by-law shall be entitled to indemnification as
authorized in such paragraph.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence and
unless ordered by a court, any indemnification under this by-law shall be made
by the Corporation if, and only if, authorized in the specific case:
     (l) By the Board of Directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors
         who are not parties to such action or proceeding upon a finding that
         the director or officer has met the standard of conduct set forth in
         the first paragraph of this by-law, or,

     (2) If such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of
         disinterested directors so directs:

         (a) By the Board of Directors upon the opinion in writing of
             independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the
             circumstances because the standard of conduct set forth in the
             first paragraph of this by-law has been met by such director or
             officer, or
         (b) By the shareholders upon a finding that the director or officer
             has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such
             paragraph.

         If any action with respect to indemnification of directors and
officers is taken by way of amendment of these by-laws, resolution of
directors, or by agreement, the Corporation shall, not later than the next
annual meeting of shareholders, unless such meeting is held within three months
from the date of such action and, in any event, within fifteen months from the
date of such action, mail to its shareholders of record at the time entitled to
vote for the election of directors a statement specifying the action taken.
         SECTION 13.  Action by Written Consent.  Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any
<PAGE>16

Committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or
Committee as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, to the adoption of a
resolution authorizing the action and such resolution and the written consents
thereto are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or
Committee.

         SECTION 1.  Officer.  The Board of Directors, as soon as may be
practicable after the annual election of directors, shall elect a Chairman of
the Board, a President, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary and a
Treasurer, and from time to time may elect or appoint such other officers as it
may deem advisable.  Any two or more offices may be held by the same person,

Secretary.
     SECTION 2.  Term of Office and Removal.  Each officer shall hold office
for the term for which he is elected or appointed, and until his successor has
been elected or appointed and qualified.  Unless otherwise provided in the
resolution of the Board of Directors electing or appointing an officer, his
term of office shall extend to and expire at the meeting of the Board following
the next annual meeting of shareholders.  Any officer may be removed by the
Board, with or without cause, at any time.  Removal of an officer without cause
shall be without prejudice to his contract rights, if any, and the election or
appointment of an officer shall not of itself create contract rights.
     SECTION 3.  Powers and Duties.  The Chairman of the Board shall preside at
all meetings of shareholders and of the Board of Directors and shall, unless
otherwise prescribed by the Board of Directors, be the Chief Executive Officer
of the Corporation.  All the other officers of the Corporation shall have such
authority and perform such duties in the management of the Corporation, as may
be prescribed by the Board of Directors and, to the extent
<PAGE>17

not so prescribed, they shall have such authority and perform such duties in
the management of the Corporation, subject to the control of the Board, as
generally pertain to their respective offices.  Securities of other
corporations held by the Corporation may be voted by the Chairman of the Board
or by another officer designated by the Board and, in the absence of any such
designation, by the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or the
Treasurer.  The Board may require any officer, agent or employee to give
security for the faithful performance of his duties.
     SECTION 4.  Books to be Kept.  The Corporation shall keep (a) correct and
complete books and records of account, (b) minutes of the proceeding of the
shareholders, Board of Directors and any committees of directors, and (c) a
current list of the directors and officers and their residence addresses; and
the Corporation shall also keep at its office in the State of New York or at
the office of its transfer agent or registrar in the State of New York, if any,
a record containing the name and addresses of all shareholders, the number and
class of shares held by each and the dates when they respectively became the
owners of record thereof.
     The Board of Directors may determine whether and to what extent and at
what times and places and under what conditions and regulations any accounts,
books, records or other documents of the Corporation shall be open to
inspection, and no creditor, security holder or other person shall have any
right to inspect any accounts, books, records or other documents of the
Corporation except as conferred by statute or as so authorized by the Board.
     SECTION 5.  Checks, Notes, etc.  All checks and drafts on, and withdrawals
from, the Corporation's accounts with banks or other financial institutions,
and all bills of exchange, notes and other instruments for the payment of
money, drawn, made, endorsed, or accepted by the Corporation, shall be signed
on its behalf by the person or persons thereunto authorized by, or pursuant to
resolution of, the Board of Directors.

                              Transfer of Shares

Corporation shall be represented by certificates, in such forms as the Board of
Directors may prescribe, signed by the Chairman or a Vice-Chairman of the Board
or the President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, and may be sealed with
the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof.  The signatures of the
officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is
countersigned by a transfer agent or registered by a registrar other than the
Corporation  or its employee.  In case any officer who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be
such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer at the date of
issue.
         Each certificate representing shares issued by the Corporation shall
set forth upon the face or back of the certificate, or shall state that the
Corporation will furnish to any shareholder upon request and without charge, a
full statement of the designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations
of the shares of each class of shares, if more than one, authorized to be
issued and the designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations of
each series of any class of preferred shares authorized to be issued so far as
the same have been fixed and the authority of the Board of Directors to
designate and fix the relative rights, preferences and limitations of other
series.
         Each certificate representing shares shall state upon the face
thereof:

         (3) The number and class of shares, and the designation of the

or a transfer agent of a certificate or certificates representing the shares
requested to be transferred, with proper endorsement on the certificate or on a

or its transfer agent may require.
         SECTION 3.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates.  No
certificate for shares of the Corporation shall be issued in place of any
certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, except,
if and to the extent required by the Board of Directors, upon:
         (1) Production of evidence of loss, destruction or wrongful taking;
         (2) Delivery of a bond indemnifying the Corporation and its agents
             against any claim that may be made against it or them on account
             of the alleged loss, destruction or wrongful taking of the
             replaced certificate or the issuance of the new certificate;
         (3) Payment of the expenses of the Corporation and its agents
             incurred in connection with the issuance of the certificate; and

                                   ARTICLE V
                                 Other Matters
                                       
         SECTION 1.  Corporate Seal.  The Board of Directors may adopt a
corporate seal, alter such seal at pleasure, and authorize it to be used by
<PAGE>20

the calendar year or such other period as may be fixed by the Board of
Directors.

amended or repealed by vote of the holders of shares at the time entitled to
vote in the election of directors, and By-Laws may also be adopted, amended or
repealed by the Board of Directors, provided that any by-law adopted by the
Board may be amended or repealed by the shareholders entitled to vote thereon
as hereinabove provided, and, provided further, that Section 3 of Article II
and this paragraph of Section 3 of Article V may not be altered, amended or
repealed, or new by-laws inconsistent therewith be adopted, except as provided
in Article Seventh of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation.
         If any by-law regulating an impending election of directors is
adopted, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors, there shall be set
forth in the notice of the next meeting of shareholders for the election of

USLIFE CORPORATION

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
AS AMENDED FEBRUARY 28, 1995




1.Eligibility

Each member  of the  Board of  Directors  of  USLIFE  Corporation
("USLIFE") who  is not  also an employee of USLIFE, or any of its
subsidiaries,  is   eligible  to  participate  in  this  Deferred
Compensation  Plan  (the  "Plan"),  pursuant  to  the  terms  and
conditions as described herein.

2.Participation by Non-Employee Directors

     (a)  On the  date of  adoption of  this Plan and at any time
thereafter, each  non-employee Director  may elect to participate
in the  Plan by  directing that  (i) all  or  part  of  the  cash
compensation which  would otherwise  have been payable to him for
services as  a Director  (including any fees payable for services
as a  member of  a committee  of the  Board) and  (ii) all or any
specified percentage  of the  shares of USLIFE common stock which
would otherwise  have been payable to him for such services shall
be credited,  respectively,   to  a  deferred  cash  compensation
account and a unit account subject to the terms of the Plan.

     (b)  An election  to participate in the Plan shall be in the
form of  a document executed by a non-employee Director and filed
with the Secretary of USLIFE, and such election shall continue in
effect until  such non-employee  Director ceases to be a Director
or is  otherwise ineligible  for the  Plan, or  until  such  non-
employee Director  terminates such election, in whole or in part,
by written  notice filed  with the Secretary of USLIFE.  Any such
termination, in  whole or  in part, shall become effective at the
close of  the calendar  quarter ending  immediately following the
date on  which the Secretary receives such notice with respect to
any and all compensation, fees and shares of common stock payable
thereafter, or  at the termination of such later calendar quarter
as may be designated in the notice of termination.

     (c)  A non-employee  Director who has filed a termination of
election may  thereafter file  an election to participate for any
future calendar quarters, at any time with respect to any and all
cash compensation, fees and shares of common stock payable to him
as a  non-employee Director of USLIFE.  Such election shall be as
provided in Paragraph 2(b).

     3(A)Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts

          (a)  All deferred cash compensation accounts shall be
<PAGE>2

held with  the general  funds of  USLIFE, shall be credited to an
account in  the name  of the  individual Director  and shall bear
interest, as described herein, from the date such fees were first
awarded or would otherwise have been paid.

          (b)  The participant's  deferred  compensation  account
shall be  credited at  the end  of each  quarter with an interest
equivalent.     The  interest   equivalent  shall  be  calculated
quarterly at a rate set by the Board, which rate shall be applied
to the  amounts in each participant's account at the beginning of
such quarter.

          (c)  The Board  of Directors  intends to review and set
the interest  rate described  in Paragraph  3A(b) annually in the
light of  current economic conditions; provided, however, that in
the event  that the  rate is not modified the interest equivalent
shall continue  to be calculated at the rate as last set forth by
the Board of Directors.

     (B)  Deferred Stock Unit Accounts

          (a)  A deferred stock unit account shall be established
in the  name of  each individual Director (i) who elects to defer
receipt of  all or  any specified  percentage of  the  shares  of
USLIFE common  stock payable  to him  on account  of  his  annual
retainer and/or  meeting fees  for his services as a Director, or
(ii) who  irrevocably elects  to have  the interest payable under
Paragraph 3A  above used to purchase stock units for crediting on
a quarterly  basis to  such Director's  stock  unit  account,  in
accordance with the formula described in Paragraph 3B(b) below.

          (b)  In the  case of  stock units  credited under  item
a(i) above,  one unit  for each full share of stock awarded shall
be credited  thereto as of the date such share(s) would otherwise
have been  paid.  The number of stock units credited quarterly to
the stock  unit account  of an electing Director under item a(ii)
above will  be calculated  by dividing  the dollar  amount of all
interest credited to the Director's deferred compensation account
at the  end of  each calendar  quarter by  the closing  price per
share of  USLIFE common stock reported as New York Stock Exchange
- Composite  Transactions on  the first  trading day  of the next
succeeding calendar  quarter, such  stock units to be computed to
four decimal places.

               Stock unit  accounts shall  be in the form of book
entry accounts  and no  actual shares  of stock  or  certificates
therefor shall  be issued  or transferred  to, or held under, the
Plan.   Shares  of  stock  issued  and  distributed  pursuant  to
Paragraph 4 shall be taken from shares of common stock previously
acquired by USLIFE and held in its treasury.

          (c)  Should  the   Director  so   elect,  the  deferred
compensation account  described in  Paragraph 3A will be credited
as of  the  pertinent  dividend  payment  date  with  a  dividend
equivalent
<PAGE>3

in the  amount of  any cash dividends declared and paid from time
to time  in respect  of USLIFE's  issued and  outstanding  common
stock for  each unit  in the  Director's stock unit account as of
such date  and interest  shall be credited thereon in the manner,
at the  times and  at the  rate  specified  in  Paragraph  3A(b).
Dividend equivalents  with respect  to any fraction of a share in
the Director's  stock unit  account will  also be credited to his
deferred cash compensation account.

          (d)  In  lieu   of  having  his  deferred  compensation
account  credited   with  dividend  equivalents  as  provided  in
Paragraph 3B(c)  above a  Director may  direct that such dividend
equivalents be  reinvested to create additional stock units which
will be  credited to  his stock  unit account.   In  the event  a
Director elects  to reinvest  the dividend equivalents, his stock
unit account  will be  credited as  of the  dividend payment date
with so  many additional stock units (and any fractions of a unit
computed to  four decimal places) as could be purchased with such
dividend equivalents  based on  the average  of the  high and low
sales price  of USLIFE's  common stock reported as New York Stock
Exchange-Composite Transactions on such dividend payment date or,
if no  trading occurs in such stock on the dividend payment date,
on the trading day immediately preceding said date.  In the event
a Director  elects to  reinvest dividend  equivalents under  this
Paragraph 3A(d),  dividend equivalents  on fractions  of a  share
will also be reinvested to create additional units.

          (e)  In the  event  a  Director  elects  to  defer  the
receipt of  less than  100% of  the shares payable to him for his
services as  a Director, any fractional share includable with the
deferred shares  (computed to  four decimal  places) will also be
credited to  his stock  unit account.   A  certificate(s) will be
issued to  the Director  with respect  to the non-deferred shares
but only  as  to  full  shares.    In  lieu  of  being  issued  a
certificate for  any non-deferred  fractional share, the value of
such fractional share will be credited to the Director's deferred
cash compensation  account or paid to the Director in cash in the
absence of such account.

          (f)  In the event that the number of outstanding shares
of USLIFE  common stock  shall be changed by reason of split-ups,
combinations, recapitalizations,  stock dividends  and the  like,
the Board  of Directors  of USLIFE shall make such adjustments as
it deems  appropriate in the number of units credited to the unit
accounts of participants hereunder.

          4.   Distribution

          (a)  Each   non-employee   Director   who   elects   to
participate in  this Plan  may make an election or may modify any
prior election  with respect  to the distribution of (i) the cash
amounts deferred hereunder plus accumulated interest and (ii) any
deferred shares  of stock  represented by  the number of units in
his unit  account in  a single  lump sum  payment  or  in  annual
installments.   Elections for distribution and any designation of
beneficiary (which designation
<PAGE>4

may name  an entity  other than  a natural person) shall first be
made by  non-employee Directors  at the  time that  they elect to
participate in the Plan.  Any modification of a prior election to
receive payment  and/or shares  of deferred  stock in  a lump sum
distribution or  in annual  installments shall  be made  no later
than the end of the calendar year preceding the year in which the
non-employee Director  ceases  to  serve  as  a  Director.    Any
beneficiary designation,  change or  cancellation may  be made at
any time.

     A Director  may elect to receive payment of (1) cash amounts
deferred under  the Plan  plus accumulated  interest  and/or  (2)
deferred shares  of stock  in one  distribution or  in some other
number of  approximately equal annual installments (not exceeding
10).   The first  installment (or the single payment and/or share
distribution if  so elected)  shall be paid and/or distributed on
or  about  the  first  business  day  of  the  month  immediately
following the month in which a non-employee Director ceases to be
a Director  of the  Company.   Subsequent installments,  if  any,
shall be  paid on  or about  the first  business day of the first
(and each  succeeding) calendar year, following the calendar year
in which  the first  installment is made, until the entire amount
credited to  the individual's  deferred cash  and/or unit account
shall have  been distributed  in full.  Cash amounts and/or units
held  pending  distribution  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall
continue to  accrue interest and/or receive dividend reinvestment
treatment, as  the case  may be, as provided in Paragraph 3 until
the date of distribution.

          (b)  The  election  or  any  modification  of  a  prior
election with  respect to  the  distribution  of  cash    amounts
deferred under the Plan plus accumulated interest and/or deferred
shares of  stock shall  be contained in a Notice of Election in a
form provided  by the  Secretary of USLIFE, and shall be executed
by the Director and filed with the Secretary of USLIFE.

          (c)  Notwithstanding any  election made  by a Director,
in  the  event  such  Director  becomes  a  proprietor,  officer,
partner, employee, or otherwise affiliated with any business that
is in  competition  with  USLIFE  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries,
directly or  indirectly, or  becomes employed by any governmental
agency having  jurisdiction over  the activities of USLIFE or any
of its  subsidiaries, the (i) entire balance of his deferred cash
compensation,   including interest,  and (ii) the deferred shares
represented by  the number  of stock units then in his stock unit
account shall  be distributed  immediately to  him  in  a  single
payment.

          (d)  If a Director should die before receiving (i) full
payment of  all amounts  credited to his deferred cash account or
(ii) distribution  of all  the shares  represented by  the  total
number of  stock units  in his stock unit account, the balance of
such account(s) shall be paid either
               (1)  in a  single lump  sum  distribution  on  the
tenth day  of the calendar year immediately following the date of
his
<PAGE>5

death to  (i) his  designated beneficiary  or beneficiaries, if a
single lump  sum distribution  has been elected for them; or (ii)
his estate, if no beneficiaries have been named or the designated
beneficiaries have predeceased the Director,

                                                    OR


               (2)  in approximately equal annual installments to
his designated  beneficiary or  beneficiaries in  the  number  of
annual  installments   (not  exceeding   ten)  elected   for  the
beneficiary  so   long  as   the  number   of  any  prior  annual
installments paid  to the  Director and  those  elected  for  the
beneficiary do not exceed 10.

          (e)  A Director  shall bear full responsibility for the
accuracy  and   legal  sufficiency   of  any   such   beneficiary
designation.   At any  time, and  from time  to  time,  any  such
designation may  be changed  or cancelled by the Director without
the consent  of any beneficiary.  Any such designation, change or
cancellation must  be made  by  written  notice  filed  with  the
Secretary of  USLIFE and  shall not  be effective  until actually
received by  the Secretary.   If  a Director designates more than
one beneficiary,  any cash payments and/or share distributions to
such beneficiaries  shall be  made in  equal  shares  unless  the
Director has  designated otherwise.   In the absence of a written
notice  contesting   a  beneficiary   designation  or   otherwise
contesting a  distribution received  by the  Secretary of  USLIFE
before the  date of  distribution, distribution  will be  made in
accordance with the beneficiary designation of record.

          (f)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan,
cash amounts  deferred under  the Plan  plus accumulated interest
together with  a certificate  or certificates  for  all  deferred
shares represented  by the  total  number  of  stock  units  then
outstanding in  his  stock  unit  account  shall  be  immediately
distributed to  each participating  Director, or  his  designated
beneficiary or  beneficiaries or  his estate, as the case may be,
in a  single lump sum distribution in the event of the occurrence
of either  (1) a  transaction which  has required the affirmative
vote of  holders of  at least  80% of  the outstanding  shares of
capital stock of USLIFE Corporation regularly entitled to vote in
the election  of  directors  by  reason  of  Article  Seventh  of
USLIFE's Certificate  of Incorporation, or (2) the acquisition by
any person, partnership, corporation or other organization, or by
any group  of two  or more thereof who are affiliates (as defined
by Rule  405 under  the Securities  Act of 1933) or are acting in
concert in  respect of such acquisition, of more than 25% of such
outstanding shares  of capital  stock if  USLIFE has  opposed  an
acquisition of  shares of  USLIFE by  such  person,  partnership,
corporation or  other organization  or group before any insurance
regulatory authority  whose  approval  of  such  acquisition  was
required.

assignment, attachment,  lien, levy,  or other  creditors' rights
under any state or federal law.

          (b)  USLIFE  shall  not  be  required  to  reserve,  or
otherwise set aside, funds for the payment or satisfaction of its
obligations hereunder.

          (c)  Copies of  the Plan  and any  and  all  amendments
thereto shall  be made  available at  all reasonable times at the
office of the Secretary of USLIFE to all non-employee Directors.

          (d)  This Deferred  Compensation Plan  may  be  amended
prospectively, from  time to  time, by  the Board of Directors of
USLIFE, and  the interest  rate applicable  hereunder may  be set
prospectively by  the  Board  as  provided  in  Paragraph  3A(b);
provided, however, that no amendment shall, in any event, be made
to the  Plan which would reduce (i) the amounts already earned by
any non-employee  Director or  (ii)  the  number  of  any  shares
deferred hereunder  and represented  by the  units accumulated in
such  Director's  stock  unit  account  or  change  the  date  or
provisions for  distribution of  such amounts  or shares,  unless
each non-employee  Director personally  approves  such  amendment
insofar as the amendment affects him, and, further, provided that
(1) item  (ii) of Paragraph 3B(a) and the provisions of Paragraph
3B(b) regarding  the timing  and the  formula for determining the
amount and  price of the stock units to be purchased and credited
to the non-employee Director's stock unit account under item (ii)
thereof as  well as  the provisions of Paragraph 1 on eligibility
for participation  herein shall  not be  amended or  revised more
than once  every six months other than to comport with changes in
the Internal  Revenue Code,  as amended,  the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder, and
(2) that  participation in  this Plan by a Director who elects to
have the  interest payable  under Paragraph  3A used  to purchase
stock units  pursuant to  Paragraphs 3B(a) and 3B(b) shall not be
voluntarily terminated  by such  Director before  the end  of the
second full calendar quarter following the effective date of such
election nor may such Director increase or decrease the amount or
percentage of  his cash compensation deferred hereunder more than
once every six months, it being intended that such unit purchases
shall qualify in all respects as "formula awards" under Rule 16b-
3(c)2(ii) of  Section 16(b)  of the  Securities Exchange  Act  of
1934, as such rule may hereinafter be amended from time to time.

          (e)  If a  Director of The United States Life Insurance
Company In  the City  of New  York with  a deferred account under
that Company's  Deferred Compensation  Plan (the  "United  States
Life Plan")  at any  time resigns  from the Board of Directors of
United States  Life to  become a member of the Board of Directors
of USLIFE Corporation and participate in this Plan, then upon his
election to  the Board  of Directors  of USLIFE  Corporation  the
Director shall  become a  Participant in  this Plan,  the  credit
balance in his deferred account under the United States Life Plan
shall
<PAGE>7

automatically be  transferred and credited to the general account
of USLIFE Corporation and the elections made by the Director with
respect to  the United  States Life Plan shall continue in effect
under this Plan as if they had originally been made thereunder.

          (f)  Nothing contained  herein  shall  prohibit  USLIFE
from establishing a "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating
funds to  pay all  (a) amounts  deferred hereunder  together with
accumulated interest  and (b)  shares of stock in a participant's
deferred stock  unit account;  provided, however, that the assets
of such Rabbi Trust shall be available to the creditors of USLIFE
if USLIFE  is unable  to pay  its debts  as they  fall due, or if
bankruptcy or  insolvency proceedings  have been initiated by any
USLIFE creditor  or USLIFE  itself, or  by any third party, under
the Bankruptcy Act of the United States or the bankruptcy laws of
any state, alleging that USLIFE is insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in
accordance with  the terms  of such a Rabbi Trust, any funds held
in such  trust revert back to USLIFE, such reversion shall not in
any manner reduce or diminish the obligation of USLIFE under this
Plan to any participant.

previously paid to him.  The amount of his remaining annual
retirement benefit payments, if any, shall be based on his annual
retainer and his total service as an Outside Director on the date
of his subsequent termination of service.

of the United States or the bankruptcy laws of any state,
alleging that the Company is insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in
accordance with the terms of a Rabbi Trust, any funds held in
such trust revert back to the Company, such reversion shall not
in any manner reduce or diminish the obligation of the Company
under this Plan to any Participant.

                    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

the State of New York.

interest under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, charge, garnishment, attachment, execution, or the
claims of creditors with respect to any Participant having an
interest in this Plan.  If any Participant who is entitled to any

charge such benefit, or if any person shall attempt to garnish,

in its sole discretion, may terminate the interest in such
benefit of such Participant and in that event, the Committee
shall cause such benefit, or any part thereof, to be held or
applied for the benefit of such Participant of his spouse,
children or other relatives or dependents, or all or any of them,
in such manner as the Committee shall determine, and any such
application shall be a complete discharge of all liability with

federal income tax on any benefits under the Plan prior to the
time such benefits are payable, then the entire amount of
benefits payable to such person under this Plan shall be due and
payable at once, in a single lump sum, determined using the UP
1984 Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
interest rates for lump sum calculations as in effect on the
first day of the Plan year in which such amount is to be paid.  A
benefit shall be determined to be subject to federal income tax
upon the earliest of (a) a final determination by the United
States Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Participant
which is not appealed to the courts, or (b) a final determination
by the United States Tax Court or any other Federal court
affirming any such determination by the Internal Revenue Service,
<PAGE>6

or (c) an opinion by counsel chosen by the Company addressed to
the Company that by reason of treasury regulations, amendments to
the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue Service
Rulings, court decisions or other substantial precedents, such
benefits are subject to federal income tax prior to payment.  The
Company shall undertake to defend, and bear the expense of, any
tax claims described herein which are asserted by the Internal
Revenue Service or by the taxing authority of any State or
locality against any Participant including the expense of
attorney fees and costs of appeal, and shall have the sole
authority to determine whether or not to appeal any determination
made by the Internal Revenue Service, or by any taxing
authorities of any State or locality, or by any court.  The
Company agrees to reimburse any Participant for any interest or
penalties in respect of Federal, State or local tax claims
hereunder upon receipt of documentation of the same.

          elect to take such material non-operational items into
<PAGE>2

          account (but not for purposes of determining Threshold Earnings Per
          Share from Continuing Operations) to the extent such items would
          result in a reduction in the Company's income from operations.

          the Company and its subsidiaries.  For purposes of determining the
          date on which a Participant becomes Permanently Disabled, the
          Committee may select the day on which such Participant first becomes

     3.   Administration.  The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.
     Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and
     complete authority to:  (i) select Participants; (ii) determine the number
     of Restricted Shares subject to each grant; (iii) determine the time or
     times when grants are to be made; (iv) prescribe the form or forms of the
     instruments evidencing any grants made hereunder, provided that such forms
     are consistent with the Plan; (v) adopt, amend and rescind such rules and
     regulations as, in its opinion, may be advisable for the administration of
     the Plan; (vi) construe and interpret the Plan and any related documents
     including, without limitation, any Restricted Share Agreement (as
     
<PAGE>3
     
     defined in Section 6(a) hereof); and (vii) make all other determinations
     deemed advisable or necessary for the administration of the Plan.  All
     determinations by the Committee shall be final and binding.

     4.   Shares of Common Stock Subject to the Plan.  No more than 1,050,000
     shares of Common Stock in the aggregate (as adjusted for the December 1992
     3-for-2 stock split) shall be issued as Restricted Shares under the Plan,
     subject to adjustment as provided in Section 7 hereof.  A Participant may
     be granted more than one award of Restricted Shares under the Plan.  No
     Participant shall be granted more than 75,000 Restricted Shares in the
     aggregate under the Plan during any one-year period, subject to adjustment
     as provided in Section 7 hereof.  Shares of Common Stock issued as
     Restricted Shares under the Plan that are later forfeited pursuant to
     Section 6 hereof may again be subject to grants under the Plan.  All
     shares of Common Stock issued as Restricted Shares hereunder shall either
     be shares held by the Company in its treasury or shares previously
     forfeited under the terms of the Plan.

     5.   Eligibility and Participation.  Participation in the Plan shall be
     limited to those executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries at
     the level of Senior Vice President and above (including Directors who are
     officers) and such other key officers as shall be designated by the
     Committee as being in positions in which they can make a significant
     impact on the profitability of the Company.  The Committee may at any time
     designate additional executive officers as Participants or revoke any
     prior designation, but such revocation shall not affect a Participant's
     rights with respect to Restricted Shares granted prior to the revocation.

     6.   Provisions Applicable to Restricted Shares

     a)   Grants of Restricted Shares.  The Committee may grant Restricted
     Shares to Participants at any time.  Subject to the provisions of Sections
     6(b) and (d) hereof, a grant of Restricted Shares shall be effective for
     the entire applicable Restricted Period and may not be revoked.  Each
     grant to a Participant shall be evidenced by a written agreement, signed
     by the Participant (a "Restricted Share Agreement"), which shall state the
     number of Restricted Shares granted, the Restricted Period, the
     restrictions that apply to such Restricted Shares, and any other terms,
     conditions, and rights with respect to such grant.

     b)   Restrictions.  At the time Restricted Shares are granted to a
     Participant, share certificates representing the appropriate number of
     Restricted Shares shall be registered in the name of such Participant but
     held by the Company for the account of such Participant.  Such
     certificates shall bear a legend restricting their transferability as
     provided herein.  During the Restricted Period, the Participant shall have
     the right to vote such Restricted Shares.  Dividends paid for any calendar
     year during the Restricted Period shall be held by the Company for the
<PAGE>4
     
     account of such Participant and shall, subject to clause (iii) of this
     Section 6(b), be distributed to the Participant as soon as practicable
     following the March 1 following such calendar year, with the exception of
     dividends payable on grants made under the Company's Long-Term Incentive
     Award Guidelines to participants who are not Covered Employees, which
     shall be paid as set forth in Section 6(c).  The Restricted Shares shall,
     however, be subject to the following restrictions during the Restricted
     Period:

          (i)  subject to Sections 6(c) and (d) hereof, none of the Restricted
          Shares may be sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned, pledged, or
          otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Participant during the
          applicable Restricted Period; provided, however, that as of March 1
          (the "Vesting Date") of each of the second, third, fourth and fifth
          of the five calendar years comprising such Restricted Period, and as
          of March 1 following such fifth calendar year, (the "Vesting
          Schedule"), such restrictions (including any restrictions under the
          applicable Restricted Share Agreement) shall, subject to clause (iii)
          of this Section 6(b), terminate with respect to 20% (the "Vesting
          Rate") of the number of Restricted Shares granted to such Participant
          for such Restricted Period and, as soon as practicable following the
          relevant Vesting Date, certificates for the appropriate number of
          shares of Common Stock shall be delivered for such Participant, free
          of the restrictions of the Plan and the Restricted Share Agreement,
          in accordance with Section 6(e) hereof;

          (ii) subject to Section 6(d) hereof, if such Participant ceases to be
          an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
          expiration  of the applicable Restricted Period, any Restricted
          Shares granted to such Participant which are still subject to
          restriction shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant to
          such Restricted Shares shall terminate without further obligation on
          the part of the Company; and

          (iii)     notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this
          Section 6(b), but subject to the last sentence of Section 6(c)
          hereof, in the event that, for any calendar year during the
          Restricted Period, the Company's Earnings Per Share from Continuing
          Operations do not exceed the Company's Threshold Earnings Per Share
          from Continuing Operations, any Restricted Shares for which the
          applicable restrictions would have terminated as of the March 1
          following such calendar year shall be forfeited and all rights of the
          Participant to such Restricted Shares (and to any dividends paid and
          held by the Company for such calendar year with respect to such
          Restricted Shares or any other Restricted Shares granted to the
          Participant) shall terminate without further obligation on the part
          of the Company.

<PAGE>5
     
     (c)  Alternative Vesting Schedules and Rates.  Notwithstanding the proviso
     to Section 6(b)(i) hereof, with respect to Restricted Shares granted to a
     Participant for any Restricted Period other than the Initial Restricted
     Period, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe that all
     restrictions on such Restricted Shares under the Plan and the applicable
     Restricted Share Agreement shall terminate in accordance with a schedule
     other than the Vesting Schedule and at a rate other than the Vesting Rate;
     provided, however, that any such grant shall, subject to the following
     sentence, be subject to the performance thresholds specified in Section
     6(b)(iii).  Grants made under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Award
     Guidelines, as amended from time to time, to Participants who are not
     Covered Employees are not subject to the forfeiture provisions contained
     in Section 6(b)(iii), and dividends payable on such shares shall not be
     held by the Company for the account of such Participant in accordance with
     Section 6(b) hereof but shall be paid on the regular dividend payment
     date.

     (d)  Termination of Employment or Occurrence of a Change in Control.  With
     respect to any Participant, if (i) such Participant ceases to be an
     employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the expiration
     of the applicable Restricted Period by reason of death, Permanent
     Disability, Retirement or termination by the Company without Cause or (ii)
     a Change in Control occurs, all restrictions set forth in the Plan and the
     applicable Restricted Share Agreement (and the provisions of Section
     6(b)(iii) hereof) shall terminate as to any Restricted Shares granted to
     such Participant which are still subject to restriction, and certificates
     for the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock free of the
     restrictions of the Plan and such Restricted Share Agreement shall be
     delivered to the Participant or his or her beneficiary or estate, as the
     case may be, in accordance with Section 6(b) hereof, all Restricted Shares
     granted to such Participant which are still subject to restriction.

     (e)  Delivery of Restricted Shares.  At the end of the applicable
     Restricted Period or at such earlier time  as provided for in accordance
     with Section 6(b), (c) or (d) hereof, subject to Section 6(b)(iii) hereof,
     where applicable, all restrictions contained in the Plan and the
     applicable Restricted Share Agreement shall terminate as to the Restricted
     Shares granted to a Participant with respect to such Restricted Period,
     and certificates for the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock free
     of the restrictions of the Plan and the Restricted Share Agreement,
     registered in the name of the Participant, shall be delivered to the
     Participant or his or her beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.

     7.   Changes in Capitalization.  If any change shall occur in or affect
     the Common Stock on account of a merger, consolidation, reorganization,
     stock dividend, stock split or combination, reclassification,
     recapitalization, or distribution to holders of the Common Stock (other
     than regular dividends), the Committee shall make such adjustments, if
     any, that it may deem, in its sole discretion, necessary or equitable in
     (a) the maximum number of shares of
<PAGE>6
     
     Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan and (b) the number of
     shares of Common Stock subject to or reserved for issuance under
     outstanding Restricted Share grants.  In the case of any stock split or
     stock dividend, such adjustments shall be self-operative and shall not
     require any specific action by the Company's Board of Directors to
     effectuate the same.

     8.   Designation of Beneficiary.  A Participant may designate a person or
     persons to receive, in the event of his or her death, any rights to which
     he or she would be entitled under the Plan.  Such a designation shall be
     made in writing and filed with the Secretary of the Company.  A
     beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant at any
     time by filing a written statement of such change or revocation with the
     Secretary of the Company.  If a Participant fails to designate a
     beneficiary, then his or her estate shall be deemed to be his or her
     beneficiary.

     9.   Rights as an Employee.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken
     hereunder shall be construed as giving any officer or employee of the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries the right to become a Participant, and
     a grant under the Plan shall not be construed as giving any Participant
     any right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any of
     its subsidiaries.

     10.  Nontransferability.  A Participant's rights under the Plan, including
     the right to any amounts or Common Stock payable, may not be assigned,
     pledged, or otherwise transferred except, in the event of a Participant's
     death, to his or her designated beneficiary or, in the absence of such a
     designation, by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

     11.  Withholding.  The Company and its subsidiaries shall have the right,
     before any payment is made or a certificate for any Common Stock is
     delivered, to deduct or withhold from any payment to a Participant under
     the Plan to satisfy any Federal, state, or local taxes, including transfer
     taxes, required by law to be withheld or to require the Participant or his
     or her beneficiary or estate, as the case may be, to pay any amount, or
     the balance of any amount, required to be withheld.  The Committee may, in
     its discretion and subject to such rules and procedures as it may adopt,
     permit a Participant to satisfy in whole or in part his or her withholding
     tax obligations for Federal, state and local income taxes, including
     without limitation FICA, arising in connection with the vesting of
     Restricted Shares under the Plan by withholding shares of Common Stock
     with a fair market value equal to such withholding obligations from the
     shares that would otherwise vest and be delivered to the Participant.

<PAGE>7

     12.  No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any grant made
     hereunder shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund
     of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries and a Participant or any other person.  To the extent that
     any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant
     to a grant under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right
     of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

     13.  Expenses.  The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by
     the Company.

     14.  Amendment and Termination.  The Committee may modify, amend, or
     terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no modification,
     amendment, or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect the rights of
     a Participant under a grant previously made to him or her without the
     consent of such Participant.

     15.  Governmental and Other Regulations.  The Plan and any grant hereunder
     shall be subject to all applicable Federal and state laws, rules, and
     regulations and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency
     as may be required.

     16.  Governing Law.  The Plan shall be construed and its provisions
     enforced and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of New
     York.

     17.  Effective Date.  The Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 1989;
     provided, however, that it shall be a condition to the effectiveness of
     the Plan, and any grants hereunder, that the shareholders of the Company
     shall approve the adoption of the Plan at the 1989 annual shareholders'
     meeting.  If such shareholders fail to approve the Plan, then the Plan and
     any grants hereunder shall be null and void ab initio.  It shall be a
     condition to the effectiveness of any grants hereunder made on or after
     January 1, 1994 that the shareholders of the Company shall approve at the
     1994 annual shareholders' meeting the amendments to the Plan submitted to
     the shareholders for their approval.

<DESCRIPTION>1991 STOCK OPTION PLAN, AS AMENDED

<PAGE>1


USLIFE Corporation
1991 Stock Option Plan
As Amended


The purpose of the 1991 Stock Option Plan of USLIFE
Corporation (the "Plan") is to encourage and enable selected
employees who are key officers of USLIFE Corporation (the
"Corporation") and its subsidiary corporations upon whose
judgment, initiative and efforts the Corporation is largely
dependent for its business success to acquire a proprietary
interest in the Corporation through the ownership of its
common stock.  In this Plan, the terms "employees of the
Corporation", "employment by the Corporation", and "in the
employ of the Corporation", shall be deemed to include
employees of, employment by, and in the employ of, a
"subsidiary corporation" or "parent corporation" of the
Corporation, as those terms are defined in section 424 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

1.  The Stock.  Options granted under the Plan shall be for
the purchase of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of USLIFE Corporation together with any Common Stock
Purchase Rights appertaining thereto ("Common Stock").
Subject to adjustment in the number and kind of shares as
hereinafter provided, not more than 1,050,000 shares of such
stock shall be sold on exercise of options under the Plan
(as adjusted for the December 1992 3-for-2 stock split,
pursuant to paragraph 12 below).  Such shares may be
authorized but unissued shares or shares acquired by the
Corporation and held in its treasury, as the Board of
Directors may determine.  Any shares in respect of which an
option granted under the Plan shall have expired or
terminated may again be allotted under the Plan.  Each
option granted under the Plan shall be subject to the
requirement that, if at any time the Board of Directors
shall determine that the listing, registration or
qualification of the shares subject thereto upon any
securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or
the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body,
is necessary or desirable in connection with the granting of
such option or the issue or purchase of shares subject
thereto, no such option may be exercised in whole or in part
unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or
approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any
conditions not acceptable to the Board of Directors.

2.  Types of Options.  The types of Original Options (as
defined in paragraph 10) that may be granted under the Plan
are incentive stock options (hereinafter "ISOs"), as defined
under section 422 of the Code, and non-qualified stock
options.  Any such option, or part thereof, granted under
<PAGE>2

the Plan may be designated as an ISO or a non-qualified
stock option by the Committee and with the approval of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation.

3.  Eligibility.  Options shall be granted only to employees
who are key officers of the Corporation (including key
officers who are directors); provided that no options may be
granted to directors who are not employees or to persons who
are then serving on the Executive Compensation and
Nominating Committee (the "Committee").

Under the Plan, the aggregate fair market value of the
shares of Common Stock with respect to which all ISOs,
including any ISOs granted after December 31, 1986 under the
1981 USLIFE Corporation Stock Option Plan (hereinafter "1981
Plan") are first exercisable by the optionee during any
calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.  Notwithstanding
any contrary provision of either the 1981 Plan or the Plan,
no ISO shall be granted to any employee who, at the time the
option is granted, owns directly or indirectly within the
meaning of section 424(d) of the Code more than ten percent
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock
of the Corporation, unless (a) the purchase price of shares
under such option is at least 110 % of the fair market value
of a share of the Common Stock on the date the option is
granted, and (b) the expiration date of such option is a
date not later than the day preceding the fifth anniversary
of the date on which the option is granted.

4.  Number of Options.  No individual shall be granted more
than 75,000 options in the aggregate under the Plan during
any one-year period.

5.  Price.  The purchase price of shares under each option
shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of such
shares at the time of grant of the option.

6.  Option Period.  The period during which each option may
be exercised shall be set forth in the option, but in no
event shall an option be exercisable in whole or in part (a)
before the end of six (6) months following the date of the
grant, or (b) after the expiration of ten (10) years from
such date; provided, however, that a Reload Option, as such
term is defined in paragraph 10, may not be exercised for a
period of three (3) years from the date of the exercise of
an Original Option.  Each option may be exercisable in one
or more installments as provided therein.

7.  Exercise of Option.  Except as provided in paragraphs 9
and 11 below, no option may be exercised unless the optionee
is at the time of such exercise in the employ of the
Corporation and shall have been continuously so employed
since the granting of the option.  Payment for shares
purchased must be made in full at the time of exercise.  The
<PAGE>3

purchase price may be paid in cash; and unless the Committee
adopts a contrary resolution, the purchase price may also be
paid through the delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by
the employee or through a combination of cash and such
shares equal to the total option price.  Any shares so
delivered will be valued at their fair market value on the
day preceding the day of exercise and the value thereof
shall not exceed the total option price.  No fractional
shares will be issued.  The Corporation may require as a
condition of the exercise of the option that the optionee
will pay to the Corporation, in cash, an amount sufficient
to satisfy the Corporation's obligation to withhold federal,
state and local taxes with respect to the exercise of the
option.

8.  Non-transferability of Option.  No option granted under
the Plan to an employee shall be transferable by the
employee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order as defined by the Code or Title 1 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, and
such option shall be exercisable, during his or her
lifetime, only by the employee.

9.  Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an
optionee while entitled to exercise any option granted to
him or her, such option shall be exercisable up to the date
of expiration of the option period or within twelve months
next succeeding the date of death, whichever is earlier, and
then only (a) by the optionee's legal representatives or the
person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under the
option pass by the optionee's will or the laws of descent
and distribution, and (b) to the extent that he or she was
entitled to exercise the option at the date of his or her
death.

10.  Reload Features.  Whenever the holder of any option
(the "Original Option") outstanding under the Plan
(including any Reload Option granted under the provisions of
this paragraph 10) exercises the Original Option and makes
payment of the option purchase price in whole or in part by
delivering shares of Common Stock previously held by him or
her, then the holder of that Option shall, subject to
paragraph 4 above, receive a new option (the "Reload
Option") for that number of additional shares of Common
Stock delivered by the optionee in payment of the purchase
price for the Original Option being exercised.  All such
Reload Options granted hereunder shall be non-qualified
stock options and shall be subject to all of the following
terms and conditions:

           (a) the option price per share shall be the then
current fair market value per share of the Common Stock as
of the date of exercise of the Original Option;
<PAGE>4

           (b) the Reload Option shall be exercisable for
three (3) years from the date it vests;

           (c) any Reload Option shall vest and be
exercisable three (3) years from the date of its grant;

           (d) except as set forth in subparagraph (e)
below, all other terms and conditions of Reload Options
shall be identical to the terms and conditions of the
Original Option; and

           (e) any and all Reload Options granted pursuant
to this paragraph 10 shall be subject to the following
additional conditions and restrictions:

         (i)              no Reload Option shall be granted
unless the shares tendered upon exercise of the Original
Option in payment therefor have been held by the optionee
for a period of more than six (6) months prior to the
exercise of the Original Option; and

         (ii)             if any of the shares of Common
Stock which are issued upon exercise of the Original Option
are sold within three (3) years following the exercise of
the Original Option, then the Reload Option shall
immediately terminate and the optionee shall have no further
rights with respect to that Reload Option.

11.  Continuation of Employment.  Each option, to the extent
it shall not have been exercised, shall terminate when the
employment of the optionee terminates for any reason other
than death, disability or retirement either after age 65, or
prior thereto with the consent of the Board of Directors
under a pension, profit sharing, long-term disability or
similar plan of his or her employer.  In the event of
termination of employment because of such retirement or
disability, the employee's options shall terminate on the
date of expiration of the option period and may be exercised
as though the optionee had remained in the employ of the
Corporation until the termination of the option except as
the Committee may provide.  Nothing contained in the Plan or
in any option granted pursuant to the Plan shall confer on
any optionee any right to be continued in the employ of the
Corporation.

12.  Dilution or Other Adjustments.  In the event that the
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be increased or
decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the
Corporation or of another corporation, whether through
reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
stock split, combination of shares, stock dividend or
otherwise, the Board of Directors shall make appropriate
adjustment in the number or kind of shares or securities
<PAGE>5

available for option pursuant to the Plan and subject to any
option, and the purchase price therefor.  The determination
of the Board of Directors as to such adjustments shall be
conclusive.  In the case of any stock split or stock
dividend, such adjustments shall be self-operative and shall
not require any specific action by the Corporation's Board
of Directors to effectuate the same.

13.  Effective Date and Termination of the Plan.  The Plan
was authorized by the Board of Directors effective as of May
21, 1991, subject to and conditioned upon approval of the
holders of a majority of the Corporation's then outstanding
shares of Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C
Cumulative Preferred Stock and any other class or series of
stock which is entitled to vote with the holders of the
Common Stock, all voting as a single class.  The Board of
Directors may in its discretion terminate the Plan with
respect to any shares for which options have not theretofore
been granted.  No option may be granted hereunder after May
20, 2001.

14.  Effect of a Change in Control on Options.  "Change in
Control" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation to which
the Corporation is a party and for which the approval of any
shareholders of the Corporation is required; (ii) any
"person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
securities of the Corporation representing 25% or more of
the combined voting power of the Corporation's then
outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; or (iv)
a liquidation or reorganization of the Corporation.  In the
event of a Change in Control then all outstanding options,
including Original Options and Reload Options, which have
been held by the optionee for at least six (6) months from
the date of their grant shall vest and become immediately
exercisable and the restrictions contained in paragraph
10(c) and paragraph 10(e)(ii) shall no longer apply.

15.  Administration and Amendment to the Plan.  The Plan
shall be administered by the Committee as appointed from
time to time by the Board of Directors from among its
members, none of whom shall be eligible to be granted stock
options under the Plan and each of whom shall be (a) a
"disinterested person" within the meaning of Rule 16b-
3(c)(2)(i) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "'34 Act") and (b) an "outside director" within
the meaning of Section 162(m)(4) of the Code.  Subject to
and within the limitations provided in the Plan, the
Committee shall grant options under the Plan on such terms
and conditions as the Committee shall deem appropriate.  The
Committee from time to time may adopt rules and regulations
<PAGE>6

for carrying out the Plan.  The interpretation and decision
with regard to any question arising under the Plan made by
the Committee shall be final and conclusive on the
Corporation and on all participants, and other persons
eligible to participate, in the Plan.  The Committee may at
any time, or from time to time, suspend or terminate the
Plan in whole or in part or amend the Plan in such respect
as the Committee may deem appropriate; provided, however,
that no such amendment shall be made, which would, without
approval of the holders of a majority of the Corporation's
outstanding shares of Common Stock, Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and
any other class or series of stock which is entitled to vote
with the holders of the Common Stock, all voting as a single
class:

      (a)  materially modify the eligibility requirements
for receiving options or change the class of employees to
whom options may be granted;

      (b)  materially increase the number of shares of
Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to options;

      (c)  reduce the minimum purchase price for option
shares as set forth in paragraph 5 above;

      (d)  extend the period of granting options; or

      (e)  materially increase in any other way the benefits
accruing to optionees.


       No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan
may, without the optionee's consent, alter or impair any of
the rights or obligations under any option theretofore
granted to an optionee under the Plan.  The Committee may
amend the Plan, subject to the limitations cited above, in
such manner as it deems necessary to (a) permit the granting
of options meeting the requirements of future amendments, if
any, to the Code or future regulations issued thereafter and
(b) ensure that options granted or to be granted hereunder
meet the requirements of Rule 16b-3 of the '34 Act for
exemption from the provisions of Rule 16b-3 thereunder, as
such rule may hereinafter be amended.

For Selected Key Officers of USLIFE Corporation and its Subsidiaries

     1.   Purpose of the Plan.  The purpose of this Annual Incentive Plan (the
     "Plan") is to provide an incentive and reward to selected key officers of
     USLIFE Corporation (the "Corporation") and its subsidiaries who have had,
     and who are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the
     performance of the Corporation by making such key officers participants in
     the Corporation's profits through the medium of annual incentive awards.

     2.   Definitions.

     a)   The term "Change in Control" shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation
          to which the Corporation is a party and for which the approval of any
          shareholders of the Corporation is required; (ii) any person (as such
          term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the beneficial owner,

          outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of substantially all
          of the assets of the Corporation; or (iv) a liquidation or

          losses, for the Corporation's individual line of business, including
          individual life, individual investment contracts and income from
          capital and surplus, before changes in accounting principles and
          before material non-operational items that are beyond the control of
          the Corporation's management, provided that the Committee may, in its
          sole discretion, elect to take such material non-operational items
          into account to the extent such items would result in a reduction in
          pre-tax income.
  
     d)   The term "Permanent Disability" shall mean a physical or mental
          condition of a Participant  that, in the judgment of the Committee,
          after consultation with a duly licensed physician, permanently
          prevents such Participant from being able to serve as an active
          employee of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.  For purposes of
          determining the day on which a Participant becomes permanently
          disabled, the Committee may select the day on which such Participant
          first becomes eligible for long-term disability benefits under the

     3.   Administration of the Plan.

     a)   This plan shall be administered by the Executive Compensation and
          Nominating Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of
          the Corporation (the "Board") which shall consist of not less than
          two members of the Board.  Each member of the Committee shall be an
          "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4) of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Service on
          the Committee shall constitute service as a director of the
          Corporation so that the members of the Committee shall be entitled to
          indemnification and reimbursement as directors of the Corporation
          pursuant to its By-laws.
  
     b)   The Committee is authorized to interpret this Plan and may from time
          to time adopt such rules and regulations for carrying out this Plan
          as it may deem necessary or advisable.  Decisions of the Committee
          shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties, including
          the Corporation, the shareholders of the Corporation and the key
          officers who participate in the Plan.  The Committee shall be
          entitled to rely upon the determination of the independent auditor of
          the Corporation with respect to, for any given year, the calculation
          of Income from the Core Life Insurance Businesses.

     4.   Participation in the Plan.

     a)   Participation in this Plan during any year shall be limited to those
          key officers ("Participants") of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
          who, in the opinion of the Committee, are in a position to have a
          significant impact on the performance of the Corporation and who are
          selected by the Committee; provided, that participation by a key
          officer of a subsidiary shall be subject to the approval of the Plan
          by such subsidiary's Board of Directors, which approval shall
          constitute the subsidiary's agreement to pay, at the direction of the
          Committee, awards directly to its key officers or to reimburse the
          Corporation for the cost of such participation in accordance with
          rules adopted by the Committee.
  
     b)   Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion,
          if a Participant ceases to be employed by the Corporation or its
          subsidiaries prior to the end of a year for any reason other than
          Permanent Disability, Retirement (as defined in the Corporation's
          Retirement Plan), or death, his or her participation in the Plan for
          such year will terminate forthwith and he or she will not be entitled
          to any award for such year.  If, prior to the end of a
<PAGE>3

          year, a Participant's employment ceases because of Permanent
          Disability, Retirement or death, of if the effective date of
          participation by a Participant for any year shall be after January 1
          of the Plan year, the Participant shall be entitled to receive only
          that proportion of the amount, if any, that he or she otherwise would
          have received under the Plan for the full calendar year which the
          number of calendar days of his or her employment during such year
          bears to the total number of calendar days in such year.

     5.   Maximum Awards Under the Plan for any Year.  No Participant shall be
     entitled to receive an award under the Plan for any year in an amount in
     excess of 75% of such Participant's base salary as in effect on January 1
     of such year; provided, however, that in no event shall "base salary" for
     such purposes be deemed to exceed such Participant's actual base salary as
     in effect on January 1, 1994 increased at the rate of 15% per year (25%
     per year in the case of a promotion), or, if such Participant is first
     employed by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries after January 1,
     1994, such Participant's actual base salary as in effect on the date of
     hire increased at the rate of 15% per year (25% per year in the case of a
     promotion).

     6.   Determination of Incentive Awards.

     a)   The Committee may authorize awards to eligible key officers based on
          the attainment by the Corporation of performance goals established by
          the Committee.  The performance goals shall be based on absolute
          levels of Income from the Core Life Insurance Businesses.  No later
          than 90 days after the commencement of each Plan year, the Committee
          shall establish the specific performance goals to be used to
          calculate awards under this Plan for such year.
  
     b)   The Committee shall not be obligated to make awards for the maximum
          amount available under Section 5 nor to make any awards at all if, in
          the sole discretion of the Committee, such awards are not appropriate
          in a given year.  Any unawarded balance of the maximum amount
          available for awards in any year shall not be carried forward or made
          available for awards in any future year.
  
     c)   No later than 90 days after the commencement of each Plan year, the
          Committee shall have absolute discretion to determine the
          Participants who are to receive awards under this Plan for such year
          and to determine the performance goals for such awards.
  
     d)   The amount determined and reported by the Corporation's independent
          auditor to the Committee as Income from the Core Life Insurance
          Businesses for a given year shall be final, conclusive and binding
          upon all parties, including the Corporation, the shareholders of the
          Corporation and the Participants,
<PAGE>4
     
          notwithstanding any subsequent special item or surplus charge or
          credit which may be considered applicable in whole or in part to such
          year; provided, however, that, if the maximum amount determined and
          reported to the Committee by the Corporation's accountants as the
          Income from the Core Life Insurance Businesses for any year shall
          later be held by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
          to have been more than the Income from the Core Life Insurance
          Businesses for such year, the amounts subsequently available for
          awards under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of any excess
          paid under the Plan as a result of the overstatement of Income from
          the Core Life Insurance Businesses.  Any such overstatement of Income
          from the Core Life Insurance Businesses and resulting excess awards
          shall be corrected exclusively by adjustment of the amounts
          subsequently available for awards and not by recourse to any person.

     7.   Method and Time of Payment of Awards.

     a)   Following the completion of each Plan year, the Committee shall
          certify the attainment of each Participant's performance goals in the
          manner required by Section 162(m) of the Code.  Awards for any year
          shall be paid in cash.
  
     b)   Subject to Section 7(c) below, awards shall be paid in full no later
          than April 30 of the year following the Plan year for which the award
          is made.
  
     c)   In the event of a Change in Control, the payment of awards for the
          Plan year in which such Change in Control occurs shall be accelerated
          and shall be made on the date on which the Change in Control occurs.
          The amount of such award shall be calculated as if all performance
          targets have been met to produce the maximum award.

     8.   Modification, Suspension or Termination.  The Board of Directors of
     the Corporation may at any time terminate or from time to time modify or
     suspend, in whole or in part, and if suspended, may reinstate, any or all
     of the provisions of this Plan.

     9.   Miscellaneous.

     a)   In the event of a change in the Corporation's fiscal year, this Plan
          shall apply, with pro rata adjustment in Income from the Core Life
          Insurance Business to be applied, for any intermediate period not
          consisting of twelve months, and shall then apply to each fiscal year
          following.
  
     b)   The Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 1994; provided, however,
          that it shall be a condition to the effectiveness of the Plan, and
          any awards hereunder, that the shareholders of the Corporation shall
          approve the adoption of the Plan at the 1994 annual shareholders'
          meeting.  If such shareholders fail
<PAGE>5

          to approve the Plan, then the Plan and any awards hereunder shall be
          null and void ab initio.  Any approval by shareholders under this
          Plan shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
          of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation present in person
          or by proxy at the meeting and voting on the proposal.

     10.  Non-Assignability and Contingent Nature of Rights.  No Participant,
     no person claiming through him or her, nor any other person shall have any
     right or interest in the Plan or its continuance, or in the payment of any
     award under the Plan, unless and until all other provisions of the Plan,
     the rules adopted thereunder, and restrictions and limitations on the
     award itself have been fully complied with.  No rights under the Plan,
     contingent or otherwise, shall be transferable, assignable or subject to
     any pledge or encumbrance of any nature.

     11.  Governing Law.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in
     accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

     12.  No Contract of Employment.  Nothing contained herein shall be
     construed as a contract of employment between the Corporation and any
     Participant, or as giving a right to any person to continue in the
     employment of the Corporation or as limiting the right of the Corporation
     to discharge any Participant at any time, with or without cause.

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan
                 (As Amended November 16, 1993)

1.   Purpose of Plan
     The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan")
     is to provide select executives of USLIFE Corporation (the
     "Corporation") and its subsidiaries with the opportunity to
     defer receipt of compensation, including a portion of annual
     base salary and incentive award payments, until a future
     date.  The Corporation has adopted this program in
     recognition of the valuable service performed by these
     executives and the desire to provide them with additional
     flexibility in their personal financial planning.

2.   Eligibility
     Senior vice presidents and above of the Corporation and
     chief executive officers of the subsidiaries of the
     Corporation are eligible to participate in the Plan.

3.   Administration of the Plan
     A.   The Plan shall be administered by the Executive
          Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of
          Directors of the Corporation (the "Administrator").
          The administrator shall have the authority in its sole
          discretion to interpret and apply the provisions of the
          Plan.

     B.   The Administrator may in its discretion delegate
          responsibility for the day to day administration and
          interpretation of the Plan to a committee composed of
          three officers of the Corporation (the "Management
          Committee") provided that any determination pertaining
          to the deferred compensation of any Management
          Committee member will be made solely by the
          Administrator.

                   Deferred Compensation Plan

4.   Election to Participate
     A.   An eligible employee who participates in the Plan (a
          "Participant") may elect that a portion of the
          compensation which would other wise be payable for
          services to be performed as an employee of the
          Corporation of any subsidiary be credited to a deferred
          compensation account subject to the terms of the Plan.
          Such election may apply to a portion of a Participant's
          annual base salary at the rate in effect at the time of
          the election, up to a maximum of 25%.  The election may
          also apply to all or a portion of a Participant's cash
          incentive award and to all or a portion of a
          Participant's book unit award.  A newly eligible
          Participant may make an election to defer compensation
          under the Plan within 30 days after becoming eligible
          to participate.  An election shall only be valid for
          the twelve month period for which it is made.

     B.   The election shall be made on a form (the "Election
          Form") signed by a Participant and filed with the
          Secretary of the Corporation.  The election shall be
          irrevocable, except as specified in Section 8.

     C.   An election to defer a portion of annual base salary
          may be made at any time with respect to the salary
          payable during the 12 months that begin on the first
          regular payroll period after the date of the filing of
          the Election Form.  Such election shall end 12 months
          after the date of such filing or on such earlier date
          as may be specified on the Election Form.

                   Deferred Compensation Plan

     D.   An election to defer all or a portion of a
          Participant's annul cash incentive award shall be made
          by December 31st with respect to an award that is
          payable during the following year.

     E.   An election to defer all or a portion of a
          Participant's book unit award shall be made by December
          31st with respect to any book unit award with a future
          December 31st valuation date that is payable in the
          year following the year in which such valuation date
          occurs.

     F.   Notwithstanding 4-C, 4-D and 4-E above, for the first
          12 months of the Plan, all employees who are eligible
          to participate in the Plan as of the effective date
          hereof shall be considered newly eligible and may make
          elections within 30 days after such effective date to
          defer the future receipt of all or part of their annual
          base salary and any cash incentive award for the then
          current year as well as all or part of any book unit
          award.

5.   Deferred Accounts
     A.   A deferred account shall be established for each
          Participant in book entry form and shall be maintained
          by the Administrator.  Credit shall be given to a
          Participant's deferred account on the same dates that
          any payments would otherwise have been made to the
          Participant currently, in accordance with the deferral
          elections indicated on the Election Form.

     B.   Balances in a Participant's deferred account shall be
          credited at the end of each quarter with an interest
          equivalent.  The interest equivalent shall be
          calculated quarterly, at a rate set by the
<PAGE>4

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan

          Administrator, and the rate shall be applied to the
          amounts accumulated in a Participant's account at the
          beginning of each quarter.

     C.   The Administrator intends to review and set the
          interest rate described in 5-B above at least annually
          in light of current economic conditions, provided that
          in the event the rate is not modified the interest
          equivalent shall continue to be calculated at the rate
          last set by the Administrator.

6.   Distribution of Deferred Compensation
     A.   Participants shall indicate on the Election Form the
          date or dates on which their deferred account balance
          shall be distributed.  A Participant may elect to
          receive amounts deferred under the Plan plus
          accumulated interest in one lump sum payment or in a
          number of approximately equal annual installments.  Any
          tax required to be withheld by any governmental
          authority shall be deducted from each distribution
          under the Plan.

     B.   A distribution election shall be made at the time a
          Participant first enrolls in the Plan.  The initial
          date of distribution shall either be the Participant's
          actual date of retirement or an earlier date, as
          specified on the Election Form.  A modification of a
          distribution election that changes the date of
          distribution to a later date or changes the lump sum or
          annual installment election shall be made no later than
          12 months before the previously selected distribution
          date by delivering a new signed

          Distribution of deferred account balances will be made
          in accordance with the latest signed Election Form on
          file with the Corporate Secretary.

     C.   Payment of deferred account balances will begin on the
          earlier of the last day of the month indicated on the
          most recently filed Election Form or on the last day of
          the month in which termination of employment or
          retirement occurs.  If a participant elects to receive
          distribution of his or her deferred account balance in
          annual installments, subsequent installments shall be
          paid in succeeding years on or about the last business
          day of the same month in which the first installment
          was paid until the entire amount credited to the
          Participant's account shall be paid in full.  All
          undistributed account balances shall continue to accrue
          interest as provided in Section 5-B until the actual
          date of distribution.

7.   Designation of Beneficiary
     Each Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries to
     receive the entire account balance deferred under the Plan
     together with accumulated interest thereon in the event of
     death.  A beneficiary designation, change or cancellation
     may be made at any time.  In the absence of any designated
     beneficiary, the entire deferred account balance shall be
     paid to the designated beneficiary under the Corporation's
     group life insurance program.

8.   A.   Each Participant shall make a determination regarding
          the distribution of his or her deferred account balance
          on the Election Form.  If a Participant continues in
          the employ of the
<PAGE>6

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan

          Corporation or terminates such employment due to
          retirement, distribution of the deferred account
          balance together with accumulated interest shall be
          made in accordance with the most recent Election Form
          on file with the Corporate Secretary.  In the event of
          any termination of a Participant's employment for
          reasons other than death, disability or retirement, the
          Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, shall have
          the right to pay the entire deferred account balance
          and accumulated interest in one lump sum to a
          Participant regardless of any specified distribution
          schedule on an Election Form.

     B.   If a Participant's employment with the Corporation
          should terminate due to death or disability before full
          payment of his or her deferred account balance and
          accumulated interest thereon, the Administrator in its
          sole discretion shall determine whether such account
          balance shall be paid in a single lump sum or in annual
          installments.  If the Administrator chooses to make a
          lump sum distribution, the lump sum shall be paid to
          the Participant's beneficiaries or the Participant on
          the last day of the month in which termination occurs.
          If the Administrator chooses to make the distribution
          in annul installments, the Administrator in its sole
          discretion shall determine the number of such
          installments and payment of the installments shall
          begin on the last day of the month in which termination
          occurs.

     C.   Distribution of deferred account balances in advance of
          the scheduled distribution date on a filed Election
          Form shall be permitted in the sole discretion of the
          Administrator but only in the event of an unanticipated
          emergency caused by circumstances
<PAGE>7

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan

          beyond the control of the Participant which would
          result in severe financial hardship to the Participant
          if such distribution were not permitted.  A penalty
          shall be deducted from such early distribution equal to
          10% of the distribution unless the Administrator in its
          sole discretion waives the penalty.  Such early
          distribution shall in no event exceed the amount
          necessary to meet the particular hardship plus the
          penalty.  A Participant who receives an early
          distribution under this Section 8-C shall not be
          permitted to participate in the Plan for a period of 12
          months after receipt of the distribution.

     D.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan,
          amounts deferred hereunder plus accumulated interest
          shall be immediately payable to each Participant, or
          his or her beneficiaries if applicable, in a single
          lump sum in the event of the occurrence of either a
          transaction which has required the affirmative vote of
          the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares
          of capital stock of the Corporation regularly entitled
          to vote in the election of directors by reason of
          ARTICLE Seventh of the Corporation's Certificate of
          Incorporation or the acquisition by person,
          partnership, corporation or other organization, or by
          any group of two or more thereof who are affiliates (as
          defined by Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933)
          or are acting in concert in respect to such
          acquisition, of more than 25% of such outstanding
          shares of capital stock if the Corporation has opposed
          an acquisition of shares of the Corporation by such
          person, partnership, corporation or other organization
          or group before any insurance regulatory authority
          whose approval of such acquisition was required.

                   Deferred Compensation Plan

9.   Rights of a Participant
     Amounts accumulated in a Participant's deferred account
     represent the Corporation's mere promise to pay such amounts
     sometime in the future.  All compensation and other amounts
     deferred under this Plan shall not be segregated from the
     general funds of the Corporation and no Participant shall
     have any claim on any specific Corporation assets.  To the
     extent that any Participant acquires a right to receive
     benefits under this Plan, the right shall be no greater than
     the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
     Corporation and is not subject to alienation, sale,
     transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or
     garnishment by creditors.  A Participant may not pledge
     benefits under the Plan; any assets related to the Plan's
     obligation to a Participant may only be paid out in the form
     chosen for the last distribution.  It is the intention of
     the Corporation that arrangements under the Plan be unfunded
     for tax purposes and for purposes of ERISA Title 1.

10.  No Implied Contract
     Neither the Plan nor the Election Form shall be construed to
     constitute an employment contact between the Corporation and
     any Participant or an agreement by the Corporation to employ
     the Participant for a specified period of time.  All
     Participants shall remain subject to discharge to the same
     extent as if the Plan had not been put into effect.

11.  Amendment and Termination
     A.   The Plan may be amended from time to time by resolution
          of the Board of Directors to comply with changes in the
          laws and regulations of any State or the Federal
          Government or any agency having supervisory or
          regulatory jurisdiction over the Corporation.  The
          amendment or invalidation of any one or more
<PAGE>9

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan

          provisions of the Plan shall not affect the remaining
          provisions of the Plan.  No amendment shall reduce any
          benefits accrued by any Participant prior to the
          effective date of the amendment.

     B.   The Board of Directors has the right in its sole
          discretion to alter the method of crediting interest to
          Participants' deferred account balances or to cease
          crediting future interest at any time.

     C.   The Board of Directors has the right in its sole
          discretion to terminate the Plan at any time.  All
          amounts accumulated under the Plan prior to the Plan's
          termination will continue to be subject to the
          provisions of the Plan.

12.  Arbitration of Disputes
     Any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out
     of or relating to this Plan or the interpretation or
     validity hereof shall be settled exclusively and finally by
     arbitration.  The arbitration shall be conducted in
     accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
     American Arbitration Association.

13.  Applicable Law
     This Plan shall be governed by and interpreted solely in
     accordance with the internal law of the State of New York
     without regard to principles of conflict of law.

14.  Administration
     Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Corporation from
     establishing a "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating
     funds to
<PAGE>10

                       USLIFE Corporation
                   Deferred Compensation Plan

     pay amounts deferred hereunder plus accumulated interest;
     provided, however, that the assets of such Rabbi Trust shall
     be available to the creditors of the Corporation if the
     Corporation is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, or
     if bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings have been initiated
     by any of the Corporation's creditors or the Corporation
     itself, or by any third party, under the Bankruptcy Act of
     the United States or the bankruptcy laws of any state,
     alleging that the Corporation is insolvent or bankrupt.  If,
     in accordance with the terms of such a Rabbi Trust, any
     funds held in such trust revert back to the Corporation,
     such reversion shall not in any manner reduce or diminish
     the obligation of the Corporation under this Plan to any
     participant.

<PAGE>1


                     USLIFE Corporation
   1993 Long-Term Incentive Award Guidelines, As Amended

The Executive Compensation and Nominating Committee of the
Board of Directors has approved new long-term award
guidelines for senior executives.  The new guidelines are
applicable to all senior vice presidents and above on Parent
Company staff and all subsidiary chief executive officers.
They are intended to encourage participants to exercise
their stock options and hold the acquired shares, thereby
creating an enhanced ownership position in USLIFE.
The following paragraphs briefly describe the principal
features of the new guidelines and illustrate the three
alternatives of stock option exercise: exercise of options
with previously acquired shares, with cash and shares, or
with cash only.

These new guidelines introduce a restricted stock component
to long-term incentive awards designed to provide an
additional incentive to exercise stock options and retain
the shares.  The number of restricted shares earned by a
participant depends on how the employee funds the option
exercise.

     Participants who pay for the option exercise using
<PAGE>2

previously acquired USLIFE shares will receive one
restricted share for every five options exercised.  They
will also receive "reload" options (if applicable) at the
current fair market value equal to the number of shares
surrendered to the company to fund the exercise.  Please
remember that shares used to exercise options must be
"mature" shares; that is, shares which the participant has
owned for at least six months.

<PAGE>3


Participants who exercise options using cash will receive
one restricted share for every three options exercised.

Share ownership is maximized to the extent cash is used to
acquire option shares.  The matching restricted stock grant
is also maximized to encourage greater investment in the
company and provide a valuable incentive to participants.

Subject to the terms of USLIFE's Restricted Stock Plan, the
restricted stock vests in three equal annual installments.
However, if any shares received upon exercise of the options
are sold before the completion of the three-year vesting
period, a proportionate amount of the unvested restricted
stock is forfeited.  If the participant is a "covered
employee" within the meaning of section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code (generally, USLIFE's Chief Executive
Officer and the other four most highly compensated executive
officers), the restricted stock (and dividends paid on the
restricted stock) will be subject to forfeiture if the
performance goals specified in USLIFE's Restricted Stock
Plan are not satisfied.

In the case of retirement, death, permanent disability,
termination without cause, or a change in control, all
restrictions on the restricted shares will lapse and the
<PAGE>4

shares will become fully vested; termination of employment
for any other reason before the end of the restriction
period will result in a forfeiture of the unvested
restricted shares.

This program and the guidelines described above are governed
by USLIFE's Restricted Stock Plan and Stock Option Plans.
Notwithstanding the participant's exercise of options in
accordance with the guidelines, the Executive Compensation
and Nominating Committee shall in each instance review and
approve all matching restricted stock grants to the
individual participant as a pre-condition to the award of
such grant or grants.  The Executive Compensation and
Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors retain the
sole discretion to administer, amend, or terminate the
program at any time.

<PAGE>1

              USLIFE CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL
            EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN
              EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 1994



     Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms
herein which are capitalized are defined in the USLIFE
Corporation Employee Savings and Investment Plan (the
"Savings Plan"), as from time to time amended and shall have
the same meaning herein as used therein.

     1.   Purpose of the Plan
          ___________________

          This Supplemental Employee Savings and Investment
          Plan (the "Plan") is intended to be an unfunded,
          non-qualified plan of deferred compensation
          covering a select group of highly compensated or
          management employees for the purpose of providing
          benefits in excess of the limitations on benefits
          under the Savings Plan resulting from the
          application of section 401(a)(17) (restricting
          compensation to $150,000 per year, as adjusted)
          and section 415 (limitation on annual
          contributions to lesser of $30,000 or 25% of
          compensation as adjusted, as well as the combined
          plan limits), of the Internal Revenue code of 1986
          as amended (the "Code") and is not intended to
          comply with the requirements of section 401(a) of
          the Code.  The Plan is also intended to provide
          any participants in the USLIFE Corporation
          Deferred Compensation Plan ("Deferred Compensation
          Plan") with the benefits they would have received
          under the Savings Plan if they had not made
          deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
          The Plan shall be administered and construed so as
          to effectuate this intent.

     2.   Administration of the Plan
          __________________________

          a)   The Plan shall be administered by the
               Executive Compensation and Nominating
               Committee of the Board of Directors of the
               Corporation (the "Committee").  The Committee
               shall have the authority in its sole
               discretion to interpret and apply the
               provisions of the Plan.  Any decision of the
               Committee with respect to questions arising
               as to the interpretation of this Plan,
               including the severability of any or all of
               the provisions thereof, shall be final,
               conclusive and binding.
  
          b)   The Committee in its discretion may delegate
               responsibility for the day-to-day
               administration of the Plan to a committee
               composed of three officers of the Corporation
               (the "Management Committee").

     
<PAGE>2

     3.   Eligibility
          ___________

          The Employees eligible to participate in the Plan
          are Participants in the Savings Plan who are (a) a
          participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan for
          management, (b) a Vice President or above of the
          Corporation or a Senior Vice President or above of
          a USLIFE Corporation subsidiary so long as the
          Employee's annual compensation for Savings Plan
          purposes at any time is projected to exceed the
          401(a)(17) earnings limitation or (c) a Vice
          President and above in the subsidiaries of USLIFE
          Corporation, so long as they are employed on or
          after January 1, 1995 and the Employee's Annual
          Compensation for Savings Plan purposes at any time
          is projected to exceed the 401(a)(17) earnings
          limitation, as adjusted from time to time.

     4.   Deferred Stock Unit Accounts
          ____________________________
          
          a)   A deferred stock unit account shall be
               established in the name of each Participant.
               The unfunded accounts of Participants are to
               be credited with a Company Contribution in an
               amount equal to 100% of the Participant's
               Basic Contribution under the Savings Plan
               times the sum of (a) the Participant's Salary
               in excess of the said 401(a)(17) earnings
               limitation, (b) any Salary deferred under the
               USLIFE Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan
               for management which otherwise would have
               been the subject of a Company Contribution
               under the Savings Plan, including any Salary
               above or below the said 401(a)(17) earnings
               limitation and (c) any other portion of
               Salary that would have been the subject of a
               Company Contribution under the Savings Plan
               but for the application of the section 415
               annual contribution limitations.  The amounts
               credited to these unfunded accounts are to be
               equated with common stock of USLIFE
               Corporation of equivalent market value as
               provided in 4(b) below.
  
          b)   The number of stock units credited will be
               calculated by dividing the dollar amount
               credited to the Participant's deferred
               compensation account at the end of each
               calendar    by the closing price per share of
               USLIFE common stock on the first trading day
               of the next succeeding calendar
               , such stock units to be computed to four
               decimal places.  Stock unit accounts shall be
               in the form of book entry accounts and no
               actual shares of stock or certificates
               therefor shall be issued or transferred to,
               or held under, the Plan.
  
          c)   Dividends declared and paid from time to time
               in respect of USLIFE 's issued and
               outstanding common stock will be credited on
               the dividend payment date as so many
               additional stock units (and any fractions of
               a
          
<PAGE>3

               unit computed to four decimal places) as
               could be purchased with such dividend
               equivalents based on the average of the high
               and low sales price of USLIFE's common stock
               reported as New York Stock Exchange-Composite
               Transactions on such dividend payment date
               or, if no trading occurs in such stock on the
               dividend payment date, on the trading day
               immediately preceding said date.  Dividend
               equivalents on fractions of a share will also
               be reinvested to create additional units.
  
          d)   In the event that the number of outstanding
               shares of USLIFE common stock shall be
               changed by reason of split-ups, combinations,
               recapitalizations, stock dividends and the
               like, the Committee shall make such
               adjustments as it deems appropriate in the
               number of units credited to the unit accounts
               of Participants hereunder.

     5.   Vesting
          _______

          A Participant will become vested in the amounts
          credited to his deferred stock unit account in
          accordance with the schedule provided in Article
          VI of the Savings Plan.  In the event of a Change
          in Control, a Participant who is then employed by
          the Company shall fully (100%) vest immediately.

     6.   Distributions
          _____________

          Only lump-sum cash distributions are to be made.
          Such distributions are to be in an amount
          equivalent to the unfunded account value upon the
          Participant's termination of employment, death,
          retirement or disability.  The amounts credited
          shall qualify in all respects for exclusion from
          the definition of the term "derivative securities"
          pursuant to Rule 16a-1(c) of the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act") with the result
          that the crediting of said amounts shall be exempt
          from the operation of the Section 16(b) short-
          swing profit restrictions under the 1934 Act.  In
          the case of the death of the Participant, the
          lump-sum cash distribution shall be made in
          accordance with the provisions applicable under
          Article VII of the Savings Plan when death occurs,
          including any beneficiary designation made under
          the Savings Plan.

     7.   Nonassignability
          ________________

          The benefits of a Participant (or his spouse or
          beneficiary as the case may be) shall not be
          transferable or assignable except by reason of the
          laws of descent and distribution.

     
<PAGE>4

     8.   Taxation
          ________

          If a Participant, his spouse or beneficiary, is
          determined to be subject to Federal income tax on
          any benefits under the Plan prior to the time such
          benefits are payable, then the entire amount of
          benefits payable to such person under this Plan
          shall be due and payable at once, in a single lump
          sum cash payment.  A benefit shall be determined
          to be subject to federal income tax upon the
          earliest of (a) a final determination by the
          United States Internal Revenue Service addressed
          to the Participant, his spouse or his beneficiary,
          as the case may be which is not appealed to the
          courts, or (b) a final determination by the United
          States Tax Court or any other Federal court
          affirming any such determination by the Internal
          Revenue Service, or (c) an opinion by counsel
          chosen by the Company addressed to the Company
          that by reason of treasury regulations, amendments
          to the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal
          Revenue Service Rulings, court decisions or other
          substantial precedents, such benefits are subject
          to Federal Income Tax prior to payment.  The
          Company shall undertake to defend, and bear the
          expense of, any tax claims described herein which
          are asserted by the Internal Revenue Service or by
          the taxing authority of any State or locality
          against any Participant, his spouse or
          beneficiary, including the expense of attorney
          fees and costs of appeal, and shall have the sole
          authority to determine whether or not to appeal
          any determination made by the State or locality,
          or by any court.  The Company agrees to reimburse
          any Participant, his spouse or beneficiary for any
          interest or penalties in respect of Federal, State
          or local tax claims hereunder upon receipt of
          documentation of the same.

     9.   Miscellaneous
          _____________

          a)   The Board of Directors of the Company
               reserves the right to modify this Plan from
               time to time, or to terminate the Plan
               entirely.  Benefits accrued under the Plan as
               of the date of any amendment or termination
               shall not be reduced.  The Plan shall
               automatically terminate simultaneously with
               the termination of the Savings Plan, in which
               case all benefits shall be paid as of the
               first day of the month coincident with or
               next following such event in a single lump
               sum cash payment.
  
          b)   Although the Plan is intended to be an
               unfunded Plan, nothing contained herein shall
               prohibit the Company from establishing a
               "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating
               funds to pay benefits under this Plan for any
               or all Participants, their spouses, or
               beneficiaries; provided, however, that the
               assets of such Rabbi Trust shall be available
               to the creditors of the Company if the
               Company is unable to pay its debts as they
               fall due, or bankruptcy or insolvency
               proceedings have been initiated by the
               Company's creditors or the
<PAGE>5
          
               Company itself, or by any third party, under
               the Bankruptcy Act of the United States or
               the bankruptcy laws of any state, alleging
               that the Company is insolvent or bankrupt.
               If, in accordance with the terms of a Rabbi
               Trust, any funds held in such trust revert
               back to the Company, such reversion shall not
               in any manner reduce or diminish the
               obligation of the Company under this Plan to
               any Participant.
          c)   Any liability of the Company to any person
               with respect to benefits payable under the
               Plan shall be based solely upon such
               contractual obligations, if any, as shall be
               created by the Plan.
  
          d)   If upon the payment of any benefits to any
               person under the Plan, the Company shall be
               required to withhold any amounts with respect
               to such payment by reason of any Federal,
               State or local tax laws, rules or
               regulations, then the Company shall be
               entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts
               from any such payments.  In any event, such
               person shall make available to the Company,
               promptly when requested by the Company,
               sufficient funds or other property to meet
               the requirements of such withholding, and the
               Company shall be entitled to take and
               authorize such steps as it may deem advisable
               in order to have the amounts required to be
               withheld made available to the Company out of
               any funds or property due or to become due to
               such person, whether under this Plan or
               otherwise.

     10.  Claims Procedure
          ________________

          The Committee shall establish a procedure for the
          resolution of disputes and dispositions of claims
          arising under the Plan.  Until modified by the
          Company, this procedure is as follows:

          Any Participant, former Participant, or any spouse
          or other beneficiary of such Participant or former
          Participant may, of he so desires, file with the
          Committee a written claim for benefits under the
          Plan.  Within sixty (60) days after the filing of
          such a claim, the Committee shall notify the
          claimant whether his claim is upheld or denied.
          The Committee may, under special circumstances,
          extend the period of time for processing a claim
          by an additional sixty (60) days.  If such an
          extension of time is required, written notice
          shall be furnished to the claimant or his duly
          authorized representative prior to the termination
          of the initial sixty (60) day period.  Such notice
          will indicate the special circumstances requiring
          an extension.  In the event the claim is denied,
          the Committee shall state in writing:

               a.   the specific reasons for the denial;

<PAGE>6

               b.   specific references to pertinent Plan
               provisions on which the denial is based;

               c.   a description of any additional material
               or information necessary for the claimant to
               perfect the claim and an explanation of why
               such material or information is necessary;
               and

               d.   an explanation of the claim review
               procedure set forth in this Section 10.

          Within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice
          that his claim has been denied, the claimant or
          his duly authorized representative may file with
          the Committee a written request for a review
          hearing and may, in conjunction therewith, submit
          written issues and comments.  The Committee shall
          then schedule, within sixty (60) days after the
          filing of such request, a full and fair hearing of
          the claim before the Committee.  The Committee
          may, under special circumstances, extend such
          period of time by an additional sixty (60) days.
          Prior to said hearing, the claimant or his
          representative shall have a reasonable opportunity
          to review a copy of the Plan and other pertinent
          documents in the possession of the Committee.  The
          Committee shall communicate their decision in
          writing to the claimant within thirty (30) days
          after the hearing.  Any claim for benefits and any
          request for a review hearing hereunder must be
          filed on forms to be furnished by the Committee
          upon a claimant's request.
     
     11.  Successors
          __________

          This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the
          benefit of any successor to the Company or its
          business as the result of merger, consolidation,
          reorganization, transfer of assets or otherwise
          and any subsequent successor thereto.  In the
          event of any such similar transaction, the
          successor to the Company or its business or any
          subsequent successor thereto shall promptly notify
          the Participants in writing of its successorship.
          In no event shall any such transaction described
          herein suspend or delay the rights of
          Participants, spouses or beneficiaries to receive
          benefits hereunder.

     12.  Choice of Law
          _____________

          This Plan shall be construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of New York except to the
          extent such laws are pre-empted by the Employee
          Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
          amended.

                              USLIFE CORPORATION
                         SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN
                        EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 1994


Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms used herein which are
capitalized are defined in the USLIFE Corporation Retirement Plan (the
"Retirement Plan"), as from time to time amended, and shall have the same
meaning herein as used therein.

     1.   Purpose of the Plan
          ___________________

          This Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Plan") is intended to be an
          unfunded, non-qualified plan of deferred compensation covering a
          select group of highly compensated or management employees for the
          purpose of providing benefits in excess of the limitations on
          benefits under the Retirement Plan resulting from the application of
          Section 401(a)(17) (restricting compensation to $150,000 per year, as
          adjusted), and Section 415 (limitation on annual benefits to $90,000
          per year as adjusted, as well as combined plan limits) of the
          Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Code") and benefits
          that would have otherwise accrued under the Retirement Plan if
          deferrals had not been made under the USLIFE Corporation Deferred
          Compensation Plan for management.  This Plan is not intended to
          comply with the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code.  The Plan
          shall be administered and construed so as to effectuate this intent.

     2.   Eligibility
          ___________

          Eligible employees include (1) each Senior Vice President and above
          of USLIFE Corporation ("Company"), and each Chief Executive Officer
          of any wholly owned subsidiary of USLIFE Corporation, (2) all those
          serving as Vice President and above of USLIFE Corporation and all
          those serving as Senior Vice President and above in the subsidiaries
          of USLIFE Corporation, so long as their earnings as defined for
          purposes of this Plan exceeds the 401(a)(17) earnings limitation, as
          adjusted from time to time, (3) all those serving as Vice President
          and above in the subsidiaries of USLIFE Corporation, so long as they
          provide an Hour of Service after November 1, 1994 and their earnings
          as defined for purposes of this Plan exceeds the 401(a)(17) earnings
          limitation, as adjusted from time to time, and (4) all Participants
          in the USLIFE Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for management,
          as well as any highly compensated or management employee of USLIFE
          Corporation who is selected by the Board of Directors of the Company.

     3.   Benefits
          ________

          The Plan shall provide a benefit to a Participant (or his spouse or
          beneficiary as the case may be) in an annual amount equal to the
          difference between the annual amount of the Participant's normal,
          early or vested retirement benefit to which he would be entitled
          under Article IV of the Retirement Plan upon his termination of
          employment if Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 were inapplicable, and
          the annual amount of such benefit at such time under Article IV of
          the Retirement Plan recognizing the effect of such Code sections.  If
          the Participant has not yet reached age 55 at such time, such offset
          shall not occur until his 55th birthday and shall at that time be
          based upon his benefit under the Retirement Plan payable at his 55th
          birthday.

          For all Participants providing an Hour of Service after December 31,
          1993, Earnings effective from and after January 1, 1992 means wages,
          as defined in section 3401(a) of the Code, and all other payments of
          compensation to an employee by the Company (in the course of the
          Company's trade or business) for which the Company is required to
          furnish the Employee a written statement under section 6041(d) and
          6051(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, more commonly known as the
          wages, tips and other compensation reported on Form W-2 (hereinafter
          "W-2 earnings") excluding therefrom (1) employee moving or relocation
          expenses, (2) any income related to the employee participation in
          USLIFE Stock Option Plans, with the exception of the value of any
          vested shares of restricted stock awarded as a result of a stock
          option exercise, and (3) any severance payments, except as
          hereinafter provided.  Earnings shall be determined before (1) any
          adjustments related to the USLIFE Flexible Advantage Program,
          including any "vacation sell" dollars, any elections of medical or
          dental options or contributions made to the USLIFE Flexible Advantage
          Accounts for health or dependent care, and (2) contributions made
          under the ESP Option of the USLIFE Corporation Employee Savings and
          Investment Plan.  Earnings shall also be increased to include any and
          all deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for management.
          In the event of a Change in Control or Attempted Change in Control,
          Earnings also includes any regular or enhanced severance paid to the
          Employee which is related to his final year of employment.  For
          Participant's providing an Hour of Service after November 1, 1994, in
          the event of a Participant's termination of employment as a result of
          the bulk sale of assets, the merger of companies, discontinuance of a
          company's operations, the sale or divestiture of a company, or the
          relocation, consolidation or elimination of functions or positions,
          Earnings also includes any regular or enhanced severance paid to the
          Employee which is related to his final year of employment.  For
          Participant's providing an Hour of Service after November 1, 1994, in
          the event of a Participant's
<PAGE>3
          
          termination of employment as a result of the bulk sale of assets, the
          merger of companies, discontinuance of a company's operations, the
          sale or divestiture of a company, or the relocation, consolidation or
          elimination of functions or positions, Final Average Earnings
          includes any regular or enhanced severance paid to the Employee in
          the final year of employment, and such year is to be included in the
          three (3) year average of Final Average Earnings even if the final
          year is not a complete calendar year, but only if its inclusion
          produces the highest average amount.

     4.   Method of Payment
          _________________

          Benefit payments shall be payable monthly (1/12 of the annual amount)
          and shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or
          next following the date of the Participant's 55th birthday or his
          termination of employment, if later.  Such monthly benefit payments
          shall continue to the Participant for his life.  In the case of those
          Participants in this Plan as of December 31, 1993, upon the
          Participant's death after payment of such benefits has commenced,
          such payments shall continue to his spouse, or beneficiary, as the
          case may be, through the month when the Participant would have
          reached his 80th birthday, or for 180 months (15 years) from the date
          that the benefits commenced to the Participant, whichever is later
          ("Guaranteed Period").  Those employees who only participate in the
          Plan after December 31, 1993 are to have all of the benefit options
          available under Article V of the Retirement Plan.  Those employees
          who participated in the Plan as of December 31, 1993 and continued to
          participate thereafter are to have the Guaranteed Period option under
          this section and all of the benefit options under Article V of the
          Retirement Plan.

     5.   Vesting
          _______

          A Participant shall be fully vested upon his being credited with ten
          Years of Service under the Retirement Plan.  Except as may be
          provided in Section 6 below, should a Participant terminate
          employment with the Company prior to being credited with at least ten
          Years of Service under the Retirement Plan, he shall forfeit all of
          his benefits under this Plan and no benefit shall thereafter be
          payable to such Participant, or to his spouse or beneficiary.

     6.   Special Rules
          _____________

          In the event of the occurrence of either (1) a transaction which has
          required the affirmative vote of holders of at least 80% of the
          outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company regularly entitled
          to vote in the election of directors by reason of Article Seven of
          the Company's
<PAGE>4
          
          Certificate of Incorporation, or (2) the acquisition by any person,
          partnership, corporation or other organization, or by any group of
          two or more thereof who are affiliates (as defined by Rule 405 under
          the Securities Act of 1933) or who are acting in concert in respect
          of such acquisition, of more than 25% of such outstanding shares of
          such capital stock, if the Company has opposed an acquisition of
          shares of the Company by such person, partnership, corporation or
          other organization or group before any insurance regulatory authority
          whose approval of such acquisition was required, then (A) the benefit
          under this Plan of each Participant who is then employed by the
          Company shall fully (100%) vest immediately, (B) for purposes of
          determining the accrued benefit to which the Participant would be
          hypothetically entitled under the Retirement Plan as per the first
          clause of Section 3 of this Plan, his Final Average Earnings, his
          Years of Credited Service and his age will be redefined to include
          earnings and service through the end of his employment contract with
          the Company then in effect, as well as any severance payments (and
          service reflected by such severance payments) to which he may be
          entitled.  In such case, the Participant's benefit under this Plan
          shall be determined as of the date of such event in accordance with
          Section 3 of the Plan (taking into account his additional deemed
          earnings, service and severance pay and service as per the foregoing
          sentence and his hypothetical age in determining any appropriate
          reduction factors) and shall commence to be paid to the Participant
          as provided in Section 4 of this Plan based upon his hypothetical
          age, or, if later, on the first day of the first month at least
          thirty (30) days after the Participant's salary is discontinued or
          reduced (whether or not the Participant has terminated employment).

     7.   Death Benefits
          ______________

          Should a Participant die before all benefit payments to him under
          this Plan have been completed, the following shall apply:

          A.   If a vested, married Participant dies before his Normal
          Retirement Date under the Retirement Plan and before his benefit
          payments under this Plan have commenced, his spouse shall be entitled
          to receive a death benefit with respect to the Participant's benefits
          under this Plan determined in the same manner, and subject to the
          same rules, as provided in Article V of the Retirement Plan without
          regard to Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415.

          B.   If a vested Participant who participated in the Plan as of
          December 31, 1993 dies after benefit payments under this Plan have
          commenced, or after he has reached his Normal Retirement Date under
          the Retirement Plan, the Participant's spouse, if at the time of his
          death the Participant was married, or the Participant's beneficiary,
          if at the time of his death he
<PAGE>5
          
          was not married, will be entitled to receive the monthly payments for
          the duration of the Guaranteed Period that were being paid to the
          Participant while he was alive.  If such spouse or other beneficiary,
          as the case may be, dies before receiving all of the monthly payments
          for the duration of the Guaranteed Period, then the remaining
          payments during such Guaranteed Period shall be paid to the estate of
          such person as a lump sum (determined using the UP 1984 Mortality
          Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rates for
          lump sum calculations as in effect on the first day of the calendar
          year in which such person dies), or the installments over the
          remaining Guaranteed Period shall continue, as the Company, in its
          discretion decides.  If any vested Participant who provided an Hour
          of Service after December 31, 1993 dies after benefit payments have
          commenced, or after he has reached his Normal Retirement Date under
          the Retirement Plan, his spouse or beneficiary, as the case may be,
          will also continue to have those benefit options provided under
          Article V of the Retirement Plan, with the benefit determined in the
          same manner, and subject to the same rules, as provided in Article V
          of the Retirement Plan without regard to Sections 401(a)(17) and 415
          of the Code.

     Except as provided in paragraph (A) or (B) above, no death benefit shall
     be payable under this Plan.

     8.   Lump Sum
          ________

          If the lump sum value of a benefit payable to a Participant, his
          spouse or beneficiary is less that $25,000 (determined using the UP
          1984 Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
          interest rates for lump sum calculations as in effect on the first
          day of the calendar year in which such benefit is to commence) the
          Company may direct that such benefit be paid as such lump sum.

     9.   Nonassignability
          ________________

          The benefits of a Participant (or his spouse or beneficiary as the
          case may be) shall not be transferable or assignable except by reason
          of the laws of descent and distribution.

     10.  Taxation
          ________

          If a Participant, his spouse or beneficiary, is determined to be
          subject to Federal income tax on any benefits under the Plan prior to
          the time such benefits are payable, then the entire amount of
          benefits payable to such person under this Plan shall be due and
          payable at once, in a single lump sum, determined using the UP 1984
          Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest
          rates for lump sum calculations as
<PAGE>6
          
          in effect on the first day of the Plan year in which such amount is
          to be paid.  A benefit shall be determined to be subject to federal
          income tax upon the earliest of (a) a final determination by the
          United States Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Participant,
          his spouse or his beneficiary, as the case may be which is not
          appealed to the courts, or (b) a final determination by the United
          States Tax Court or any other Federal court affirming any such
          determination by the Internal Revenue Service, or (c) an opinion  by
          counsel chosen by the Company addressed to the Company that by reason
          of treasury regulations, amendments to the Internal Revenue Code,
          published Internal Revenue Service Rulings, court decisions or other
          substantial precedents, such benefits are subject to Federal Income
          Tax prior to payment.  The Company shall undertake to defend, and
          bear the expense of, any tax claims described herein which are
          asserted by the Internal Revenue Service or by the taxing authority
          of any State or locality against any Participant, his spouse or
          beneficiary, including the expense of attorney fees and costs of
          appeal, and shall have the sole authority to determine whether or not
          to appeal any determination made by the Internal Revenue Service, or
          by any taxing authorities of any State or locality, or by any court.
          The Company agrees to reimburse any Participant, his spouse or
          beneficiary for any interest or penalties in respect of Federal,
          State or local tax claims hereunder upon receipt of documentation of
          the same.

     11.  Miscellaneous
          _____________

          (a)  The plan shall be administered by the Administrative Committee
          ("Committee") established under the Retirement Plan and any decision
          of said Committee with respect to questions arising as to the
          interpretation of this Plan, including the severability of any or all
          of the provisions thereof, shall be final, conclusive and binding.

          (b)  The Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to
          modify this Plan from time to time, or to terminate the Plan
          entirely.  Benefits accrued under the Plan as of the date of any
          amendment or termination shall not be reduced.  The Plan shall
          automatically terminate simultaneously with the termination of the
          Retirement Plan, in which case all benefits shall be paid as of the
          first day of the month coincident with or next following such event
          in a single lump sum (determined using the UP 1984 Mortality Table
          and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rates for lump
          sum calculations as in effect on the first day of the calendar year
          in which such event occurs).

          (c)  Although the Plan is intended to be an unfunded Plan, nothing
          contained herein shall prohibit the Company from establishing a
          "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to pay benefits
          under this
<PAGE>7
          
          Plan for any or all Participants, their spouses, or beneficiaries;
          provided, however, that the assets of such Rabbi Trust shall be
          available to the creditors of the Company if the Company is unable to
          pay its debts as they fall due, or bankruptcy or insolvency
          proceedings have been initiated by the Company's creditors or the
          Company itself, or by any third party, under the Bankruptcy Act of
          the United States or the bankruptcy laws of any state, alleging that
          the Company is insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in accordance with the
          terms of a Rabbi Trust, any funds held in such trust revert back to
          the Company, such reversion shall not in any manner reduce or
          diminish the obligation of the Company under this Plan to any
          Participant.

          (d)  Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to
          benefits payable under the Plan shall be based solely upon such
          contractual obligations, if any, as shall be created by the Plan.

          (e)  If upon the payment of any benefits to any person under the
          Plan, the Company shall be required to withhold any amounts with
          respect to such payment by reason of any Federal, State or local tax
          laws, rules or regulations, then the Company shall be entitled to
          deduct and withhold such amounts from any such payments.  In any
          event, such person shall make available to the Company, promptly when
          requested by the Company, sufficient funds or other property to meet
          the requirements of such withholding, and the Company shall be
          entitled to take and authorize such steps as it may deem advisable in
          order to have the amounts required to be withheld made available to
          the Company out of any funds or property due or to become due to such
          person, whether under this Plan or otherwise.

     12.  Claims Procedure
          ________________

          The Committee shall establish a procedure for the resolution of
          disputes and dispositions of claims arising under the Plan.  Until
          modified by the Company, this procedure is as follows:

          Any Participant, former Participant, or any spouse or other
          beneficiary of such Participant or former Participant may, if he so
          desires, file with the Committee a written claim for benefits under
          the Plan.  Within sixty (60) days after the filing of such a claim,
          the Committee shall notify the claimant whether his claim is upheld
          or denied.  The Committee may, under special circumstances, extend
          the period of time for processing a claim by an additional sixty (60)
          days.  If such an extension of time is required, written notice shall
          be furnished to the claimant or his duly authorized representative
          prior to the termination of the initial sixty (60) day period.  Such
          notice will indicate the special circumstance requiring an
<PAGE>8
          
          extension.  In the event the claim is denied, the Committee shall
          state in writing:

          a)   the specific reasons for the denial;

          b)   specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
          denial is based;

          c)   a description of any additional material or information
          necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
          why such material or information is necessary; and

          d)   an explanation of the claim review procedure set forth in this
          Section 12.

          Within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice that his claim has
          been denied, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may
          file with the Committee a written request for a review hearing and
          may, in conjunction therewith, submit written issues and comments.
          The Committee shall then schedule, within sixty (60) days after the
          filing of such request, a full and fair hearing of the claim before
          the Committee.  The Committee may, under special circumstances,
          extend such period of time by an additional sixty (60) days.  Prior
          to said hearing, the claimant or his representative shall have a
          reasonable opportunity to review a copy of the Plan and other
          pertinent documents in the possession of the Committee.  The
          Committee shall communicate their decision in writing to the claimant
          within thirty (30) days after the hearing.  Any claim for benefits
          and any request for a review hearing hereunder must be filed on forms
          to be furnished by the Committee upon a claimant's request.

     13.  Successors
          __________

          This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
          successor to the Company or its business as the result of merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or otherwise and
          any subsequent successor thereto.  In the event of any such merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or other similar
          transaction, the successor to the Company or its business or any
          subsequent successor thereto shall promptly notify the Participants
          in writing of its successorship.  In no event shall any such
          transaction described herein suspend or delay the rights of
          Participants, spouses or beneficiaries to receive benefits hereunder.
<PAGE>9


     14.  Choice of Law
          _____________

          This Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State
          of New York except to the extent such laws are pre-empted by the
          Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
