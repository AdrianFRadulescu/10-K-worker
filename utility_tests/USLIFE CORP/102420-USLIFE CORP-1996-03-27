          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial Condition

Liquidity


   The liquidity  requirements of  the Company  are met  primarily by cash flows
from operations  of the life insurance subsidiaries and accumulated funds at the
subsidiary level.   These internal sources of liquidity are complemented by such
external sources  as  available  bank  lines  of  credit  and  revolving  credit
agreements and  the ability  of the  Company  to  utilize  capital  markets  for
intermediate and long-term financing.

   Premium and  investment income  as well  as maturities  and sales of invested
assets provide  the primary  sources of  cash available  at the  life  insurance
subsidiaries, while  cash is  applied by  such subsidiaries to payment of policy
benefits and  loans, costs  of acquiring new business (principally commissions),
and operating  expenses, as  well as  purchases of  new investments.   Net  cash
provided from  operating activities  of the life insurance subsidiaries amounted
to approximately $211 million in 1995.

   Payment of  dividends from  the life  insurance subsidiaries  for application
toward liquidity  needs at  the parent  company level (including overhead costs,
interest on  indebtedness and  dividends on  preferred and  common  stocks)  may
require regulatory  approval  in  cases  where  such  dividends  exceed  certain
guidelines.  These guidelines are generally based on after-tax income and equity
capital as  reported  to  regulatory  authorities  on  the  basis  of  statutory
accounting practices  (see Note  18 of  Notes to Financial Statements) and, at a
further threshold,  may require  payment of additional taxes under provisions of
Federal income  tax law  applicable to life insurance companies.  In determining
the timing  and amount  of such  dividend payments,  management considers, among
other factors,  insurance  industry  rating  agency  criteria  which  are  based
primarily upon  the statutory  financial position  of life  insurance companies.
Historically, these self imposed criteria have been more restrictive in terms of
dividend availability than the aforementioned regulatory or tax considerations.

   Cash dividends paid by all consolidated subsidiaries to the parent company in
1995 amounted  to $42  million, including  $6.5 million  remitted by an inactive
life insurance  subsidiary  and  then  contributed  to  another  life  insurance
subsidiary in  connection with  the earlier  combination of  the two  companies'
operations.   Excluding the  latter transaction,  cash  dividends  totaling  $36
million were  received during  1995 from  USLIFE's subsidiaries  for application
toward parent  company cash  requirements, versus  $46 million  in 1994  and $61
million in 1993.  All of the aforementioned cash dividends to the parent company
came from the life insurance subsidiaries. Additionally, during 1993, securities
with market  value of  $22  million  were  transferred  from  a  life  insurance
subsidiary to  the parent  company and  subsequently contributed to another life
insurance subsidiary in connection with the combination of the two subsidiaries'
operations.

   The reduced  level of  dividends to the parent company in 1995 as compared to
1994  reflected   the  Company's  analysis  of  statutory  capital  requirements
associated with the growth of individual life insurance sales in 1995, for which
new annualized  premiums increased  21% over  the prior year, and its consequent
decision to  limit the  amount of  such dividends  in order  to  permit  capital
accumulation at  the subsidiary level.  As a result, a portion of parent company
working capital  requirements during  1995 was  financed through  a $26  million
increase in  short term  borrowings.   The  greater  amount  of  cash  dividends
received in  1993 versus the following years reflected capital made available at
the subsidiary  level  from  the  combination  of  operations  of  certain  life
insurance subsidiaries, and a portion of the 1993 dividends was applied to repay
corporate borrowings.

   Investment advisory and service fees paid by the life insurance subsidiaries,
and portfolio  investment income comprise additional sources of liquidity at the
parent company.   These  sources totalled about $13 million in each of the three
years ended  December  31,  1995.    Parent  company  cash  flows  may  also  be
complemented  by   transactions  such   as  repayment  of  advances  by  certain
subsidiaries and proceeds from investment securities sold, matured or redeemed.

<PAGE>4

   In addition  to the  liquidity factors  at the  subsidiary  level  previously
discussed, cash requirements at the parent company for interest on indebtedness,
dividends on preferred and common stocks, and overhead costs are a key factor in
the Company's  overall liquidity  situation.   On a  pre-tax basis, interest and
overhead expense  charges, less  depreciation, amortization,  and provisions for
future retirement benefits, amounted to $71 million, $65 million and $62 million
in 1995,  1994 and 1993, respectively, while dividends totalled $31 million, $29
million and  $27 million,  respectively.  The major portion of the 1995 and 1994
increases in  interest  and  overhead  came  primarily  from  interest  expense,
reflecting higher interest rates applicable to short term corporate borrowings.

   The Company's  common stock  repurchase program  is also a factor in its cash
requirements.   In October  1995, the  Board of  Directors extended this program
through November  1996 and  authorized repurchase  of up  to 1.5  million common
shares.   During 1995, 128,700 shares were repurchased by the Company at a total
cost of  $3 million under this program, for an average cost of $25.12 per share.
These purchases  were financed  primarily by  selective sales  of bonds  in  the
parent company investment portfolio.

   On a  consolidated basis,  net cash provided by operating activities amounted
to  $180  million,  $178  million  and  $98  million  in  1995,  1994  and  1993
respectively.   These reported  amounts reflect fluctuations in accounts payable
and receivable  and amounts  due to policyholders that result from random timing
differences in  securities transaction settlements, claims payments, and similar
matters.   Excluding the  impact of  these fluctuations,  net cash  provided  by
operating activities  would be  $179 million,  $166 million, and $152 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

   Cash flows  from operating activities for 1995 included $102 million from the
change in liability for future policy benefits, versus $73 million in 1994.  The
increase reflected  increased sales of term insurance as well as greater written
premiums on credit life and disability products in 1995.

   Interest credited  to policyholder account balances increased to $210 million
in 1995  versus $194  million  in  1994,  reflecting  the  aggregate  growth  in
policyholder account  balances from  $3.3 billion  at December  31, 1993 to $3.6
billion at  December 31,  1994 and  $3.8 billion  at December  31, 1995.     The
portion of  policyholder account  balances relating  to individual annuities was
virtually unchanged  at approximately $1.8 billion at both December 31, 1995 and
December 31, 1994.  The balance, relating to universal life insurance contracts,
increased approximately $190 million during 1995.

   Increases in rates of interest credited on substantially all of the Company's
deferred annuities,  initiated during  the second half of 1994 and effective for
renewing contracts  either at contract anniversary or January 1, 1995, were also
a factor  in the  increase in interest credited to policyholder account balances
for 1995 versus 1994.  As discussed under "Results of Operations," reductions in
interest rates  offered and  credited on  the Company's universal life insurance
and annuity products were implemented during 1995, continuing into 1996.

   Interest rates  credited on  universal life  and individual  deferred annuity
contracts may  be  adjusted  periodically  by  the  Company.    Subject  to  any
applicable surrender  charges, the  Company's universal  life insurance products
and individual  deferred annuities  may be  surrendered by  the holder.   A cash
surrender  value,   based  on  contractual  terms,  is  also  available  to  the
policyholder upon surrender of many of the Company's traditional individual life
insurance policies under which cash values are accumulated.  Such surrenders are
influenced  by   various  factors   including  economic   conditions,  available
alternative investment  returns, competition for investment and insurance funds,
and perceived  financial strength of the insurer.  These contracts are generally
supported by  the Company's investment portfolios, which are primarily comprised
of investment grade, publicly traded corporate bonds.

   Substantially all  of the  Company's interest  sensitive life  insurance  and
annuity contracts  provide for  imposition of a surrender charge in the event of
policy surrender  during a  specified initial  period commencing  with  contract
inception, typically  ten to fifteen years for universal life insurance and five
to seven  years for  individual annuities,  with the significance of this charge
often subject  to reduction  over the  applicable period  or  during  the  later
portion thereof.

<PAGE>5

   The Company's  investment portfolios  are continually  monitored to determine
whether the  distribution of investment maturities is considered appropriate for
expected levels  of policy surrenders.  The Company's fixed maturity investments
may be  sold prior  to maturity  as part  of the  Company's  asset  /  liability
management strategy  and are  classified as "available for sale" as discussed in
Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements.  Adjustments to the investment maturity
distribution, if  necessary, may  also be accomplished by actions concerning the
investment of  incoming funds  and/or reinvestment of the proceeds of securities
matured or  redeemed.   The Company  monitors its surrenders on a monthly basis.
Any material  deviation or  emerging trend  is traced  to the  product line  and
agency of  record, and  remedial action  is taken  where  appropriate.    If  an
acceleration of  surrenders of  these contracts  were experienced, the cash flow
requirements associated  with such  surrenders  could  conceivably  require  the
Company to  liquidate a  portion of the underlying security investments prior to
maturity,  at   then-prevailing  market   prices.    Any  additional  cash  flow
requirements would be met through the sources of liquidity described earlier.

   As of  December 31,  1995, approximately 9% of the Company's deferred annuity
contracts  and   15%  of   its  universal  life  insurance  policies,  based  on
policyholder account balances, were beyond the contractual period during which a
significant charge  could be  imposed in the event of termination.  Based on the
Company's  significant  1991  sales  of  individual  annuities  with  five  year
surrender charge  periods, with gross deposits that year totalling approximately
$500 million,  an increase  in the  proportion of  annuity contracts  beyond the
surrender charge  period is  anticipated during  1996.   The Company's  asset  /
liability management strategies have contemplated the expected surrender pattern
for these  annuities, and  based on  cash flow testing the Company believes that
its distribution  of  investments  is  appropriate  for  the  cash  requirements
associated with the expected level of surrenders.

   Net additions to deferred policy acquisition costs amounted to $67 million in
1995, versus  $45 million in 1994 and $36 million in 1993.  The 1995 increase of
approximately $22  million reflected  greater individual life insurance sales in
1995.   New  annualized  premiums  for  traditional  individual  life  insurance
products (primarily  term insurance)  increased $14  million or  26% over  1994,
while sales  of interest-sensitive life insurance products increased $10 million
or 17%.

   Current year Federal income tax payments amounted to $56 million, $55 million
and $61  million in  1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company and certain
subsidiaries also  made payments  to the  Internal Revenue  Service during  1994
amounting to  approximately $6 million, relating to settlement of prior year tax
returns.   Since the  latter payments were associated with a previously recorded
liability, this settlement had no impact on reported results of operations.

   Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $264 million, $457 million,
and $493  million in  1995, 1994  and 1993,  respectively.   The  1995  decrease
reflected a  reduced level  of individual  annuity sales  and a greater level of
surrenders on  these contracts  during 1995  as compared  to 1994, both of which
affected the increase in policyholder account balances.

   Individual annuity gross deposits decreased from $345 million in 1993 to $245
million in  1994 and  to $94  million in  1995.   The  1994  decrease  reflected
previous management  actions with  objectives including diversification of sales
mix and  production sources.   The  1995 decrease  resulted from various factors
including the  negative impact  on sales  of declining interest rates offered on
these contracts during 1995.

   Individual annuity  surrender benefits  increased to  $208  million  in  1995
versus $173  million in  1994 and  $119 million  in 1993, reflecting the greater
volume of  annuity contracts  in force and increased interest rates available to
consumers on certain alternative investments.  It should be noted that the major
portion of  these surrenders resulted in imposition of a surrender charge by the
Company as  contractually permitted  and consequently,  these surrenders did not
have an adverse impact upon consolidated results of operations for 1995.

   Reflecting the  above factors,  the increase in policyholder account balances
amounted to  $99 million in 1995 versus $269 million in 1994 and $417 million in
1993.

<PAGE>6

   The Company's  investment management policies include continual evaluation of
securities market conditions and circumstances relating to particular investment
holdings which  may result  in selection  of fixed maturity or other investments
for sale  prior to  maturity.   Securities may  also be  sold  as  part  of  the
Company's asset/liability  management strategy as indicated above in response to
changes in  interest rates,  resultant prepayment  risk,  and  similar  factors.
Valuation reserves  are maintained  for investments  with a  reduction in  value
determined to be other than temporary.

   The approximately  $438 million,  $1.1 billion, and $1.2 billion disposals of
fixed maturity  investments included in cash flows from investing activities for
1995, 1994  and 1993 included, respectively, $115 million, $209 million and $928
million (adjusted  cost) of  securities which  were called for redemption by the
respective issuers  prior to  maturity.  Fixed maturity disposals also reflected
sales of  certain  securities  as  part  of  the  Company's  asset  /  liability
management strategy  with objectives  including maintenance  of  an  appropriate
relationship of  asset yields  and maturities  to current policy liabilities, as
well as  sales of  certain non-performing  securities  for  which  reserves  had
previously been  established.   Substantially all  of the  proceeds  from  fixed
maturities sold  or redeemed  were directed  to investment  grade fixed maturity
investments.

   Purchases of  fixed maturity  investments in  1995, 1994 and 1993 amounted to
approximately  $799  million,  $1.5  billion  and  $1.8  billion,  respectively,
reflecting both  reinvestment of  the proceeds from fixed maturity disposals and
investment of  funds corresponding  to the  increases  in  policyholder  account
balances.

   Net unrealized  gains on  the  Company's  fixed  maturities  portfolio,  with
adjusted cost  of $5.6 billion at December 31, 1995, amounted to $448 million at
that date.   This  amount reflects  gross unrealized  gains of  $458 million and
gross unrealized losses of $10 million.  Also at that date, the fixed maturities
portfolio includes  defaulted securities  totalling $7  million (at fair value).
The sales  of  selected  fixed  maturity  investments  in  accordance  with  the
Company's asset  / liability  management strategies and the retention of certain
securities with  current market  value less than book value or currently in non-
performing status  are not  anticipated to  result in  a material adverse impact
upon the Company's net cash flows.

      As discussed  in Note  14 of  Notes to Financial Statements, the Company's
$296 million  consolidated investment  in mortgage loans as of December 31, 1995
is characterized  by a  broad geographical  distribution.   The Company  invests
principally in  commercial mortgages  which comprise  substantially all  of  the
total investment  in mortgages  at  December  31,  1995.    Commercial  mortgage
investments are  generally made  with a loan-to-value ratio not in excess of 75%
and emphasize  fully occupied general purpose retail, office and industrial real
estate having  broad user appeal on a diversified national basis.  Investment in
real estate  is limited  typically to  selected commercial  real estate which is
substantially  pre-leased  or  where  the  prospects  of  finding  a  user  upon
completion are unusually attractive.

   As of  December 31,  1995 and 1994, consolidated invested assets included $18
million and  $30 million book value of real estate acquired through foreclosure,
respectively.   Consolidated net  investment  income  includes  net  credits  of
approximately $1  million and  $500 thousand  in 1995  and  1994,  respectively,
relating to  such properties.   It  is the Company's general policy to determine
the estimated  net  realizable  value  of  foreclosed  real  estate  based  upon
appraisals relating  to the  underlying mortgage  loans  which  are  continually
reviewed and/or  updated by management based upon market conditions furnished by
third party  property managers  or brokers.   The  Company maintains reserves so
that these  assets are  carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value.   Based on  current evaluation of real estate properties held as a result
of foreclosure  and anticipated  continuation of the Company's policies relating
to disposal of such properties, the retention of these properties until disposal
at terms  believed to  reflect their  estimated net  realizable  values  is  not
anticipated to  result in  a  material  adverse  impact  upon  consolidated  net
investment income or the liquidity of the Company.

   Net cash  flows provided by consolidated financing activities amounted to $96
million, $270  million, and  $380 million  in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The reduced  levels of  cash flows  from financing  activities in 1995 and 1994,
versus the  respective prior year, reflect the smaller increases in policyholder
account balances as discussed above.

<PAGE>7

   Cash flows  from financing activities for 1995 reflect a $26 million increase
in notes  payable relating  to parent  company working  capital requirements  as
discussed  above.     Financing   activities  for  1994  reflect  a  refinancing
transaction in  which the  Company borrowed  $100 million,  classified as  notes
payable, under  a revolving  credit  agreement  which  provided  for  term  loan
borrowings of  up to $150 million.  The proceeds of this borrowing were utilized
to repay  $100 million  "current maturities  of long-term debt" under a previous
two-year revolving  credit facility.  Subsequently in 1994, the Company borrowed
the remaining  $50 million  available under  this agreement  and utilized  these
proceeds to  repay a similar amount of short-term variable rate bank borrowings.
The aggregate  1994 increase  of approximately  $31 million in outstanding long-
term and  short-term debt relates primarily to working capital requirements.  In
1993 refinancing  transactions, the  Company issued  a  total  of  $300  million
principal amount  of debt  securities under  shelf registration  statements  and
utilized the  proceeds to  repay $200  million long  term debt  and $100 million
short term  variable rate bank debt.  The $112 million decrease in notes payable
included in  1993 cash  flows  from  financing  activities  reflects  the  noted
refinancing of  short term variable rate bank debt as well as the application of
a portion  of dividends  received from  the life  insurance subsidiaries  by the
parent company to repay short term bank borrowings as discussed earlier.

   As of  December 31,  1995, the  Company had  lines of credit with seven banks
amounting to  $60 million,  all of which was unused.  However, at that date, the
Company had  outstanding  short-term  borrowings  with  four  banks,  negotiated
independently of  such lines  to take  advantage  of  more  favorable  available
interest rates,  in the aggregate amount of $73 million, as well as $150 million
borrowings under  a revolving  credit agreement  with The Bank of New York which
expires  in   April  1996.    The  Company  currently  anticipates,  subject  to
negotiations, that  it  will  commence  a  generally  similar  revolving  credit
agreement at  that time  for a term not to exceed three years.  The Company also
has available  a revolving  credit agreement with Chemical Bank which expires in
February 1997  and provides  short term borrowing facilities up to $100 million,
under which  no borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 1995.  The Company's
short term borrowings were utilized primarily for working capital requirements.


Capital Resources

   Long term  debt at  December 31,  1995 includes  a $150  million non-callable
issue of  6.75% Notes  due 1998  and a $150 million non-callable issue of 6.375%
Notes due  2000, both  issued in early 1993 under shelf registration statements.
The Company  has filed  an additional  shelf registration statement which, as of
December 31,  1995, permits  the issuance of up to $150 million principal amount
of debt securities subject to management's discretion as to timing and amount of
issues thereunder.   The Company's remaining long term debt at December 31, 1995
consists of  a $50  million issue  of 9.15%  Notes due  1999 which permits early
repayment at the option of the Company, commencing in June 1996.

   While it  is currently  anticipated that  the major  portion of the long term
debt will  be repaid using the net proceeds of debt and/or equity or combination
securities to  be issued at future dates, determination of the timing and amount
of such  repayments and  securities issues  will be dependent upon future market
conditions, future cash flows, and other unforeseen circumstances.

  For  the   years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively,
consolidated interest  expense amounted  to $40  million, $36  million, and  $32
million.   The 1995  increase in  interest expense  came primarily  from  higher
interest rates  applicable to  the Company's  short term  borrowings,  and  also
reflected the  $26 million  increase in  notes payable related to parent company
working capital  requirements as  previously discussed.   The 1994 increase came
primarily from higher interest rates applicable to short-term borrowings.

  Dividends paid  on the  Company's outstanding stock issues for 1995, 1994, and
1993,  respectively,     were   $31  million,  $29  million,  and  $27  million,
substantially all  relating to  common stock.   The increases in these dividends
reflected increases in common stock dividends per share from 81 cents in 1993 to
84 cents in 1994 and to 91 cents in 1995.

<PAGE>8

  As discussed  in Note  13 of  Notes to  Financial Statements,  the Company has
outstanding Standby  Letters of  Credit with  two banks  representing contingent
obligations to  fund various  trusts  established  in  connection  with  certain
employment contracts  of management  employees and retirement plans in the event
of a  Change in  Control (as  defined in  the trust  agreements), totalling  $93
million, and  the parent  company has  guaranteed  certain  obligations  of  its
subsidiaries.



Results of Operations

     1995 Compared to 1994


     For the year ended December 31, 1995, net income amounted to $105.4 million
versus $96.2 million for 1994.

     Net income  for 1995  included net capital gain transactions with an after-
tax impact  of $4.2  million, while  1994 net income included net capital losses
with an  after-tax impact  of $902 thousand.  The 1995 net capital gains reflect
disposals of several fixed maturity investments pursuant to tender offers of the
respective issuers, as well as certain redemptions as discussed under "Financial
Condition".  The 1994 net capital losses came primarily from disposal of certain
real estate investments.

     Capital gains  and losses  during 1995  reflect disposals of non-performing
securities with  adjusted cost  of approximately $26 million, as well as several
real estate  properties that  were acquired  through foreclosure, with aggregate
cost of  approximately $24 million.  Since reserves had been previously recorded
to recognize  the reduction  in value  of these investments, these disposals did
not have a material impact on current reported results.

     Excluding the capital gains and losses discussed above, consolidated after-
tax income amounted to $101.3 million for 1995 versus $97.1 million for 1994, an
increase of  $4.2 million  or 4%.   On  a similar basis, after-tax income of the
life insurance  subsidiaries increased  $7.7 million  or 6%.   Also on a similar
basis, after-tax  corporate charges  (including the  operating  results  of  the
Company's servicing  units) amounted  to $40.6  million  in  1995  versus  $37.1
million for  1994, resulting in a negative comparative impact of $3.5 million on
after-tax consolidated  results that  partially offset  the improvement  in life
insurance subsidiary results.

     The improvement in life insurance subsidiary results came primarily from an
increase in  pre-tax profits  from the individual life and annuity product line,
partially offset  by unfavorable  results from  the  employer/association  group
health insurance line.

     The negative  variance in  corporate charges  reflected increased  interest
expense at  the corporate  level.   The Company's consolidated interest expense,
which increased  to $39.7 million in 1995 from $35.6 million in 1994, relates to
borrowings at  the parent  company level  for general  corporate purposes.    As
discussed under  "Financial Condition,"  the 1995  increase in  interest expense
came primarily from higher interest rates applicable to the Company's short term
borrowings, and also reflected a $26.4 million increase in notes payable related
to parent company working capital requirements.

     Pre-tax income of the life insurance subsidiaries, excluding the previously
discussed capital  gains and  losses, was  $215.0 million  in 1995 versus $204.7
million in  1994.  The major portion of the life insurance subsidiaries' pre-tax
income is  attributed to the individual life insurance and annuity product line.
Other product  lines include  group life  and health insurance, sold principally
through employers  and associations,  and credit  life and  disability  products
which are  sold primarily  to customers of financial institutions.  A discussion
of the  Company's various  product lines,  excluding the impact of capital gains
and losses, follows.

<PAGE>9

     Individual life  and annuity pre-tax profits, including income attributable
to capital  and surplus,  amounted to  $206.1 million  for  1995  versus  $186.3
million for  1994.  The increase of $19.8 million or 11% reflected contributions
from major  sources of profit including mortality experience, investment income,
and  voluntary  policy  termination  experience  ("persistency").    Gains  from
investment income  are affected  by changes  in rates of return available to the
Company on  portfolio investments,  and adjustments  that may  be  made  by  the
Company on credited rates of interest for certain contracts, as discussed below.

     A pre-tax  profit of  approximately $900  thousand was  reported for credit
life insurance  coverages for  1995, versus  $1.1 million in 1994.  The negative
variance of  $200 thousand came primarily from somewhat less favorable mortality
experience during  the 1995 period.  Written premiums from credit life insurance
products increased  $8.0 million  or 12%  versus 1994.   It should be noted that
pre-tax profits on credit insurance products are anticipated to be realized when
currently written  premiums are  earned in future periods rather than during the
period of sale.

     Pre-tax profits  from the  Company's group life insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.8 million for 1995, versus $5.5 million for 1994, for a positive
variance   of    approximately   $300    thousand.       These   lines   include
employer/association group  life insurance, mortgage life insurance, and certain
specialty coverages.   The  positive variance  came  primarily  from  the  group
mortgage life  insurance line,  reflecting more  favorable mortality experience.
Pre-tax income  from employer/association group life insurance products amounted
to $5.1 million in 1995, approximating the $5.2 million reported in 1994.

     The Company's  group health  insurance lines of business reported a pre-tax
loss of  approximately $5 million for 1995 versus a pre-tax profit of $6 million
for 1994.   The negative variance of $11 million was primarily attributed to the
employer/association group  health insurance line, which reported a pre-tax loss
of $5.2 million for 1995 versus a pre-tax profit of $5.6 million a year ago.

     Premium revenues  on employer/association  group health  insurance products
declined from  $397 million  in 1994  to $358  million in 1995, with the decline
primarily attributed  to traditional  indemnity major  medical cases  associated
with a  shift in  market emphasis  toward managed care products.  This change in
market emphasis  resulted both  in a  reduction of  new sales  of the  Company's
indemnity major  medical products  as well as erosion of business in force, over
the past several years.

     Although a  significant portion  of the  Company's 1995 major medical sales
came from  managed  care  products,  historically  the  majority  of  its  group
insurance premium  revenues were derived from indemnity major medical coverages.
As a  result,  about  60%  of  current  employer/association  group  health  and
disability premium  in force  at year  end 1995 relates to traditional indemnity
products.

     The Company  has taken  a number  of actions  to  address  the  decline  in
revenues, including  refinement of  "ancillary" group products such as long-term
disability and  dental insurance,  with  goals  including  an  increase  in  the
proportion of  group business  from non-major  medical lines, and has introduced
new managed  care products  in several  states  (using  provider  networks  made
available through unrelated companies).

     The Company  has also initiated expense reduction measures to alleviate the
impact of  reduced group  health revenues.   Despite these measures, the revenue
decline outpaced  reductions in  overhead and  other expenses during 1995.  This
revenue shortfall,  together with  expense charges  of approximately  $1 million
related to the closing of a claims office, resulted in the reported pre-tax loss
for 1995.   The claims office closing represents the substantial completion of a
program to consolidate these offices in order to achieve future economies.

     In January,  1996, the Company announced that it would discontinue offering
its traditional indemnity major medical products, and that it would restrict its
new sales  of managed  care major  medical products to eight states where it has
significant market  presence and  an appropriate  managed care network in place.
The Company  will, however,  continue to provide full support and service to all
existing indemnity  customers regardless  of location  and will  seek to convert
cases from indemnity coverage to managed care in order to conserve the business.
As discussed  in Note  4 of  Notes to  Financial Statements,  the  Company  will
continue to monitor this business in order to determine whether future financial
statement adjustments are necessary.

<PAGE>10

     Profitability of  the Company's  group health  insurance lines is dependent
upon various  factors including  the ability  of the  Company to  match premiums
charged to  benefit costs and to maintain underwriting standards so that premium
charged is  consistent with risk assumed on an overall basis.  Market acceptance
of products currently offered and those being introduced is also a key factor in
the prospective profitability of these product lines.

     Pre-tax income  from credit disability products amounted to $6.9 million in
1995, versus  $5.2 million  in 1994,  reflecting an  increased  base  of  earned
premiums and more favorable claims experience in 1995.

     Total revenues of the life insurance subsidiaries in 1995 amounted to $1.72
billion, an  increase of  $88 million or 5% over 1994, primarily on increases of
$47 million  (or 4%)  and $27 million (or 6%) in premiums and considerations and
net investment income, respectively.

     The increase  in  premiums  and  considerations  came  primarily  from  the
individual life  insurance and  annuity product  line and  the credit  life  and
disability lines,  with declining  employer/association group  health premiums a
partial offset as previously discussed.

     Premiums and  other  considerations  from  individual  life  insurance  and
annuity products  amounted to  $487 million in 1995, compared to $434 million in
1994, with  the increase  from both  interest sensitive and traditional products
and reflecting  a larger  base of  in-force business  as well as increased sales
during 1995.

     Net premium  income on  credit life  and disability  products increased $17
million to  $149 million  in 1995, reflecting increased written premium for both
credit life  and credit  disability products.   The increased written premium is
attributed to  various factors including increased sales through bank sources of
business.

     Net investment  income of  the life  insurance subsidiaries  increased  $27
million, as noted above, reflecting a larger investment base in the 1995 period.
The pre-tax annual yield was 7.93% in 1995 versus 7.92% in 1994.

     The Company's  interest sensitive  life insurance and annuity contracts are
subject to  periodic adjustment  of credited interest rates which are determined
by management  based on  factors including  available market  interest rates and
portfolio rates of return.  Recent rate actions are discussed below.

     Total benefits  and expenses  of the  life insurance subsidiaries increased
$70 million or 5% over 1994.

     Benefits to  policyholders and  beneficiaries amounted  to $715  million in
1995, a  decrease of  $13 million  versus the $728 million reported for 1994.  A
$39 million  decrease in  employer/association group health benefits, reflecting
the decline  in volume  on that  line, was  the primary  cause  of  the  overall
decrease in  benefits.   Volume related increases in benefits on various product
lines, including  increases of  $10 million in death benefits on individual life
insurance products  and $4  million in  credit  life  and  disability  benefits,
partially offset  the impact of the decline in employer/association group health
benefits.

     Interest credited  to policyholder  account balances  increased $16 million
(or 8%)  over 1994.   This  increase reflected  the greater  volume of universal
life-type contracts  in 1995  as well  as credited  interest rate adjustments on
individual annuities  initiated in late 1994.  Recognizing the rise in available
interest rates  during the  second half of 1994, credited interest rates offered
on substantially  all of  the Company's deferred annuities were increased during
that period,  with the  amount of  increase varying  based on  type of contract.
Increases in  credited  renewal  rates  of  interest  on  these  contracts  were
effective either  at contract  anniversary or  January 1,  1995 based on type of
contract.

<PAGE>11

     Interest rates  credited  on  the  Company's  deferred  annuity  contracts,
exclusive of  first year bonuses on certain products, typically ranged from 4.5%
to 4.8%  during 1994.   Giving  effect to  the late 1994 rate actions, the rates
credited on  these contracts as of January 1, 1995 and during 1995 (on a similar
basis) typically  ranged from  4.8% to  5.5%, with  a weighted average (based on
account value)  of about  5%.  In 1995, a series of reductions in interest rates
offered on  newly issued  deferred annuity  contracts were implemented, together
with various adjustments of credited interest rates on renewing contracts.  As a
result of  actions taken  during the  fourth  quarter  of  1995,  credited  rate
reductions of 25 to 50 basis points affecting the major portion of the Company's
deferred annuities  in force  were implemented  on January  1, 1996 for calendar
year contracts and are being implemented on policy anniversary dates during 1996
for other contracts.

     Interest rates credited on the Company's universal life insurance contracts
typically ranged  from 6.0%  to 7.0%  during 1994  and during  the first half of
1995.   Reductions in  credited rates,  generally amounting  to 25 basis points,
were implemented  during the  third and  fourth quarters of 1995 with respect to
the major portion of the Company's universal life insurance policies in force as
well as  substantially all  of its  currently offered  universal life  insurance
policies.   Further credited  rate reductions  of 25  to 50  basis  points  were
implemented on January 1, 1996.  As a result of these actions, credited rates on
the Company's  universal life  insurance contracts  generally range from 5.3% to
6.8% commencing January 1, 1996.

     The prospective  impact of  these rate adjustments on reported results will
be dependent  upon various  factors including future sales and surrender levels.
Investment portfolio  yield will  also be a key factor in profitability of these
lines.

     In the  event of  future general  increases in  market interest  rates, the
market value  of certain  of  the  Company's  investments  including  its  fixed
maturity portfolio  would be  expected to  decrease, and the contribution to the
Company's earnings  from the  difference between  interest earned on investments
and interest credited on deferred annuity and universal life-type products could
be adversely  affected, depending  on the  timing and  extent of  adjustments in
credited rates  of interest on in-force business and in the investment portfolio
in response to such changes.

     An increase  in future  policy benefits  of $112  million was  recorded for
1995, versus  $79 million  for 1994,  with the  $33 million  variance  primarily
associated  with  the  increase  in  premiums  on  traditional  individual  life
insurance and credit insurance coverages.

     Aggregate commissions,  general expenses,  and insurance taxes and licenses
increased from  $262 million  in 1994  to $293 million in 1995.  The $31 million
increase reflects  approximately $7  million volume  related expenses  which are
directly associated  with premiums  from a  specialty  group  insurance  product
marketed in  conjunction with  a consumer retailer, as well as expenses of about
$1 million  from closing  of a group claims office as previously discussed.  The
remainder of  the increase  is primarily  attributed to  increased volume in the
individual life  insurance and annuity product line and greater credit insurance
written premiums.

     At December  31, 1995,  consolidated invested assets included approximately
$246 million (at fair value) of less than investment grade corporate securities,
based on ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies and insurance regulatory
authorities.   These investments represent about 3% of consolidated total assets
at that  date.   See Note  3  of  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  for  further
information.   These securities  generally involve  greater risk  of  loss  from
borrower  default   than  investment  grade  securities  because  their  issuers
typically have  higher levels of indebtedness and are more vulnerable to adverse
economic conditions  than other  issuers.   The Company's  results of operations
historically have  not reflected  a material  adverse impact from investments in
such securities.

     In March,  1995, the  Financial Accounting  Standards Board  (FASB)  issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, entitled "Accounting for the
Impairment of  Long-Lived Assets  and for  Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."
In October,  1995, FASB  issued Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, entitled "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."  As discussed in Note 1
of Notes  to Financial Statements, the implementation of these Statements during
1996 is  not anticipated  to have  a material  impact on  the Company's reported
financial position or results of operations.

     1994 Compared to 1993

     For the  year ended December 31, 1994, net income amounted to $96.2 million
versus $97.2 million for 1993.

     The  $96.2   million  net   income  for  1994  included  net  capital  loss
transactions with  an after-tax  impact of  $902 thousand,  while  1993  results
included net  capital gains  with an after-tax impact of $5.5 million.  The 1994
net  capital  losses  came  primarily  from  disposal  of  certain  real  estate
investments.   The net  capital gains  reported for 1993 reflected $54.5 million
pre-tax gains  on disposals  of fixed maturity investments, which were partially
offset by  pre-tax losses  of approximately $10.7 million on disposal of certain
real estate,  mortgage  and  joint  venture  investments  and  by  additions  to
valuation reserves  for certain  investments with  loss  exposure.    The  major
portion of  disposals of  fixed maturity  investments  during  1993  related  to
securities which  were called  for redemption by the respective issuers prior to
maturity.

     Consolidated net  income for  1993 also  includes a  gain of  $1.5  million
(after applicable  taxes) from sale of a subsidiary's home office property and a
charge of  $2.0 million  to recognize  the cumulative  impact of  the change  in
corporate Federal  income tax  rates enacted  in August 1993 as required by FASB
Statement No. 109.

     Excluding the  transactions discussed above (capital gains and losses, 1993
recognition of cumulative impact of income tax rate change, and 1993 home office
property sale), consolidated after-tax income amounted to $97.1 million for 1994
versus $92.1  million for 1993, an increase of $5.0 million or 5%.  On a similar
basis, after-tax  income of  the  life  insurance  subsidiaries  increased  $7.6
million or  6%.   The improvement  in life  insurance  subsidiary  results  came
primarily from  an increase  in pre-tax  profits from  the individual  life  and
annuity product  line, accompanied  by  alleviation  of  certain  expenses  that
negatively impacted  1993 group  health results  from "association"  business as
discussed  below.    Also  on  a  similar  basis,  after-tax  corporate  charges
(including the  operating results of USLIFE's servicing units) amounted to $37.1
million in  1994  versus  $34.5  million  for  1993,  resulting  in  a  negative
comparative impact  of $2.6  million on  after-tax consolidated results.  Higher
interest rates  applicable to  short term  corporate borrowings in 1994 were the
primary cause of this negative variance.  Corporate charges reflect, among other
factors, interest  expense associated  with  financing  of  repurchases  of  the
Company's common stock under the treasury stock repurchase program.

     Pre-tax income  of the life insurance subsidiaries, excluding capital gains
and losses  and the 1993 home office sale as discussed above, was $204.7 million
in 1994  versus $192.9 million in 1993.  The major portion of the life insurance
subsidiaries' pre-tax income is attributed to the individual  life insurance and
annuity product  line.   The indicated  pre-tax income includes a pre-tax profit
of $11.8  million attributed  to all  health insurance coverages in 1994, versus
$9.3 million  in 1993.  Employer / association group health insurance, primarily
consisting of employer-employee cases that are often written in conjunction with
group life  insurance, accounted  for approximately  84% and 87% of total health
insurance premiums  in 1994  and  1993,  respectively.    A  discussion  of  the
Company's various  product lines,  excluding the  impact of  capital  gains  and
losses and  the 1993  subsidiary home  office property sale which are previously
discussed, follows.

     Individual life  and annuity  pre-tax  profits,  on  a  similar  basis  and
including income attributable to capital and surplus, amounted to $186.3 million
in 1994 versus $177.1 million in 1993.  The increase of approximately $9 million
or 5%  reflected improved  mortality experience,  gains from  investment  income
margins, and voluntary policy termination (persistency) experience.

     A pre-tax  profit of  $1.1 million  was reported  for credit life insurance
coverages for  1994, versus  $1.3 million  for 1993, as less favorable mortality
experience in 1994 offset the impact of increased premium income.

<PAGE>13

     Pre-tax profits  from the  Company's group life insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.5 million  in 1994  versus $5.2 million in 1993.  Pre-tax income
from employer / association life insurance products increased approximately $650
thousand, from $4.6 million in 1993 to $5.2 million in 1994, reflecting improved
mortality experience  and reduced  expense levels.  A negative variance of about
$300 thousand  from the  Company's other  group life  insurance lines, including
mortgage life  insurance and  specialty coverages, partially offset the improved
employer / association group life results.

     Pre-tax profits  from the  credit disability  product line amounted to $5.2
million for  1994, versus  $5.0  million  in  1993,  reflecting  more  favorable
morbidity experience during 1994.

     Pre-tax profits from the Company's group health insurance lines of business
amounted to  $5.9 million  in 1994  versus $4.6 million in 1993.  Pre-tax income
from employer  / association  health  insurance  products  increased  from  $4.6
million in 1993 to $5.6 million in 1994.  The favorable variance of $1.0 million
came primarily  from a  decrease in  legal and  other expenses  relating  to  an
association group  health marketing  organization which had declared bankruptcy.
These expenses,  which were the major contributing factor in a $4.3 million pre-
tax loss  for 1993 ascribed to "association" products included in the employer /
association group  health line,  were subsequently mitigated.  Residual expenses
relating to  this matter  are not  expected to have a material adverse impact on
consolidated results  of operations.   The  benefit  from  mitigation  of  these
expenses was offset by the impact of a decline in premium revenues on employer /
association health  insurance products from $429 million in 1993 to $397 million
in 1994,  primarily attributed  to small  group major  medical lines.  Since the
major portion of the Company's major medical business has consisted primarily of
"indemnity" coverages,  a shift  in market  emphasis to  managed  care  products
arising from  legislation in  New York and New Jersey resulted in a reduction in
new sales  as well  as erosion  of business in force.  The Company's decision in
late 1993  to restrict  major medical sales to states where it has a significant
amount of in-force business also contributed to the decline in revenues.

     Total revenues  of the  life insurance  subsidiaries in  1994  amounted  to
$1.630 billion,  an increase  of $46.8  million or  3% over  1993, primarily  on
increases of  $43.4 million  (or 4%)  and $16.8  million (or 4%) in premiums and
considerations and  net investment income, respectively.  Other income decreased
$1.3 million  to $17.0 million in 1994, reflecting the inclusion in 1993 results
of $2.3 million income from the sale of a subsidiary's home office property.

     The increase  in  premiums  and  considerations  came  primarily  from  the
individual life  insurance and  annuity product  line and from increased written
premiums on  the Company's  credit insurance  products.   A  decrease  of  $31.0
million in  employer /  association group insurance premiums, reflecting reduced
sales and  erosion of  in-force business  on major medical products as discussed
above, was  a partial offset.  Premiums and other considerations from individual
life insurance and annuity products amounted to $434.2 million in 1994, compared
to $388.1  million in  1993, with  the increase from both interest sensitive and
traditional products  and reflecting  a larger base of in-force business as well
as increased sales of traditional life insurance products in 1994.

     Net investment  income of  the life  insurance subsidiaries increased $16.8
million, as  noted above, reflecting a larger investment base in 1994.  The pre-
tax annual  yield declined  from 8.35% in 1993 to 7.92% in 1994, as a decline in
market interest  rates resulted in redemptions of higher yielding securities out
of the  Company's investment  portfolio particularly  during 1993  and into  the
first quarter  of 1994,  and the reinvestment of proceeds from these securities,
as well as funds provided from operations, at lower available interest rates.

     The Company's  interest sensitive  life insurance and annuity contracts are
subject to  periodic adjustment  of credited interest rates which are determined
by management  based on  available market  interest rates and portfolio rates of
return.  Investment income gains represent the spread between interest earned on
the investment  portfolio and  interest credited to policyholders.  These gains,
on certain  products, benefited  during 1993  as reductions in credited rates of
interest  were  implemented  as  contractually  permitted  while  reductions  in
investment income  arising from  redemptions  by  the  respective  issuers  were
experienced over the course of the year.  These gains tended to stabilize rather
than increase  during most  of 1994 due to realization of the full impact of the
investment income  reductions associated with the earlier redemptions.  Although
available interest  rates on  securities  investments  rose  during  the  latter
portion of 1994, the impact on yields was not fully realized during that year.

<PAGE>14

     During 1993,  interest rates  credited on   the  Company's  universal  life
insurance contracts  typically ranged  from 6.5% to 7.5% at the beginning of the
year and  from 6.0%  to 7.0%  at the  end of  the year, reflecting periodic rate
decreases during  that year.  Rates were essentially unchanged on these policies
during 1994.  In 1993, interest rates credited on the Company's deferred annuity
contracts, exclusive of first year bonuses on certain products, typically ranged
from 4.5%  to 5.0%.   Credited  rates of  interest  on  the  Company's  deferred
annuities at  the beginning  of 1994,  on a similar basis, typically ranged from
4.5% to  4.8% .   Recognizing  the rise  in available  interest rates during the
second half of 1994, first year credited interest rates offered on substantially
all of  the Company's  deferred and  immediate annuity  contracts were increased
during that  period, with  the amount  of increase  varying based on the type of
contract.   Credited renewal  rates of  interest were  also increased  on  these
contracts, with  effective dates  either at  contract anniversary  or January 1,
1995 based  on type  of contract.   At  January 1,  1995, giving  effect to  the
various rate  adjustments, the rates offered on these contracts typically ranged
from 4.8% to 5.5% excluding first year bonuses.

     Total benefits  and expenses  of the  life insurance subsidiaries increased
$49.4 million or 4% over 1993.

     Benefits to  policyholders and  beneficiaries amounted to $727.9 million in
1994, versus  $737.7 million  in 1993.  The decrease came primarily from reduced
group health  insurance volume, particularly in major medical business, relating
to policy lapses and a reduced level of sales as previously discussed.

     Interest credited  to policyholder account balances increased $10.3 million
(or 6%),  reflecting the  increased volume of universal life-type and individual
annuity contracts  in 1994  with the  impact of  earlier reductions  in credited
rates of interest on certain contracts a partial offsetting factor.

     An increase  in future  policy benefits  of $79.3  million was recorded for
1994, versus  $39.8 million  for 1993, with the $39.4 million variance primarily
associated with  the increases  in premiums  on traditional  individual life and
credit insurance  coverages.   Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
amounted to  $159.7 million  in 1994  versus $151.9  million in 1993, reflecting
various factors  including the  increased volume  of individual life and annuity
business in  force during  1994.  Commissions, insurance taxes and licenses, and
general expenses  totalled $261.9  million in  1994,  approximating  the  $260.4
million recorded  in 1993,  as  volume  related  increases  in  commissions  and
expenses on  the  individual  life  and  credit  insurance  product  lines  were
essentially offset  by expense  reductions relating  to group  health  insurance
products as previously discussed.

Life Insurance

  General

     In 1995,  USLIFE's life  insurance business was conducted by four operating
life insurance  subsidiaries (the  "Life Insurance  Subsidiaries"):  The  United
States Life  Insurance Company  In The  City of New York ("United States Life"),
All American  Life Insurance  Company ("All  American Life"),  The Old Line Life
Insurance Company of America ("Old Line Life"), and USLIFE Credit Life Insurance
Company ("USLIFE Credit Life").

     The  Life   Insurance  Subsidiaries   are  all   domestic  stock  insurance
corporations with  strong regional  identifications.   United States Life is the
oldest stock  life insurance company in America, having been incorporated in New

York in February, 1850.  While authorized to do business in all fifty states and
the District  of Columbia,  its business is heavily concentrated in New York and
adjacent eastern  states.   All American  Life was  incorporated in  Illinois in
1950, and  is licensed to do business in all states, except New York, and in the
District of  Columbia.   Approximately 40%  of its  business in 1995 was derived

<PAGE>16

from the  central and southwestern regions of the United States.  Old Line Life,
incorporated in  Wisconsin in  1910, is authorized to do business in all states,
except New  York, and  in the District of Columbia; its business is concentrated
heavily in Wisconsin, California, New Jersey and the north central region of the
United States.   USLIFE  Credit Life, whose predecessors date from 1890, derives
most of  its business  from its  home state of Illinois and other midwestern and
northwestern states.


  Types of Insurance Written

     The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries offer a broad portfolio of individual life
insurance and  annuity policies.   Also, through United States Life, part of the
sales forces  of the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries offer  group life  and health
insurance policies  with particular  emphasis on  small groups.   Group life and
health insurance policies are also offered to associations.  Several of the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries also offer products designed for funding pension, profit-
sharing and  other qualified  plans.   In addition,  through USLIFE Equity Sales
Corp., equity  products are  available for  the noninsurance  portion  of  these
plans.  Credit insurance is offered principally through USLIFE Credit Life.

     Individual  life  policies  are  offered  by  all  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries,  except   USLIFE  Credit   Life,  on   a   non-participating   and
participating  basis.     Participating   insurance  is  insurance  whereby  the
policyholder is  entitled to  receive policy dividends reflecting the difference
between the  premium charged and actual experience, the premium being calculated
to provide  a margin  over the  anticipated cost  of insurance  protection.   On
December 31,  1995, 5%  of individual  life insurance in force was participating
and premiums  on participating  policies  represented  10%  of  individual  life
insurance premium  income in  1995.   See "Participating  Policies" in Note 1 of
Notes to  Financial Statements.   All  group business,  other than  credit  life
insurance, is  on a  non-participating  basis  but  approximately  12%  of  such
business is  subject to  experience ratings  under which  the  policyholder  may
receive refund credits depending on experience.  Substantially all of the credit
life insurance in force is non-participating.


  Development

     The following  tabulations set forth the classes of life insurance in force
at December 31, and the amount of new life insurance paid for and premium income
in each of the years 1991 through 1995.

</TABLE>

     Universal life insurance represents approximately 34%, 36% and 37% of total
individual life  insurance in  force  at  December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  Universal life insurance policies permit the policyholder to vary
the timing  and amount  of premium payments, within contractual limits.  Premium
payments under  these  policies  are  credited  to  the  policyholder's  account
balance, from  which amounts  are assessed  for risk and administrative charges.
These charges  are subject  to periodic  adjustment by the Company.  Interest is
credited to  the policyholder's  account balance  at rates  which are subject to
periodic adjustment by the Company.

     The remainder  of the Company's individual life insurance in force consists
primarily of whole life insurance and term insurance coverages.  These contracts
generally provide  for fixed  premium payments  and death  benefits.  Whole life
policies provide  insurance over  the entire  life of the insured, with the face
amount payable only upon the death of the insured, and typically provide for the
accumulation of  a surrender  value based  on contractual  terms  which  may  be
payable to  the policyholder  or  utilized  to  purchase  a  different  form  of
insurance in  the event  that the  policy is  terminated prior  to death  of the
insured.   Term insurance  policies provide insurance over a specified period of
time, with  the face  amount payable if the insured dies during the policy term.
Inasmuch as  term policies  generally do  not provide  for maturity  benefits or
accumulation of  significant cash surrender values, premiums per dollar of death
benefit are often initially lower than those of whole life policies.

     Profitability of  universal life  insurance is  dependent on  the Company's
ability to  earn a  spread between  the income  on investments  supporting these
contracts and  the rates  of interest  credited to  policyholders,  as  well  as
underwriting results  and actual  experience in  voluntary  policy  terminations
("persistency") and  expenses in  relation to  levels assumed in setting premium
rates.

     Profitability  of   non-interest  sensitive  life  insurance  coverages  is
dependent on  underwriting results,  the Company's  ability to  earn  investment
income in  excess of  the amounts  required for  accumulation  of  reserves  for
ultimate payment  of policy  benefits, and  actual experience in persistency and
expenses in relation to levels assumed in setting premium rates.

     The individual  annuities  that  have  been  sold  by  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries are  primarily  single  premium  deferred  annuity  contracts  that
provide fixed  interest rates  which can  be adjusted by the Company either on a
calendar year or contract anniversary basis.  Profitability of these products is
primarily dependent on the Company's ability to earn a spread between the income
on investments  supporting these contracts and the rates of interest credited to
the policyholders.   These  annuities are offered through financial institutions
as well  as general  agencies who  also offer  life insurance  products.   Total
policyholder account  balances  for  the  Company's  individual  single  premium
deferred annuities  were $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion at December
31, 1995,  1994 and  1993, respectively.   Gross  deposits  for  single  premium
annuities amounted  to $94  million, $245 million and $345 million in 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.

<PAGE>19

     The 1994  decrease in  individual annuity gross deposits reflected previous
management actions  with objectives  including diversification  of sales mix and
production sources.   The  1995 decrease resulted from various factors including
the negative  impact on  sales of  declining interest  rates  offered  on  these
contracts in 1995.

     The 1995  and 1994  increases in  face value of individual insurance issued
came primarily  from increased  term insurance  sales.   Sales of universal life
insurance and  traditional permanent  life insurance also increased in both 1995
and 1994  as compared  to the  respective preceding  year.   The face  amount of
individual life  insurance terminated,  in the aggregate, by lapse and surrender
amounted to $9.2 billion, $8.2 billion, and $7.9 billion in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.  The relative consistency of these terminations as a percentage of
beginning of  year in-force  business  reflected  a  continuation  of  favorable
persistency experience.

     Subject to  any applicable  surrender charges, the Company's universal life
insurance products  and individual  deferred annuities may be surrendered by the
holder.   A cash  surrender value, based on contractual terms, is also available
to the  policyholder  upon  surrender  of  many  of  the  Company's  traditional
individual life  insurance policies  under which  cash values  are  accumulated.
Such surrenders are influenced by various factors including economic conditions,
available  alternative   investment  returns,  competition  for  investment  and
insurance funds,  and perceived  financial  strength  of  the  insurer.    These
contracts are  generally supported  by the  investment portfolios  of  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries,  which are  primarily  comprised  of  investment  grade,
publicly traded  corporate bonds.   Substantially  all of the Company's interest
sensitive life  insurance and  annuity contracts  provide for  imposition  of  a
surrender charge  in the  event of  policy surrender  during a specified initial
period commencing  with contract  inception, typically  ten to fifteen years for
universal life  insurance and five to seven years for individual annuities, with
the significance  of this  charge often subject to reduction over the applicable
period or during the later portion thereof.  The Company monitors its surrenders
on a  monthly basis.   Any material deviation or emerging trend is traced to the
product  line  and  agency  of  record,  and  remedial  action  is  taken  where
appropriate.

     As  discussed   under  "Asset   /  Liability  Management;  Investments  and
Investment  Results,"   the  Company's  investment  portfolios  are  continually
monitored to  determine whether  the distribution  of investment  maturities  is
considered  appropriate   for  expected  cash  flows  from  policy  liabilities,
including policy surrenders.

     Credit life insurance, generally similar to decreasing term life insurance,
is issued on the lives of borrowers to cover payment of loan balances in case of
death.   Credit disability  insurance is written in conjunction with credit life
insurance and  covers the continuation of loan payments to a lender in the event
the borrower  becomes disabled.   These  products are primarily marketed through
financial institutions and automobile dealers.


<PAGE>20

     Profitability  of   these  products  is  dependent  upon  various  factors,
including actual  mortality and  morbidity experience.   Profitability  is  also
affected by  premium rate  limitations  imposed  by  regulatory  authorities  in
various states  and by  competitive factors, which may affect both premium rates
and levels  of compensation  provided by  the Company  to its  sources of credit
insurance business.

Life and Health product lines were as follows:

</TABLE>


     The major  portion of the Company's group life and health business consists
of coverages  sold through  employers to  their  employees  and  coverages  sold
through associations  to their  members.  The Company also offers group mortgage
life and  disability products  and specialty  group insurance  products that are
often marketed through financial institutions.

     Profitability of  group insurance  products is dependent on various factors
including underwriting  results and,  particularly in  the case  of employer and
association group health insurance products, the ability of the Company to match
premiums charged to increases in benefit costs through periodic rate adjustments
and to  maintain underwriting  standards so  that premium  charged is consistent
with risk  assumed on  an overall  basis.   Premiums charged  for  group  health
insurance products are subject to periodic rate adjustments by the Company which
considers, among  other factors,  trends in  the costs  of benefits  provided in
setting such rates.  Profitability is also dependent on the Company's ability to
generate sufficient  premium volume to recover expenses necessary to support the
business.

     Premium revenues  on employer/association  group health  insurance products
declined from  $429 million  in 1993 to $397 million in 1994 and to $358 million
in 1995,  with the  decline primarily  attributed to traditional indemnity major
medical cases  associated with  a shift  in market  emphasis toward managed care
products.   This change  in market  emphasis resulted both in a reduction of new
sales of  the Company's  indemnity major  medical products as well as erosion of
business in force, over the past several years.

     Although a  significant portion  of the  Company's 1995 major medical sales
came from  managed  care  products,  historically  the  majority  of  its  group
insurance premium  revenues were derived from indemnity major medical coverages.
As a  result, about  60% of  employer/association group  health  and  disability
premium in  force at  year end  1995 relates  to traditional indemnity products.
These policies  were often  sold together  with employer/association  group life
insurance.

<PAGE>21

     The Company  has taken  a number  of actions  to  address  the  decline  in
revenues, including  refinement of  "ancillary" group products such as long-term
disability and  dental insurance,  with  goals  including  an  increase  in  the
proportion of  group business  from non-major  medical lines, and has introduced
new managed  care products  in several  states  (using  provider  networks  made
available through unrelated companies).

     The Company  has also initiated expense reduction measures to alleviate the
impact of  reduced group  health revenues.   Despite these measures, the revenue
decline outpaced  reductions in  overhead and  other expenses during 1995.  This
revenue shortfall,  together with  expense charges  of approximately  $1 million
related to the closing of a claims office, resulted in the reported pre-tax loss
for 1995.   The claims office closing represents the substantial completion of a
program to consolidate these offices in order to achieve future economies.

     In January,  1996, the Company announced that it would discontinue offering
its traditional indemnity major medical products, and that it would restrict its
new sales  of managed  care major  medical products to eight states where it has
significant market  presence and  an appropriate  managed care network in place.
The Company  will, however,  continue to provide full support and service to all
existing indemnity  customers regardless  of location  and will  seek to convert
cases from indemnity coverage to managed care in order to conserve the business.
As discussed  in Note  4 of  Notes to  Financial Statements,  the  Company  will
continue to monitor this business in order to determine whether future financial
statement adjustments are necessary.

     In addition  to the  profitability factors  indicated above, future results
from the  Company's group  insurance product  lines will  be dependent on market
acceptance of  the recently  introduced managed  care and ancillary products and
the degree  to which  the above  strategies result  in premium  volume  that  is
commensurate with continuing expense levels.


  Asset / Liability Management; Investments and Investment Results


     Investments are  subject to  the direction  and control  of the  Boards  of
Directors or  Executive Committees  of each  of the  respective  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries.   Certain investments  are made  upon the recommendation of USLIFE
Realty Corporation  or USLIFE  Real Estate  Services  Corporation  (see  "Realty
Investment" below)  with respect  to real  estate and  mortgages, and  upon  the
recommendation of  the parent  company with  respect to securities, all of which
furnish such  investment  advice  to  the  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries.    All
investments must  comply with  applicable insurance  laws and regulations, which
prescribe the  nature, quality  and percentages  of various types of investments
which may  be made by insurance companies.  The major portion of funds available
for investment  in recent  years has  been  invested  in  bonds  and  redeemable
preferred stocks  ("fixed maturities"), and in short term investments, including
corporate commercial paper and money market instruments.

     The  investment  management  policies  of  the  Company  include  continual
evaluation  of  securities  market  conditions  and  circumstances  relating  to
particular investment  holdings which  may result  in sale  of fixed maturity or
other investments prior to maturity.  Securities may also be sold as part of the
Company's asset  / liability  management strategy  in  response  to  changes  in
interest rates,  resultant prepayment  risk, and similar factors.  Additionally,
the Company's  investment portfolios  are  continually  monitored  to  determine
whether the  distribution of investment maturities is considered appropriate for
expected cash  flows, including  surrenders,  relating  to  policy  liabilities.
These cash  flows are  sensitive to various factors including available interest
rates.   Securities may  be sold  prior to  maturity in  order to  rebalance the
distribution of  investment maturities based on this evaluation of expected cash
flows.     Consequently,  the  Company's  entire  portfolio  of  fixed  maturity
investments has  been classified  as "available  for sale."   Adjustments to the
investment maturity  distribution, if  necessary, may  also be  accomplished  by
actions concerning  the investment  of incoming funds and/or reinvestment of the
proceeds of securities matured or redeemed.  The adjusted cost and fair value of
the Company's  debt security investments, by contractual maturity, are set forth
in Note 3 of Notes to Financial Statements.

<PAGE>22

     The fixed  maturities portfolios  of the  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries  at
December 31,  1995 were  predominantly comprised  of investment grade securities
(based  on   ratings  assigned  by  recognized  rating  agencies  and  insurance
regulatory authorities).   At  December 31,  1995, invested  assets of  the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  included approximately  $230 million  (adjusted cost) of
less than  investment grade  fixed maturity  securities, based on these ratings.
The latter investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $232 million
as of  December 31,  1995 and based on fair value, represent approximately 3% of
total assets  of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at that date.  These securities
generally involve  greater risk  of loss  from borrower  default than investment
grade  securities   because  their  issuers  typically  have  higher  levels  of
indebtedness and  are more  vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than other
issuers.    The  results  of  operations  of  the  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries
historically have not reflected a material adverse impact from retention of such
securities.   Certain bonds,  representing less than one half of 1% of the total
fixed maturities  portfolio for  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries, have defaulted
in interest.   Quality  ratings of  the fixed  maturities portfolio  of the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  at December  31, 1995  with  respect  to  each  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners  (NAIC)  credit  classification  are  as

     The mortgage  portfolio of  the Life Insurance Subsidiaries at December 31,
1995 had  an aggregate  principal  amount  of  approximately  $300  million  and
consisted of  approximately 300  loans.  The mortgage portfolio is characterized
by a  broad geographical distribution, with approximately 6% of total book value
at December  31, 1995  relating to  the New England region of the United States,
17% from the middle-Atlantic states, 21% from the north-central states, 17% from
the south-Atlantic  states, 12%  from the  south-central states,  13%  from  the
mountain states,  and 14%  from the  Pacific  states.    Based  on  book  value,
approximately 36%  of these  mortgage loans  at that  date are secured by office
buildings, 24%  by industrial  /  warehouse  properties,  29%  retail,  and  the
remainder secured  by apartments, one to four family residential, hotel / motel,
medically oriented,  or other  specialty properties.   At December 31, 1995, the
average principal  balance of  mortgage loans  contained in the portfolio was $1
million, with  a weighted  average yield  of 10.3%  on principal  balance.   The
average maturity  was approximately  6 years.   The largest principal balance of
any single  mortgage loan  at that  date was  $10 million.   The Company regards
delinquent mortgage  loans to  be those  on which  interest due is unpaid for 60
days or  more or  the loan  is in  foreclosure.   The book  value of  delinquent
mortgage loans  amounted to  approximately 1.8%  and 2.9%  of the  mortgage loan
portfolio at  December 31,  1995 and  1994, respectively.   On December 31, 1995
property held as a result of foreclosure of loans amounted to $18 million.


     The Company's management of the investment portfolios of the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries includes  identification and  evaluation of holdings which are non-
performing or  have otherwise  indicated performance  which could imperil future
investment income  or  recovery  of  invested  amounts.    A  valuation  reserve
(established  through   income  statement   charges)  is  maintained  for  those
investments where a reduction of value is determined to be other than temporary.

<PAGE>23

     In 1993,  net additions to the valuation reserve for securities investments
(on a  pre-tax basis)  amounted to $8 million, and $25 million was added to such
reserves  relating   to  real  estate,  mortgage  loans,  and  other  long  term
investments.   In 1994,  net additions  to the  valuation reserve for securities
investments were  $3 million,  and a  total of  $6 million was released from the
reserves for  real estate,  mortgage loans and other investments due to disposal
of certain investments for which reserves were previously established.  In 1995,
$8 million  was released  from the  reserve for securities, and $24 million from
the reserve  for real  estate, mortgage  loans, and other investments, also as a
result  of   disposal  of   investments  for   which  reserves  were  previously
established.      Total  pre-tax  portfolio  reserves  for  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries amounted to $89 million at December 31, 1995.  The Company believes
that adequate reserves for losses have been established.

     The following  table shows  the investment  results of  the Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries for the periods indicated.

     (1) Does  not include  adjustments for  net unrealized  gains and losses on
securities.   See Notes  1 and  3 of  Notes to  Financial Statements for further
information.

     (2) Net  investment income  is after  deduction of  investment expenses but
before realized capital gains or losses and federal income taxes.

     (3) Calculated  on the  basis of  a  formula  prescribed  by  the  National
Association of  Insurance Commissioners  which computes  the yield  on the  mean
asset values during the year.


     The decrease in net yield on cash and invested assets from 8.35% in 1993 to
7.92% in  1994 reflected  a decline  in market  interest rates  that resulted in
calls of  higher yielding  securities out of the investment portfolio, primarily
in 1993,  and reinvestment  of proceeds  from these  securities as well as funds
provided from operations at lower available interest rates.

     The Company's  liability for  policyholder account  balances, amounting  to
$3.8 billion  and $3.6  billion at  December 31,  1995 and  1994,  respectively,
relates to  interest sensitive  life insurance  and annuity  contracts that  are
subject to  periodic adjustment  of credited  interest  rates  by  the  Company.
Credited interest rates for these products are determined by management based on
factors including available market interest rates and portfolio rates of return,
and accordingly  are sensitive  to changes  in  interest  rates  earned  on  the
Company's investments  and generally  follow the  pattern of  yields  on  assets
supporting the  related liabilities.   Credited  rates  of  interest  for  these
products are  discussed in  Management's Discussion  and Analysis of "Results of
Operations"  herein.     Traditional  contracts  (such  as  permanent  and  term
insurance) are not subject to credited interest rate adjustments.

     As discussed  under "Regulation"  herein, the  Life Insurance  Subsidiaries
have complied  for statement  years 1995,  1994 and  1993 with valuation actuary
testing requirements,  promulgated by  the NAIC,  which apply specified rules to
assess the  impact of  various interest rate scenarios on the adequacy of assets
to meet  policyholder liabilities.   These tests did not disclose any failure of
the Company's  assets to support its policy liabilities under the NAIC specified
testing scenarios.

<PAGE>24

  Reserves and Reinsurance

     In accordance with applicable law, the Life Insurance Subsidiaries have set
up and  carry actuarial  reserves to  meet their  obligations on  their  various
policies.   These reserves  are amounts  which,  together  with  additions  from
premiums to  be received  and interest  on such  reserves compounded annually at
certain assumed  rates, are  calculated  to  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries'  policy obligations  as they mature.   The liability for
policy benefits  relating to  cash values  of  interest  sensitive  products  is
accumulated based  on credited  rates of  interest which are subject to periodic
adjustment.   The statutory  reserves of  the Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries  are
certified by  internal actuaries as permitted by state insurance departments and
are not  specifically examined  by independent  actuaries.   The Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries generally  reinsure risks  over $1.5  million as  well as  selected
risks of lesser amounts.  See Note 15 of Notes to Financial Statements.


  Employees and Agents

     At December  31, 1995,  the Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  had approximately
1,500 regular  employees at their home and regional offices, and individual life
insurance policies  were  sold  principally  through  approximately  550  active
general agencies  located throughout  the United  States.   As discussed  below,
services are  also furnished to the Life Insurance Subsidiaries by the Company's
Realty Investment,  Securities Investment,  and Corporate Services subsidiaries,
and by USLIFE Corporation.

     With few exceptions, the general agents and producers of the Life Insurance
Subsidiaries are  independent contractors  and are  compensated on  a commission
basis within  limitations set  by applicable  insurance laws.   Service fees and
expense reimbursement  allowances are  paid to  general agents,  also within the
limitations of  applicable insurance laws.  A large percentage of producers also
sell for other companies.


  Home Offices

     United States  Life leases  a portion of a building at 125 Maiden Lane, New
York, New York 10038 which houses its principal executive offices as well as the
principal executive  offices of  USLIFE, USLIFE Equity Sales Corporation, USLIFE
Realty Corporation,  USLIFE Advisers,  Inc. and  an  office  of  USLIFE  Systems
Corporation.   The leases  for space  occupied by  United States  Life and other
USLIFE companies  expire in  2006.   Present  annual  base  rent  for  all  such
companies is  $1.7 million,  subject to  adjustment, tax and escalation clauses.
The lease  provides for two consecutive five year renewal options, based on fair
rental value  at the  time of renewal.  The group insurance operations of United
States Life,  certain other  clerical and  administrative  units  which  provide
support services for that company and certain other Life Insurance Subsidiaries,
and several corporate units are located in a building at 3600 Route 66, Neptune,
New Jersey  07754.   This building is rented under a lease expiring in 2003 with
renewal options for two additional five year terms and a further option relating
to rental  of additional office space.  The annual base rent under this lease is
approximately $2.3 million, subject to adjustment, tax and escalation clauses.

     In addition,  subsidiaries of  USLIFE own  or lease  other properties which
house insurance  and  related  service  operations.    Management  believes  its
facilities are adequate for present needs in all material respects.  See Note 12
of Notes to Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company's
lease commitments.


  Regulation

     The Life  Insurance Subsidiaries  are subject to regulation and supervision
by the  supervisory agency of each state or other jurisdiction in which they are
licensed to  do business.   These supervisory agencies have broad administrative
powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business,
the licensing  of agents, the approval of policy forms, premium levels, the form
and content  of mandatory  financial statements  (see "Basis of Presentation" in
Note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements), capital, surplus, reserve requirements
and the  types of  investments which  may be  made.  The National Association of
Insurance Commissioners  ("NAIC") has  recommended certain  regulatory reporting
requirements for  insurance companies,  including "valuation actuary" and "risk-

<PAGE>25

based capital"  requirements.   Under the  valuation  actuary  requirement,  the
company must  provide an actuary's certification of the adequacy of reserves for
future liabilities,  taking account  of the  assets  that  support  them,  under
various possible  economic scenarios.   As  indicated under  "Asset /  Liability
Management; Investments and Investment Results," the Life Insurance Subsidiaries
have satisfactorily  complied with  these requirements for statement years 1995,
1994 and  1993.   The risk-based  capital requirements, effective with statement
year 1993,  require the  company to demonstrate that capital and surplus meet or
exceed formula-driven  standards based  on exposure  to specific  categories  of
risk.   Companies that do not meet a standard of at least a 200% ratio of "Total
Adjusted Capital"  to "Authorized  Control Level Risk-Based Capital," as defined
by regulatory  authorities, are  identified as  candidates for various levels of
regulatory action,  ranging  from  increased  surveillance  to  state  insurance
department  control.    At  December  31,  1995,  each  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries had  a risk-based  capital ratio (as defined) of 400% or more, thus
exceeding the  required  ratio.    The  Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries  have  not
experienced and  do not  anticipate an  adverse impact  on their operations as a
consequence of  the valuation  actuary and  risk-based capital requirements.  As
specified by  the NAIC,  Insurance Regulatory Information System ("IRIS") ratios
of certain  key statutory  data are computed for the Life Insurance Subsidiaries
on an  annual basis.  These ratios revealed no material exceptions for statement
year 1995.   The Life Insurance Subsidiaries may be required, under the solvency
or guaranty  laws of  the various  states in  which they  are licensed,  to  pay
assessments up  to prescribed  limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities
of insolvent  insurance companies.  The Life Insurance Subsidiaries are required
to file  detailed reports  with each  supervisory agency,  and their  books  and
records are  subject to  examination by  each.  In accordance with the insurance
codes in  the states  in which they are domiciled and the rules and practices of
the  National   Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners,  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries are  examined periodically by examiners of the states in which they
are domiciled  and by  representatives (on  an "association" or "zone" basis) of
the other  states in  which they  are licensed  to do business.  All of the Life
Insurance Subsidiaries have been examined at least as of December 31, 1990.

     Annual  financial   statements  prepared   in  accordance   with  statutory
accounting practices  for each  of the  Company's Life  Insurance  Subsidiaries,
filed with  insurance  departments  in  the  states  where  the  Company's  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  are domiciled  or licensed  to do  business, require the
inclusion of  an interest  maintenance reserve  ("IMR") and  an asset  valuation
reserve ("AVR"),  according to  regulations  prescribed  by  the  NAIC.    These
regulations apply  to all  invested assets and require that investment gains and
losses resulting  from changes in interest rates be distinguished from gains and
losses resulting  from changes  in  creditworthiness.    The  IMR  captures  all
investment gains  and losses  resulting  from  changes  in  interest  rates  and
provides for  subsequent amortization  of such amounts into statutory net income
on a  basis reflecting the remaining lives of the assets sold.  The AVR captures
investment gains  and losses  related to  changes  in  creditworthiness  and  is
adjusted each year based on a formula related to the quality and loss experience
of the  Company's investment  portfolio.  The AVR requires reserves for mortgage
loans, other  invested assets  and  short-term  investments  as  well  as  fixed
maturity and  equity security  investments.   The AVR  and IMR  are not recorded
under generally  accepted accounting  principles and consequently have no impact
on reported  financial position  or results  of operations  of the Company.  The
Company has  not experienced  any significant  adverse  impact  on  its  overall
operations as a result of these regulatory accounting requirements and, based on
the current  composition of  the investment  portfolios of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries, the  Company does  not currently  anticipate  significant  adverse
impact.

     Most states  have enacted legislation or adopted administrative regulations
covering such  matters as  the acquisition of control of insurance companies and
transactions between  insurance companies and the persons controlling them.  The
National  Association   of  Insurance   Commissioners  has   recommended   model
legislation on  these subjects  which has been adopted, with variations, by many
states.  The nature and extent of the legislation and administrative regulations
now in  effect vary  from state  to state,  and  in  most  states  they  require
administrative approval  of the  acquisition of  control of an insurance company
incorporated in  the state,  whether by  tender offer,  exchange of  securities,
merger or  otherwise, and  require the  filing of detailed information regarding
the acquiring  parties and  the plan  of acquisition.   Every  insurance company
which is authorized to do business in the state and is a member of an "insurance
holding company  system," other  than a  company incorporated  in another  state
subject to  substantially similar  disclosure  requirements  and  standards,  is
generally required to register as such with the insurance regulatory authorities
and file  periodic reports  concerning  its  relationships  with  the  insurance
holding  company  and  other  affiliates  of  the  holding  company.    Material
transactions between  registered insurance  companies and members of the holding
company system  are required  to be  "fair and reasonable" and in some cases are

<PAGE>26

subject to  administrative approval, and the books, accounts and records of each
party are required to be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
precise nature  and details  of the  transactions.   Notice to  or  approval  by
regulatory authorities  is frequently  required for  dividends paid by insurance
companies, and their surplus following any dividend is required to be reasonable
in relation  to outstanding  liabilities and  adequate for financial needs.  See
Note 18  of Notes  to Financial  Statements for  further  information  regarding
dividends.  Broad examination and enforcement powers are conferred on regulatory
authorities.  Each of the Life Insurance Subsidiaries is required to register as
a member  of an  insurance holding company system with the insurance supervisory
authorities in  at least  one state.   USLIFE does not presently anticipate that
legislation and regulation such as that described above will materially restrict
its activities.

     Acquired  Immune  Deficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS),  which  has  received  wide
publicity because  of its  serious public  health implications, presents special
concerns to  the life  insurance industry.   Morbidity  and mortality  risks are
accepted  by   insurers  based   on  methods   of  classification   designed  to
appropriately relate  premiums charged  to such  risks and,  in this connection,
steps have  been taken  toward  strengthening  the  Company's  underwriting  and
selection process.    The  Company's  own  mortality  and  morbidity  experience
reflects no  significant adverse  impact as a result of any acceleration of AIDS
claims.   The Company  is continuing  to monitor  developments in  this area but
cannot predict  the long  term impact  of this  problem on  the  life  insurance
industry generally or on the Company.


  Competition

     The insurance  business is  highly competitive, and there are approximately
1,800 stock  and mutual  companies some  of  which  are  larger  than  the  Life
Insurance Subsidiaries  (individually and  in the  aggregate).    Although  most
insurance companies are stock companies, mutual companies account for nearly 40%
of the  life insurance  in force  in the  United States  and hold a still larger
percentage of the admitted assets.  The Life Insurance Subsidiaries believe that
their premium  rates and  policies are generally competitive with those of other
life insurance companies.

     If the  aggregate volume  of insurance  in  force  of  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries were  considered to be that of one company, such company would have
ranked 19th among the companies listed in surveys contained in the June 26, 1995
edition of  the National  Underwriter, Life  and Health  Insurance Edition.   In
addition to  competition among  life insurance  companies,  the  Life  Insurance
Subsidiaries also compete increasingly with other financial institutions such as
commercial banks  and securities brokerage organizations.  Competition from such
financial institutions as well as other insurance companies is considered by the
Life Insurance  Subsidiaries in determining the rates of return to be offered on
interest  sensitive   products.     See  discussion  under  "Asset  /  Liability
Management; Investments and Investment Results."

remain the responsibility of the individual Life Insurance Subsidiaries.  USLIFE
Real Estate  Services Corporation  also provides  services relating  to mortgage
portfolios of  non-affiliated companies amounting to approximately $5 million at

Securities Investment

  USLIFE Advisers, Inc.

     USLIFE Advisers,  Inc. ("Advisers"),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of USLIFE,
was incorporated  in October  1972 to be the adviser to USLIFE Income Fund, Inc.

primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current income to its
shareholders.   Income Fund made a public offering of its securities in December
1972 and  had net  assets of  approximately $58  million at  December 31,  1995.
Advisers' services  to Income  Fund are  furnished under  an investment advisory
contract which, as required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, provides that
its continuance  is subject to specific approval at least annually by a majority
of the  directors of  Income Fund, including a majority of its directors who are
not parties  to such  agreement or  interested persons  of any such party, or by
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Income
Fund, and  to termination by either party on 60 days' notice.  In 1995, Advisers

Item 2.  Properties.

     Descriptions of  properties of USLIFE and its subsidiaries are set forth in
Item 1.


Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.


     As previously reported, in November 1981, the Company filed a third amended
complaint against  Louis Wilcox  and other former officers of USLIFE Savings and
Loan Association,  a former  subsidiary of  the  Company,  for  indemnification,
injunctive relief  and accounting  (USLIFE Savings and Loan Association v. Louis
Wilcox, et  al., Superior  Court of  the State  of California  for the County of
Riverside).   In April  1984, defendant  Louis M. Wilcox filed a cross complaint
against the  Company seeking  general damages of $1 million, punitive damages of
$10 million  and special  damages.   In 1986,  Wilcox's  causes  of  action  for
malicious prosecution  and abuse  of process  were dismissed.   On  appeal,  the
dismissal of  the cause  of action  for malicious prosecution was reversed while
the dismissal  of the  abuse of  process claim  was upheld.    Pursuant  to  the
Company's request,  the case was bifurcated for trial.  In July, 1993, the trial
court, after  hearing evidence  on the  issue, without  a jury, decided that the
Company had  probable cause  to sue Wilcox in 1981.  That ruling was dispositive
of the  claim for  malicious prosecution and, thus, the Court dismissed Wilcox's
only remaining claim against the Company.  A judgment in the Company's favor was
entered in  late 1993.  Wilcox has appealed and the appeal is still pending.  No
contingent loss has been accrued for this litigation because the amount of loss,
if any,  cannot be  reasonably estimated,  nor is  it probable in the opinion of
management that  the ultimate  outcome of  this  litigation  will  result  in  a
liability to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

     As previously reported in the Company's Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 30, 1995, on November 17, 1994, a purported class action (Smith,
et al.  v. USLIFE Credit Life Insurance Company, et al.) was filed against three
subsidiaries of the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of  Illinois.   The Complaint alleges that in connection with purchases
by plaintiffs  of single  premium term  life insurance  from mortgage lenders in
connection with  second mortgage  loans, defendants  misrepresented the  type of
insurance offered  as credit  life insurance and sold the term life insurance at
premiums in  excess of those permitted for credit life insurance.  The Complaint
further alleges  that upon  prepayment of  mortgage  loans  plaintiffs  did  not
receive refunds  of unearned  premiums, which  they would  have been entitled to
receive had they purchased credit life insurance.  On July 27, 1995, the parties
filed a  Stipulation of  Dismissal of  plaintiffs' claims  against USLIFE Credit
Life Insurance  Company and  Security of America Life Insurance Company, leaving
the matter  pending against  only All  American Life  Insurance  Company.    The
parties have  agreed to  a settlement  of all claims asserted and the settlement
was given tentative approval by the Court on December 20, 1995.  Under the terms
of the  Settlement Agreement,  class members  will be notified of their right to
file claims  for partial  premium refunds.   The  settlement would  resolve  all
claims against  the Company's subsidiaries in this lawsuit as well as the claims
asserted by  plaintiffs in two cases previously reported in the Company's Report
on Form  10-Q for  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  1995,  which  have  been
terminated without prejudice (Hoban v. USLIFE Credit Life Insurance Company, All
American Life  Insurance Company and Security of America Life Insurance Company,
and Grant,  et al.  v. USLIFE  Credit Life  Insurance Company  and  Security  of
America Life  Insurance Company).   A  list of  potential class members is being
compiled and  a status  hearing is scheduled.  In the opinion of management, the
ultimate resolution  of  this  action  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the
Settlement Agreement  will not  result in a material additional liability on the
part of the Company.

     As previously  reported, on August 28, 1995, a purported class action (John
G. Robinson & Company, et al. v. The Old Line Life Insurance Company of America)
was filed  in the  District Court  of Tarrant  County, Texas.   On September 29,
1995, the  case was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern
District of  Texas.   The Complaint  alleges that defendant, a subsidiary of the
Company, violated  the federal  Telephone Consumer  Protection Act  ("TCPA")  by
sending unsolicited facsimiles of advertisements.  Plaintiff also asserts claims
for negligence,  gross negligence, trespass to chattels and invasion of privacy.
The Complaint  contains claims  for damages  in the amount of $500 for each such
unsolicited facsimile  (allowed under  the TCPA)  or alternatively,  plaintiffs'

<PAGE>29

actual  monetary   loss;  plaintiffs  have  also  sued  for  treble  damages  or
alternatively, punitive  damages.  Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss based
on application  of the  McCarran-Ferguson Act,  a Motion  to Dismiss plaintiff's
class action  allegations based  on procedural  defects and a Motion for Partial
Judgment on  the Pleadings.   These  Motions are  currently pending  before  the
Court.   No contingent  loss has  been accrued  for this  litigation because the
amount of loss, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

     As previously  reported, on  March 16, 1995, a purported class action (Dana
Galloway v. USLIFE Credit Life Insurance Company) was filed in the Circuit Court
of Fayette  County, Alabama.  The complaint alleges that defendant, a subsidiary
of the  Company, issued insurance contracts in an amount sufficient to cover the
gross amount  of indebtedness,  rather than  the  net  amount  of  indebtedness,
contrary to  Alabama law.   The complaint contains claims of fraud and breach of
contract based  on allegations  that  defendant  misrepresented  the  amount  of
insurance needed  (based on  a recent  ruling in  a similar  case by the Alabama
Supreme Court  in  McCullar  v.  Universal  Underwriters  ).    Plaintiffs  seek
compensatory and  punitive  damages.    Defendant  contends  that  its  sale  of
insurance covering  the gross  amount of  indebtedness was  done in  reliance on
regulations promulgated  by the Insurance Department of the State of Alabama and
is aggressively  defending the  case.   No contingent  loss has been accrued for
this litigation  because the  amount of  loss,  if  any,  cannot  be  reasonably
estimated.

     In addition  to the  aforementioned legal  proceedings, the Company and its
subsidiaries are  parties to various routine legal proceedings incidental to the
conduct of  their business.   Based  on currently  available information, in the
opinion of  management, it is not probable that the ultimate resolution of these
suits will result in a material liability on the part of the Company.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933
may  be  permitted  to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons  of  the
registrant pursuant  to the  foregoing provisions,  or otherwise, the registrant
has been  advised that  in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of 1933  and is,  therefore, unenforceable.   In  the event  that  a  claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant of  expenses incurred  or paid  by a director, officer or controlling
person of  the registrant  in the  successful defense  of any  action,  suit  or
proceeding) is  asserted by  such director,  officer or  controlling  person  in
connection with  the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to  a  court  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  the  question  whether  such
indemnification by  it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
                                        

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
  USLIFE Corporation:

     We have  audited the  accompanying consolidated  balance sheets  of  USLIFE
Corporation and  subsidiaries as  of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related
statements of  consolidated income,  equity capital,  and cash flows for each of
the years  in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995.  These consolidated
financial statements  are the  responsibility of  the Company's management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits  in accordance  with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting principles  used and  significant  estimates  made  by
management, as  well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our  opinion, the  consolidated financial  statements referred  to above
present fairly,  in all  material respects,  the financial  position  of  USLIFE
Corporation and  subsidiaries at  December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of
their operations  and their  cash flows  for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

     As discussed  in Note  1 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the
Company changed  its method of accounting for debt and equity securities in 1994
to adopt  the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement
of Financial  Accounting Standards  No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities."

report to  insurance regulatory authorities (see Note 18).  All subsidiaries are
wholly owned.   All  material intercompany  accounts and  transactions have been
eliminated.


Use of Estimates

     The preparation  of financial  statements in  accordance with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities and  disclosure of  contingent assets and liabilities at
the date  of the  financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during  the reporting  period.   Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


Changes in Accounting Principles

     Effective January  1, 1995,  the Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards No. 114 ("SFAS 114"), entitled "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of  a Loan,"  as modified  by SFAS  118, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of  a Loan  - Income  Recognition and Disclosures."  These Statements
require a  writedown, as  defined by  SFAS 114,  for certain  mortgage loans and
similar investments  where impairment  results in  a change  in repayment terms.
The adoption of these Statements did not have a material impact on the Company's
reported financial position or results of operations.

     Effective January  1, 1994,  the Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards  No. 115  ("SFAS 115"),  entitled "Accounting  for  Certain
Investments in  Debt and  Equity Securities."    SFAS  115  requires  that  debt
securities which may be sold as part of the Company's asset/liability management
strategy be  classified as "available for sale" and carried at fair value in the
Consolidated Balance  Sheets, commencing  with  the  date  of  adoption  of  the
Statement.   The Company's  portfolio of  debt  securities  had  been  similarly
classified as  "available for  sale" prior  to the adoption of SFAS 115, but was
carried at  lower of  aggregate adjusted cost or fair value pursuant to previous
accounting standards.   Since  the aggregate  fair  value  of  these  securities
exceeded their  adjusted cost  at December  31, 1993, this classification had no
impact on  Equity Capital  at  that  date.    The  Company's  equity  securities
portfolio had  been carried at fair value in accordance with previous accounting
standards prior  to the adoption of SFAS 115 and continues to be carried at fair
value as required by the Statement.

     As required  by SFAS  115, the net impact of the initial adjustment to fair
value of  these securities,  less corresponding  adjustments to  deferred policy
acquisition costs  (required where  fair value  differs from  cost  for  certain
securities), certain  policyholder liabilities,  and deferred  income taxes, was
recorded  through   a  direct  credit  to  "Net  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on
securities" included in Equity Capital as follows:

                                                                   (Amounts in
                                                                    Thousands)

Impact of adoption of SFAS 115:

  Unrealized gain on debt securities at January 1, 1994.........    $380,343
  Less:
    Adjustment of deferred policy acquisition costs.............      99,889
    Increase in certain policyholder liabilities................      16,706

                                                                    ________

  Adjustment to Equity Capital before federal income tax........     263,748
  Adjustment of deferred federal income tax liability...........     (92,312)
                                                                    ________

  Net adjustment to Equity Capital at January 1, 1994...........    $171,436
                                                                    ========



     SFAS 115  requires that  unrealized gains  and losses on available-for-sale
securities, other  than those  relating to a reduction in value determined to be
other than  temporary, be  recorded  as  direct  charges  and  credits  to  "Net
unrealized  gains   (losses)  on   securities"  included   in  Equity   Capital.
Consequently, the  recognition of  these unrealized  gains and losses (including
the  required   adjustments  of   deferred  policy  acquisition  costs,  certain
policyholder liabilities,  and deferred  income taxes)  has  no  impact  on  net
income.

     Under both  SFAS 115  and previous accounting standards, valuation reserves
(established through  income statement  charges) are maintained as an adjustment
to cost  for investments,  including "available  for sale"  securities,  with  a
reduction in  value determined  to be  other than  temporary.  The cost and fair
value of the Company's investments in securities are presented in Note 3.

     Also in  1994,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.   112,  ("SFAS   112")  entitled   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits."    SFAS  112  requires  advance  recognition  of  non-
retirement benefits such as severance pay and health insurance continuation when
certain conditions  are met.   The  adoption of SFAS 112 did not have a material
impact on  the Company's  reported financial position  or results of operations.
Financial statements  of previous  years were  not restated  as a  result of the
adoption of SFAS 112.



Split of Common Stock

     In July  1995, the  Board of  Directors of USLIFE Corporation approved a 3-
for-2 split  of its  common stock, $1.00 par value.  As a result of this action,
one additional  share of  USLIFE common  stock was  distributed on September 22,
1995 for  each two  shares held  by shareholders of record on September 1, 1995.
The par  value of  the common stock was not changed, and the aggregate par value
of $19.2  million for  the additional shares issued was transferred from Paid-in
Surplus to  Common Stock  as of  the effective  date of  the transaction.    All
references in  the financial  statements herein  to number  of common shares and
related prices,  per-share amounts,  and stock  plan data  have been restated as
appropriate to reflect the 3-for-2 split of the Company's common stock.


Future Accounting Changes


     In March  1995, the  Financial Accounting  Standards Board  ("FASB") issued
Statement of  Financial Accounting  Standards No.  121, entitled "Accounting for
the Impairment  of Long-Lived  Assets and  for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed
Of."   The Statement  requires that  long-lived  assets  such  as  property  and
equipment, and certain intangible assets, be reviewed for impairment when events
or changes  in circumstances  indicate that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be
recoverable.   When recoverability  standards specified in the Statement are not
met, a  writedown of the covered assets may be required.  The Statement does not
apply to various classes of assets including the Company's investment securities
and deferred policy acquisition costs, which will continue to be evaluated based
on previously established accounting standards.  The adoption of this Statement,
in the  first quarter  of 1996, will not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

<PAGE>54

     In October  1995, FASB  issued Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123,  entitled "Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation."  This Statement,
which must  be adopted  no later than 1996, establishes financial accounting and
reporting standards  for stock  option plans  and  other  stock-based  forms  of
compensation.   Under previously established accounting standards, stock options
such as  those granted  by the  Company (with  option price  set equal to market
price at  date of  grant) do  not require income statement charges, although the
outstanding options are considered in earnings per share calculations.  FASB 123
introduces standards  for computing  "fair value" of these stock options using a
mathematical model,  as well  as expense charges over the related service period
based on this calculated value.  However, companies can elect to report the pro-
forma impact of these computed charges on net income and earnings per share in a
footnote rather  than actually  recording the computed income statement charges.
USLIFE Corporation  will adopt  Statement No. 123 in 1996 and intends to provide
footnote disclosure  of the  pro-forma impact  of the  calculated  stock  option
expense  charges,  commencing  with  its  year  end  1996  financial  statements
(indicating comparative  data for 1995), rather than record these charges in its
income statement.


Investments

     The Company's  investment management  policies include continual monitoring
and evaluation of securities market conditions and circumstances relating to its
investment holdings  which may  result in  the selection of investments for sale
prior to  maturity.   Securities may  also be  sold as  part  of  the  Company's
asset/liability management  strategy in  response to  changes in interest rates,
resultant prepayment  risk, and  similar factors.   Accordingly,  the  Company's
entire fixed  maturity portfolio  (bonds and  redeemable  preferred  stocks)  is
classified  as   "available  for  sale"  and  is  carried  in  the  accompanying
consolidated balance  sheets at  fair value.   The Company's investments in non-
redeemable preferred  stocks and common stocks ("equity securities") are carried
at fair  value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Fair values for
fixed maturities  and equity  securities are  based on  quoted market  prices or
dealer quotes.

     Mortgage loans  are carried  at the aggregate of unpaid principal balances,
net of  unamortized discount  and applicable  reserves and writedowns.  Mortgage
loans are  considered impaired  when it  is determined  to be  probable that the
Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
agreement, and  are evaluated  based on  present value  of estimated future cash
flows discounted  at the  contractual rate of the loan.  Mortgage loans that are
more than  60 days  delinquent or  in foreclosure  are carried  at the  lower of
amortized cost or estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral.

     Real estate  is carried  at the  lower of depreciated cost or estimated net
realizable value.   Depreciation  is calculated  on a  straight line  basis with
useful lives varying based on the type of building.

     Policy loans  are stated  at the  aggregate of  unpaid principal  balances.
Other long  term investments  are stated at the lower of cost or their estimated
net realizable  value.   Short term  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which
approximates fair value.

     Realized gains  and losses  are included  in net  income based  on specific
identification of investments disposed.

     Valuation reserves  (established through income statement charges which are
included in  realized gains  and losses) are maintained as an adjustment to cost
for investments,  including "available for sale" securities, with a reduction in
value determined to be other than temporary.


<PAGE>55

     Unrealized gains  and losses  on available-for-sale  securities, other than
those relating  to a  reduction in  value determined to be other than temporary,
are recorded through direct charges and credits to Equity Capital.


Life Insurance


  Traditional Individual Contracts; Group and Credit Insurance

     The Company's  traditional individual  life insurance  products,  including
term insurance, whole life insurance, and immediate annuities, generally provide
fixed premiums  and guaranteed benefits.  Premiums on these policies, as well as
group and  credit life  and health insurance contracts, are recognized when due.
Appropriate provisions are made for future policy benefits or unearned premiums.
Policy claims are charged to expense when incurred.

     Liabilities  for  future  policy  benefits  relating  to  traditional  life
insurance policies  have been  computed by the net level premium method based on
estimated  future   investment  yield,  mortality  and  termination  experience.
Interest rate  assumptions for  most non-interest  sensitive life insurance have
ranged from  2-1/2 to  3-1/2 percent on issues of 1959 and prior, to 5-1/2 to 6-
3/4 percent  on issues  of 1967 and subsequent years.  (On certain products, the
rate  ranges  as  high  as  8-3/4  percent.)    Mortality  has  been  calculated
principally on  an experience  multiple applied to select and ultimate tables in
common usage  in the  industry.   Estimated terminations  have  been  determined
principally based on industry tables.


Universal Life-Type and Investment Contracts

     Universal life  insurance policies  permit the  policyholder  to  vary  the
timing and  amount of premium payments, within contractual limits.  Revenues for
universal  life   insurance,  other   interest-sensitive  life   insurance,  and
investment contracts  include policy  charges for  administration  and  cost  of
insurance, and  surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances
during the  period.   These charges  are subject  to periodic  adjustment by the
Company.   Premiums received  on these  products  are  treated  as  policyholder
deposits rather  than revenues.  The liability for policyholder account balances
represents the accumulated amounts which accrue to the benefit of policyholders,
and  reflects   interest  credited  at  rates  which  are  subject  to  periodic
adjustment.  Charges to expense relating to these policies and contracts include
such interest  credited as  well as  benefits during  the period  in  excess  of
related policy account balances.


  Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

     The costs  of acquiring  new business (principally commissions) and certain
costs of  issuing policies (such as medical examinations and inspection reports)
and certain  agency and  marketing expenses,  all of  which vary  with  and  are
primarily related to the production of new business, have been deferred.

     For most policies other than universal life-type contracts, these costs are
being amortized  over the  premium-paying periods  of the  related  policies  in
proportion to  the ratio  of the annual premium revenue to the total anticipated
premium revenue.   Anticipated  premium revenue  was estimated  using  the  same
assumptions  which  were  used  for  computing  liabilities  for  future  policy
benefits.

     For universal life-type contracts, these costs are being amortized over the
lives of  the policies  in relation  to the  incidence of  gross profits arising
principally from  investment, mortality  and expense  margins.  Additionally, as
required by  SFAS 115,  the carrying  amount of  these costs is adjusted at each
balance sheet date as if the unrealized gains or losses on securities associated
with these contracts had been realized and included in the gross profits used to
determine required amortization.

<PAGE>56

     Deferred policy  acquisition  costs  are  reviewed  at  least  annually  to
determine that the unamortized portion of such costs does not exceed recoverable
amounts, after considering anticipated investment income.


Participating Policies

     Participating  policies  subject  to  profit  limitations  approximate  4.9
percent of  the individual  life insurance in force at December 31, 1995 and 9.5
percent of  individual life  insurance premium  income in  1995.  The portion of
earnings therefrom that inures to the benefit of the participating policyholders
is  not   available  to   shareholders.     Undistributed  earnings  payable  to
participating policyholders  are included  as a  liability in  the  Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

     All participating  policies approximate 5.0 percent of the total individual
life insurance  in force at December 31, 1995 and 9.7 percent of individual life
insurance premium income in 1995.  The provisions for dividends to policyholders
in the  statements of  consolidated income  include dividends paid or payable on
participating policies.


Liability for Unpaid Claims

     The liability  for unpaid  claims and claim adjustment expenses is based on
the estimated  amount payable on claims reported prior to the balance sheet date
which have not yet been settled, claims reported subsequent to the balance sheet
date which  have been  incurred during  the period  then ended,  and an estimate
(based on  prior experience)  of incurred but unreported claims relating to such
period.


Liability for Guaranty Fund Assessments

     The Company's  life insurance  subsidiaries  may  be  required,  under  the
solvency or  guaranty laws  of the various states in which they are licensed, to
pay  assessments  up  to  prescribed  limits  to  fund  policyholder  losses  or
liabilities of  insolvent insurance  companies.   Certain  states  permit  these
assessments, or  a portion  thereof, to  be recovered  as an  offset  to  future
premium taxes.  Assessments are recognized based on notification of liability by
regulatory authorities,  including provision for certain future amounts payable,
and, when  subject to  credit against  future premium  taxes and  judged  to  be
recoverable, may  be capitalized  and amortized  on a  basis consistent with the
credits to be realized under applicable state law.


Reinsurance

     Amounts paid for or recoverable under reinsurance contracts are included in
total assets  as reinsurance  receivable or  recoverable amounts.   The  cost of
reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of
the underlying  reinsured policies  using assumptions consistent with those used
to account for the underlying policies.


Other Assets

     Included  in   other  assets   is  the  unamortized  portion  of  goodwill,
representing the  excess of  cost over  the value  of  net  assets  acquired  in
subsidiary acquisitions  accounted for by the purchase method.  Such amounts are
being amortized by straight-line basis charges to income over forty year periods
which began at the respective dates of acquisition of the acquired subsidiaries.
Amortization of  goodwill amounted  to approximately  $2 million for each of the
three years ended December 31, 1995.


<PAGE>57

Income Taxes

     Deferred income  taxes arise  as a result of applying enacted statutory tax
rates to  the temporary  differences between  the financial  statement  carrying
value and  the tax  basis of  assets and  liabilities.   Such differences result
primarily from  amounts capitalized  for policy acquisition costs and calculated
for future policy benefit liabilities.

     The Company  and its  subsidiaries file  a consolidated  Federal income tax
return and  have elected  to include  the life  insurance and non-life insurance
subsidiaries in the consolidated tax return.  Taxes on income for life insurance
and non-life  insurance subsidiaries  are  recorded  in  the  individual  income
accounts of  the subsidiaries  and are  remitted to  the Company  on a  separate
return basis.   The provision for taxes in the Statements of Consolidated Income
represents the tax for all companies on a consolidated return basis.


Income Per Share

     Income per  share was  computed by dividing the income applicable to common
and common equivalent shares by the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares  outstanding during each year.  The weighted average number of
common and  common equivalent  shares was determined by using the average number
of common  shares outstanding  during each  year, net  of reacquired  (treasury)
shares from  the date  of acquisition;  by converting the shares of the Series A
and Series  B  Preferred  Stock  to  their  equivalent  common  shares,  and  by
calculating the  number of  shares issuable  on exercise  of those  common stock
options with  exercise prices  lower than  the market price of the common stock,
reduced by the number of shares assumed to have been purchased with the proceeds
from the exercise of the options.  Fully diluted income per share is the same as
income per share data indicated.


Standby and Permanent Financing Commitments

     In the  ordinary  course  of  investment  operations,  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries may,  in return  for commitment  fees, extend  standby  commitments
which represent  contingent obligations  to replace  certain borrowings  in  the
event of  default by  unaffiliated borrowers.  The life  insurance  subsidiaries
historically have  not provided permanent financing on the major portion of such
commitments.    The  life  insurance  subsidiaries  also  may  extend  permanent
financing commitments  for investments in mortgage loans, with specified closing
dates typically  within 90  to 120  days after  approval and  interest rates and
other terms  (based on  the credit policies utilized for investments in mortgage
loans) determined  at the  commitment date.   There  were no outstanding standby
commitments or material permanent financing commitments at December 31, 1995.


Note 2.  Nature of Operations and Segment Information


     USLIFE  Corporation   is  a  life  insurance-based  holding  company  whose
principal subsidiaries  engage in  the life insurance business.  USLIFE operates
nationwide through four life insurance companies and offers a broad portfolio of
individual life  insurance and  annuity policies  as well  as group  and  credit
insurance.   The individual  life  and  annuity  product  line,  which  includes
universal life,  term life, whole life, and deferred annuity products as well as
income attributed  to capital  and surplus,  accounts for  the major  portion of
USLIFE's pre-tax  income and total revenues.  These individual products are sold
primarily  through  independent  general  agencies  who  are  compensated  on  a
commission basis  and usually  sell products  of other  companies in addition to
those of  USLIFE.   Other product lines include group life and health insurance,
sold principally  through  employers  and  associations,  and  credit  life  and
disability  products   which  are  sold  primarily  to  customers  of  financial
institutions through USLIFE's credit insurance group.

</TABLE>

     The balance  of deferred  policy acquisition costs for employer/association
group health  insurance includes  amounts deferred with respect to the Company's
traditional indemnity major medical coverages.  As a result of a shift in market
emphasis toward  managed care  products and  consequent decline in revenues from
indemnity products,  the Company initiated strategies to increase the proportion
of group  business from non-major medical lines, and introduced new managed care
products in  several states  (using provider  networks  made  available  through
unrelated companies).

     Although a  significant portion  of the  Company's 1995 major medical sales
came from  managed  care  products,  historically  the  majority  of  its  group
insurance premium  revenues were derived from indemnity major medical coverages.
As a  result,  about  60%  of  current  employer/association  group  health  and
disability premium  in force  relates to traditional indemnity products.   These
policies  were   often  sold   together  with  employer/association  group  life
insurance.  Recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs for the employer
/ association  lines has been evaluated based on estimates of future persistency
and claims experience by aggregating related product groups.

     In January  1996, the  Company announced that it would discontinue offering
its traditional indemnity major medical products, and that it would restrict its
new sales  of managed  care major  medical products to eight states where it has
significant market  presence and  an appropriate  managed care network in place.
The Company  will, however,  continue to provide full support and service to all
existing indemnity  customers regardless  of location  and will  seek to convert
cases from indemnity coverage to managed care in order to conserve the business.
The Company will continue to monitor this business in order to determine whether
future financial statement adjustments are necessary.

Note 5.  Notes Payable

     Notes payable at December 31, 1995 includes $150 million borrowings under a
revolving credit  agreement between  the Company  and The  Bank of  New York (as
agent) which expires in April 1996, at which time all borrowings thereunder must
mature.   The credit agreement provides for term borrowings in segments of up to
six months with interest indexed to the LIBOR borrowing rate or based on certain
alternative interest  rates at the option of the Company.  USLIFE has the option
to prepay  amounts borrowed under the credit agreement, in whole or in part, and
to reborrow loans thereunder provided the total amount of outstanding borrowings
does not exceed $150 million.

     Also included  in this item are short term borrowings against bank lines of
credit or  pursuant to certain bank revolving credit agreements, and other short
term bank  borrowings.   The Company has lines of credit of $60.0 million with 7
banks and  a revolving  short term bank credit agreement which provide term loan
borrowing facilities  up to  a maximum  of $100  million.   The lines  of credit
provide for  annual review and renewal at the option of each bank.  The interest
rates and  terms of  loans under  the lines  of credit  and the revolving credit
agreements are  determined bilaterally on the date of borrowing.  Although there
are no  formal requirements  to maintain  compensating balances, the Company has
carried balances which generally approximate 5 to 10 percent of the lines.

     The following  table sets  forth summary  information with respect to short
term borrowings of the Company for the three years ended December 31, 1995.

</TABLE>

     The Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation  Act of  1993, enacted  in August  1993,
increased the Federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactively to
January 1,  1993.  This rate increase resulted in additional tax expense for the
first half  of 1993  amounting to  $666 thousand, and the effect of the tax rate
change upon  net deferred  tax liabilities as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards  No. 109  ("SFAS 109")  was $1.322  million.  In accordance
with SFAS  109, the  $1.988 million aggregate catch-up impact of the rate change
was included in Federal income tax expense for 1993.

     The significant  components of  deferred income  tax expense  for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are as follows:

     Federal income  tax returns  have been  examined and  settled for all years
through 1988.  The Company believes that its recorded income tax liabilities are
adequate for all open years.

     Under the  provisions  of  prior  tax  law  applicable  to  life  insurance
companies, one  half of  the excess  of the  gain  from  operations  of  a  life
insurance company  over its  taxable investment income was not taxed but was set
aside in  a special  "Policyholders' Surplus  Account".  Under provisions of the
Tax Reform  Act of 1984, this account is "frozen" as of December 31, 1983 and is
subject  to   tax  under  conditions  set  forth  pursuant  to  prior  tax  law.
Policyholder Surplus  may be  taxable at  the time  of its  distribution to  the
company's shareholders or under certain other specified conditions.  The Company
does not believe that any significant portion of the amount in this account will
be taxed in the foreseeable future.  However, should the balance at December 31,
1995 become  taxable, the  tax computed  at present rates would be approximately
$47.8 million.

     At  December   31,  1995,  the  Company  has  nonlife  net  operating  loss
carryforwards for  Federal income  tax purposes  of approximately  $74.7 million
which are  available to  offset future  Federal taxable  income, if any, through
2010.

Note 9.  Retirement Plans

     The Company  and its  subsidiaries have a qualified noncontributory defined
benefit pension  plan  covering  substantially  all  employees.    Benefits  are
generally based on years of service, the employee's compensation during the last
three years of employment, and an average of Social Security covered wage bases.
It is  the Company's  policy to  fund  pension  costs  in  accordance  with  the
requirements of  the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Based on
such standards,   contributions amounting to $4.2 million, $4.5 million and $4.5
million were  made for  the years  ended  December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.   Substantially all of the Plan assets are invested in the general
investment account  of a  life insurance  subsidiary of  the Company  through  a
deposit administration  insurance contract.   As  a result  of compensation  and
benefit limitations  under Federal tax law applicable to the Company's qualified
defined benefit  pension plan,  the "excess" portion of the pension benefits for
certain employees is provided under an unfunded Supplemental Retirement Plan for
which eligibility requirements and certain other provisions were modified during
1993.   Additionally, the  Company has  an unfunded  Retirement Plan for Outside
Directors which  provides pension  benefits to  non-employee Directors of USLIFE
Corporation subject  to specified  eligibility requirements.  Benefits are based
on years of service and the annual retainer at time of retirement.

     Pension expense  for all  of the  above pension  plans amounted  to  $7.724
million, $7.848 million and $5.212 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The net  periodic pension  cost for  these plans in 1995, 1994 and 1993 included

an additional  minimum pension  liability is  required for  the  Company's  non-
qualified plans  to reflect  the excess  of the  accumulated benefit obligations
over  the  liability  already  recognized  as  unfunded  accrued  pension  cost.
Statement No.  87 also  permits offsetting  of this liability with an intangible
asset, based  on provisions  of the  Statement.   The unrecognized  net loss and
unrecognized prior  service cost  relating to  the Company's  pension plans  are
subject to  amortization on  a straight-line  basis over  the estimated  average
future service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the
plan.   Assumptions used in the actuarial computations for the Company's pension
plans were as follows:

     In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company and its subsidiaries
provide certain  health care  and life  insurance benefits  to retired employees
under a  defined benefit plan.  Employees may become eligible for these benefits
if they  have accumulated  ten years  of  service  and  reach  normal  or  early
retirement age  while working  for the  Company.   The  plan  provides  benefits
supplemental to Medicare after retirees are eligible for Medicare benefits.  The


<PAGE>73

postretirement benefit  plan contains  cost-sharing features such as deductibles
and coinsurance,  and contributions  of certain  retirees are  subject to annual
adjustment.   It is  the Company's  current policy to fund these benefits, which
are provided  through an  insurance contract with a life insurance subsidiary of
the Company, on a "pay as you go" basis.

     During 1993,  the Company's  non-pension postretirement benefit program was
modified in  several respects,  including the  establishment of a maximum dollar
cap on  amounts to  be paid  by the  Company for future increases in the cost of
retiree health  benefits.   These plan  amendments resulted  in an  unrecognized
reduction in  prior service  cost, which  is being  amortized over the remaining
average  service   period  to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.   Excess gains  or losses  are being  amortized over  the  average
remaining service  period  to  full  eligibility  for  benefits  of  the  active
participants.

     The funded  status of  the non-pension postretirement benefit program as of
December 31,  1995 and 1994 is reconciled to accrued postretirement benefit cost
as follows:

     For measurement  purposes, a 10 percent annual rate of increase in the per-
capita cost  of covered  health benefits  (ie., health care cost trend rate) was
assumed for 1995; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 6 percent by the
year 1997  and remain  at that  level thereafter.   A  9 percent  annual rate of
increase in  claims reimbursed  by Medicare for retirees over age 65 was assumed
for 1995;  the rate  was assumed  to decrease gradually to 6 percent by the year
1997 and  remain at  that level  thereafter.  The assumed health care cost trend
rate does  not have  a significant  effect on the amounts reported in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 ("Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions") due to the maximum dollar cap
adopted.   For example,  increasing the  assumed health care cost trend rates by
one percentage  point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation  as of  December 31,  1995 by approximately $185 thousand and
the aggregate  of the  service and interest cost components of 1995 net periodic
postretirement benefit  cost by  $12  thousand.    The  discount  rate  used  in
determining the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation  was  7.0%  at
December 31, 1995, 8.25% at December 31, 1994 and 7.5% at December 31, 1993.

share (each share of Series A Stock valued at $100), subject to adjustment under
a formula  intended to  protect against dilution in certain events.  Holders are
entitled to  vote together  with the  Common  Stock  and  Series  B  Convertible
Preferred Stock as one class on the basis of one vote per share and to vote as a
class upon  the election  of two  directors during  any  period  in  which  four
quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) are in default.

     The $5.00 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ($1.00 par value; authorized
and issued  as of  December 31,  1995, 1,852  shares; December  31, 1994,  2,003
shares; December  31, 1993,  2,050 shares) is carried at involuntary liquidating
value of  $50 per  share in  the financial statements; is entitled to cumulative
annual dividends  of $5.00 per share; may be redeemed in whole or in part at the
option of  the Company  at $100  per share;  and is convertible at any time into
Common Stock  at a  conversion price  which at  December 31,  1995 was $8.34 per
share (each share of Series B Stock valued at $100), subject to adjustment under
a formula intended to protect against dilution in certain events.  Voting rights
are the same as those of holders of Series A Stock.

     The Preferred  Stock, undesignated  ($1.00  par  value;  authorized  as  of
December  31,   1995,  10,793,668   shares,  issued  none),  may  be  issued  by
authorization  of   the  Board   of  Directors   without  further   approval  of
shareholders.   The Board  has broad  powers to  fix the  terms of  such  issues
subject to  the limit  that the  aggregate of  all amounts  which may be paid to
holders  of   all  of  the  series  of  Preferred  Stock  upon  the  involuntary
liquidation, dissolution  or winding  up of the Company cannot exceed $100 times
the number of such shares plus accrued unpaid dividends.


      Common Stock

     The outstanding  shares  of  Common  Stock  (par  value  $1.00  per  share;
authorized, as  of December  31, 1995, 1994 and 1993: 60,000,000 shares; issued,
including treasury  shares, as of December 31, 1995, 57,468,882 shares; December
31, 1994,  57,465,735 shares; December 31, 1993, 57,463,235 shares) entitle each
holder to  one vote  per share  in the  election of  directors and  on all other
matters  submitted  to  a  vote  of  shareholders  and  to  such  dividends  and
distributions as  may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available.   At December  31, 1995,  75,965 shares of Common Stock were reserved
for issuance  upon conversion of Preferred Stock.  The Company sponsors, through
certain of  its life  insurance subsidiaries, savings plans for selected general
agents and  producers (the  "Agents Plans") providing for distribution of Common
shares to  participants if  specified qualification and vesting requirements are
satisfied.   As of  December 31,  1995, participant interests relating to 34,713
Common shares  had vested  under the Agents Plans.  On July 10, 1986 the Company
issued, to  shareholders of record on that date, one Common Stock Purchase Right
(a "Right") for each share of Common Stock owned on that date.  Until the Rights
become exercisable  they will  be represented  by the stock certificates for all
outstanding Common  Stock including newly issued shares.  Upon the occurrence of
certain events  specified in  a Rights  Agreement dated  as of June 24, 1986 and
amended and  restated as  of September 27, 1994 between the Company and Chemical
Bank (successor  by merger  to Manufacturers  Hanover Trust  Company) as  Rights
Agent, the  Rights will  become exercisable,  separate certificates representing
the Rights  will be  issued, and  each Right will entitle the holder to purchase
one half  of a  share of the Common Stock for $107.  Under certain circumstances
specified in  the Rights  Agreement  each  Right  will  entitle  the  holder  to
purchase, for one half of its then market value, publicly traded common stock of
any corporation  which acquires  the Company;  each Right  will also entitle the
holder, with  certain exceptions  specified in the Rights Agreement, to purchase
$150 worth of the Common Stock for $75.  As of December 31, 1995, the Rights had
not become exercisable.

<PAGE>75

     The Company  also sponsors  a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
which enables holders of the Company's Common Stock to invest cash dividends and
optional cash  payments in additional shares of the Common Stock.  In 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively, 37,208, 39,861 and 38,534 shares of the Common Stock had
been sold pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.


     Treasury Stock

     At December  31, 1995, there were 22,997,693 shares of Common Stock held in
treasury.   During 1995,  207,589 Common shares were acquired (including 128,700
shares purchased  under a  repurchase program  and  78,889  shares  relating  to
benefit plans), at an aggregate cost of $5.3 million, and 449,618 Common shares,
with an  aggregate cost  of $5.6  million, were  utilized for  certain employee,
director, and  agent benefit  plans and  for the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan  of USLIFE  Corporation.   At December  31, 1994,  treasury  stock
consisted of  23,239,722 Common  shares.   Common  shares  outstanding,  net  of
treasury shares, as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 are as follows:

Note 11.  Stock Options and Long-Term Incentive Plans

     In May,  1991, the  Company adopted  a stock  option plan  (the "1991 Stock
Option Plan")  for key employees to replace the previous stock option plan under
which options  could no  longer be granted.  Under the 1991 Stock Option Plan, a
maximum of 1,575,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued upon the
exercise of  stock options  which may be granted pursuant to the Plan.  The 1991
Stock Option  Plan also  provides for  "Reload" options, which are automatically
granted to  a participant upon the exercise of an option if the participant uses
previously owned  shares to  pay for  the option shares.  Reload options will be
for the number of previously-owned shares delivered upon the employee's exercise
of an  option.   Under the  1991 Stock Option Plan, the purchase price of shares
subject to  each option will be not less than 100% of their fair market value at
the time of the grant of the option.  The Plan limits the number of options that
may be  granted to any one individual during any one-year period to 112,500.  No
options may be granted under the 1991 Stock Option Plan after May 20, 2001.

     In May  1994, the  Company adopted  a stock  option plan (the "Non-Employee
Director Stock  Option Plan")  for directors  of USLIFE who are not employees of
the Company  or its  subsidiaries or  affiliates.  The Plan provides that on the
date of  each Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders,  each  eligible  director  will
automatically be  granted options  to purchase  3,000 shares  of  USLIFE  common
stock.   A maximum of 375,000 shares of the Company's common stock may be issued
upon the  exercise of  stock options which may be granted under the Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan.  No options may be granted under this Plan after May
17, 2004.

     No option  granted under the Company's stock option plans is exercisable in
whole or  in part  in less  than six months from the date of grant.  Each option
may be  exercisable in  one or  more installments  as provided  therein.  To the
extent such  options are  not exercised,  installments accumulate  to the  total
granted and  are exercisable  in whole or in part at any time during the term of
the option.   This  term is set forth in the option but in no event is an option

<PAGE>76

exercisable, in  whole or  in part,  after the  expiration of ten years from the
date of  grant.   The 1991  Stock Option  Plan provides  that in  the event of a
Change in  Control (as  defined in  the Plan),  all outstanding  options granted
under that  Plan which  have been  held for at least six months from the date of
grant shall become immediately exercisable.

     As of  December 31,  1995, the  Company  had  outstanding  options  to  its
employees (including officers) and non-employee directors for purchase of shares
of its Common Stock as follows:

     As of December 31, 1995, options for 904,525 common shares were exercisable
under all  stock option  plans at  $15.61 to  $29.08 per share.  At December 31,
1995, up  to 2,408,636  common shares  could be issued under the Company's stock
option plans.   Common  shares may  be issued  under the  Company's stock option
plans from shares in treasury or authorized but unissued shares.

     The Company  has a  Book Unit  Plan for  certain key  employees.  Under the
terms of the Plan, the Board of Directors may award, at its sole discretion, one
or more  units to  employees it has selected to become participants in the Plan.
No more than 900,000 units shall be outstanding under the Plan at any time.  The
value of units granted prior to 1994 shall be the amount by which the book value
per share,  as of the award date, has been increased or decreased by (a) the sum
of the  increases or  decreases in  the book  value per  share of  the Company's
common stock,  excluding the  impact of "mark-to-market" adjustments required by
FASB Statement  No. 115  to recognize  unrealized gains  and losses  on debt and
equity securities,  plus (b) dividend equivalents for subsequent years up to and
including the  valuation date.   In  May 1994, the Plan was amended to limit the
number of book units that may be granted to any one individual during a one-year
period to  no more  than 112,500  and further,  to eliminate  the  inclusion  of
cumulative dividends paid to shareholders in calculating the value of book units
awarded in  1994 and  thereafter.  Accordingly, approximately $1.3 million, $1.7
million, and  $2.1 million  were charged  to expense  in 1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.

</TABLE>

     The Company  also has  a Restricted  Stock Plan for selected key employees.
Under the  terms of  the Plan,  a committee  of the Board of Directors may award
restricted shares  of common stock of the Company, up to an aggregate maximum of
1,575,000 shares,  to designated  Participants.   The shares,  when awarded, are
initially non-transferable  and subject  to forfeiture  in the  event  that  the
Participant ceases  to be an employee of USLIFE or any of its subsidiaries other
than by  reason of  death, permanent  disability, retirement,  or certain  other
specified circumstances.  These restrictions generally terminate with respect to
20% of  the number  of shares  awarded on  March 1  of each of the five calendar
years following  the year  of award,  at which  time the  appropriate number  of
unrestricted shares  are distributed  to the  Participant.   For certain awards,
restrictions terminate with respect to one-third of the number of shares awarded
on the  first, second,  and third  anniversaries of the award date, with similar
distribution.   In the  event of  a Change  in Control,  as defined in the Plan,
restrictions would  terminate as to previously awarded but unvested shares.  The
Plan limits  the number  of shares  that may  be granted  to any  one individual
during any  one-year period to 112,500, and provides for forfeiture of awards to
certain key officers under the Plan in the event that performance goals based on
the Company's "Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations," as defined in the
Plan, are  not satisfied.   Upon  award  of  shares  under  the  Plan,  deferred
compensation equivalent  to the  market value of the shares on the award date is
charged to Equity Capital.  Such deferred compensation is subsequently amortized
by means  of charges  to expense  over the  period during which the restrictions
lapse.   During 1995,  a total  of 126,699  shares were  awarded under the Plan.
During 1994,  a total  of 306,411  shares were awarded under the Plan, and 7,998
previously awarded  shares were forfeited pursuant to the terms of the Plan.  As
of December  31, 1995,  there were 375,429 previously awarded shares outstanding
under the Plan as to which the restrictions had not yet lapsed.  Expense charges
recognized in  1995,  1994  and  1993  relating  to  these  awards  amounted  to
approximately $2.6 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

     In May  1994, the  Company adopted an Annual Incentive Plan (the "Incentive
Plan") for  certain key  executive officers.   Under  the Incentive Plan, annual
bonuses for  participating  key  officers  will  depend  on  the  attainment  of
performance goals  based on  levels of  income  from  the  Company's  core  life
insurance  businesses,   as  defined  in  the  Plan.    The  Incentive  Plan  is
administered by  the Executive  Compensation and Nominating Committee, which may
authorize awards of up to 75% of a Participant's base salary based on attainment
of performance  goals established by the Committee.  These awards are payable in
cash no later than April 30 after each plan year, following certification by the
Committee that the performance goals have been met.  The Incentive Plan provides
that in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan), the amount of
awards will be calculated as if all performance targets have been met to produce
the maximum  award and  payment of the awards will be accelerated to the date on
which the Change in Control occurs.

Note 12.  Leases

     A subsidiary  of the  Company leases a portion of a building located at 125
Maiden Lane,  New York,  New  York,  which  houses  the  subsidiary's  principal
executive offices  as well  as the headquarters of the Company and several other
subsidiaries.   The lease expires in 2006 and provides a renewal option based on
fair rental  value at time of renewal.  Additionally, several subsidiaries lease
office space  at other  locations generally  for periods  ranging from  five  to
fifteen years,  and certain  subsidiaries utilize  leased furniture  and  office
equipment.   Certain of  the operating  leases for  office premises  provide for
renewal options  for periods  ranging from  five to  twenty years  based on fair
rental value  at time  of renewal,  and further  options relating  to rental  of
additional office  space.   The minimum  rental commitments  for all  such  non-
cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 1995 approximate $12.0 million in
1996, $10.2  million in  1997, $9.5  million in 1998, $8.6 million in 1999, $8.0
million in 2000, a total of $25.4 million from 2001 to 2005, and a total of $4.1
million from 2006 to 2007.  Total rental expense amounted to approximately $12.5
million, $13.1  million and $13.5 million for the years ended December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively.


Note 13.  Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

     The Company  has outstanding  Standby Letters  of  Credit  with  two  banks
representing contingent  obligations  to  fund  various  trusts  established  in
connection with certain employment contracts of management employees, as well as
certain employee and Director benefit plans, in the event of a Change in Control
(as defined  in the  trust agreements),  totalling $93 million.  The Company has
also entered  into Key  Executive Employment Protection Agreements with selected
key employees, which provide for certain contingent severance benefits, based on
compensation,  in  the  event  of  a  Change  in  Control  (as  defined  in  the
agreements).  Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  application  by  a  life
insurance subsidiary  for an  additional state  license  to  transact  business,
USLIFE Corporation  has agreed to guarantee that subsidiary's maintenance of the
state's minimum  capital and  surplus requirements (amounting to $4.4 million at
December 31,  1995) for  a ten  year period  commencing at the effective date of
such license.   The  Company has  also  agreed  to  guarantee  the  payment  and
performance of  two real  estate leases  which expire December 31, 2006 and June
30, 2007,  respectively, for  two of  its subsidiaries,  which  represent  gross
minimum rents for the remaining term of the leases totalling, as of December 31,
1995, $19.4  million and  $14.9 million,  respectively,  plus  additional  rents
representing any  increase in  operating expenses and real estate taxes over the
base year (defined in the leases as calendar year 1995 and 1997, respectively).

     The Company  and certain  of its  subsidiaries are  involved in litigation,
which originated  in 1981,  with a  former officer of a former subsidiary of the
Company.   Allegations in  the former  officer's lawsuit  include breach  of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, infliction of
emotional distress and malicious prosecution.  Judgment was rendered in favor of
the Company.   That  judgment is  being appealed.   No  contingent loss has been
accrued for  this litigation  because the  amount of  loss, if  any,  cannot  be
reasonably estimated,  nor is  it probable in the opinion of management that the
ultimate outcome of this litigation will result in a liability to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries.

     In November,  1994, a purported class action was filed against three of the
Company's subsidiaries  alleging that in connection with purchases by plaintiffs
of  single  premium  term  life  insurance  from  mortgage  lenders,  defendants
misrepresented the  type of  insurance offered as credit life insurance and sold
the term life insurance at premiums in excess of those permitted for credit life
insurance.   The parties  have agreed to a settlement of all claims asserted and
the settlement  was given  tentative approval  by the  Court in  December, 1995.
Under the  terms of  the Settlement Agreement, class members will be notified of
their right  to file  claims for  partial premium  refunds.   In the  opinion of
management, the  ultimate resolution of this action in accordance with the terms
of the  Settlement Agreement  will not result in a material additional liability
on the part of the Company.

     In August,  1995, a  purported class  action  was  filed  alleging  that  a
subsidiary of the Company violated the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act
by sending  unsolicited facsimiles  of advertisements.   The  Complaint contains
claims for  damages in the amount of $500 for each such unsolicited facsimile or

<PAGE>79

alternatively, plaintiffs'  actual monetary  loss; plaintiffs have also sued for
treble damages  or alternatively, punitive damages.  No contingent loss has been
accrued for  this litigation  because the  amount of  loss, if  any,  cannot  be
reasonably estimated.

In March, 1995, a purported class action was filed alleging that a subsidiary of
the Company  issued insurance  contracts in  an amount  sufficient to  cover the
gross amount  of indebtedness,  rather than  the  net  amount  of  indebtedness,
contrary to  Alabama law.   The complaint contains claims of fraud and breach of
contract based  on allegations  that  defendant  misrepresented  the  amount  of
insurance needed  (based on  a recent  ruling in  a similar  case by the Alabama
Supreme Court).    Plaintiffs  seek  compensatory  and  punitive  damages.    No
contingent loss has been accrued for this litigation because the amount of loss,
if any, cannot be reasonably estimated.

     In addition  to the  aforementioned legal  proceedings, the Company and its
subsidiaries are  parties to various routine legal proceedings incidental to the
conduct of  their business.   Based  on currently available information, in  the
opinion of  management it  is not probable that the ultimate resolution of these
suits will result in a material liability on the part of the Company.


Note 14.  Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk


     The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of the indicated classes of financial instruments:

Cash and Short-term Investments

     The carrying amounts of these assets approximate their fair value.

Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

     Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes.

Mortgage Loans

     The fair  value of  mortgage loans, other than those which are more than 60
days delinquent  or in  foreclosure, is  estimated by  discounting the  expected
future cash  flows.   The rates  used for this purpose are the estimated current
rates that  would be  applied to the loans in a purchase or sale transaction, on
an  aggregate   or  bulk  basis  grouped  by  maturity  range,  considering  the
creditworthiness of  the  borrowers  and  the  general  characteristics  of  the
collateral.   For purposes  of this  calculation, the  fair value  of loans with
stated interest  rates greater  than the  estimated applicable  market rate  was
adjusted to  reflect the impact of prepayment options or other contractual terms
upon market value.  For mortgage loans which are classified as delinquent or are
in foreclosure,  fair value  is based  on estimated  net realizable value of the
underlying collateral.

Policyholder Account Balances Relating to Investment Contracts

     The fair  value of  the Company's  liabilities under  investment contracts,
primarily  deferred   annuities,  is   estimated  using   discounted  cash  flow
calculations based  on interest  rates being  offered by the Company for similar
contracts at the balance sheet date.

Long-term Debt

     The fair  value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on rates
believed to  be currently  available to  the Company  for borrowings  with terms
similar to  the remaining  maturities of  the outstanding debt.  For outstanding
debt securities  with fixed  interest rates  in excess  of current market rates,
repayment on  call dates  prior to  stated maturity  was assumed for purposes of
fair value estimation.

     In accordance  with the  requirements of Statement No. 107 of the Financial
Accounting Standards  Board, the  financial instruments  presented above exclude
accounts relating to the Company's insurance contracts and certain other classes
of assets  and liabilities.   The  Company has not utilized derivative financial
instruments such  as futures,  forward, swap,  or option contracts as defined in
Statement  of   Financial  Accounting   Standards  No.  119,  "Disclosure  about
Derivative Financial  Instruments and  Fair Value of Financial Instruments," for
periods presented herein.

     The estimated  fair values  of the Company's policy loan assets at December
31, 1995  and 1994  are not  materially different  from the  respective carrying
values at  those dates.   It  should be noted that fair value estimates based on
assumed discount rates and assumptions and estimates of the timing and amount of
future cash flows are significantly affected by the assumptions used.


     Concentrations of Credit Risk

     The Company's  investments in  fixed maturities  and equity  securities are
comprised of  a diverse portfolio represented by approximately 650 issuers, with
no issuer accounting for more than 2% of the Company's total investment in these
securities, based on fair value, at December 31, 1995.

                                                          =====


     The Company's  reinsurance receivables  and other  recoverable  amounts  at
December 31,  1995 relate  to approximately  150 reinsurers.   Two  major United
States  insurance   companies,  rated   "A+"  (superior)   and  "A"  (excellent)
respectively by  A. M.  Best Company,  a  recognized  insurance  rating  agency,
account for  approximately 15%  and 9%,  respectively, of  the total reinsurance
receivable and  recoverable amount at that date.  Other than these companies, no
single reinsurer  accounts for  more than 6% of the total reinsurance receivable
and recoverable amount at December 31, 1995.  The Company monitors the financial
condition of  its reinsurers  in order  to minimize  its exposure  to loss  from
reinsurer insolvencies.


Note 15.  Reinsurance

     The life  insurance subsidiaries  reinsure with other companies portions of
the risks  they underwrite and assume portions of risks on policies underwritten
by other  companies.   The life  insurance subsidiaries generally reinsure risks
over $1.5  million as  well as  selected risks  of  lesser  amounts.    In  this
connection, $9.3  billion, representing  6 percent  of total  life insurance  in
force as  of December  31, 1995,  was ceded  to  other  carriers.    Reinsurance
contracts do  not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders, and
the Company  is contingently liable with respect to insurance ceded in the event
any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations which have been assumed.

     The effect  of reinsurance  on premiums, other considerations, and benefits
to policyholders and beneficiaries, is as follows:

(a) Statutory  accounting practices  require acquisition  costs on  new business
(including commissions  and underwriting  and issue  costs)  to  be  charged  to
expense when  incurred.  Regulatory net income includes income (loss) attributed
to participating  policyholders of  approximately $(21)  million, $200 thousand,
and $2  million in  1995, 1994,  and 1993,  respectively,  with  the  1995  loss
primarily a  result of increased sales of participating term insurance products.
Regulatory  equity   capital  includes   capital  attributed   to  participating
policyholders of  approximately $20  million, $30  million, and  $39 million  at
December  31,  1995,  1994  and  1993,  respectively.    Capital  attributed  to
participating policyholders  is  not  available  for  payment  of  dividends  to
shareholders.

(b) Regulatory  net income  includes after-tax capital losses of $8 million, $10
million, and  $2 million in 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  GAAP net income
includes after-tax  capital gains  (losses) of  $4 million,  $(1) million and $7
million in those years, respectively.


     The dividend  paying capability  of  the  life  insurance  subsidiaries  is
generally limited  by after-tax  income and  equity capital  as  reported  on  a
regulatory basis.   As  a  result  of  the  appropriate  adjustments,  including
deferral and  amortization of policy acquisition costs and fair value accounting
for  fixed   maturities  under  GAAP,  equity  capital  of  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries prepared  in accordance with GAAP exceeds regulatory equity capital
as indicated  above.   Notice  to  or  approval  by  regulatory  authorities  is
frequently required  for dividends  paid by  insurance companies.   Loans  to or
advances from  the life insurance subsidiaries to the parent company may also be
subject to  regulatory approval  requirements or  limitations.   At December 31,
1995, the  portion of  the aggregate  $1.786 billion  GAAP equity capital of the
life insurance  subsidiaries which  was not available for transfer to the parent
company by  dividend, loan,  or advance or available for such transfer only with
regulatory approval ("Restricted Net Assets"), as a result of insurance laws and
regulations,  amounted   to  $1.732   billion.    Cash  dividends  paid  by  all
consolidated subsidiaries  to the parent company totalled $42 million (including
$6.5 million  remitted  by  an  inactive  life  insurance  subsidiary  and  then
contributed  to   another  life   subsidiary  in  connection  with  the  earlier
combination of  the two  companies' operations),  $46 million and $61 million in
1995, 1994  and 1993,  respectively.  Additionally, during 1993, securities with
market value of $22 million were transferred from a life insurance subsidiary to
the parent  company and  subsequently  contributed  to  another  life  insurance
subsidiary  in   connection  with  the  combination  of  the  two  subsidiaries'
operations.

        KEY EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENT
        _____________________________________________


     THIS AGREEMENT between USLIFE Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company"), and __________________ (the
"Executive"), dated as of this ___ day of ___________, 199_.


                    W I T N E S S E T H :
                    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

     WHEREAS, the Company has employed the Executive in a key
executive officer position and has determined that the Execu-
tive holds a position which is of critical importance to the
Company;

     WHEREAS, the Company believes that, in the event it is
confronted with a situation that could result in a change in
ownership or control of the Company, continuity of management
will be essential to its ability to evaluate and respond to
such situation in the best interests of shareholders;

     WHEREAS, the Company understands that any such situation
will present significant concerns for the Executive with
respect to his financial and job security;

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of the
Executive's services during the period in which it is
confronting such a situation, and to provide the Executive
with certain financial assurances to enable the Executive to
perform the responsibilities of his position without undue
distraction and to exercise his judgment without bias due to
his personal circumstances;

     WHEREAS, to achieve these objectives, the Company and
the Executive desire to enter into an agreement providing the
Company and the Executive with certain rights and obligations
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in
Section 2);

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed by and
between the Company and the Executive as follows:

     1.  Operation of Agreement.  (a) Effective Date.  The
effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which a
Change of Control occurs (the "Change of Control Date"),
provided that, except as provided in Section 1(b), if the
Executive is not employed by the Company on the Change of
Control Date, this Agreement shall be void and without
effect.
<PAGE>2

          (b)  Termination of Employment Following a
Potential Change of Control.  Notwithstanding Section 1(a),
if (i) the Executive's employment is terminated by the
Company without Cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) after the
occurrence of a Potential Change of Control (as defined in
Section 2(b)) and prior to the occurrence of a Change of
Control and (ii) other Change of Control occurs within one
year of such termination, the Executive shall be deemed,
solely for purposes of determining his rights under this
Agreement, to have remained employed until the date such
Change of Control occurs and to have been terminated by the
Company without Cause immediately after this Agreement
becomes effective.

     2.  Definitions.  (a)  Change of Control.  For the
purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean
(i) a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party
and for which the approval of any shareholders of the Company
is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or
more of the combined voting power of the Company's then
outstanding securities or (iii) a sale or transfer of
substantially all of the assets of the Company.

          (b)  Potential Change of Control.  For the purposes
of this Agreement, a Potential Change of Control shall be
deemed to have occurred if (i)  any "person" (as such term is
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) commences a tender offer
for securities, which if consummated, would result in such
person owning 20% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's then outstanding securities; (ii) the Company
enters into an agreement the consummation of which would
constitute a Change of Control; (iii) proxies for the
election of directors of the Company are solicited by anyone
other than the Company; or (iv) any other event occurs which
is deemed to be a Potential Change of Control by the Board.

     3.  Employment Period.  Subject to Section 6 of this
Agreement, the Company agrees to continue the Executive in
its employ, and the Executive agrees to remain in the employ
of the Company, for the period (the "Employment Period")
commencing on the Change of Control Date and ending on the
third anniversary of the Change of Control Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the Change of
Control Date, the Executive is demoted to a lower position
than the position held on the date first set forth above, the
Board may declare that this Agreement shall be without force
and effect by written notice delivered to the Executive (i)
within 30 days following such demotion and (ii) prior to the
occurrence of a Potential Change of Control or a Change of
Control.

     4.  Position and Duties.  (a)  No Reduction in Position.
During the Employment Period, the Executive's position
(including his titles, authority and responsibilities) shall
be at least commensurate with those held, exercised and
assigned immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.
The Executive's services shall be performed at the location
where the Executive was employed immediately preceding the
Change of Control Date.
<PAGE>3

          (b)  Business Time.  From and after the Change of
Control Date, the Executive agrees to devote his full
attention during normal business hours to the business and
affairs of the Company and to perform faithfully and
efficiently the responsibilities assigned to him hereunder,
to the extent necessary to discharge such responsibilities,
except for  periods of vacation, sick leave and other leave
to which he is entitled. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Executive's continuing to serve on any boards
and committees on which he is serving or with which he is
otherwise associated immediately preceding the Change of
Control Date shall not be deemed to interfere with the
performance of the Executive's services to the Company.

     5.  Compensation.  (a)  Base Salary.  During the
Employment Period, the Executive shall receive a base salary
at a monthly rate at least equal to the monthly salary paid
to the Executive by the Company immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date.  The base salary shall be reviewed at
least once each year after the Change of Control Date, and
may be increased (but not decreased) at any time and from
time to time by action of the Board or any committee thereof
or any individual having authority to take such action in ac-
cordance with the Company's regular practices. The
Executive's base salary, as it may be increased from time to
time, shall hereafter be referred to as "Base Salary".
Neither the Base Salary nor any increase in Base Salary after
the Change of Control Date shall serve to limit or reduce any
other obligation of the Company hereunder.

          (b) Annual Bonus and Incentive Compensation.
During the Employment Period, in addition to the Base Salary,
for each fiscal year of the Company ending during the
Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to receive
(i) an annual bonus which is at least equal to the greater of
(1) the highest annual bonus, including, without limitation,
any bonus provided under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan,
that had been payable to the Executive in respect of either
of the last two fiscal years ended immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date or (2) the amount that would have been
payable to the Executive as a target bonus including, without
limitation, under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan, for
the year in which the Change of Control occurs, plus (ii)
other long-term incentive compensation opportunities on terms
and conditions no less favorable to the Executive than those
applicable to the Executive prior to the Change of Control
Date.  Any amount payable hereunder as an annual bonus shall
be paid as soon as practicable following the year for which
the amount is payable, unless electively deferred by the
Executive pursuant to any deferral programs or arrangements
that the Company may make available to the Executive.

          (c)  Benefit Plans.  During the Employment Period,
the Executive (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents)
shall be entitled to participate in or be covered under all
pension, retirement, deferred compensation, savings, medical,
dental, health, disability, group life, accidental death and
travel accident insurance plans at a level that is
commensurate with the Executive's participation in such plans
immediately prior to the Change of Control Date, or, if more
favorable to the Executive, at the level made available to
the Executive or other similarly situated officers at any
time thereafter.  The Executive shall also be entitled to
receive such perquisites as were generally provided to the
Executive in accordance with the Company's policies and
practices immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.
<PAGE>4
          (d)  Expenses.  During the Employment Period, the
Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement
for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in
accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company as
in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may apply the
policies and procedures in effect after the Change of Control
Date to the Executive, if such policies and procedures are
more favorable to the Executive than those in effect
immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.

          (e)  Indemnification.  During and after the Em-
ployment Period, the Company shall indemnify the Executive
and hold the Executive harmless from and against any claim,
loss or cause of action arising from or out of the Ex-
ecutive's performance as an officer, director or employee of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any other
capacity, including any fiduciary capacity, in which the
Executive serves at the request of the Company to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law and the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws (the "Governing
Documents"), provided that in no event shall the protection
afforded to the Executive hereunder be less than that af-
forded under the Governing Documents as in effect immediately
prior to the Change of Control Date.

     6.   Termination.  (a)  Death, Disability or Retirement.
This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the Exec-
utive's death, termination due to "Disability" (as defined
below) or voluntary retirement under any of the Company's
retirement plans as in effect from time to time.  For
purposes of this Agreement, Disability shall mean the
Executive's inability to perform the duties of his position,
as determined in accordance with the policies and procedures
applicable with respect to the Company's long-term disability
plan, as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control
Date.

          (b)  Voluntary Termination.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following a
Change of Control the Executive may, upon not less than 10
days' written notice to the Company, voluntarily terminate
his employment for any reason (including early retirement
under the terms of any of the Company's retirement plans as
in effect from time to time), provided that any termination
by the Executive pursuant to Section 6(d) on account of Good
Reason (as defined therein) shall not be treated as a vol-
untary termination under this Section 6(b).

          (c)  Cause.  The Company may terminate the Exec-
utive's employment for Cause.  For purposes of this Agree-
ment, "Cause" means (i) the Executive's conviction or plea of
nolo contendere to a felony; (ii) an act or acts of extreme
dishonesty or gross misconduct on the Executive's part which
result or are intended to result in material damage to the
Company's business or reputation; or (iii) repeated material
violations by the Executive of his obligations under Section
4 of this Agreement, which violations are demonstrably
willful and deliberate on the Executive's part and which
result in material damage to the Company's business or
reputation and such violations must have occurred following
the Change of Control Date.
<PAGE>5

          (d)  Good Reason.  Following the occurrence of a
Change of Control, the Executive may terminate his employment
for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Good
Reason" means the occurrence of any of the following, without
the express written consent of the Executive, after the
occurrence of a Change of Control:

          (i)  (A) the assignment to the Executive of any
     duties inconsistent in any material adverse respect with
     the Executive's position, authority or responsibilities
     as contemplated by Section 4 of this Agreement, or (B)
     any other material adverse change in such position,
     including titles, authority or responsibilities;

          (ii)  any failure by the Company to comply with any
     of the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, other
     than an insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by
     the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof
     given by the Executive;

          (iii)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be
     based at any office or location more than 50 miles from
     that location at which he performed his services speci-
     fied under the provisions of Section 4 immediately prior
     to the Change of Control, except for travel reasonably
     required in the performance of the Executive's
     responsibilities; or

          (iv)  any failure by the Company to obtain the
     assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a
     successor as contemplated by Section 11(b).

In no event shall the mere occurrence of a Change of Control,
absent any further impact on the Executive, be deemed to
constitute Good Reason.

          (e)  Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason shall
be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party
hereto given in accordance with Section 12(e).  For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written
notice given, in the case of a termination for Cause, within
10 business days of the Company's having actual knowledge of
the events giving rise to such termination, and in the case
of a termination for Good Reason, within 180 days of the
Executive's having actual knowledge of the events giving rise
to such termination, and which (i) indicates the specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii)
sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances
claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's
employment under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the
termination date is other than the date of receipt of such
notice, specifies the termination date of this Agreement
(which date shall be not more than 15 days after the giving
of such notice).  The failure by the Executive to set forth
in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which
contributes to a showing of Good Reason shall not waive any
right of the Executive hereunder or preclude the Executive
from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his
rights hereunder.
<PAGE>6

          (f)  Date of Termination.  For the purpose of this
Agreement, the term "Date of Termination" means (i) in the
case of a termination for which a Notice of Termination is
required, the date of receipt of such Notice of Termination
or, if later, the date specified therein, as the case may be,
and (ii) in all other cases, the actual date on which the
Executive's employment terminates during the Employment
Period.

     7.  Obligations of the Company upon Termination.  (a)
Death or Disability.  If the Executive's employment is
terminated during the Employment Period by reason of the
Executive's death or Disability, this Agreement shall
terminate without further obligations to the Executive or the
Executive's legal representatives under this Agreement other
than those obligations accrued hereunder at the Date of
Termination, and the Company shall pay to the Executive (or
his beneficiary or estate) (i) the Executive's full Base
Salary through the Date of Termination (the "Earned Salary"),
(ii) any vested amounts or benefits owing to the Executive
under the Company's otherwise applicable employee
compensation and benefit plans and programs, including any
compensation previously deferred by the Executive (together
with any accrued earnings thereon) and not yet paid by the
Company and any accrued vacation pay not yet paid by the
Company (the "Accrued Obligations"), and (iii) any other
benefits payable due to the Executive's death or Disability
under the Company's plans, policies or programs (the
"Additional Benefits").

     Any Earned Salary shall be paid in cash in a single lump
sum as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 10
business days (or at such earlier date required by law),
following the Date of Termination.  Accrued Obligations and
Additional Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the
terms of the applicable plan, program or arrangement.

          (b)  Cause and Voluntary Termination.  If, during
the Employment Period, the Executive's employment shall be
terminated for Cause or voluntarily terminated by the Execu-
tive (other than on account of Good Reason following a Change
of Control) in accordance with Section 6(b) other than during
the 180 day period described in Section 7(c)(i) below, the
Company shall pay the Executive (i) the Earned Salary in cash
in a single lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event
more than 10 days, following the Date of Termination, and
(ii) the Accrued Obligations in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plan, program or arrangement.

          (c)  Termination by the Company other than for
Cause and Certain Terminations by the Executive.
<PAGE>7

          (i)  Lump Sum Payments.  If (x) the Company
     terminates the Executive's employment other than for
     Cause during the Employment Period, (y) the Executive
     terminates his employment for Good Reason at any time
     during the Employment Period or (z) the Executive
     voluntarily terminates his employment without Good
     Reason during the 180 day period beginning on the Change
     of Control Date, then the Company shall pay to the
     Executive the following amounts:

                    (A)  the Executive's Earned Salary;

                    (B)  a cash amount (the "Severance
                    Amount") equal to three times the sum of
                    (1)  the Executive's annual Base Salary;
                    and (2) the greater of (x) the highest
                    bonus amount payable (including any
                    amounts payable under the Annual
                    Incentive Plan) to the Executive in
                    respect of either of the last two fiscal
                    years of the Company ending immediately
                    prior to the Change of Control Date or
                    (y) the amount that would have been
                    payable to the Executive as a target
                    bonus (including any amounts payable
                    under the Annual Incentive Plan) for the
                    year in which the Change of Control
                    occurs; and

                    (C)  the Accrued Obligations.

     The Earned Salary and Severance Amount shall be paid in
     cash in a single lump sum as soon as practicable, but in
     no event more than 10 business days (or at such earlier
     date required by law), following the Date of
     Termination.  Accrued Obligations shall be paid in
     accordance with the terms of the applicable plan,
     program or arrangement.

          (ii)  Continuation of Benefits. If the Executive
     receives the Severance Amount described in Section
     7(c)(i), the Executive (and, to the extent applicable,
     his dependents) shall be entitled, after the Date of
     Termination until the earlier of (1) the second
     anniversary of the Date of Termination (the "End Date")
     or (2) the date the Executive becomes eligible for
     comparable benefits under a similar plan, policy or
     program of a subsequent employer, to continue
     participation in all of the Company's employee and
     executive welfare and fringe benefit plans (the "Benefit
     Plans") and to receive such perquisites as were
     generally provided to the Executive in accordance with
     the Company's policies and practices immediately prior
     to the Change of Control Date.  To the extent any such
     benefits or perquisites cannot be provided under the
     terms of the applicable plan, policy or program, the
     Company shall provide a comparable benefit under another
     plan or from the Company's general assets.  The
     Executive's participation in the Benefit Plans and
     eligibility for perquisites will be on the same terms
     and conditions that would have applied had the Executive
     continued to be employed by the Company through the End
     Date.
<PAGE>8

          (d)  Discharge of the Company's Obligations.
Except as expressly provided in the last sentence of this
Section 7(d), the amounts payable to the Executive pursuant
to this Section 7 (whether or not reduced pursuant to Section
7(e)) following termination of his employment shall be in
full and complete satisfaction of the Executive's rights
under this Agreement and any other claims he may have in
respect of his employment by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.  Such amounts shall constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any and all such rights and claims
and, upon the Executive's receipt of such amounts, the
Company shall be released and discharged from any and all
liability to the Executive in connection with this Agreement
or otherwise in connection with the Executive's employment
with the Company and its subsidiaries.  Nothing in this
Section 7(d) shall be construed to release the Company from
its commitment to indemnify the Executive and hold the
Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or cause
of action arising from or out of the Executive's performance
as an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or in any other capacity, including any
fiduciary capacity, in which the Executive served at the
request of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and the Governing Documents.

          (e)  Certain Further Payments by the Company.

          (i)  In the event that any amount or benefit paid
     or distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agree-
     ment, taken together with any amounts or benefits
     otherwise paid or distributed to the Executive by the
     Company or any affiliated company (collectively, the
     "Covered Payments"), are or become subject to the tax
     (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
     or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed, the
     Company shall pay to the Executive at the time specified
     in Section 7(e)(v) below an additional amount (the "Tax
     Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount
     retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered
     Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the
     Covered Payments and any Federal, state and local income
     or employment tax and Excise Tax on the Tax Reimburse-
     ment Payment provided for by this Section 7(e), but
     before deduction for any Federal, state or local income
     or employment tax withholding on such Covered Payments,
     shall be equal to the amount of the Covered Payments.

          (ii)  For purposes of determining whether any of
     the Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax
     and the amount of such Excise Tax,

                    (A)  such Covered Payments will be
               treated as "parachute payments" within the
               meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and all
               "parachute payments" in excess of the "base
               amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3)
               of the Code) shall be treated as subject to
               the Excise Tax, unless, and except to the
               extent that, in the good faith judgment of the
               Company's independent certified public
               accountants appointed prior to the Change of
               Control Date or tax counsel selected by such
               Accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company
               has a reasonable basis to conclude that such
               Covered Payments (in whole or in part) either
               do not constitute "parachute payments" or
               represent reasonable compensation for personal
               services actually rendered (within the meaning
               of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in
               excess of the "base amount," or such
               "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject
               to such Excise Tax, and
<PAGE>9

                    (B)  the value of any non-cash benefits
               or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
               determined by the Accountants in accordance
               with the principles of Section 280G of the
               Code.

          (iii)  For purposes of determining the amount of
     the Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be
     deemed to pay:

                    (A)  Federal income taxes at the highest
               applicable marginal rate of Federal income
               taxation for the calendar year in which the
               Tax Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and

                    (B)  any applicable state and local
               income taxes at the highest applicable
               marginal rate of taxation for the calendar
               year in which the Tax Reimbursement Payment is
               to be made, net of the maximum reduction in
               Federal income taxes which could be obtained
               from the deduction of such state or local
               taxes if paid in such year.

          (iv)  In the event that the Excise Tax is subse-
     quently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any
     proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue
     Service to be less than the amount taken into account
     hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment
     made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the
     time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax
     is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax
     Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if
     such Excise Tax had been applied in initially
     calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus
     interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
     provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion
     of the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be refunded to the
     Company has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax
     authority, repayment thereof shall not be required until
     actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to
     the Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall
     not exceed interest received or credited to the
     Executive by such tax authority for the period it held
     such portion.  The Executive and the Company shall
     mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued
     (and the method of allocating the expenses thereof) if
     the Executive's good faith claim for refund or credit is
     denied.
<PAGE>10

          In the event that the Excise Tax is later
     determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any
     proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue
     Service to exceed the amount taken into account
     hereunder at the time the Tax Reimbursement Payment is
     made (including, but not limited to, by reason of any
     payment the existence or amount of which cannot be
     determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement
     Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax
     Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus
     any interest or penalty payable with respect to such
     excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is
     finally determined.

          (v)  The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion
     thereof) provided for in Section 7(e)(i) above shall be
     paid to the Executive not later than 10 business days
     following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided,
     however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement
     Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally
     determined on or before the date on which payment is
     due, the Company shall pay to the Executive by such date
     an amount estimated in good faith by the Accountants to
     be the minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment
     and shall pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement
     Payment (together with interest at the rate provided in
     Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
     thereof can be determined, but in no event later than 45
     calendar days after payment of the related Covered
     Payment.  In the event that the amount of the estimated
     Tax Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount
     subsequently determined to have been due, such excess
     shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive,
     payable on the fifth business day after written demand
     by the Company for payment (together with interest at
     the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).

     8.  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as expressly
provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or
limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in
any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program, or
perquisite provided by the Company or any of its affiliated
companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall
anything herein limit or otherwise prejudice such rights as
the Executive may have under any other agreements with the
Company or any of its affiliated companies, including
employment agreements or stock option agreements.  Amounts
which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise
entitled to receive under any plan or program of the Company
or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the
Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such
plan or program.

     9.  Full Settlement.  The Company's obligation to make
the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to
perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by
any circumstances, including, without limitation, any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which the Company may have against the Executive or others
whether by reason of the subsequent employment of the
Executive or otherwise.
<PAGE>11

     10.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  If the Executive asserts
any claim in any contest (whether initiated by the Executive
or by the Company) as to the validity, enforceability or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay the Executive's legal expenses (or cause
such expenses to be paid) including, without limitation, his
reasonable attorney's fees, on a quarterly basis, upon
presentation of proof of such expenses, provided that the
Executive shall reimburse the Company for such amounts, plus
simple interest thereon at the 90-day United States Treasury
Bill rate as in effect from time to time, compounded
annually, if the Executive shall not prevail, in whole or in
part, as to any material issue as to the validity, en-
forceability or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

     11.  Successors.  (a)  This Agreement is personal to the
Executive and, without the prior written consent of the
Company, shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

          (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Company and its successors.  The
Company shall require any successor to all or substantially
all of the business and/or assets of the Company, whether
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation,
acquisition of stock, or otherwise, by an agreement in form
and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent as the Company would be required to
perform if no such succession had taken place.

     12.  Miscellaneous. (a)  Applicable Law.  This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York, applied without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.

          (b)  Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
resolved by binding arbitration.  The arbitration shall be
held in New York, New York and except to the extent
inconsistent with this Agreement, shall be conducted in
accordance with the Expedited Employment Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association then in effect at the
time of the arbitration, and otherwise in accordance with
principles which would be applied by a court of law or
equity.   The arbitrator shall be acceptable to both the
Company and the Executive.  If the parties cannot agree on an
acceptable arbitrator, the dispute shall be heard by a panel
of three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the parties
and the third appointed by the other two arbitrators.
<PAGE>12

          (c)  Entire Agreement.  Upon the Change of Control
Date, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the matters
referred to herein.  During the Employment Period, the
Employment Agreement between the Executive and the Company
dated as of April 1, 1989, as amended and as may be amended

the Employment Period, the Employment Agreement shall be
reinstated for the remainder of its term immediately
following the end of such Employment Period.  No other
agreement relating to the terms of the Executive's employment
by the Company, oral or otherwise, shall be binding between
the parties unless it is in writing and signed by the party

 EMPLOYMENT AND KEY EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENT
 ____________________________________________________________


          THIS AGREEMENT between USLIFE Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company"), and _______________ (the
"Executive"), dated as of this ___ day of __________, 199_.


                     W I T N E S S E T H :
                     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

          WHEREAS, the Company has employed the Executive in a
key executive officer position and has determined that the
Executive holds a position of significant importance with the
Company;

     WHEREAS, the Company deems it desirable and in its best
interests to make provision for the availability to the
Company, its subsidiaries, and their respective successors and
assigns in the future of the Executive's services on the terms
set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, the Company further believes that, in the event
it is confronted with a situation that could result in a change
in ownership or control of the Company, continuity of
management will be essential to its ability to evaluate and
respond to such situation in the best interests of
shareholders;

     WHEREAS, the Company also desires to assure itself of the
Executive's services during the period in which it is
confronting such a situation, and to provide the Executive with
certain financial assurances to enable the Executive to perform
the responsibilities of his position without undue distraction
and to exercise his judgment without bias due to his personal
circumstances;

           NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed by and
between the Company and the Executive as follows:
<PAGE>2

          1.   Agreement to Employ.  Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, the Company agrees to employ the
Executive and the Executive agrees to perform services as an
employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries for an
initial period commencing on the date hereof (the "Commencement
Date") and ending on the day immediately preceding the third
anniversary of the Commencement Date.  Upon each anniversary of
the Commencement Date, the term of this Agreement will be
extended for one (1) additional year without any action by the
Company or the Executive, unless either the Company or the
Executive delivers written notice (the "Notice") to the other
party, during the 90 day period immediately prior to any such
anniversary date, stating that it or he does not want the term
of this Agreement further extended; provided that, except as
provided in the next following sentence, if a Change of Control
(as defined below) occurs during the term of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall in all events continue in effect until the
third anniversary of the date upon which such Change of Control
occurs (the "Change of Control Date").  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, prior to the occurrence of a Potential Change of
Control (as defined below) or a Change of Control, the
Executive is demoted to a lower position than the position of
Senior Vice President, the additional protection afforded by
this Agreement in respect of a Change of Control shall be
without force and effect.

          2.   Duties and Responsibilities. Executive shall be
initially employed as an Executive Vice President, and shall
serve in such other executive capacity or capacities with the
Company or its subsidiaries as its Board of Directors from time
to time may determine at any time prior to the Change of
Control Date. During the term of this Agreement the Executive
will devote all of his business time and attention to the
business and affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries;
provided that the Executive will not be deemed to have violated
his commitment hereunder by reason of periods of vacation, sick
leave and other leave to which  he is entitled.

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
following a Change of Control, the Executive's position
(including his titles, authority and responsibilities) shall be
at least commensurate with those held, exercised and assigned
immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.   Following a
Change of Control, the Executive's services shall be performed
at the location where the Executive was employed immediately
preceding the Change of Control Date.

          3.  Annual Compensation.  (a) Base Salary. The
Company will pay Executive for his services hereunder at the
rate in effect on the date hereof, in equal monthly
installments, plus any lump sum bonus payments, plus such
periodic salary increases and such additional compensation (if
any) as may from time to time be voted by the Company's Board
of Directors and/or the Executive Compensation Committee or its
successor, in the sole and absolute discretion of said Board
and/or Committee.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as precluding merit increases in salary or barring the
Executive from such fringe benefits as the Company may grant.
During the term hereof, the Executive shall be eligible to
participate in each employee benefit plan or program sponsored
or maintained by the Company and in other Company perquisites
to the extent that he is eligible to participate therein in
accordance with the terms and conditions generally applicable
thereto. The Executive's base salary, as it may be increased
from time to time, shall hereafter be referred to as "Base
Salary".
<PAGE>3

          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
following a Change of Control Date, the Executive shall receive
a Base Salary at a monthly rate at least equal to the monthly
salary paid to the Executive by the Company and any of its
affiliated companies immediately prior to such Change of
Control Date.  Neither the Base Salary nor any increase in Base
Salary after the Change of Control Date shall serve to limit or
reduce any other obligation of the Company hereunder.

          (b)  Annual Bonus.  Following a Change of Control,
for each fiscal year of the Company ending during the term of
this Agreement, the Executive shall receive a bonus at least
equal to the greater of (i) the highest bonus amount payable to
the Executive in respect of either of the last two fiscal years
of the Company ending immediately prior to the Change of
Control Date or (ii) the amount that would have been payable to
the Executive as a target bonus for the year in which the
Change of Control occurs plus, long-term incentive compensation
opportunities on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Executive than those applicable to the Executive prior to the
Change of Control Date.  Any amount payable hereunder as an
annual bonus shall be paid as soon as practicable following the
year for which the amount is payable, unless electively
deferred by the Executive pursuant to any deferral programs or
arrangements that the Company may make available to the
Executive.

          4.   Definitions.   (a)  Change of Control.  For the
purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean
(i) a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party
and for which the approval of any shareholders of the Company
is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or
more of the combined voting power of the Company's then
outstanding securities or (iii) a sale or transfer of
substantially all of the assets of the Company.

          (b)  Potential Change of Control.  For the purposes
of this Agreement, a Potential Change of Control shall be
deemed to have occurred if (i)  any "person" (as such term is
used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) commences a tender offer for
securities, which if consummated, would result in such person
owning 20% or more of the combined voting power of the
Company's then outstanding securities; (ii) the Company enters
into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a
Change of Control; (iii) proxies for the election of directors
of the Company are solicited by anyone other than the Company;
or (iv) any other event occurs which is deemed to be a
Potential Change of Control by the Board.

          5.   Termination.  (a)  Death, Disability or
Retirement.  This Agreement shall terminate automatically upon
the Executive's death, termination due to "Disability" (as
defined below) or voluntary retirement under any of the
Company's retirement plans as in effect from time to time.  For
purposes of this Agreement, Disability shall mean the
Executive's inability to perform the duties of his position, as
determined in accordance with the policies and procedures
applicable with respect to the Company's long-term disability
plan, as in effect from time to time, except that, following a
Change of Control, disability shall be determined based on the
policies and procedures in effect immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date.
<PAGE>4

          (b)  Voluntary Termination.  Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, following a Change of
Control the Executive may, upon not less than 30 days' written
notice to the Company, voluntarily terminate his employment for
any reason (including early retirement under the terms of any
of the Company's retirement plans as in effect from time to
time), provided that any termination by the Executive pursuant
to Section 5(d) on account of Good Reason (as defined therein)
shall not be treated as a voluntary termination under this
Section 5(b).

          (c)  Cause.  The Company may terminate the Exec-
utive's employment for Cause.  For purposes of this Agreement,
"Cause" means (i) the Executive's conviction or plea of nolo
contendere to a felony; (ii) an act or acts of extreme dis-
honesty or gross misconduct on the Executive's part which
result or are intended to result in material damage to the
Company's business or reputation; or (iii) repeated material
violations by the Executive of his obligations under Section 2
of this Agreement, provided that, following a Change of Control
Date, Cause shall not exist due to such violations of his
obligations unless such violations are demonstrably willful and
deliberate on the Executive's part and result in material
damage to the Company's business or reputation and such
violations must have occurred following a Change of Control
Date.

          (d)  Good Reason.  Following the occurrence of a
Change of Control, the Executive may terminate his employment
for Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason"
means the occurrence of any of the following, without the
express written consent of the Executive, after the occurrence
of a Change of Control:

          (i)  (A) the assignment to the Executive of any
     duties inconsistent in any material adverse respect with
     the Executive's position, authority or responsibilities as
     contemplated by Section 2 of this Agreement, or (B) any
     other material adverse change in such position, including
     titles, authority or responsibilities;

          (ii)  any failure by the Company to comply with any
     of the provisions of Section 3 of this Agreement, other
     than an insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by
     the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given
     by the Executive;

          (iii)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be
     based at any office or location more than 50 miles from
     that location at which  he  performed his services speci-
     fied under the provisions of Section 2 immediately prior
     to the Change of Control, except for travel reasonably
     required in the performance of the Executive's
     responsibilities;
<PAGE>5

          (iv) the failure by the Company to permit the
     Executive to participate in all long-term incentive
     compensation programs for key executives at a level that
     is commensurate with the Executive's participation in such
     plans immediately prior to the Change of Control Date (or,
     if more favorable to the Executive, at the level made
     available to the Executive or other similarly situated
     officers at any time thereafter);

          (v) the failure by the Company to permit the
     Executive (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents)
     to participate in or be covered under all pension,
     retirement, deferred compensation, savings, medical,
     dental, health, disability, group life, accidental death
     and travel accident insurance plans and programs of the
     Company and its affiliated companies at a level that is
     commensurate with the Executive's participation in such
     plans immediately prior to the Change of Control Date (or,
     if more favorable to the Executive, at the level made
     available to the Executive or other similarly situated
     officers at any time thereafter); or

          (vi)  any failure by the Company to obtain the
     assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a
     successor as contemplated by Section 11(b).

In no event shall the mere occurrence of a Change of Control,
absent any further impact on the Executive, be deemed to
constitute Good Reason.

          (e)  Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 12(f).  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice
given, in the case of a termination for Cause, within 10
business days of the Company's having actual knowledge of the
events giving rise to such termination, and in the case of a
termination for Good Reason, within 180 days of the Executive's
having actual knowledge of the events giving rise to such
termination, and which (i) indicates the specific termination
provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment
under the provision so indicated, and (iii) if the termination
date is other than the date of receipt of such notice,
specifies the termination date of this Agreement (which date
shall be not more than 15 days after the giving of such
notice).  The failure by the Executive to set forth in the
Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which
contributes to a showing of Good Reason shall not waive any
right of the Executive hereunder or preclude the Executive from
asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights
hereunder.

          (f)  Date of Termination.  For the purpose of this
Agreement, the term "Date of Termination" means (i) in the case
of a termination for which a Notice of Termination is required,
the date of receipt of such Notice of Termination or, if later,
the date specified therein, as the case may be, and (ii) in all
other cases, the actual date on which the Executive's
employment terminates during the Employment Period.
<PAGE>6

          6.   Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
(a)  Death or Disability.  If the Executive's employment is
terminated during the term hereof by reason of the Executive's
death or Disability, this Agreement shall terminate without
further obligations to the Executive or the Executive's legal
representatives under this Agreement other than those
obligations accrued hereunder at the Date of Termination, and
the Company shall pay to the Executive (or his beneficiary or
estate) (i) the Executive's full Base Salary through the Date
of Termination (the "Earned Salary"), (ii) any vested amounts
or benefits owing to the Executive under the Company's
otherwise applicable employee compensation and benefit plans
and programs, including any compensation previously deferred by
the Executive (together with any accrued earnings thereon) and
not yet paid by the Company and any accrued vacation pay not
yet paid by the Company (the "Accrued Obligations"), and (iii)
any other benefits payable due to the Executive's death or
Disability under the Company's plans, policies or programs (the
"Additional Benefits").

          Any Earned Salary shall be paid in cash in a single
lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 10
business days (or at such earlier date required by law),
following the Date of Termination.  Accrued Obligations and
Additional Benefits shall be paid in accordance with the terms
of the applicable plan, program or arrangement.

          (b)  Cause and Voluntary Termination.  If, during the
Employment Period, the Executive's employment shall be
terminated for Cause or voluntarily terminated by the Executive
in accordance with Section 5(b) other than during the 90 day
period described in Section 6(d)(i) below, the Company shall
pay the Executive (i) the Earned Salary in cash in a single
lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 10
days, following the Date of Termination, and (ii) the Accrued
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the applicable
plan, program or arrangement.

          (c)  Termination by the Company Without Cause Prior
to a Change of Control. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in Section 6(d), in the event that the Company terminates the
Executive's employment during the term of this Agreement
without Cause prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control,
the Company's only obligation to the Executive shall be to pay
the Executive an amount equal to his Base Salary (at the same
time as the Executive would have received his Base Salary had
he  continued to be employed)  for the period ending on the
first to occur of (i) the date on which the Executive obtains
other employment, (ii) the date on which the term of this
Agreement would have expired (but for such termination)
pursuant to Section 1 hereof, assuming that no further renewals
of such term occur after the Executive's Date of Termination,
and (iii) the date on which the Executive breaches any of the
provisions of Section 9.

          (d)  Certain Terminations In Connection With a Change
of Control.
<PAGE>7

          (i)  Lump Sum Payments.  If, following a Change of
     Control, (x) the Company terminates the Executive's em-
     ployment other than for Cause, (y) the Executive
     terminates his employment at any time for Good Reason or
     (z) the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment
     without Good Reason during the 90 day period beginning on
     the first anniversary of the Change of Control Date, then
     the Company shall pay to the Executive the following
     amounts:

                    (A)  the Executive's Earned Salary;

                    (B)  a cash amount (the "Severance Amount")
                    equal to three times the sum of (1)  the
                    Executive's annual Base Salary; and (2)
                    the greater of (x) the highest bonus amount
                    payable to the Executive in respect of
                    either of the last two fiscal years of the
                    Company ending immediately prior to the
                    Change of Control Date or (y) the amount
                    that would have been payable to the
                    Executive as a target bonus for the year in
                    which the Change of Control occurs; and

                    (C)  the Accrued Obligations.

     Notwithstanding the limitations contained in the preceding
     sentence, if (i) the Executive's employment is terminated
     by the Company without Cause after the occurrence of a
     Potential Change of Control and prior to the occurrence of
     a Change of Control and (ii) a Change of Control occurs
     within one year of such termination, the Executive shall
     be deemed, solely for purposes of determining his rights
     under this Agreement, to have remained employed until the
     date such Change of Control occurs and to have been
     terminated by the Company without Cause immediately after
     the Change of Control Date.

               The Earned Salary and Severance Amount shall be
     paid in cash in a single lump sum as soon as practicable,
     but in no event more than 10 business days (or at such
     earlier date required by law), following the later of the
     Change of Control Date or the Date of Termination.
     Accrued Obligations shall be paid in accordance with the
     terms of the applicable plan, program or arrangement.

          (ii)  Continuation of Benefits. If, the Executive is
     entitled to receive the Severance Amount, the Executive
     (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents) shall be
     entitled, after the Date of Termination until the earlier
     of (1) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination
     (the "End Date") or (2) the date the Executive becomes
     eligible for comparable benefits under a similar plan,
     policy or program of a subsequent employer, to continue
     participation in all of the Company's Executive and
     executive welfare and fringe benefit plans (the "Benefit
     Plans") and to receive such perquisites as were generally
     provided to the Executive in accordance with the Company's
     policies and practices immediately prior to the Change of
     Control Date.  To the extent any such benefits or
     perquisites cannot be provided under the terms of the
     applicable plan, policy or program, the Company shall
     provide a comparable benefit under another plan or from
     the Company's general assets.  The Executive's par-
     ticipation in the Benefit Plans and eligibility for
     perquisites will be on the same terms and conditions that
     would have applied had the Executive continued to be
     employed by the Company through the End Date.
<PAGE>8

          (e)  Discharge of the Company's Obligations.  Except
as expressly provided in the last sentence of this Section
6(e), the amounts payable to the Executive pursuant to this
Section 6 (whether or not reduced pursuant to Section 6(f))
following termination of his employment shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of the Executive's rights under this
Agreement and any other claims  he  may have in respect of his
employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Such
amounts shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any
and all such rights and claims and, upon the Executive's
receipt of such amounts, the Company shall be released and
discharged from any and all liability to the Executive in con-
nection with this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries.
Nothing in this Section 6(e) shall be construed to release the
Company from its commitment to indemnify the Executive and hold
the Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or
cause of action arising from or out of the Executive's
performance as an officer, director or Executive of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or in any other capacity, including
any fiduciary capacity, in which the Executive served at the
request of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and the Governing Documents.

          (f)  Certain Further Payments by the Company.

          (i)  In the event that any amount or benefit paid or
     distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement,
     taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid
     or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any
     affiliated company (collectively, the "Covered Payments"),
     are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax")
     imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
     1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any similar tax that may
     hereafter be imposed, the Company shall pay to the
     Executive at the time specified in Section 6(f)(v) below
     an additional amount (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment")
     such that the net amount retained by the Executive with
     respect to such Covered Payments, after deduction of any
     Excise Tax on the Covered Payments and any Federal, state
     and local income or employment tax and Excise Tax on the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment provided for by this Section
     6(f), but before deduction for any Federal, state or local
     income or employment tax withholding on such Covered
     Payments, shall be equal to the amount of the Covered
     Payments.

          (ii)  For purposes of determining whether any of the
     Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
     amount of such Excise Tax,
<PAGE>9

                    (A)  such Covered Payments will be treated
               as "parachute payments" within the meaning of
               Section 280G of the Code, and all "parachute
               payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as
               defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
               shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax,
               unless, and except to the extent that, in the
               good faith judgment of the Company's independent
               certified public accountants appointed prior to
               the Change of Control Date or tax counsel
               selected by such accountants (the "Ac-
               countants"), the Company has a reasonable basis
               to conclude that such Covered Payments (in whole
               or in part) either do not constitute "parachute
               payments" or represent reasonable compensation
               for personal services actually rendered (within
               the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the
               Code) in excess of the "base amount," or such
               "parachute payments" are otherwise not subject
               to such Excise Tax, and

                    (B)  the value of any non-cash benefits or
               any deferred payment or benefit shall be deter-
               mined by the Accountants in accordance with the
               principles of Section 280G of the Code.

          (iii)  For purposes of determining the amount of the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed
     to pay:

                    (A)  Federal income taxes at the highest
               applicable marginal rate of Federal income tax-
               ation for the calendar year in which the Tax
               Reimbursement Payment is to be made, and

                    (B)  any applicable state and local income
               taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of
               taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax
               Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the
               maximum reduction in Federal income taxes which
               could be obtained from the deduction of such
               state or local taxes if paid in such year.

          (iv)  In the event that the Excise Tax is subse-
     quently determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any
     proceeding or negotiations with the Internal Revenue
     Service to be less than the amount taken into account
     hereunder in calculating the Tax Reimbursement Payment
     made, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the
     time that the amount of such reduction in the Excise Tax
     is finally determined, the portion of such prior Tax
     Reimbursement Payment that would not have been paid if
     such Excise Tax had been applied in initially calculating
     such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus interest on the
     amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section
     1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
     in the event any portion of the Tax Reimbursement Payment
     to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any Fed-
     eral, state or local tax authority, repayment thereof
     shall not be required until actual refund or credit of
     such portion has been made to the Executive, and interest
     payable to the Company shall not exceed interest received
     or credited to the Executive by such tax authority for the
     period it held such portion.  The Executive and the
     Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to
     be pursued (and the method of allocating the expenses
     thereof) if the Executive's good faith claim for refund or
     credit is denied.
<PAGE>10

          In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined
     by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or
     negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed
     the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment is made (including, but not
     limited to, by reason of any payment the existence or
     amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment), the Company shall make an
     additional Tax Reimbursement Payment in respect of such
     excess (plus any interest or penalty payable with respect
     to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess
     is finally determined.

          (v)  The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion
     thereof) provided for in Section 6(f)(i) above shall be
     paid to the Executive not later than 10 business days
     following the payment of the Covered Payments; provided,
     however, that if the amount of such Tax Reimbursement
     Payment (or portion thereof) cannot be finally determined
     on or before the date on which payment is due, the Company
     shall pay to the Executive by such date an amount
     estimated in good faith by the Accountants to be the
     minimum amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment and shall
     pay the remainder of such Tax Reimbursement Payment
     (together with interest at the rate provided in Section
     1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount thereof
     can be determined, but in no event later than 45 calendar
     days after payment of the related Covered Payment.  In the
     event that the amount of the estimated Tax Reimbursement
     Payment exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have
     been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the
     Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth business
     day after written demand by the Company for payment (to-
     gether with interest at the rate provided in Section
     1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).

          7.   Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as expressly
provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or
limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any
benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan, program or perquisite
provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and
for which the Executive may qualify, nor shall anything herein
limit or otherwise prejudice such rights as the Executive may
have under any other agreements with the Company or any of its
affiliated companies, including employment agreements or stock
option agreements.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which
the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan
or program of the Company or any of its affiliated companies at
or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with such plan or program.

          8.   Full Settlement.  Following a Change of Control,
the Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in
this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations
hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances,
including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have
against the Executive or others whether by reason of the
subsequent employment of the Executive or otherwise.
<PAGE>11

          9.  Noncompetition.  The Executive agrees that in the
event his employment is terminated, whether by him or by the
Company, prior to the Change of Control Date  he  will not for
a period of one (1) year after the Date of Termination (i)
acting alone or in conjunction with others, directly or
indirectly engage (either as owner, partner, stockholder,
employer or employee) in any business in which  he has been
directly engaged during the last two (2) years prior to such
termination and which is directly in competition with a
business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
(ii) acting alone or in conjunction with others, directly or
indirectly induce any customers of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries with whom the Executive has had contacts or
relationships, directly or indirectly, during and within the
scope of his employment with the Company, to curtail or cancel
their business with such companies or any of them; (iii) acting
alone or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly
disclose to any person, firm or corporation the names of any
customers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (iv)
acting alone or in conjunction with others, solicit or canvass
business from any person who was a customer of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries at or prior to termination of the
Executive's employment; or (v) acting alone or in conjunction
with others, directly or indirectly induce, or attempt to
influence, any executive of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to terminate their employment.  The provisions of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) above are separate and
distinct commitments independent of each of the other clauses.
It is agreed that the ownership of not more than 2% of the
equity securities of any company having securities listed on a
registered exchange or regularly traded in the over-the-counter
market shall not, of itself, be deemed inconsistent with clause
(i).

          10. Legal Fees and Expenses.  If following a Change
of Control, the Executive asserts any claim in any contest
(whether initiated by the Executive or by the Company) as to
the validity, enforceability or interpretation of any provision
of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive's legal
expenses (or cause such expenses to be paid) including, without
limitation, his reasonable attorney's fees, on a quarterly
basis, upon presentation of proof of such expenses, provided
that the Executive shall reimburse the Company for such
amounts, plus simple interest thereon at the 90-day United
States Treasury Bill rate as in effect from time to time,
compounded annually, if the Executive shall not prevail, in
whole or in part, as to any material issue as to the validity,
enforceability or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

          11.  Successors.  (a)  This Agreement is personal to
the Executive and, without the prior written consent of the
Company, shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

          (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Company and its successors.  The Company
shall require any successor to all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the Company, whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, acquisition of
stock, or otherwise, by an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent as the Company would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place.
<PAGE>12

          12.  Miscellaneous. (a)  Applicable Law.  This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, applied without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.

          (b)  Arbitration. Following the occurrence of a
Change of Control, any dispute or controversy arising under or
in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding
arbitration.  The arbitration shall be held in New York, New
York and except to the extent inconsistent with this Agreement,
shall be conducted in accordance with the Expedited Employment
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then
in effect at the time of the arbitration, and otherwise in
accordance with principles which would be applied by a court of
law or equity.   The arbitrator shall be acceptable to both the
Company and the Executive.  If the parties cannot agree on an
acceptable arbitrator, the dispute shall be heard by a panel of
three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the parties and the
third appointed by the other two arbitrators.

          (c)  Expenses.  During the term hereof, the Executive
shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all
reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in accordance
with its usual policies and procedures as in effect from time
to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  after the Change of
Control Date, such policies and procedures shall be no less
favorable to the Executive than those in effect immediately
prior to the Change of Control Date.

          (d)  Indemnification.  During and after the term
hereof, the Company shall indemnify the Executive and hold the
Executive harmless from and against any claim, loss or cause of
action arising from or out of the Executive's performance as an
officer, director or Executive of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or in any other capacity, including any fiduciary
capacity, in which the Executive serves at the request of the
Company to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws (the
"Governing Documents"), provided that in no event shall the
protection afforded to the Executive hereunder following a
Change of Control be less than that afforded under the
Governing Documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date.

          (e)  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the matters referred to herein.  No other agreement relating to
the terms of the Executive's employment by the Company, oral or
otherwise, shall be binding between the parties unless it is in
writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought.  There are no promises, representations, inducements or
statements between the parties other than those that are
expressly contained herein.  This Agreement may not be amended
or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by
the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal
representatives.  In the event any provision of this Agreement
is invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected. The
Executive acknowledges that he is entering into this Agreement
of his own free will and accord, and with no duress, that  he
has read this Agreement and that  he  understands it and its
legal consequences.

          KEY EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENT
          _____________________________________________


          THIS AGREEMENT between USLIFE Corporation, a New York
corporation (the "Company"), and _______________ (the
"Executive"), dated as of this ___ day of ____________, 199_.


                      W I T N E S S E T H :
                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


          WHEREAS, the Company has employed the Executive in an
officer position and has determined that the Executive holds a
position of importance with the Company;

     WHEREAS, the Company believes that, in the event it is
confronted with a situation that could result in a change in
ownership or control of the Company, continuity of management
will be essential to its continued successful operations;

     WHEREAS, the Company understands that any such situation
will present significant concerns for the Executive with respect
to his financial and job security;

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of the
Executive's services during the period in which it is confronting
such a situation, and to provide the Executive certain financial
assurances to enable the Executive to perform the
responsibilities of his position without undue distraction and to
exercise his judgment without bias due to his personal
circumstances;

     WHEREAS, to achieve these objectives, the Company and the
Executive desire to enter into an agreement providing the Company
and the Executive with certain rights and obligations upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 2);

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed by and
between the Company and the Executive as follows:

          1.   Operation of Agreement.  (a) Effective Date.  The
effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which a
Change of Control occurs (the "Change of Control Date"), provided
that, except as provided in Section 1(c), if the Executive is not
employed by the Company on the Change of Control Date, this
Agreement shall be void and without effect.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, prior to the occurrence of a Potential Change of
Control (as defined below) or a Change of Control, the Executive
is demoted to a lower position than the position of Senior Vice
President this Agreement shall be void and without effect.

          (b)  Employment Protection Benefits.  If, on or before
the first anniversary of the Change of Control Date, (x) the
Company terminates the Executive's employment other than due to
Disability (as defined below) or for Cause (as defined below) or
(y) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (as
defined below), the Company shall pay to the Executive a cash
amount (the "Severance Amount") equal to two times the sum of
<PAGE>2

          (i)  the Executive's annual Base Salary; and (ii) the
          highest bonus amount payable to the Executive in
          respect of either of the last two fiscal years of the
          Company ending immediately prior to the Change of
          Control Date.

The Severance Amount shall be paid in a single lump sum as soon
as practicable, but in no event more than 10 business days (or at
such earlier date required by law), following the Executive's
date of termination.

          (c)  Termination of Employment Following a Potential
Change of Control.  Notwithstanding Section 1(a), if (i) the
Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause
(as defined below) after the occurrence of a Potential Change of
Control and prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control and
(ii) a Change of Control occurs within one year of such
termination, the Executive shall be deemed, solely for purposes
of determining his rights under this Agreement, to have remained
employed until the date such Change of Control occurs and to have
been terminated by the Company without Cause immediately after
this Agreement becomes effective.

          2.   Definitions.  (a)  Change of Control.  For the
purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean (i)
a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party and for
which the approval of any shareholders of the Company is
required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
of securities of the Company representing 25% or more of the
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
securities or (iii) a sale or transfer of substantially all of
the assets of the Company.

          (b)  Potential Change of Control.  For the purposes of
this Agreement, a Potential Change of Control shall be deemed to
have occurred if (i)  any "person" (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) commences a tender offer for securities, which
if consummated, would result in such person owning 20% or more of
the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
securities; (ii) the Company enters into an agreement the con-
summation of which would constitute a Change of Control; (iii)
proxies for the election of directors of the Company are
solicited by anyone other than the Company; or (iv) any other
event occurs which is deemed to be a Potential Change of Control
by the Board.

          (c)  Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause"
means (i) the Executive's conviction or plea of nolo contendere
to a felony; (ii) an act or acts of extreme dishonesty or gross
misconduct on the Executive's part which result or are intended
to result in material damage to the Company's business or
reputation; or (iii) repeated material violations by the
Executive of his position, authority or responsibilities as in
effect at the Change of Control Date, which violations are
demonstrably willful and deliberate on the Executive's part and
which result in material damage to the Company's business or
reputation.
<PAGE>3

          (d)  Good Reason.  "Good Reason" means the occurrence
of any of the following, without the express written consent of
the Executive, after the occurrence of a Change of Control:

          (i)  (A) the assignment to the Executive of any duties
     inconsistent in any material adverse respect with the
     Executive's position, authority or responsibilities as in
     effect at the Change of Control Date, or (B) any other
     material adverse change in such position, including titles,
     authority or responsibilities;

          (ii)  any failure by the Company, other than an
     insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by the Company
     promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the
     Executive, to provide the Executive with a base salary or
     incentive compensation opportunities at a level which, in
     each case, is at least the same as the base salary paid, or
     incentive compensation opportunities made available, to the
     Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control Date;

          (iii) the failure by the Company to permit the
     Executive (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents) to
     participate in or be covered under all pension, retirement,
     deferred compensation, savings, medical, dental, health,
     disability, group life, accidental death and travel accident
     insurance plans and programs of the Company and its
     affiliated companies at a level that is commensurate with
     the Executive's participation in such plans immediately
     prior to the Change of Control Date (or, if more favorable
     to the Executive, at the level made available to the
     Executive or other similarly situated officers at any time
     thereafter); or

          (iv)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be based
     at any office or location more than 50 miles from that
     location at which he performed his services for the Company
     immediately prior to the Change of Control, except for
     travel reasonably required in the performance of the Ex-
     ecutive's responsibilities; or

          (v)  any failure by the Company to obtain the
     assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a
     successor as contemplated by Section 6(b).

In no event shall the mere occurrence of a Change of Control,
absent any further impact on the Executive, be deemed to
constitute Good Reason.

          (e) Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,
Disability shall mean the Executive's inability to perform the
duties of his position, as determined in accordance with the
policies and procedures applicable with respect to the Company's
long-term disability plan, as in effect immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date.

3.   Other Benefits and Provisions Relating to Termination.

          (a)  Earned Salary and Accrued Obligations.  The
Severance Amount shall be in addition to and neither a limitation
of, nor an offset against, the amount payable to the Executive in
respect of (i) his base salary earned through the date of
termination and (ii) any vested amounts or benefits owing to the
Executive under the Company's otherwise applicable employee
benefit plans and programs, including any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued earnings
thereon) and not yet paid by the Company and any accrued vacation
pay not yet paid by the Company.

          (b)  Continuation of Benefits. If the Executive is
entitled to receive the Severance Amount, the Executive (and, to
the extent applicable, his dependents) shall be entitled, after
the date of termination until the earlier of (x) the second
anniversary of his date of termination (the "End Date") or (y)
the date the Executive becomes eligible for comparable benefits
under a similar plan, policy or program of a subsequent employer,
to continue participation in all of the Company's employee and
executive welfare and fringe benefit plans (the "Benefit Plans").
To the extent any such benefits cannot be provided under the
terms of the applicable plan, policy or program, the Company
shall provide a comparable benefit under another plan or from the
Company's general assets.  The Executive's participation in the
Benefit Plans will be on the same terms and conditions that would
have applied had the Executive continued to be employed by the
Company through the End Date.

          (c) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 7(d).  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice
given, in the case of a termination for Cause, within 10 business
days of the Company's having actual knowledge of the events
giving rise to such termination, and in the case of a termination
for Good Reason, within 180 days of the Executive's having actual
knowledge of the events giving rise to such termination, and
which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this
Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
indicated, and (iii) if the termination date is other than the
date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date of
this Agreement (which date shall be not more than 15 days after
the giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which
contributes to a showing of Good Reason shall not waive any right
of the Executive hereunder or preclude the Executive from
asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights
hereunder.

          (d)  Discharge of the Company's Obligations.  Except as
expressly provided in the last sentence of this Section 3(d), the
Severance Amount and the amounts payable and benefits provided in
respect of the Executive pursuant to Section 3 following
termination of his employment shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of the Executive's rights under this Agreement and
any other claims he may have in respect of his employment by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Such amounts shall
constitute liquidated damages with respect to any and all such
rights and claims and, upon the Executive's receipt of such
amounts, the Company shall be released and discharged from any
and all liability to the Executive in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Executive's
employment with the Company and its subsidiaries.  Nothing in
this Section 3(d) shall be construed to release the Company from
its obligation under Section 3(e) below to indemnify the
Executive.
<PAGE>5
     
          (e)  Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify the
Executive and hold the Executive harmless from and against any
claim, loss or cause of action arising from or out of the Ex-
ecutive's performance as an officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any other capacity,
including any fiduciary capacity, in which the Executive serves
at the request of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws (the "Governing Documents"), provided that in no event
shall the protection afforded to the Executive hereunder be less
than that afforded under the Governing Documents as in effect im-
mediately prior to the Change of Control Date.

          (f)  Certain Further Payments by the Company.

          (i)  In the event that any amount or benefit paid or
     distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement,
     taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid
     or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any
     affiliated company (collectively, the "Covered Payments"),
     are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed
     under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended (the "Code"), or any similar tax that may hereafter
     be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the
     time specified in Section 3(f)(v) below an additional amount
     (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount
     retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered
     Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered
     Payments and any Federal, state and local income or
     employment tax and Excise Tax on the Tax Reimbursement
     Payment provided for by this Section 3(f), but before deduc-
     tion for any Federal, state or local income or employment
     tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to
     the amount of the Covered Payments.

          (ii)  For purposes of determining whether any of the
     Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
     amount of such Excise Tax,

                    (A)  such Covered Payments will be treated as
               "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
               280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in
               excess of the "base amount" (as defined under
               Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated
               as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except
               to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of
               the Company's independent certified public
               accountants appointed prior to the Change of
               Control Date or tax counsel selected by such
               accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a
               reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered
               Payments (in whole or in part) either do not
               constitute "parachute payments" or represent
               reasonable compensation for personal services
               actually rendered (within the meaning of Section
               280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base
               amount," or such "parachute payments" are other-
               wise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
<PAGE>6

                    (B)  the value of any non-cash benefits or
               any deferred payment or benefit shall be deter-
               mined by the Accountants in accordance with the
               principles of Section 280G of the Code.

          (iii)  For purposes of determining the amount of the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to
     pay:

                    (A)  Federal income taxes at the highest
               applicable marginal rate of Federal income tax-
               ation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reim-
               bursement Payment is to be made, and

                    (B)  any applicable state and local income
               taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of
               taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax
               Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the
               maximum reduction in Federal income taxes which
               could be obtained from the deduction of such state
               or local taxes if paid in such year.

          (iv)  In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently
     determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding
     or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less
     than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating
     the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, the Executive shall
     repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such
     reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the
     portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would
     not have been paid if such Excise Tax had been applied in
     initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus
     interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
     provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of
     the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be refunded to the Company
     has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority,
     repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund
     or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive,
     and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed
     interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax
     authority for the period it held such portion.  The
     Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the
     course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating
     the expenses thereof) if the Executive's good faith claim
     for refund or credit is denied.
<PAGE>7

          In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by
     the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or
     negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the
     amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Re-
     imbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to,
     by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which
     cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement
     Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax
     Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any
     interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at
     the time that the amount of such excess is finally
     determined.

          (v)  The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof)
     provided for in Section 3(f)(i) above shall be paid to the
     Executive not later than 10 business days following the
     payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if
     the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion
     thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date
     on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to the
     Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by
     the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Re-
     imbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax
     Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate
     provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as
     the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later
     than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered
     Payment.  In the event that the amount of the estimated Tax
     Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently
     determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
     loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth
     business day after written demand by the Company for payment
     (together with interest at the rate provided in Section
     1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).

          4.   Full Settlement.  The Company's obligation to make
the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to
perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any
circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the
Company may have against the Executive or others whether by
reason of the subsequent employment of the Executive or
otherwise.

          5.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  If the Executive asserts
any claim in any contest (whether initiated by the Executive or
by the Company) as to the validity, enforceability or inter-
pretation of any provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
pay the Executive's legal expenses (or cause such expenses to be
paid) including, without limitation, his reasonable attorney's
fees, on a quarterly basis, upon presentation of proof of such
expenses, provided that the Executive shall reimburse the Company
for such amounts, plus simple interest thereon at the 90-day
United States Treasury Bill rate as in effect from time to time,
compounded annually, if the Executive shall not prevail, in whole
or in part, as to any material issue as to the validity, en-
forceability or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

          6.  Successors.  (a)  This Agreement is personal to the
Executive and, without the prior written consent of the Company,
shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will
or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.
<PAGE>8

          (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Company and its successors.  The Company
shall require any successor to all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the Company, whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, acquisition of
stock, or otherwise, by an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession
had taken place.

          7.  Miscellaneous.  (a)  Applicable Law.  This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, applied without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.

          (b)  Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy arising
under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by
binding arbitration.  The arbitration shall be held in New York,
New York and except to the extent inconsistent with this
Agreement, shall be conducted in accordance with the Expedited
Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect at the time of the arbitration, and
otherwise in accordance with principles which would be applied by
a court of law or equity.   The arbitrator shall be acceptable to
both the Company and the Executive.  If the parties cannot agree
on an acceptable arbitrator, the dispute shall be heard by a
panel of three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the parties
and the third appointed by the other two arbitrators.

          (c)  Entire Agreement.  Upon the Change of Control
Date, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the matters referred
to herein.  No other agreement relating to the terms of the
Executive's employment by the Company, oral or otherwise, shall
be binding between the parties unless it is in writing and signed
by the party against whom enforcement is sought.  There are no
promises, representations, inducements or statements between the
parties other than those that are expressly contained herein.
This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their
respective successors and legal representatives.  In the event
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof
shall not be affected.  The Executive acknowledges that he is
entering into this Agreement of his own free will and accord, and
with no duress, that he has read this Agreement and that he
understands it and its legal consequences.

          (d)  Notices.  All notices and other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by hand-delivery

          KEY EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENT
          _____________________________________________


          THIS AGREEMENT between ______________________________a
__________ corporation (the "Company"), and ________________ (the
"Executive"), dated as of this ___ day of ______________, 1995.


                      W I T N E S S E T H :
                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


          WHEREAS, the Company has employed the Executive in an
executive officer position and has determined that the Executive
holds a position of significant importance with the Company;

          WHEREAS, the Company believes that, in the event it is
confronted with a situation that could result in a change in
ownership or control of the its parent, USLIFE Corporation (the
"Parent"), continuity of management at the Company will be
essential to the Company's continued successful operations;

          WHEREAS, the Company understands that any such
situation will present significant concerns for the Executive
with respect to his financial and job security;

          WHEREAS, the Company desires to assure itself of the
Executive's services during the period in which it is confronting
such a situation, and to provide the Executive certain financial
assurances to enable the Executive to perform the
responsibilities of his position without undue distraction and to
exercise his judgment without bias due to his personal
circumstances;

          WHEREAS, to achieve these objectives, the Company and
the Executive desire to enter into an agreement providing the
Company and the Executive with certain rights and obligations
upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Section
2);

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
mutual covenants herein contained, it is hereby agreed by and
between the Company and the Executive as follows:
<PAGE>2

          1.   Operation of Agreement.  (a) Effective Date.  The
effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which a
Change of Control occurs (the "Change of Control Date"), provided
that, except as provided in Section 1(c), if the Executive is not
employed by the Company on the Change of Control Date, this
Agreement shall be void and without effect.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, prior to the occurrence of a Potential Change of
Control (as defined below) or a Change of Control, the Executive
is demoted, this Agreement shall be void and without effect.

     (b)  Employment Protection Benefits.  If, on or before the
first anniversary of the Change of Control Date, (x) the Company
terminates the Executive's employment other than due to
Disability (as defined below) or for Cause (as defined below) or
(y) the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (as
defined below), the Company shall pay to the Executive a cash
amount (the "Severance Amount") equal to two times the sum of
     
     (i)  the Executive's annual Base Salary; and (ii) the
     highest bonus amount payable to the Executive in respect of
     either of the last two fiscal years of the Company ending
     immediately prior to the Change of Control Date.

The Severance Amount shall be paid in a single lump sum as soon
as practicable, but in no event more than 10 business days (or at
such earlier date required by law), following the Executive's
date of termination.

          (c)  Termination of Employment Following a Potential
Change of Control.  Notwithstanding Section 1(a), if (i) the
Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause
(as defined below) after the occurrence of a Potential Change of
Control and prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control and
(ii) a Change of Control occurs within one year of such
termination, the Executive shall be deemed, solely for purposes
of determining his rights under this Agreement, to have remained
employed until the date such Change of Control occurs and to have
been terminated by the Company without Cause immediately after
this Agreement becomes effective.

          2.   Definitions.  (a)  Change of Control.  For the
purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall mean (i)
a merger or consolidation to which the Parent is a party and for
which the approval of any shareholders of the Parent is required;
(ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and
14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
securities of the Parent representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of the Parent's then outstanding securities or (iii)
a sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of the
Parent.
<PAGE>3

          (b)  Potential Change of Control.  For the purposes of
this Agreement, a Potential Change of Control shall be deemed to
have occurred if (i)  any "person" (as such term is used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended) commences a tender offer for securities, which
if consummated, would result in such person owning 20% or more of
the combined voting power of the Parent's then outstanding
securities; (ii) the Parent enters into an agreement the con-
summation of which would constitute a Change of Control; (iii)
proxies for the election of directors of the Parent are solicited
by anyone other than the Parent; or (iv) any other event occurs
which is deemed to be a Potential Change of Control by the Board
of Directors of the Parent.

          (c)  Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause"
means (i) the Executive's conviction or plea of nolo contendere
to a felony; (ii) an act or acts of extreme dishonesty or gross
misconduct on the Executive's part which result or are intended
to result in material damage to the Company's or the Parent's
business or reputation; or (iii) repeated material violations by
the Executive of his position, authority or responsibilities as
in effect at the Change of Control Date, which violations are
demonstrably willful and deliberate on the Executive's part and
which result in material damage to the Company's or the Parent's
business or reputation.

          (d)  Good Reason.  "Good Reason" means the occurrence
of any of the following, without the express written consent of
the Executive, after the occurrence of a Change of Control:

          (i)  (A) the assignment to the Executive of any duties
     inconsistent in any material adverse respect with the
     Executive's position, authority or responsibilities as in
     effect at the Change of Control Date, or (B) any other
     material adverse change in such position, including titles,
     authority or responsibilities;

          (ii)  any failure by the Company, other than an
     insubstantial or inadvertent failure remedied by the Company
     promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the
     Executive, to provide the Executive with a base salary or
     incentive compensation opportunities at a level which, in
     each case, is at least the same as the base salary paid, or
     incentive compensation opportunities made available, to the
     Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control Date;
<PAGE>4

          (iii) the failure by the Company to permit the
     Executive (and, to the extent applicable, his dependents) to
     participate in or be covered under all pension, retirement,
     deferred compensation, savings, medical, dental, health,
     disability, group life, accidental death and travel accident
     insurance plans and programs of the Company and its
     affiliated companies at a level that is commensurate with
     the Executive's participation in such plans immediately
     prior to the Change of Control Date (or, if more favorable
     to the Executive, at the level made available to the
     Executive or other similarly situated officers at any time
     thereafter); or

          (iv)  the Company's requiring the Executive to be based
     at any office or location more than 50 miles from that
     location at which he performed his services for the Company
     immediately prior to the Change of Control, except for
     travel reasonably required in the performance of the Ex-
     ecutive's responsibilities; or

          (v)  any failure by the Company to obtain the
     assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by a
     successor as contemplated by Section 6(b).

In no event shall the mere occurrence of a Change of Control,
absent any further impact on the Executive, be deemed to
constitute Good Reason.

          (e) Disability.  For purposes of this Agreement,
Disability shall mean the Executive's inability to perform the
duties of his position, as determined in accordance with the
policies and procedures applicable with respect to the Company's
long-term disability plan, as in effect immediately prior to the
Change of Control Date.

3.   Other Benefits and Provisions Relating to Termination.

          (a)  Earned Salary and Accrued Obligations.  The
Severance Amount shall be in addition to and neither a limitation
of, nor an offset against, the amount payable to the Executive in
respect of (i) his base salary earned through the date of
termination and (ii) any vested amounts or benefits owing to the
Executive under the Company's otherwise applicable employee
benefit plans and programs, including any compensation previously
deferred by the Executive (together with any accrued earnings
thereon) and not yet paid by the Company and any accrued vacation
pay not yet paid by the Company.
<PAGE>5

          (b)  Continuation of Benefits. If the Executive is
entitled to receive the Severance Amount, the Executive (and, to
the extent applicable, his dependents) shall be entitled, after
the date of termination until the earlier of (x) the second
anniversary of his date of termination (the "End Date") or (y)
the date the Executive becomes eligible for comparable benefits
under a similar plan, policy or program of a subsequent employer,
to continue participation in all of the Company's employee and
executive welfare and fringe benefit plans (the "Benefit Plans").
To the extent any such benefits cannot be provided under the
terms of the applicable plan, policy or program, the Company
shall provide a comparable benefit under another plan or from the
Company's general assets.  The Executive's participation in the
Benefit Plans will be on the same terms and conditions that would
have applied had the Executive continued to be employed by the
Company through the End Date.

          (c) Notice of Termination.  Any termination by the
Company for Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason shall be
communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto
given in accordance with Section 7(d).  For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice
given, in the case of a termination for Cause, within 10 business
days of the Company's having actual knowledge of the events
giving rise to such termination, and in the case of a termination
for Good Reason, within 180 days of the Executive's having actual
knowledge of the events giving rise to such termination, and
which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this
Agreement relied upon, (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for
termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so
indicated, and (iii) if the termination date is other than the
date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date of
this Agreement (which date shall be not more than 15 days after
the giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which
contributes to a showing of Good Reason shall not waive any right
of the Executive hereunder or preclude the Executive from
asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights
hereunder.

          (d)  Discharge of the Company's Obligations.  Except as
expressly provided in the last sentence of this Section 3(d), the
Severance Amount and the amounts payable and benefits provided in
respect of the Executive pursuant to Section 3 following
termination of his employment shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of the Executive's rights under this Agreement and
any other claims he may have in respect of his employment by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.  Such amounts shall
constitute liquidated damages with respect to any and all such
rights and claims and, upon the Executive's receipt of such
amounts, the Company shall be released and discharged from any
and all liability to the Executive in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Executive's
employment with the Company and its subsidiaries.  Nothing in
this Section 3(d) shall be construed to release the Company from
its obligation under Section 3(e) below to indemnify the
Executive.
<PAGE>6
     
          (e)  Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify the
Executive and hold the Executive harmless from and against any
claim, loss or cause of action arising from or out of the Ex-
ecutive's performance as an officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any other capacity,
including any fiduciary capacity, in which the Executive serves
at the request of the Company to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
By-Laws (the "Governing Documents"), provided that in no event
shall the protection afforded to the Executive hereunder be less
than that afforded under the Governing Documents as in effect im-
mediately prior to the Change of Control Date.

          (f)  Certain Further Payments by the Company.

          (i)  In the event that any amount or benefit paid or
     distributed to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement,
     taken together with any amounts or benefits otherwise paid
     or distributed to the Executive by the Company or any
     affiliated company (collectively, the "Covered Payments"),
     are or become subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed
     under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended (the "Code"), or any similar tax that may hereafter
     be imposed, the Company shall pay to the Executive at the
     time specified in Section 3(f)(v) below an additional amount
     (the "Tax Reimbursement Payment") such that the net amount
     retained by the Executive with respect to such Covered
     Payments, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Covered
     Payments and any Federal, state and local income or
     employment tax and Excise Tax on the Tax Reimbursement
     Payment provided for by this Section 3(f), but before deduc-
     tion for any Federal, state or local income or employment
     tax withholding on such Covered Payments, shall be equal to
     the amount of the Covered Payments.

          (ii)  For purposes of determining whether any of the
     Covered Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the
     amount of such Excise Tax,

                    (A)  such Covered Payments will be treated as
               "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
               280G of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in
               excess of the "base amount" (as defined under
               Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated
               as subject to the Excise Tax, unless, and except
               to the extent that, in the good faith judgment of
               the Parent's independent certified public
               accountants appointed prior to the Change of
               Control Date or tax counsel selected by such
               accountants (the "Accountants"), the Company has a
               reasonable basis to conclude that such Covered
               Payments (in whole or in part) either do not
               constitute "parachute payments" or represent
               reasonable compensation for personal services
               actually rendered (within the meaning of Section
               280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code) in excess of the "base
               amount," or such "parachute payments" are other-
               wise not subject to such Excise Tax, and
<PAGE>7

                    (B)  the value of any non-cash benefits or
               any deferred payment or benefit shall be deter-
               mined by the Accountants in accordance with the
               principles of Section 280G of the Code.

          (iii)  For purposes of determining the amount of the
     Tax Reimbursement Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to
     pay:

                    (A)  Federal income taxes at the highest
               applicable marginal rate of Federal income tax-
               ation for the calendar year in which the Tax Reim-
               bursement Payment is to be made, and

                    (B)  any applicable state and local income
               taxes at the highest applicable marginal rate of
               taxation for the calendar year in which the Tax
               Reimbursement Payment is to be made, net of the
               maximum reduction in Federal income taxes which
               could be obtained from the deduction of such state
               or local taxes if paid in such year.

          (iv)  In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently
     determined by the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding
     or negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to be less
     than the amount taken into account hereunder in calculating
     the Tax Reimbursement Payment made, the Executive shall
     repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such
     reduction in the Excise Tax is finally determined, the
     portion of such prior Tax Reimbursement Payment that would
     not have been paid if such Excise Tax had been applied in
     initially calculating such Tax Reimbursement Payment, plus
     interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate
     provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of
     the Tax Reimbursement Payment to be refunded to the Company
     has been paid to any Federal, state or local tax authority,
     repayment thereof shall not be required until actual refund
     or credit of such portion has been made to the Executive,
     and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed
     interest received or credited to the Executive by such tax
     authority for the period it held such portion.  The
     Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the
     course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating
     the expenses thereof) if the Executive's good faith claim
     for refund or credit is denied.
<PAGE>8

          In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by
     the Accountants or pursuant to any proceeding or
     negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the
     amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Tax Re-
     imbursement Payment is made (including, but not limited to,
     by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which
     cannot be determined at the time of the Tax Reimbursement
     Payment), the Company shall make an additional Tax
     Reimbursement Payment in respect of such excess (plus any
     interest or penalty payable with respect to such excess) at
     the time that the amount of such excess is finally
     determined.

          (v)  The Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion thereof)
     provided for in Section 3(f)(i) above shall be paid to the
     Executive not later than 10 business days following the
     payment of the Covered Payments; provided, however, that if
     the amount of such Tax Reimbursement Payment (or portion
     thereof) cannot be finally determined on or before the date
     on which payment is due, the Company shall pay to the
     Executive by such date an amount estimated in good faith by
     the Accountants to be the minimum amount of such Tax Re-
     imbursement Payment and shall pay the remainder of such Tax
     Reimbursement Payment (together with interest at the rate
     provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as
     the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later
     than 45 calendar days after payment of the related Covered
     Payment.  In the event that the amount of the estimated Tax
     Reimbursement Payment exceeds the amount subsequently
     determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a
     loan by the Company to the Executive, payable on the fifth
     business day after written demand by the Company for payment
     (together with interest at the rate provided in Section
     1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).

          4.   Full Settlement.  The Company's obligation to make
the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to
perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any
circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the
Company may have against the Executive or others whether by
reason of the subsequent employment of the Executive or
otherwise.
<PAGE>9

          5.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  If the Executive asserts
any claim in any contest (whether initiated by the Executive or
by the Company) as to the validity, enforceability or inter-
pretation of any provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
pay the Executive's legal expenses (or cause such expenses to be
paid) including, without limitation, his reasonable attorney's
fees, on a quarterly basis, upon presentation of proof of such
expenses, provided that the Executive shall reimburse the Company
for such amounts, plus simple interest thereon at the 90-day
United States Treasury Bill rate as in effect from time to time,
compounded annually, if the Executive shall not prevail, in whole
or in part, as to any material issue as to the validity, en-
forceability or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement.

          6.  Successors.  (a)  This Agreement is personal to the
Executive and, without the prior written consent of the Company,
shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will
or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's
legal representatives.

          (b)  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and
be binding upon the Company and its successors.  The Company
shall require any successor to all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the Company, whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, acquisition of
stock, or otherwise, by an agreement in form and substance
satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to
perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent
as the Company would be required to perform if no such succession
had taken place.

          7.  Miscellaneous.  (a)  Applicable Law.  This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, applied without reference to
principles of conflict of laws.

          (b)  Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy arising
under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by
binding arbitration.  The arbitration shall be held in New York,
New York and except to the extent inconsistent with this
Agreement, shall be conducted in accordance with the Expedited
Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect at the time of the arbitration, and
otherwise in accordance with principles which would be applied by
a court of law or equity.   The arbitrator shall be acceptable to
both the Company and the Executive.  If the parties cannot agree
on an acceptable arbitrator, the dispute shall be heard by a
panel of three arbitrators, one appointed by each of the parties
and the third appointed by the other two arbitrators.
<PAGE>10

          (c)  Entire Agreement.  Upon the Change of Control
Date, this Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the matters referred
to herein.  No other agreement relating to the terms of the
Executive's employment by the Company, oral or otherwise, shall
be binding between the parties unless it is in writing and signed
by the party against whom enforcement is sought.  There are no
promises, representations, inducements or statements between the
parties other than those that are expressly contained herein.
This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their
respective successors and legal representatives.  In the event
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the
validity  and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof
shall not be affected.  The Executive acknowledges that he is
entering into this Agreement of his own free will and accord, and
with no duress, that he has read this Agreement and that he
understands it and its legal consequences.

          (d)  Notices.  All notices and other communications

     WHEREAS, Landlord  and Tenant are parties to that certain Lease Agreement,
dated as  of December 30,  1986 (the "Original Lease"), whereby Landlord leased
to Tenant and Tenant hired from Landlord a portion of the basement level, first

<PAGE>2


     WHEREAS, pursuant  to that  certain Fourth Amendment to Lease, dated as of
April 14,  1995, (the "Fourth Amendment"), Landlord and Tenant further modified
the Lease  to, among  other things,  provide for (i) the surrender by Tenant to

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby  acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby agree to modify the Lease
as follows:

     1.   Definitions.   All capitalized  terms used  and not otherwise defined
          herein shall  have the  respective meanings  assigned to  them in the
          Lease.   The term  "Effective Date"  shall mean  the date that is the
          earlier of  (i) December 31,  1995 and  (ii) the Plan Date; provided,
          however, that  upon the occurrence of a default under the Lease which
          continues beyond  the expiration  of any  applicable notice  and cure
          period, the "Effective Date", at Landlord's election, shall be deemed
          to be the date upon which such default occurred.

     2.   Lease Term.   Effective  as of  the Effective  Date, the  term of the
          Lease shall be extended until December 31, 2006 (or such earlier date
          on which the term may end pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or
          covenants of  the Lease,  as modified  by this  Fifth  Amendment,  or
          pursuant to  law, but  subject to  Tenant's right  to extend the term

               Revitalization of  Lower Manhattan, dated December 15, 1994 (the

               abatement applicable  to certain  lease renewals.   Landlord and
               Tenant desire  to obtain such abatement in respect of the Lease,
               as modified  by this Fifth Amendment, to the extent practicable,
               and shall  reasonably cooperate  with each  other in  (i) making

               jurisdiction and  (ii) modifying  the Lease, as modified by this
               Fifth Amendment,  if necessary to qualify the Lease, as modified
               by this Fifth Amendment, for such abatement, provided that in no
               event shall  (x) the economic terms of the Lease, as modified by
               this Fifth Amendment, be modified in any respect, (y) Landlord's
               rights be  decreased  or  Landlord's  obligations  be  increased
               (except  as   provided  in   clause  (i)   above)  or   (z)  the
               implementation of  such abatement  result in  a reduction in the
               payments required to be made by other tenants at the Building in
               respect of  Taxes.   In the  event an  abatement or reduction of
               Taxes  is   obtained  pursuant  to  the  Plan  (as  enacted  and
               thereafter in  effect from  time to  time) and such abatement or
               reduction is thereafter terminated or reduced (unless due solely
               to Landlord's  acts, failure  to perform any acts required under
               the Plan (as enacted and thereafter in effect from time to time)
               (including the  timely payment  of real  property taxes provided
               Tenant shall  have paid  to Landlord the applicable installments
               of the  Tax Payment  when due)  or  misrepresentations),  Tenant
               shall be  responsible for  and shall  pay to  Landlord within 10
               days after  demand the  resulting increase  in Taxes  payable by
               Landlord (including  any retroactive increase), and all interest
               and penalties  relating thereto.   In  the event an abatement or
               reduction of  Taxes is obtained pursuant to the Plan (as enacted
               and thereafter  in effect  from time to time) and such abatement
               or reduction  is thereafter  terminated or reduced due solely to
               Landlord's acts,  failure to perform any acts required under the
               Plan (as  enacted and thereafter in effect from time to time) or
               misrepresentations, Tenant's  Tax Payment shall be determined as
               if such abatement or reduction were not terminated or reduced as
               aforesaid.

                    carried by owners of similar buildings in Manhattan, or (C)
                    Landlord is  not reimbursed therefor due to the coinsurance
                    provisions  of   its  insurance   policies  on  account  of

                    facilities, luncheon club, athletic and recreational club
                    which is not generally provided by landlords of first class
                    office buildings in lower Manhattan;

              (xix) the cost of any special or extra heating, ventilating, air-
                    conditioning, janitorial or other special or extra services
                    provided to tenants during other than Business Hours and
                    which is not provided to Tenant (other than at Tenant's
                    direct expense);

               (xx) any fee for the management of the Building to the extent
                    materially in excess of management fees that would be
                    payable to a reputable first-class management company which
                    is unrelated to Landlord;

              (xxi) arbitration expenses incurred in connection with the
                    leasing of space in the Building or with prosecuting
                    default or eviction proceedings against tenants for
                    nonpayment of rent; or

             (xxii) any rent, additional rent or other charge under any lease
                    or sublease to or assumed, directly or indirectly, by
                    Landlord;

            (xxiii) costs incurred in performing work or furnishing services
                    for any tenant (including Tenant), whether at such tenant's
                    or Landlord's expense, to the extent that such work or
                    service is materially in excess of any work or service that
                    Landlord is obligated to furnish to Tenant at Landlord's
                    expense;

<PAGE>9

             (xxiv) there shall be deducted from Expenses an amount equal to
                    all amounts received by Landlord through proceeds of
                    insurance to the extent the proceeds are compensation for
                    Expenses which (i) previously were included in Expenses
                    hereunder, (ii) are included in Expenses for the Operating
                    Year in which the insurance proceeds are received, or (iii)
                    will be included as Expenses in a subsequent Operating
                    Year;

              (xxv) costs and expenses related to or incurred in connection
                    with the initial construction on the land of the Building
                    and other improvements, whether above or below ground; and

             (xxvi) any expenses related to any retail, parking or garage
                    facilities or space in, on or about the Building or the
                    land upon which the Building is located or appurtenant or
                    adjacent thereto which are not also related to the office
                    portion of the Building.

          (c)  In determining  the amount  of Expenses  for the  Base Operating
               Year  or  any  Operating  Year  thereafter,  Expenses  shall  be
               determined for  such Base Operating Year or Operating Year to be
               an amount  equal to  the like  expenses which  would normally be
               expected to  be incurred  had such  occupancy  been  ninety-five
               percent (95%)  throughout such  Base Operating Year or Operating
               Year.

          (d)  If Landlord  is not  furnishing any  particular work  or service
               (the cost  of which if performed by Landlord would constitute an
               Expense) to  a tenant  because such  tenant  has  undertaken  to
               perform such  work or  service itself in lieu of the performance
               thereof by  Landlord or  because such item of work or service is
               not required by such tenant or for other reasons, Expenses shall
               be determined  to  be  increased  by  an  amount  equal  to  the
               additional Expense  which reasonably  would have  been  incurred
               during such  period by  Landlord if  it had  at its  own expense
               furnished such work or services to such tenant.

     (2)  The  term   "Base  Operating  Year"  shall  mean  the  calendar  year
          commencing on January 1, 1995.

     (3)  The term  "Operating  Year"  shall  mean  each  calendar  year  which
          includes any part of the term.

     (4)  The term  "Tenant's Proportionate  Share" shall  mean a fraction with
          the numerator  equaling the  number of  rentable square  feet in  the
          Premises (excluding  basement  storage  space)  and  the  denominator
          equaling  the   number  of  rentable  square  feet  in  the  Building
          (excluding basement  storage space  and the  lobby newsstand).  As of
          the date hereof, Tenant's Proportionate Share for each portion of the
          Premises are the percentages set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
<PAGE>10


     (5)  The term  "Escalation Statement" shall mean a statement setting forth
          the amount  payable by  Tenant for  a specified Operating Year or Tax
          Year (as defined in Article 4 hereof).

     5.02 For each  Operating Year  commencing during  the term  of this Lease,
          Tenant shall  pay ("Tenant's  Operating Payment")  a sum equal to the
          product obtained  by multiplying  (i) Tenant's Proportionate Share by
          (ii) the  excess of  Expenses  for  any  given  Operating  Year  over
          Expenses incurred in the Base Operating Year.

     5.03 Landlord  shall   furnish  to  Tenant  for  each  Operating  Year  an
          escalation  statement   (the  "Escalation   Statement")  (subject  to
          revision as  hereinafter provided)  setting forth Landlord's estimate
          of Tenant's  Operating Payment for such Operating Year.  Tenant shall
          pay to  Landlord on the first day of each month during such Operating
          Year an  amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of Landlord's estimate of
          Tenant's Operating  Payment for  such Operating  Year.   If  Landlord
          shall  furnish   such  estimate  for  an  Operating  Year  after  the
          commencement thereof,  then (a)  until the  first day  of  the  month
          following the  month in  which such  estimate is furnished to Tenant,
          Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the first day of each month an amount
          equal to  the monthly  sum payable  by Tenant  to Landlord under this
          Section 5.03  for the last month of the preceding Operating Year; (b)
          Landlord shall  notify Tenant  in the Escalation Statement containing
          such estimate  whether the installments of Tenant's Operating Payment
          previously paid  for such  Operating Year  were more or less than the
          installments which  should have  been paid  for such  Operating  Year
          pursuant to  such estimate and (i) if there shall be an underpayment,
          Tenant shall  pay the  amount thereof  within thirty  (30) days after
          being furnished with such Escalation Statement or (ii) if there shall
          be an overpayment, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit in the amount
          thereof against  subsequent payments  of Fixed  Base Rent; and (c) on
          the first day of the month following the month in which such estimate
          is furnished  to Tenant and every month thereafter for the balance of
          such Operating  Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to
          one-twelfth (1/12)  of Tenant's  Operating Payment  as shown  on such
          estimate.   Landlord may  at any  time and from time to time (but not
          more often  than two  (2) times  in any  Operating Year)  furnish  to
          Tenant an  Escalation  Statement  setting  forth  Landlord's  revised
          estimate of  Tenant's Operating  Payment for  a particular  Operating
          Year and  in such case, Tenant's Operating Payment for such Operating
          Year shall  be adjusted  and paid  or credited, as applicable, in the
          same manner as provided in the preceding sentence.

     5.04 After the end of each Operating Year, Landlord shall submit to Tenant
          an annual  Escalation Statement  setting forth  the Expenses  for the
          preceding Operating  Year  and  the  balance  of  Tenant's  Operating
          Payment, if any, due to Landlord from Tenant for such Operating Year.
          If such  annual Escalation Statement shall show that the sums paid by
          Tenant  under   Section  5.03 during  such  Operating  Year  exceeded
          Tenant's Operating  Payment for  such Operating Year, Tenant shall be
          entitled to  a credit in the amount of such excess against subsequent
          
<PAGE>11


          payments under  this Article  5.  If such annual Escalation Statement
          shall show  that the  sums so  paid by Tenant were less than Tenant's
          Operating Payment  for such  Operating Year,  Tenant  shall  pay  the
          amount of  such deficiency  to Landlord within thirty (30) days after
          being furnished  with such  annual Escalation  Statement.  The annual
          Escalation Statements with respect to expenses shall be in reasonable
          detail and  shall either be (i) certified by an officer or partner of
          Landlord (or  of Landlord's  managing agent  if the  Landlord is  the
          landlord named  herein or any affiliate of the landlord named herein)
          or  (ii)  audited  or  certified  by  accountants.    Any  Escalation
          Statement sent  to Tenant  shall be  conclusively binding upon Tenant
          unless, within  ninety (90)  days after  such Escalation Statement is
          delivered, Tenant  shall deliver  notice  to  Landlord  stating  that
          Tenant  objects  to  such  Escalation  Statement  and  specifying  in
          reasonable detail  the respects in which such Escalation Statement is
          being disputed.   Provided  Tenant timely  objects to  an  Escalation
          Statement as  aforesaid, during  the 30-day period following Tenant's
          delivery of  the objection  notice, Tenant shall have the right, upon
          at least  5 days prior notice, to audit (at a location in the City of
          New  York  designated  by  Landlord)  Landlord's  books  and  records
          relating to  the Expenses  for  the  Operating  Year  to  which  such
          Escalation Statement  relates.   Such audit shall be performed within
          the ninety  (90) day  period and  shall be  conducted at such time or
          times during  normal business  hours  as  Landlord  shall  reasonably
          designate and  shall be  performed by an independent certified public
          accounting firm  selected by  Tenant and  approved by Landlord in its
          reasonable judgment.  Tenant shall deliver a copy of the audit report
          prepared by  such independent  accounting firm  to Landlord,  and  if
          Landlord disputes  such report,  either party may submit such dispute
          for expedited  arbitration  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
          Section 5.05.   Notwithstanding  the  making  of  any  objections  by
          Tenant, and  as a  condition to  Tenant's right  to dispute  any such
          Escalation Statement  and to  conduct such audit, Tenant shall pay to
          Landlord when  due the  amount shown on any such Escalation Statement
          as provided in this Article 5.

     5.05 (a)  An expedited  arbitration for  any dispute  pursuant to  Section
          5.04 shall  be commenced  by either party by the delivery of a notice
          (an "Arbitration  Notice") which  shall set  forth the  dispute to be
          determined.   The expedited  arbitration shall  be  determined  by  a
          single arbitrator  who shall be a partner or member of one of the so-
          called "Big  Six" certified public accounting firms (or any successor
          firms thereto)  and who  shall be  jointly selected  by Landlord  and
          Tenant within  five  (5)  Business  Days  after  the  giving  of  the
          Arbitration Notice.   If  the parties  are  unable  to  agree  on  an
          arbitrator within  such five  (5) Business  Day period, either party,
          upon notice  to the  other party, may request such appointment by the
          American Arbitration  Association,  or  any  successor  thereto  (the
          "AAA").   If the  AAA is  unable or  refuses to  act within  five (5)
          Business Days  after request  for an  appointment of an arbitrator is
          made, then  either party  may apply to the Supreme Court of the State
          of New York, New York County for appointment of the arbitrator.
<PAGE>12


          (b)  The arbitrator  designated or  appointed shall  be  directed  to
               reach a  decision regarding  the dispute  that is the subject of
               the  expedited   arbitration  within   ten  (10)  Business  Days
               following the  arbitrator's designation  or  appointment.    The
               expedited arbitration  shall be conducted in accordance with the
               then prevailing  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA (or any
               successor rules  thereto).  The arbitrator's award in connection
               with, or  determination of,  an expedited  arbitration shall  be
               conclusive and  binding  on  the  parties,  and  such  award  or
               determination may be enforced on the application of either party
               by the  order or  judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
               The arbitrator shall be bound by the provisions of the Lease and
               shall not  add  to,  subtract  from  or  otherwise  modify  such
               provisions.   The fees  and expenses  of the  arbitrator and all
               other costs  and expenses  of the expedited arbitration shall be
               borne by  the  parties  equally,  and  all  costs  and  expenses
               incurred  by  each  party  in  connection  with  such  expedited
               arbitration (including  the reasonable fees and disbursements of
               attorneys  or   witnesses)  shall   be  borne   by  each   party
               respectively."

     6.   Termination Option.  Provided Tenant shall not be in Material Default
          under the  terms and  provisions of  the Lease,  as modified  by this
          Fifth Amendment,  both at  the time  Tenant delivers  the Termination
          Notice and  on the Termination Date, Tenant shall have the right (the
          "Termination Right")  to terminate  the Lease,  as modified  by  this
          Fifth Amendment,  as of  June  30,  2005  (the  "Termination  Date").
          Tenant may  exercise the  Termination Right  only  by  (i) delivering
          irrevocable notice  thereof (the "Termination Notice") to Landlord on
          or  before   December  31,   2003  and   (ii) paying  $462,837   (the
          "Termination Payment")  to Landlord on or prior to December 31, 2004.
          Time shall  be of  the essence  with respect  to the  giving  of  the
          Termination Notice  and the  making of  the Termination  Payment.  If
          Tenant properly  exercises the  Termination Right  and  delivers  the
          Termination Payment to Landlord as aforesaid, then on the Termination
          Date this  Lease shall  terminate and end as if such Termination Date
          was the  Expiration Date  of the  Lease, as  modified by  this  Fifth
          Amendment.   Tenant shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes
          and other  payments (including,  without limitation,  transfer taxes)
          required to  be paid  in connection  with  or  relating  to  Tenant's
          exercise of  the Termination  Right, regardless of whether such taxes
          or other  payments are  the obligation of Landlord or Tenant.  Tenant
          shall  indemnify   and  hold  harmless  Landlord  and  its  partners,
          directors,  officers,  principals,  agents,  shareholders,  trustees,
          trust beneficiaries,  investment  managers  and  employees  from  and
          against any  and all  liability, damages,  claims, costs  or expenses
          relating to the payment of any taxes or other payments required to be
          paid in  connection with  or relating  to Tenant's  exercise  of  the
          Termination Right,  together with all costs, expenses and liabilities
          incurred in  or in  connection with  each such  claim  or  action  or
          proceeding  brought   thereon,  including,  without  limitation,  all
          reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
<PAGE>13


     7.   Option to  Renew.   Effective as of the Effective Date, Article 40 of
          the Lease  shall  be  deleted  in  its  entirety  and  the  following
          substituted in its place:

     "40.01.  (a)   Provided that  Tenant is not in Material Default under this
     lease, Tenant  shall have  the option to extend the term of this lease for
     two additional  periods of 5 years (each, an "Extended Term" and together,
     the "Extended  Terms").  Such option to extend the terms of this lease may
     be exercised  only as  follows.   With respect to the first Extended Term,
     (i) in  the event  that Landlord delivers notice to Tenant no earlier than
     December 31, 2004 and no later than June 30, 2005 that Tenant may exercise
     its option pursuant to this Section 40.01, Tenant shall notify Landlord on
     or before  September 30,  2005 as to whether it wishes to so exercise such
     option; and  (ii) in  the event  that Landlord  delivers notice  to Tenant
     subsequent to  June 30,  2005, or  fails to so deliver such notice, Tenant
     shall notify  Landlord on  or before December 31, 2005 but no earlier than
     July 1, 2005 as to whether it wishes to so exercise its option pursuant to
     this Section  40.01.  With respect to the second Extended Term, (i) in the
     event that  Landlord delivers  such  notice  to  Tenant  no  earlier  than
     December 31, 2009 and no later than June 30, 2010 that Tenant may exercise
     its option pursuant to this Section 40.01, Tenant shall notify Landlord on
     or before  September 30,  2010 as to whether it wishes to so exercise such
     option, and  (ii) in the  event that  Landlord delivers  notice to  Tenant
     subsequent to  June 30,  2010, or  fails to so deliver such notice, Tenant
     shall notify  Landlord on  or before December 31, 2010 but no earlier than
     July 1, 2010 as to whether it wishes to so exercise its option pursuant to
     this Section 40.01.  If Tenant fails to timely give any notice required by
     this Section 40.01, Tenant's option to extend the term of this lease shall
     be terminated  and be deemed waived by Tenant, and of no further force and
     effect and  Landlord shall  have the  right to  lease the  Premises or any
     portion thereof  to  any  entity  for  any  period  commencing  after  the
     expiration of  this lease.   It  is expressly agreed that Tenant shall not
     have an  option to  extend the term of this lease beyond the expiration of
     the second  Extended Term.   If  this lease shall be terminated before the
     commencement of  an Extended  Term, Tenant's  option to extend the term of
     this lease,  or its exercise thereof, or an Extended Term or lease created
     by any  such exercise,  shall be abrogated and rendered null and void.  In
     no event  shall Tenant  be permitted to exercise its option for the second
     Extended  Term  pursuant  to  this  Section  40.01  unless  it  previously
     exercised its  option  for  the  first  Extended  Term  pursuant  to  this
     Section 40.01.

          (b) Upon Tenant's giving notice of its election to extend the term of
              this lease  for an  Extended Term,  pursuant to Section 40.01(a),
              this lease  shall be  deemed automatically amended as of the date
              following the  Expiration Date with respect to the first Extended
              Term, and  as of  the date  following the  expiration date of the
              first Extended  Term with respect to the Second Extended Term, as
              follows: (i) the  Fixed Base  Rent shall  be equal  to 95% of the
              fair market rent (excluding amounts allocable to electricity) for
              the Premises  for the  applicable  Extended  Term  as  determined
              pursuant to  Section 40.02; (ii) the Expiration Date of the first
              Extended Term  shall be December 31, 2011 and the Expiration Date
              of the second Extended Term shall be December 31, 2016; (iii) for
              purposes of  Article 4,  the Base  Tax  Year  shall  be  the  Tax
              
<PAGE>14


              Year commencing  on July 1, 2006 and ending June 30, 2007 for the
              first Extended  Term and  the Tax Year commencing on July 1, 2011
              and ending  on June  30, 2012  for the Second Extended Term; (iv)
              for purposes  of Article  5, the Base Operating Year shall be the
              Operating Year  commencing  on  January 1,  2007  and  ending  on
              December 31, 2007  for the  first Extended Term and the Operating
              Year commencing  on January 1,  2012 and  ending on  December 31,
              2012 for  the second Extended Term; (v) with respect to the first
              Extended Term  only, this Article 40 shall be modified to provide
              for the  option to  extend the  term of  this lease  for only one
              additional period  of 5 years and (vi) with respect to the second
              Extended Term  only, this  Article 40  shall be  deleted  in  its
              entirety.  Tenant and Landlord shall promptly execute and deliver
              an appropriate  modification  of  this  lease  to  evidence  said
              Extended Terms.

    40.02 (a)  For purposes of this Article 40, in such instances that it is
          provided that Tenant shall pay a "fair market rent" as Fixed Base
          Rent, such fair market rent shall be proposed by Landlord giving
          notice therefor (a "FMR Notice") not later than July 1, 2006 with
          respect to the first Extended Term and not later than July 1, 2011
          with respect to the second Extended Term, and shall exclude amounts
          allocable to electricity.

     (b)  Within 15  Business Days  after Landlord  gives a  FMR Notice, Tenant
          shall notify  Landlord as  to whether  Tenant agrees  with Landlord's
          proposed fair  market rent, and if it does not so agree, Tenant shall
          in such  notice submit to Landlord its proposed fair market rent.  If
          Tenant fails  to respond  as aforesaid  within said  15-Business  Day
          period, Tenant shall be deemed to have agreed to the fair market rent
          proposed by Landlord.

     (c)  If Landlord  and Tenant do not agree upon the fair market rent within
          15 Business Days (the "Negotiation Period") after Tenant delivers its
          notification to  Landlord in  accordance with  clause (b) above,  the
          matter shall be submitted to arbitration in the Borough of Manhattan,
          City of New York, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
          of  the   American  Arbitration   Association   (or   any   successor
          organization), subject, however, to the following modifications:

          (i)  Landlord and Tenant shall each within 15 Business Days after the
               expiration of  the Negotiation Period select an arbitrator, each
               of whom shall be a licensed real estate broker with at least ten
               years experience in the leasing or management of office space in
               the "Downtown"  office  market  in  the  Borough  of  Manhattan.
               Landlord and  Tenant shall  each bear  the fees  and expenses of
               their respective arbitrators.

<PAGE>15

         (ii)  The arbitrators shall be instructed to complete the appraisal
               procedure and to submit their written determinations to Landlord
               and Tenant within 30 days after their meeting.  If said
               arbitrators are unable to agree on the fair market rent within
               such 30-day period, then (A) if the determination by the
               arbitrator appointed by Landlord is less than 110% of the
               determination by the arbitrator appointed by Tenant, the fair
               market rent shall be the average of the two determinations or
               (B) if otherwise, the arbitrators shall within 10 days after
               they report their determinations appoint a third arbitrator with
               similar qualifications to determine the fair market rent.  In
               the event the two arbitrators cannot agree as to the selection
               of the third arbitrator within 15 Business Days after Landlord
               and Tenant are notified of the determination of the arbitrators,
               either party may request that the President of the Real Estate
               Board of New York Inc. (or any successor organization) appoint
               the third arbitrator.  The fees of the third arbitrator shall be
               borne equally by Landlord and Tenant.

               (iii)     The third  arbitrator shall  be instructed to complete
                         the  appraisal   procedure  and   submit   a   written
                         determination of  the fair market rent to Landlord and
                         Tenant  within   30  days   after  such   arbitrator's
                         appointment;

               (iv)      If the difference between the two closest of the three
                         determinations is  less than  10% of the determination
                         which  is   neither  the   highest  nor   the   lowest
                         determination (the  "Middle Determination"),  the fair
                         market  rent   shall  be   the  average  of  said  two
                         determinations.   Otherwise, the  determination of the
                         third arbitrator shall be the fair market rent.

               (v)       In  rendering  such  determinations,  the  arbitrators
                         shall determine  the fair  market rent  that would  be
                         agreed upon  by Landlord  and a  new  unrelated  third
                         party tenant, and in connection therewith shall assume
                         or take  into consideration  as appropriate all of the
                         following: (A) the Landlord and prospective tenant are
                         typically motivated;  (B) the Landlord and prospective
                         tenant are  well informed and well advised and each is
                         acting in what it considers its own best interest; (C)
                         a   reasonable   time   under   then-existing   market
                         conditions  has  been  allowed  for  exposure  of  the
                         Premises  on   the  open   market;  (D)  the  rent  is
                         unaffected by  concessions, special  financing amounts
                         and/or  terms,  or  unusual  services,  fees,  leasing
                         commissions, costs  or credits  in connection with the
                         leasing transaction;  (E) the  Premises  are  fit  for
                         immediate occupancy  and use  "as-is" and  require  no
                         additional work  by Landlord and that no work has been
                         carried out  thereon by  the Tenant, its subtenant, or
                         their predecessors  in interest  during the term which
                         has diminished  the rental  value of the Premises; (F)
                         in the  event the  Premises  have  been  destroyed  or
                         damaged by  fire or  other casualty,  they  have  been
                         fully restored;  (G) the  Premises are  to be let with
                         vacant possession  and subject  to the  provisions  of
                         
<PAGE>16


                         this  lease   for  a  5-year  term,  except  that  the
                         arbitrators shall  take into  consideration  that  for
                         purposes of  Article 4  the Base  Tax  Year  shall  be
                         governed by  the provisions  of  Section 40.01(b)  and
                         that for purposes of Article 5 the Base Operating Year
                         shall   be    governed   by    the    provisions    of
                         Section 40.01(b); and  (H)  market  rents  then  being
                         charged for  comparable space  in other similar office
                         buildings  in  the  same  area.    In  rendering  such
                         decision and  award, the  arbitrator shall  not modify
                         the provisions of this lease.

               (vi)      The decision  and award of the arbitrators shall be in
                         writing and be final and conclusive on all parties and
                         counterpart copies  thereof shall be delivered to each
                         of said  parties.  Judgment may be had on the decision
                         and award  of the arbitrators so rendered in any court
                         of competent jurisdiction.

          (d)  In the event that, prior to the determination of the fair market
               rent for an Extended Term, any payment of Fixed Base Rent is due
               hereunder, Tenant  shall pay (in addition to any Additional Rent
               then required  to be paid by Tenant hereunder) as the Fixed Base
               Rent hereunder  the Fixed  Base Rent specified in Landlord's FMR
               Notice with  respect to  such  Extended  Term  plus  the  amount
               allocable  to   electricity  on  a  "rent  inclusion"  basis  as
               determined in  accordance with  the provisions  of  this  lease,
               subject however  to such  further increases  or decreases as are
               provided in  Article 16  hereof.   If the  arbitrator determines
               that the  Fixed Base Rent payable pursuant to this Article 40 is
               less than that set forth in the FMR Notice, then Tenant shall be
               entitled to  a credit  in the amount of its overpayment for such
               period against subsequent payments of Fixed Base Rent due.

          (e)  After the  determination of  the  fair  market  rent  (excluding
               amounts allocable  to electricity)  by the agreement of Landlord
               and Tenant, as provided in Sections 40.02(a) and 40.02(b), or by
               arbitration, as  provided in  Section 40.02(c),  Fixed Base Rent
               for the  applicable Extended  Term shall  be the  sum of (x) the
               fair market rent as so determined, plus (y) the amount allocable
               to electricity  on a  "rent inclusion"  basis as  determined  in
               accordance with the provisions of this lease, subject however to
               such further  increases or  decreases as are provided in Article
               16 hereof."

     8.   Contraction Space.   (a)   Provided  Tenant shall  not be in Material
          Default under  any of  the terms  and provisions  of  the  Lease,  as
          modified by this Fifth Amendment, both (i) on the date of delivery of
          the Surrender  Notice  (as  hereinafter  defined)  and  (ii)  on  the
          Surrender Date  (as hereinafter defined), Tenant shall have the right
          (the "Surrender  Right") at  one time during the Term of the Lease to
          surrender to  Landlord up  to 12,842  rentable  square  feet  of  the
          Premises, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.
<PAGE>17


          (b)  Tenant may  exercise the  Surrender  Right  only  by  delivering
               irrevocable notice  thereof to Landlord (the "Surrender Notice")
               at least  18 months  prior to  the date  upon which Tenant shall
               surrender the  Surrender Premises  (as hereinafter  defined)  to
               Landlord (the  "Surrender Date"),  which Surrender  Notice shall
               specify the  portion of  the Premises  to  be  surrendered  (the
               "Surrender Premises").   On  or before the date that is 6 months
               prior to  the Surrender  Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (the
               "Surrender Payment")  the unamortized  portion allocable  to the
               Surrender Premises (which allocation shall be made on a rentable
               square foot  basis in  respect of  the Premises  other than  the
               Additional Basement Space) of (i) the Tenant Allowance, (ii) the
               brokerage commission  paid  by  Landlord,  (iii) the  free  rent
               granted to  Tenant  and  (iv) the  rent  differential  from  the
               original lease term attributable to the Surrender Premises in an
               amount equal  to $2.00  per rentable  square foot, which amounts
               shall be  amortized on  a straight-line  basis over  the  period
               commencing on  July 1,  1995 and  ending on  the Expiration Date
               (the Surrender  Payment to be deemed to be Additional Rent).  If
               Tenant shall  fail to  deliver  the  Surrender  Notice  and  the
               Surrender Payment  in accordance  with the  provisions  of  this
               Section 8,  Tenant's exercise  of the  Surrender Right  shall be
               null and void and Tenant shall have no further rights under this
               Section 8.   Tenant shall, in the Surrender Notice (A) represent
               on behalf  of itself,  its successors and assigns that as of the
               date thereof,  it  shall  not  have  not  assigned,  pledged  or
               encumbered the  Lease, as  modified by  this Fifth Amendment, or
               sublet the  Surrender Premises  or done  or suffered  any  other
               action as  a result of which the Lease or the Surrender Premises
               might be  subject to  any lien  or encumbrance, and (B) covenant
               that  such  representation  shall  also  be  true,  correct  and
               accurate on  the  Surrender  Date.    If  Tenant  exercises  the
               Surrender Right  as aforesaid,  then on  or before the Surrender
               Date Tenant  shall vacate  the Surrender  Premises and surrender
               the Surrender  Premises to  Landlord in  the condition  required
               pursuant to  the Lease,  as modified by this Fifth Amendment, as
               if such  date was  initially set  forth as  the Expiration  Date
               applicable thereto.   If  Tenant fails  to  vacate  and  deliver
               possession  of   the  Surrender  Premises  to  Landlord  in  the
               condition required  pursuant to  this Section 8(b), on or before
               the Surrender  Date, then (X) such failure shall be a default by
               Tenant under the Lease, as modified by this Fifth Amendment, and
               (Y) Tenant  shall be  deemed to  be a  holdover in the Surrender
               Premises and,  in addition  to  all  of  Landlord's  rights  and
               remedies set  forth in  the Lease, Landlord shall have the right
               to exercise any of its rights and remedies at law and in equity.
               Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,
               Tenant shall not be permitted to exercise the Surrender Right if
               the Surrender  Premises  shall  not,  in  Landlord's  reasonable
               judgment, be  marketable for  lease to  other tenant(s),  taking
               into  account  the  size  and  configuration  of  the  Surrender
               Premises and  its suitability  for normal  renting purposes.  If
               Landlord objects  to the Surrender Premises designated by Tenant
               in its  Surrender Notice, Landlord shall notify Tenant within 15
               
<PAGE>18


               days of  its receipt  of the  Surrender Notice  and Tenant shall
               thereafter be  required  to  designate  a  new  portion  of  the
               Premises as the Surrender Premises within 10 days after Landlord
               gives Tenant notice of its objection,  and this process shall be
               repeated until  Landlord no  longer  objects  to  the  Surrender
               Premises.   The Surrender  Date shall be extended to be the date
               occurring  12 months  after  Tenant  notifies  Landlord  of  the
               Surrender Premises that is ultimately acceptable as aforesaid.

          (c)  If Tenant  properly exercises  the Surrender Right as aforesaid,
               then effective  as of  the Surrender Date, the term of the Lease
               with respect  to the Surrender Premises shall end and expire and
               Tenant's estate  in and  possession of  the  Surrender  Premises
               shall terminate  and be  wholly extinguished with the same force
               and effect  as if  such date  was initially  set  forth  as  the
               Expiration Date applicable thereto.

          (d)  If Tenant  properly exercises  the Surrender Right as aforesaid,
               then effective  from and after the day immediately following the
               Surrender Date,  (i) Tenant shall continue to lease the Premises
               (other than  the Surrender  Premises) upon  all of the terms and
               conditions of  the Lease,  as modified by this Fourth Amendment,
               (ii) the Fixed Base Rent shall be reduced by the Fixed Base Rent
               attributable to  the Surrender  Premises as set forth on Exhibit
               D, (iii)  the Lease  shall be deemed amended to provide that the
               "Premises" and  the  "premises"  shall  no  longer  include  the
               Surrender Premises,  (iv) Tenant  shall be deemed to have given,
               granted, assigned  and surrendered unto Landlord, its successors
               and assigns,  all right to possession of the Surrender Premises,
               (v) Tenant's Proportionate Share shall be appropriately adjusted
               to  reflect   the  surrender  of  the  Surrender  Premises,  and
               (vi) Landlord shall  be entitled to lease the Surrender Premises
               to any  person or  entity, or take any other action with respect
               thereto, free  from any  claim of Tenant or any person or entity
               claiming through Tenant.

          (e)  Tenant shall  be responsible  for the  payment of  all taxes and
               other payments  (including,  without  limitation,  all  transfer
               taxes) required  to be  paid in  connection with  or relating to
               Tenant's surrender  of the  Surrender  Premises,  regardless  of
               whether such  taxes or  other payments  are  the  obligation  of
               Landlord or  Tenant.   Tenant shall  indemnify and hold harmless
               Landlord and  its  partners,  directors,  officers,  principals,
               agents, shareholders,  trustees, trust beneficiaries, investment
               managers and  employees from  and against any and all liability,
               damages, claims,  costs or  expenses relating  to the payment of
               any taxes  or other  payments required  to be paid in connection
               with  or   relating  to  Tenant's  surrender  of  the  Surrender
               Premises, together  with all  costs,  expenses  and  liabilities
               incurred in  or in  connection with each such claim or action or
               proceeding brought  thereon, including,  without limitation, all
               reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
<PAGE>19


          (f)  Landlord and  Tenant shall,  at the  request of the other party,
               execute an  instrument confirming  the terms of the surrender of
               the  Surrender   Premises,  but  no  such  instrument  shall  be
               necessary to make the terms hereof effective.

     9.   Expansion Space.   Effective  as of the Effective Date, Article 39 of
          the Lease  shall  be  deleted  in  its  entirety  and  the  following
          substituted in its place:

  "39.01.  (a)  Provided this lease is in full force and effect and no default
          has occurred hereunder which is then continuing beyond applicable
          notice and grace periods, Landlord shall notify Tenant if Landlord
          intends to offer for lease to bona fide third parties (i) all or any
          portion of the fifth floor of the Building or (ii) all or any portion
          of the tenth floor of the Building (such portions of the fifth floor
          and the tenth floor shall herein together be called the "Option
          Space"), and Tenant shall have the irrevocable right (during the
          period and in the manner specified in Section 39.01(b)) to lease the
          Option Space; provided, however, such expansion option shall be
          subordinated to any and all expansion options or renewal options held
          by other tenants of the Building in effect on the date hereof and
          affecting the Option Space.  Landlord's notice to Tenant pursuant to
          this Section 39.01(a) (the "Option Notice") shall specify that
          portion of the Option Space that Landlord intends to lease, including
          the number of rentable square feet included therein and the date such
          Option Space will be available for lease (the "Option Space
          Anticipated Delivery Date").

          (b)  If Tenant  shall wish  to exercise  its right under this Section
               39.01 to  lease the  Option Space,  notice of such election (the
               "Answer") shall  be given  to Landlord within a period of twenty
               (20) days after the giving of the Option Notice (the "Acceptance
               Period").

          (c)  (i)  Provided (A) Tenant shall have properly delivered an Answer
               in accordance with Section 39.01(b), and (B) Tenant shall on the
               Option Space Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) not then be
               in default  under this  lease beyond  any applicable  notice and
               cure period,  then on  the  Option  Space  Effective  Date,  the
               applicable Option  Space shall  become and be deemed to comprise
               part of  the Premises  as if  originally included  in the demise
               under this  lease, upon  all of the terms and conditions of this
               lease, except  that:  (I) the Fixed Base Rent shall be increased
               by an amount determined pursuant to Section 39.02, (II) Tenant's
               Proportionate  Share   shall  be  increased  by  the  percentage
               obtained by  dividing (X) the  rentable square  footage  of  the
               Option Space  by (Y) 294,563,  (III) if such Answer is delivered
               prior to  July 1, 1997, (x) Tenant shall receive an abatement of
               Fixed  Base   Rent   payable   on   account   of   such   Option

               Space for  the number of days calculated by multiplying 180 by a
               fraction, the  numerator of which shall be the number of days in
               the period  commencing on  the Option  Space Effective  Date and
               ending on  December 31, 2006, and the denominator of which shall
               be the  number of  days in the period commencing on July 1, 1995
               and ending on December 31, 2006, and (y) Tenant shall receive an
               allowance (each,  the "Supplemental  Tenant  Allowance")  in  an
               amount equal  to the  product obtained by multiplying (A) $25.00
               by (B) the rentable square footage of such Option Space by (C) a
               fraction, the  numerator of which shall be the number of days in
               the period  commencing on  the Option  Space Effective  Date and
               ending on  December 31, 2006, and the denominator of which shall
               be the  number of  days in  the period commencing on the July 1,
               1995 and  ending on December 31, 2006 (which Supplemental Tenant
               Allowance shall  be paid by Landlord to Tenant following (1) the
               completion of the work performed by Tenant to prepare the Option
               Space for  Tenant's occupancy  thereof and  (2) the  delivery to
               Landlord  of   evidence  reasonably   satisfactory  to  Landlord
               establishing  that  all  sums  due  and  owing  to  contractors,
               subcontractors and  materialmen have  been paid, including final
               lien waivers).

               (ii) The term  "Option Space Effective Date" shall mean the date
                    upon which  Landlord  delivers  vacant  possession  of  the
                    Option Space  to Tenant.   Landlord  shall  use  reasonable
                    efforts to deliver possession of the Option Space to Tenant
                    on or  prior to the Option Space Anticipated Delivery Date,
                    including, to the extent advisable in Landlord's reasonable
                    business judgment so to do, the institution and prosecution
                    of holdover  or other  appropriate proceedings  against any
                    occupant of  the Option  Space.   If Landlord  is unable to
                    deliver possession  of the  Option Space  to Tenant for any
                    reason on or prior to the Option Space Anticipated Delivery
                    Date, the  Option Space Effective Date with respect thereto
                    shall be  the date  on which Landlord is able to so deliver
                    possession, and  Landlord  shall  not  be  subject  to  any
                    liability and  this lease  shall not be impaired under such
                    circumstances.   Tenant hereby  waives any right to rescind
                    this lease  under the  provisions of  Section 223-a  of the
                    Real Property Law of the State of New York, and agrees that
                    the provisions  of this  Article are intended to constitute
                    "an express  provision to  the contrary" within the meaning
                    of said Section 223-a.

          (d)       If an  Answer shall  not be timely given or if Tenant shall
                    notify Landlord  within the  Acceptance Period  that Tenant
                    has waived  its right to lease the Option Space, all rights
                    of Tenant  under this  Section 39.01  with respect  to  the
                    Option Space  specified in  the Option Notice shall be void
                    and of  no further  force or  effect, but  Tenant's  rights
                    under this  Section 39.01  with respect to any Option Space
                    not specified  in such  Option Notice  shall remain in full
                    force and effect.

          (e)       Landlord and  Tenant,  at  either  party's  request,  shall
                    promptly execute  and  exchange  an  appropriate  agreement
                    evidencing the  leasing  of  any  Option  Space  reasonably
                    satisfactory to  both parties,  but no such agreement shall
                    be  necessary  in  order  to  make  the  provisions  hereof
                    effective.

   39.02. For purposes of this Article 39 the Fixed Base Rent for the Option
          Space shall be determined as follows:

          (a)  If Tenant's Answer with respect to any Option Space is delivered
               to Landlord  on or  prior to  June 30,  1997,  Fixed  Base  Rent
               payable by  Tenant for  such Option Space (excluding any amounts
               payable on  account of  electricity) shall  equal  (x)  for  the
               period commencing  on the  commencement date  of the  leasing of
               such Option  Space and  ending on  March 31,  2001, the  product
               obtained by  multiplying (A) $18.75  by (B)  the rentable square
               footage of  such Option Space, and (y) for the period commencing
               on April  1, 2001 and ending on the Expiration Date, the product
               obtained by  multiplying (A)  $19.25 by  (B) the rentable square
               footage of such Option Space.

          (b)  If Tenant's Answer with respect to any Option Space is delivered
               to Landlord after June 30, 1997, Fixed Base Rent for such Option
               Space (excluding any amounts payable per account of electricity)
               shall be  the fair market rent determined in accordance with the
               procedures set  forth  in  Section  40.02  of  this  lease,  for
               determining fair market rent for the Extended Terms; except that
               (x) Landlord  shall deliver a FMR Notice to Tenant together with
               the Option  Notice and (y) pending the determination of the fair
               market rent, Tenant shall pay as Fixed Base Rent for such Option
               Space the  Fixed Base  Rent set  forth in the FMR Notice.  After
               the determination  of the  fair market  rent (excluding  amounts
               allocable to  electricity) as  herein provided,  Fixed Base Rent
               for such  Option Space  shall be  the sum of (A) the fair market
               rent  as  so  determined,  plus  (B)  the  amount  allocable  to
               electricity  on  a  "rent  inclusion"  basis  as  determined  in
               accordance with the provisions of this lease, subject however to
               further increases  or decreases as are provided in Article 16 of
               this lease."

     10.  Brokers.   Tenant covenants,  represents and warrants that Tenant has
          had no  dealings or  negotiations with any broker or agent other than
          Equis of  New York (the "Broker") in connection with the consummation
          of this Fifth Amendment, and Tenant covenants and agrees to pay, hold
          harmless and  indemnify Landlord  from and  against any and all cost,
          expense (including  reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs), loss
          and liability for any compensation, commissions or charges claimed by
          any broker  or agent,  other than  the Broker,  with respect  to this
          Fourth Amendment  or the negotiation thereof to the extent such claim
          or claims  by any  such broker or agent are based in whole or in part
          on dealing with Tenant or its representatives and not Landlord or its
          representatives.     Landlord   shall   be   responsible   for   such
          compensation, commissions  or charges to which Broker may be entitled
          pursuant  to  a  separate  agreement  between  Broker  and  Landlord.
          Landlord covenants  and agrees  to pay,  hold harmless  and indemnify

          any compensation,  commissions or  charges in  connection  with  this
          Fourth Amendment  or  the  negotiation  thereof,  claimed  under  any
          circumstances by  the Broker, or claimed by any other broker or agent
          if the  claims by  such other brokers or agents are based in whole or
          part on  dealing with  Landlord or  its representatives  and not with
          Tenant or its representatives.

     11.  No Modification.   Except  as specifically  provided herein,  nothing
          contained in  this Fifth  Amendment shall  be deemed to modify in any
          respect the  terms, provisions  or conditions  of the Lease, and such
          terms, provisions and conditions are hereby ratified and shall remain
          in full force and effect as modified hereby.

     12.  Construction.   In the  event that there is any inconsistency between
          the terms  of this  Fifth Amendment  and the  terms of the Lease, the
          terms of this Fifth Amendment shall prevail.

     13.  Entire Agreement.   This Fifth Amendment contains the sole and entire
          understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to its entire
          subject   matter    and   all    prior   negotiations,   discussions,
          representations, agreements,  and understandings heretofore had among
          the parties with respect thereto are merged herein.

     14.  Counterparts.   This Fifth  Amendment may  be executed  in  duplicate
          counterparts, each  of which  shall be  deemed an original and all of
          which, when  taken  together,  shall  constitute  one  and  the  same
          instrument.

Amendment as of the day and year first above written.

          "(c) (i)  Tenant hereby requests that an application for abatement of
          real property taxes pursuant to Title 4 of the Real Property Tax Law
          (the "RPTL") be filed by Landlord and Tenant (any abatement granted
          pursuant to said Title 4 being hereinafter referred to as the ("Tax
          Abatement") for the Premises.  Tenant hereby acknowledges that Tenant
          shall be solely responsible for (x) the expenditure of all amounts
          and the performance of all work to the Premises necessary to obtain
          the Tax Abatement and (y) the preparation of the application, the
          annual reports and other documentation required pursuant to Title 4
          of the RPTL (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 499-
          d and 499-f of the RPTL).  All fees, charges and other expenses
          incurred in connection with the application and continuing
          eligibility for the Tax Abatement shall be the sole responsibility of
          Tenant.

               (ii)      Pursuant to Section 499-c.5. of the RPTL, Tenant is
                         hereby informed that:
               
          (v)  the percentage of the Building's aggregate floor area allocated
               to the Premises, and "tenant's percentage share" for the
               purposes of Title 4 of the RPTL, is, as of the date hereof,
               28.233%;
          
          (w)  an application for abatement of real property taxes pursuant to
               Title 4 of the RPTL will be made for the Premises;
          
          (x)  the Fixed Base Rent and additional rent payable by Tenant under
               this Lease, including amounts payable by Tenant for real
               property taxes, will accurately reflect any abatement of real
               property taxes granted pursuant to Title 4 of the RPTL for the
               Premises;
          
          (y)  at least $10 per square foot of space in the Premises must be
               spent on improvements to the Premises and the common areas of
               the Building since the Lease, as modified by this Sixth
               Amendment, is considered a renewal lease pursuant to Title 4 of
               the RPTL; and

          (z)  all abatements granted with respect to a building pursuant to
               Title 4 of the RPTL will be revoked if, during the benefit
               period, real estate taxes or water or sewer charges or other
               lienable charges are unpaid for more than one year, unless such
               delinquent amounts are paid as provided in subdivision 4 of
               Section 499-f of the RPTL.
          
               (iii)     The lease commencement date of the Lease, solely for
                         the purposes of Title 4 of the RPTL, is January 1,
                         1997.
               
               (iv)      If the Tax Abatement shall be granted to Tenant,
                         Landlord shall credit against future installments of
                         the Tax Payment the amount of the Tax Abatement to
                         which Tenant shall be entitled (or if the Tax
                         Abatement shall exceed the amount that Landlord is
                         able to credit, pay to Tenant) as and when the same
                         shall be received by Landlord.
               
<PAGE>3

               (v)       If the Tax Abatement shall be granted and is
                         thereafter terminated or reduced or recalculated as a
                         result of a change in the billable assessed value of
                         the Building or for any other reason (unless due
                         solely to Landlord's acts, failure to perform any acts
                         required under Title 4 of the RPTL (including the
                         timely payment of real property taxes provided Tenant
                         shall have paid to Landlord the applicable
                         installments of the Tax Payment when due) or
                         misrepresentations), Tenant shall be responsible for
                         and shall pay to Landlord within 30 days after demand
                         the resulting increase in Taxes payable by Landlord
                         (including any retroactive increase), and all interest
                         and penalties relating thereto.  If the Tax Abatement
                         shall be granted and is thereafter terminated or
                         reduced or recalculated due solely to Landlord's acts,
                         failure to perform any acts required under Title 4 of
                         the RPTL or misrepresentations, Tenant's Tax Payment
                         shall be determined as if such abatement or reduction
                         were not terminated or reduced as aforesaid.  Tenant
                         shall notify Landlord, and Landlord shall notify
                         Tenant, within 10 days following the occurrence of any
                         event which may cause the Tax Abatement to be
                         terminated or reduced or recalculated.
               
               (vi)      Upon the request of Tenant, Landlord shall complete,
                         execute and submit with Tenant all applications
                         (including any revised applications therefor),
                         certificates of continuing eligibility and such other
                         documents, certificates and instruments that the New
                         York City Department of Finance may require in order
                         to issue a certificate of abatement granting the Tax
                         Abatement or in order to maintain the Tax Abatement in
                         effect.
               
               (vii)     Tenant hereby acknowledges that Landlord has made no
                         representations or warranties to Tenant with respect
                         to Title 4 of the RPTL or of any potential Tax
                         Abatement.  Tenant's obligation to pay the Tax Payment
                         shall not in any way be affected, reduced or impaired
                         by reason of Tenant's failure to qualify for, or
                         obtain, any potential Tax Abatement."
               
     3.   Modifications to Fifth Amendment.  Effective as of the date hereof,
          the provisions of Sections 6 and 8 of the Fifth Amendment shall be
          deemed null and void and of no further force or effect.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant shall not receive a
          "certificate of eligibility" (as such term is used in Title 4 of the
          RPTL) for the Tax Abatement for any reason on or before December 31,
          1997, then the provisions of Sections 6 and 8 of the Fifth Amendment
          shall automatically be deemed to be revived and be in full and force
          in accordance with the terms and provisions thereof.

                                ______________

                              USLIFE CORPORATION
                            NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS'
                          DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                         (AS AMENDED JANUARY 23, 1996)



1.     Eligibility

       Each member of the Board of Directors of USLIFE Corporation ("USLIFE")
       who is not also an employee of USLIFE, or any of its subsidiaries, is
       eligible to participate in this Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"),
       pursuant to the terms and conditions as described herein.

2.     Participation by Non-Employee Directors

       (a)  On the date of adoption of this Plan and at any time thereafter,
            each non-employee Director may elect to participate in the Plan by
            directing that (i) all or part of the cash compensation which would
            otherwise have been payable to him for services as a Director
            (including any fees payable for services as a member of a committee
            of the Board) and (ii) all or any specified percentage of the
            shares of USLIFE common stock which would otherwise have been
            payable to him for such services shall be credited, respectively,
            to a deferred cash compensation account and a unit account subject
            to the terms of the Plan.

       (b)  An election to participate in the Plan shall be in the form of a
            document executed by a non-employee Director and filed with the
            Secretary of USLIFE, and such election shall continue in effect
            until such non-employee Director ceases to be a Director or is
            otherwise ineligible for the Plan, or until such non-employee
            Director terminates such election, in whole or in part, by written
            notice filed with the Secretary of USLIFE.  Any such termination,
            in whole or in part, shall become effective at the close of the
            calendar quarter ending immediately following the date on which the
            Secretary receives such notice with respect to any and all
            compensation, fees and shares of common stock payable thereafter,
            or at the termination of such later calendar quarter as may be
            designated in the notice of termination.

       (c)  A non-employee Director who has filed a termination of election may
            thereafter file an election to participate for any future calendar
            quarters, at any time with respect to any and all cash
            compensation, fees and shares of common stock payable to him as a
            non-employee Director of USLIFE.  Such election shall be as
            provided in Paragraph 2(b).

<PAGE>2

3(A)        Deferred Cash Compensation Accounts

  (a)       All deferred cash compensation accounts shall be held with the
            general funds of USLIFE, shall be credited to an account in the
            name of the individual Director and shall bear interest, as
            described herein, from the date such fees were first awarded or
            would otherwise have been paid.

  (b)       The participant's deferred compensation account shall be credited
            at the end of each quarter with an interest equivalent.  The
            interest equivalent shall be calculated quarterly at a rate set by
            the Board, which rate shall be applied to the amounts in each
            participant's account at the beginning of such quarter.

  (c)       The Board of Directors intends to review and set the interest rate
            described in Paragraph 3A(b) annually in the light of current
            economic conditions; provided, however, that in the event that the
            rate is not modified the interest equivalent shall continue to be
            calculated at the rate as last set forth by the Board of Directors.

(B)    Deferred Stock Unit Accounts

  (a)       A deferred stock unit account shall be established in the name of
            each individual Director (i) who elects to defer receipt of all or
            any specified percentage of the shares of USLIFE common stock
            payable to him on account of his annual retainer and/or meeting
            fees for his services as a Director, or (ii) who irrevocably elects
            to have the interest payable under Paragraph 3A above used to
            purchase stock units for crediting on a quarterly basis to such
            Director's stock unit account, in accordance with the formula
            described in Paragraph 3B(b) below.

  (b)       In the case of stock units credited under item a(i) above, one unit
            for each full share of stock awarded shall be credited thereto as
            of the date such share(s) would otherwise have been paid.  The
            number of stock units credited quarterly to the stock unit account
            of an electing Director under item a(ii) above will be calculated
            by dividing the dollar amount of all interest credited to the
            Director's deferred compensation account at the end of each
            calendar quarter by the closing price per share of USLIFE common
            stock reported as New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions
            on the first trading day of the next succeeding calendar quarter,
            such stock units to be computed to four decimal places.

<PAGE>3

            Stock unit accounts shall be in the form of book entry accounts and
            no actual shares of stock or certificates therefor shall be issued
            or transferred to, or held under, the Plan.  Shares of stock issued
            and distributed pursuant to Paragraph 4 shall be taken from shares
            of common stock previously acquired by USLIFE and held in its
            treasury.

  (c)       Should the Director so elect, the deferred compensation account
            described in Paragraph 3A will be credited as of the pertinent
            dividend payment date with a dividend equivalent in the amount of
            any cash dividends declared and paid from time to time in respect
            of USLIFE's issued and outstanding common stock for each unit in
            the Director's stock unit account as of such date and interest
            shall be credited thereon in the manner, at the times and at the
            rate specified in Paragraph 3A(b).  Dividend equivalents with
            respect to any fraction of a share in the Director's stock unit
            account will also be credited to his deferred cash compensation
            account.

  (d)       In lieu of having his deferred compensation account credited with
            dividend equivalents as provided in Paragraph 3B(c) above a
            Director may direct that such dividend equivalents be reinvested to
            create additional stock units which will be credited to his stock
            unit account.  In the event a Director elects to reinvest the
            dividend equivalents, his stock unit account will be credited as of
            the dividend payment date with so many additional stock units (and
            any fractions of a unit computed to four decimal places) as could
            be purchased with such dividend equivalents based on the average of
            the high and low sales price of USLIFE's common stock reported as
            New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on such dividend
            payment date or, if no trading occurs in such stock on the dividend
            payment date, on the trading day immediately preceding said date.
            In the event a Director elects to reinvest dividend equivalents
            under this Paragraph 3A(d), dividend equivalents on fractions of a
            share will also be reinvested to create additional units.

  (e)       In the event a Director elects to defer the receipt of less than
            100% of the shares payable to him for his services as a Director,
            any fractional share includable with the deferred shares (computed
            to four decimal places) will also be credited to his stock unit
            account.  A certificate(s) will be issued to the Director with
            respect to the non-deferred shares but only as to full shares.  In
            lieu of being issued a certificate for any non-deferred fractional
            share, the value of such fractional share will be credited to the
            Director's deferred cash compensation account or paid to the
            Director in cash in the absence of such account.

<PAGE>4

  (f)       In the event that the number of outstanding shares of USLIFE common
            stock shall be changed by reason of split-ups, combinations,
            recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like, the Board of
            Directors of USLIFE shall make such adjustments as it deems
            appropriate in the number of units credited to the unit accounts of
            participants hereunder.

4.     Distribution

       (a)  Each non-employee Director who elects to participate in this Plan
            may make an election or may modify any prior election with respect
            to the distribution of (i) the cash amounts deferred hereunder plus
            accumulated interest and (ii) any deferred shares of stock
            represented by the number of units in his unit account in a single
            lump sum payment or in annual installments.  Elections for
            distribution and any designation of beneficiary (which designation
            may name an entity other than a natural person) shall first be made
            by non-employee Directors at the time that they elect to
            participate in the Plan.  Any modification of a prior election to
            receive payment and/or shares of deferred stock in a lump sum
            distribution or in annual installments shall be made no later than
            the end of the calendar year preceding the year in which the non-
            employee Director ceases to serve as a Director.  Any beneficiary
            designation, change or cancellation may be made at any time.

            A Director may elect to receive payment of (1) cash amounts
            deferred under the Plan plus accumulated interest and/or (2)
            deferred shares of stock in one distribution or in some other
            number of approximately equal annual installments (not exceeding
            10).  The first installment (or the single payment and/or share
            distribution if so elected) shall be paid and/or distributed on or
            about the first business day of the month immediately following the
            month in which a non-employee Director ceases to be a Director of
            the Company.  Subsequent installments, if any, shall be paid on or
            about the first business day of the first (and each succeeding)
            calendar year, following the calendar year in which the first
            installment is made, until the entire amount credited to the
            individual's deferred cash and/or unit account shall have been
            distributed in full.  Cash amounts and/or units held pending
            distribution pursuant to this paragraph shall continue to accrue
            interest and/or receive dividend reinvestment treatment, as the
            case may be, as provided in Paragraph 3 until the date of
            distribution.

<PAGE>5

       (b)  The election or any modification of a prior election with respect
            to the distribution of cash amounts deferred under the Plan plus
            accumulated interest and/or deferred shares of stock shall be
            contained in a Notice of Election in a form provided by the
            Secretary of USLIFE, and shall be executed by the Director and
            filed with the Secretary of USLIFE.

       (c)  Notwithstanding any election made by a Director, in the event such
            Director becomes a proprietor, officer, partner, employee, or
            otherwise affiliated with any business that is in competition with
            USLIFE or any of its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, or
            becomes employed by any governmental agency having jurisdiction
            over the activities of USLIFE or any of its subsidiaries, the (i)
            entire balance of his deferred cash compensation,  including
            interest, and (ii) the deferred shares represented by the number of
            stock units then in his stock unit account shall be distributed
            immediately to him in a single payment.

       (d)  If a Director should die before receiving (i) full payment of all
            amounts credited to his deferred cash account or (ii) distribution
            of all the shares represented by the total number of stock units in
            his stock unit account, the balance of such account(s) shall be
            paid either

            (1)  in a single lump sum distribution on the tenth day of the
                 calendar year immediately following the date of his death to
                 (i) his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, if a single
                 lump sum distribution has been elected for them; or (ii) his
                 estate, if no beneficiaries have been named or the designated
                 beneficiaries have predeceased the Director,

                                          OR

            (2)  in approximately equal annual installments to his designated
                 beneficiary or beneficiaries in the number of annual
                 installments (not exceeding ten) elected for the beneficiary
                 so long as the number of any prior annual installments paid to
                 the Director and those elected for the beneficiary do not
                 exceed 10.

<PAGE>6

       (e)  A Director shall bear full responsibility for the accuracy and
            legal sufficiency of any such beneficiary designation.  At any
            time, and from time to time, any such designation may be changed or
            cancelled by the Director without the consent of any beneficiary.
            Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made by
            written notice filed with the Secretary of USLIFE and shall not be
            effective until actually received by the Secretary.  If a Director
            designates more than one beneficiary, any cash payments and/or
            share distributions to such beneficiaries shall be made in equal
            shares unless the Director has designated otherwise.  In the
            absence of a written notice contesting a beneficiary designation or
            otherwise contesting a distribution received by the Secretary of
            USLIFE before the date of distribution, distribution will be made
            in accordance with the beneficiary designation of record.

       (f)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, cash amounts
            deferred under the Plan plus accumulated interest together with a
            certificate or certificates for all deferred shares represented by
            the total number of stock units then outstanding in his stock unit
            account shall be immediately distributed to each participating
            Director, or his designated beneficiary or beneficiaries or his
            estate, as the case may be, in a single lump sum distribution in
            the event of a "Change In Control" which means (i) a merger or
            consolidation to which USLIFE is a party and for which the approval
            of any shareholders of USLIFE is required; (ii) any "person" (as
            such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the beneficial owner,
            directly or indirectly, of securities of USLIFE representing 25% or
            more of the combined voting power of USLIFE's then outstanding
            securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of substantially all of the
            assets of USLIFE; (iv) a liquidation or reorganization of USLIFE;
            or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over Transaction or Event, as
            defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and Restated Rights
            Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the occurrence of
            any such transaction or event that otherwise would have previously
            been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.

5.     Miscellaneous

       (a)  No cash compensation, fees or interest thereon or shares deferred
            pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to assignment, attachment,
            lien, levy, or other creditors' rights under any state or federal
            law.

       (b)  USLIFE shall not be required to reserve, or otherwise set aside,
            funds for the payment or satisfaction of its obligations hereunder.

       (c)  Copies of the Plan and any and all amendments thereto shall be made
            available at all reasonable times at the office of the Secretary of
            USLIFE to all non-employee Directors.

       (d)  This Deferred Compensation Plan may be amended prospectively, from
            time to time, by the Board of Directors of USLIFE, and the interest
            rate applicable hereunder may be set prospectively by the Board as
            provided in Paragraph 3A(b); provided, however, that no amendment
            shall, in any event, be made to the Plan which would reduce (i) the
            amounts already earned by any non-employee Director or (ii) the
            number of any shares deferred hereunder and represented by the
            units accumulated in such Director's stock unit account or change
            the date or provisions for distribution of such amounts or shares,
            unless each non-employee Director personally approves such
            amendment insofar as the amendment affects him, and, further,
            provided that (1) item (ii) of Paragraph 3B(a) and the provisions
            of Paragraph 3B(b) regarding the timing and the formula for
            determining the amount and price of the stock units to be purchased
            and credited to the non-employee Director's stock unit account
            under item (ii) thereof as well as the provisions of Paragraph 1 on
            eligibility for participation herein shall not be amended or
            revised more than once every six months other than to comport with
            changes in the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the Employee
            Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules and regulations
            thereunder, and (2) that participation in this Plan by a Director
            who elects to have the interest payable under Paragraph 3A used to
            purchase stock units pursuant to Paragraphs 3B(a) and 3B(b) shall
            not be voluntarily terminated by such Director before the end of
            the second full calendar quarter following the effective date of
            such election nor may such Director increase or decrease the amount
            or percentage of his cash compensation deferred hereunder more than
            once every six months, it being intended that such unit purchases
            shall qualify in all respects as "formula awards" under Rule 16b-
            3(c)2(ii) of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
            as such rule may hereinafter be amended from time to time.

<PAGE>8

       (e)  If a Director of The United States Life Insurance Company In the
            City of New York with a deferred account under that Company's
            Deferred Compensation Plan (the "United States Life Plan") at any
            time resigns from the Board of Directors of United States Life to
            become a member of the Board of Directors of USLIFE Corporation and
            participate in this Plan, then upon his election to the Board of
            Directors of USLIFE Corporation the Director shall become a
            Participant in this Plan, the credit balance in his deferred
            account under the United States Life Plan shall automatically be
            transferred and credited to the general account of USLIFE
            Corporation and the elections made by the Director with respect to
            the United States Life Plan shall continue in effect under this
            Plan as if they had originally been made thereunder.

       (f)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit USLIFE from establishing a
            "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to pay all (a)
            amounts deferred hereunder together with accumulated interest and
            (b) shares of stock in a participant's deferred stock unit account;
            provided, however, that the assets of such Rabbi Trust shall be
            available to the creditors of USLIFE if USLIFE is unable to pay its
            debts as they fall due, or if bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
            have been initiated by any USLIFE creditor or USLIFE itself, or by
            any third party, under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States or
            the bankruptcy laws of any state, alleging that USLIFE is insolvent
            or bankrupt.  If, in accordance with the terms of such a Rabbi
            Trust, any funds held in such trust revert back to USLIFE, such
            reversion shall not in any manner reduce or diminish the obligation
            of USLIFE under this Plan to any participant.

nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from establishing a "Rabbi
Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to pay benefits under this Plan;
provided, however, that the assets of such Rabbi Trust shall be available to

Bankruptcy Act of the United States or the bankruptcy laws of any state,
alleging that the Company is insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in accordance with the
terms of a Rabbi Trust, any funds held in such trust revert back to the

                         MISCELLANEOUS

6.1  Governing Law - The Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York.

6.2  No Right to Continued Service - Nothing contained in the Plan shall be
construed as conferring upon any Outside Director the right to continue to

limitation of any right to terminate an Outside Director's service.

6.3  Construction of Language - Wherever appropriate in the Plan, words used in
the singular may be read in the plural, words in the plural may be read in the

State law, no benefit payable or any interest under the Plan shall be subject
in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,

creditors with respect to any Participant having an interest in this Plan.  If
any Participant who is entitled to any benefit under the Plan shall become
bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge,
encumber or charge such benefit, or if any person shall attempt to garnish,
attach, execute or otherwise encumber a benefit payable or to become payable

terminate the interest in such benefit of such Participant and in that event,
the Committee shall cause such benefit, or any part thereof, to be held or
applied for the benefit of such Participant or his spouse, children or other
relatives or dependents, or all or any of them, in such manner as the Committee
shall determine, and any such application shall be a complete discharge of all
liability with respect to such benefit.

<PAGE>6

6.5  Taxation - If a Participant is determined to be subject to federal income
tax on any benefits under the Plan prior to the time such benefits are payable,
then the entire amount of benefits payable to such person under this Plan shall
be due and payable at once, in a single lump sum, determined using the UP 1984
Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rates for
lump sum calculations as in effect on the first day of the Plan year in which
such amount is to be paid.  A benefit shall be determined to be subject to
federal income tax upon the earliest of (a) a final determination by the United
States Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Participant which is not
appealed to the courts, or (b) a final determination by the United States Tax
Court or any other Federal court affirming any such determination by the
Internal Revenue Service, or (c) an opinion by counsel chosen by the Company
addressed to the Company that by reason of treasury regulations, amendments to
the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue Service Rulings, court
decisions or other substantial precedents, such benefits are subject to federal
income tax prior to payment.  The Company shall undertake to defend, and bear
the expense of, any tax claims described herein which are asserted by the
Internal Revenue Service or by the taxing authority of any State or locality
against any Participant including the expense of attorney fees and costs of
appeal, and shall have the sole authority to determine whether or not to appeal
any determination made by the Internal Revenue Service, or by any taxing
authorities of any State or locality, or by any court.  The Company agrees to
reimburse any Participant for any interest or penalties in respect of Federal,
State or local tax claims hereunder upon receipt of documentation of the same.

                        Exhibit 10(lvi)
                        _______________

                       USLIFE CORPORATION
                       EXECUTIVE OFFICER
                   DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
                 (AS AMENDED JANUARY 23, 1996)

1.   Purpose of Plan

     The purpose of the Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is to provide
     select executives of USLIFE Corporation (the "Corporation") and its
     subsidiaries with the opportunity to defer receipt of compensation,
     including a portion of annual base salary and incentive award payments,
     until a future date.  The Corporation has adopted this program in
     recognition of the valuable service performed by these executives and the
     desire to provide them with additional flexibility in their personal
     financial planning.

2.   Eligibility

     Senior vice presidents and above of the Corporation and chief executive
     officers of the subsidiaries of the Corporation are eligible to
     participate in the Plan.

3.   Administration of the Plan

     A.   The Plan shall be administered by the Executive Compensation and
          Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation
          (the "Administrator").  The administrator shall have the authority in
          its sole discretion to interpret and apply the provisions of the
          Plan.

     B.   The Administrator may in its discretion delegate responsibility for
          the day to day administration and interpretation of the Plan to a
          committee composed of three officers of the Corporation (the
          "Management Committee") provided that any determination pertaining to
          the deferred compensation of any Management Committee member will be
          made solely by the Administrator.

4.   Election to Participate

     A.   An eligible employee who participates in the Plan (a "Participant")
          may elect that a portion of the compensation which would otherwise be
          payable for services to be performed as an employee of the
          Corporation or any subsidiary be credited to a deferred compensation
          account subject to the terms of the Plan.  Such election may apply to
          a portion of a Participant's annual base salary at the rate in effect
          at the time of the election, up to a maximum of 25%.  The election
          may also apply to all or a portion of a Participant's cash incentive
          award and to all or a portion of a Participant's book unit award.  A
          newly eligible Participant may make an election to defer compensation
          under the Plan within 30 days after becoming eligible to participate.
          An election shall only be valid for the twelve month period for which
          it is made.

<PAGE>2

     B.   The election shall be made on a form (the "Election Form") signed by
          a Participant and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation.  The
          election shall be irrevocable, except as specified in Section 8.

     C.   An election to defer a portion of annual base salary may be made at
          any time with respect to the salary payable during the 12 months that
          begin on the first regular payroll period after the date of the
          filing of the Election Form.  Such election shall end 12 months after
          the date of such filing or on such earlier date as may be specified
          on the Election Form.

     D.   An election to defer all or a portion of a Participant's annul cash
          incentive award shall be made by December 31st with respect to an
          award that is payable during the following year.

     E.   An election to defer all or a portion of a Participant's book unit
          award shall be made by December 31st with respect to any book unit
          award with a future December 31st valuation date that is payable in
          the year following the year in which such valuation date occurs.

     F.   Notwithstanding 4-C, 4-D and 4-E above, for the first 12 months of
          the Plan, all employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan
          as of the effective date hereof shall be considered newly eligible
          and may make elections within 30 days after such effective date to
          defer the future receipt of all or part of their annual base salary
          and any cash incentive award for the then current year as well as all
          or part of any book unit award.

5.   Deferred Accounts

     A.   A deferred account shall be established for each Participant in book
          entry form and shall be maintained by the Administrator.  Credit
          shall be given to a Participant's deferred account on the same dates
          that any payments would otherwise have been made to the Participant
          currently, in accordance with the deferral elections indicated on the
          Election Form.

<PAGE>3

     B.   Balances in a Participant's deferred account shall be credited at the
          end of each quarter with an interest equivalent.  The interest
          equivalent shall be calculated quarterly, at a rate set by the
          Administrator, and the rate shall be applied to the amounts
          accumulated in a Participant's account at the beginning of each
          quarter.

     C.   The Administrator intends to review and set the interest rate
          described in 5-B above at least annually in light of current economic
          conditions, provided that in the event the rate is not modified the
          interest equivalent shall continue to be calculated at the rate last
          set by the Administrator.

6.   Distribution of Deferred Compensation

     A.   Participants shall indicate on the Election Form the date or dates on
          which their deferred account balance shall be distributed.  A
          Participant may elect to receive amounts deferred under the Plan plus
          accumulated interest in one lump sum payment or in a number of
          approximately equal annual installments.  Any tax required to be
          withheld by any governmental authority shall be deducted from each
          distribution under the Plan.

     B.   A distribution election shall be made at the time a Participant first
          enrolls in the Plan.  The initial date of distribution shall either
          be the Participant's actual date of retirement or an earlier date, as
          specified on the Election Form.  A modification of a distribution
          election that changes the date of distribution to a later date or
          changes the lump sum or annual installment election shall be made no
          later than 12 months before the previously selected distribution date
          by delivering a new signed Election Form to the Secretary of the
          Corporation.  Distribution of deferred account balances will be made
          in accordance with the latest signed Election Form on file with the
          Corporate Secretary.

     C.   Payment of deferred account balances will begin on the earlier of the
          last day of the month indicated on the most recently filed Election
          Form or on the last day of the month in which termination of
          employment or retirement occurs.  If a Participant elects to receive
          distribution of his or her deferred account balance in annual
          installments, subsequent installments shall be paid in succeeding
          years on or about the last business day of the same month in which
          the first installment was paid until the entire amount credited to
          the Participant's account shall be paid in full.  All undistributed
          account balances shall continue to accrue interest as provided in
          Section 5-B until the actual date of distribution.

<PAGE>4

7.   Designation of Beneficiary

     Each Participant may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive the
     entire account balance deferred under the Plan together with accumulated
     interest thereon in the event of death.  A beneficiary designation, change
     or cancellation may be made at any time.  In the absence of any designated
     beneficiary, the entire deferred account balance shall be paid to the
     designated beneficiary under the Corporation's group life insurance
     program.

8.   Change in Distribution Schedule

     A.   Each Participant shall make a determination regarding the
          distribution of his or her deferred account balance on the Election
          Form.  If a Participant continues in the employ of the Corporation or
          terminates such employment due to retirement, distribution of the
          deferred account balance together with accumulated interest shall be
          made in accordance with the most recent Election Form on file with
          the Corporate Secretary.  In the event of any termination of a
          Participant's employment for reasons other than death, disability or
          retirement, the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, shall
          have the right to pay the entire deferred account balance and
          accumulated interest in one lump sum to a Participant regardless of
          any specified distribution schedule on an Election Form.

     B.   If a Participant's employment with the Corporation should terminate
          due to death or disability before full payment of his or her deferred
          account balance and accumulated interest thereon, the Administrator
          in its sole discretion shall determine whether such account balance
          shall be paid in a single lump sum or in annual installments.  If the
          Administrator chooses to make a lump sum distribution, the lump sum
          shall be paid to the Participant's beneficiaries or to the
          Participant on the last day of the month in which termination occurs.
          If the Administrator chooses to make the distribution in annual
          installments, the Administrator in its sole discretion shall
          determine the number of such installments and payment of the
          installments shall begin on the last day of the month in which
          termination occurs.

<PAGE>5

     C.   Distribution of deferred account balances in advance of the scheduled
          distribution date on a filed Election Form shall be permitted in the
          sole discretion of the Administrator but only in the event of an
          unanticipated emergency caused by circumstances beyond the control of
          the Participant which would result in severe financial hardship to
          the Participant if such distribution were not permitted.  A penalty
          shall be deducted from such early distribution equal to 10% of the
          distribution unless the Administrator in its sole discretion waives
          the penalty.  Such early distribution shall in no event exceed the
          amount necessary to meet the particular hardship plus the penalty.  A
          Participant who receives an early distribution under this Section 8-C
          shall not be permitted to participate in the Plan for a period of 12
          months after receipt of the distribution.

     D.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, amounts deferred
          hereunder plus accumulated interest shall be immediately payable to
          each Participant, or his or her beneficiaries if applicable, in a
          single lump sum in the event of a "Change In Control" which means (i)
          a merger or consolidation to which the Corporation is a party and for
          which the approval of any shareholders of the Corporation is
          required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
          and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
          becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities
          of the Corporation representing 25% or more of the combined voting
          power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale
          or transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Corporation;
          (iv) a liquidation or reorganization of the Corporation; or (v) the
          occurrence of any Flip Over Transaction or Event, as defined in
          Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, as
          amended from time to time prior to the occurrence of any such
          transaction or event that otherwise would have previously been
          considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.

<PAGE>6

9.   Rights of a Participant

     Amounts accumulated in a Participant's deferred account represent the
     Corporation's mere promise to pay such amounts sometime in the future.
     All compensation and other amounts deferred under this Plan shall not be
     segregated from the general funds of the Corporation and no Participant
     shall have any claim on any specific Corporation assets.  To the extent
     that any Participant acquires a right to receive benefits under this Plan,
     the right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general
     creditor of the Corporation and is not subject to alienation, sale,
     transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment by
     creditors.  A Participant may not pledge benefits under the Plan; any
     assets related to the Plan's obligation to a Participant may only be paid
     out in the form chosen for the last distribution.  It is the intention of
     the Corporation that arrangements under the Plan be unfunded for tax
     purposes and for purposes of ERISA Title 1.

10.  No Implied Contract

     Neither the Plan nor the Election Form shall be construed to constitute an
     employment contact between the Corporation and any Participant or an
     agreement by the Corporation to employ the Participant for a specified
     period of time.  All Participants shall remain subject to discharge to the
     same extent as if the Plan had not been put into effect.

11.  Amendment and Termination

     A.   The Plan may be amended from time to time by resolution of the Board
          of Directors to comply with changes in the laws and regulations of
          any State or the Federal Government or any agency having supervisory
          or regulatory jurisdiction over the Corporation.  The amendment or
          invalidation of any one or more provisions of the Plan shall not
          affect the remaining provisions of the Plan.  No amendment shall
          reduce any benefits accrued by any Participant prior to the effective
          date of the amendment.

     B.   The Board of Directors has the right in its sole discretion to alter
          the method of crediting interest to Participants' deferred account
          balances or to cease crediting future interest at any time.

     C.   The Board of Directors has the right in its sole discretion to
          terminate the Plan at any time.  All amounts accumulated under the
          Plan prior to the Plan's termination will continue to be subject to
          the provisions of the Plan.

<PAGE>7

12.  Arbitration of Disputes

     Any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating
     to this Plan or the interpretation or validity hereof shall be settled
     exclusively and finally by arbitration.  The arbitration shall be
     conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
     American Arbitration Association.

13.  Applicable Law

     This Plan shall be governed by and interpreted solely in accordance with
     the internal law of the State of New York without regard to principles of
     conflict of law.

14.  Administration

     Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Corporation from establishing
     a "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to pay amounts
     deferred hereunder plus accumulated interest; provided, however, that the
     assets of such Rabbi Trust shall be available to the creditors of the
     Corporation if the Corporation is unable to pay its debts as they fall
     due, or if bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings have been initiated by any
     of the Corporation's creditors or the Corporation itself, or by any third
     party, under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States or the bankruptcy
     laws of any state, alleging that the Corporation is insolvent or bankrupt.
     If, in accordance with the terms of such a Rabbi Trust, any funds held in
     such trust revert back to the Corporation, such reversion shall not in any
     manner reduce or diminish the obligation of the Corporation under this
     Plan to any participant.

                               _________________

                        USLIFE CORPORATION SUPPLEMENTAL
                     EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN
                        EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 1994
                         (AS AMENDED JANUARY 23, 1996)


     Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms herein which are
capitalized are defined in the USLIFE Corporation Employee Savings and
Investment Plan (the "Savings Plan"), as from time to time amended and shall
have the same meaning herein as used therein.

     1.   Purpose of the Plan
          ___________________

          This Supplemental Employee Savings and Investment Plan (the "Plan")
          is intended to be an unfunded, non-qualified plan of deferred
          compensation covering a select group of highly compensated or
          management employees for the purpose of providing benefits in excess
          of the limitations on benefits under the Savings Plan resulting from
          the application of section 401(a)(17) (restricting compensation to
          $150,000 per year, as adjusted) and section 415 (limitation on annual
          contributions to lesser of $30,000 or 25% of compensation as
          adjusted, as well as the combined plan limits), of the Internal
          Revenue code of 1986 as amended (the "Code") and is not intended to
          comply with the requirements of section 401(a) of the Code.  The Plan
          is also intended to provide any participants in the USLIFE
          Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan")
          with the benefits they would have received under the Savings Plan if
          they had not made deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
          The Plan shall be administered and construed so as to effectuate this
          intent.

     2.   Administration of the Plan
          __________________________

          a)   The Plan shall be administered by the Executive Compensation and
               Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the
               Corporation (the "Committee").  The Committee shall have the
               authority in its sole discretion to interpret and apply the
               provisions of the Plan.  Any decision of the Committee with
               respect to questions arising as to the interpretation of this
               Plan, including the severability of any or all of the provisions
               thereof, shall be final, conclusive and binding.
  
          b)   The Committee in its discretion may delegate responsibility for
               the day-to-day administration of the Plan to a committee
               composed of three officers of the Corporation (the "Management
               Committee").

          the Savings Plan who are (a) a participant in the Deferred
          Compensation Plan for management, (b) a Vice President or above of
          the Corporation or a Senior Vice President or above of a USLIFE
          Corporation subsidiary so long as the Employee's annual compensation

          401(a)(17) earnings limitation or (c) a Vice President and above in
          the subsidiaries of USLIFE Corporation, so long as they are employed

          401(a)(17) earnings limitation, as adjusted from time to time.

     4.   Deferred Stock Unit Accounts
          ____________________________
          
          a)   A deferred stock unit account shall be established in the name
               of each Participant.  The unfunded accounts of Participants are
               to be credited with a Company Contribution in an amount equal to
               100% of the Participant's Basic Contribution under the Savings
               Plan times the sum of (a) the Participant's Salary (including
               any amounts payable or in connection with an employment contract
               with the Corporation) in excess of the said 401(a)(17) earnings
               limitation, (b) any Salary deferred under the USLIFE Corporation
               Deferred Compensation Plan for management which otherwise would
               have been the subject of a Company Contribution under the
               Savings Plan, including any Salary above or below the said
               401(a)(17) earnings limitation and (c) any other portion of
               Salary that would have been the subject of a Company
               Contribution under the Savings Plan but for the application of
               the section 415 annual contribution limitations.  In the event
               of a Change-In-Control, Salary also includes (i) amounts which
               an Employee is paid or to which an Employee is entitled under
               any Key Executive Employment Protection Agreement, the
               Restricted Stock Plan or the Book Unit Plan and (ii) any regular
               or enhanced severance to which an employee is entitled as the
               result of a termination occurring within three years after a
               Change-In-Control or three years after the expiration of any
               employment contract, whichever is later.  "Change-In-Control"
               shall mean (i) a merger or consolidation to which the Company is
               a party and for which the approval of any shareholders of the
               Company is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in
               Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
               1934, as amended) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
               indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 25% or
               more of the combined voting power of the Company's then
               
<PAGE>3

               outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
               substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a
               liquidation or reorganization of the Company; or (v) the
               occurrence of any Flip Over Transaction or Event, as defined in
               Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, as
               amended from time to time prior to the occurrence of any such
               transaction or event that otherwise would have previously been
               considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.  The amounts
               credited to these unfunded accounts are to be equated with
               common stock of USLIFE Corporation of equivalent market value as
               provided in 4(b) below.
          
          b)   The number of stock units credited will be calculated by
               dividing the dollar amount credited to the Participant's
               deferred compensation account at the end of each calendar by the
               closing price per share of USLIFE common stock on the first
               trading day of the next succeeding calendar month, such stock
               units to be computed to four decimal places.  Stock unit
               accounts shall be in the form of book entry accounts and no
               actual shares of stock or certificates therefor shall be issued
               or transferred to, or held under, the Plan.
          
          c)   Dividends declared and paid from time to time in respect of
               USLIFE 's issued and outstanding common stock will be credited
               on the dividend payment date as so many additional stock units
               (and any fractions of a unit computed to four decimal places) as
               could be purchased with such dividend equivalents based on the
               average of the high and low sales price of USLIFE's common stock
               reported as New York Stock Exchange-Composite Transactions on
               such dividend payment date or, if no trading occurs in such
               stock on the dividend payment date, on the trading day
               immediately preceding said date.  Dividend equivalents on
               fractions of a share will also be reinvested to create
               additional units.

          d)   In the event that the number of outstanding shares of USLIFE
               common stock shall be changed by reason of split-ups,
               combinations, recapitalizations, stock dividends and the like,
               the Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems
               appropriate in the number of units credited to the unit accounts
               of Participants hereunder.
          
     
<PAGE>4

     5.   Vesting
          _______

          A Participant will become vested in the amounts credited to his
          deferred stock unit account in accordance with the schedule provided
          in Article VI of the Savings Plan.  In the event of a Change in
          Control, a Participant who is then employed by the Company shall
          fully (100%) vest immediately.

     6.   Distributions
          _____________

          Only lump-sum cash distributions are to be made.  Such distributions
          are to be in an amount equivalent to the unfunded account value upon
          the Participant's termination of employment, death, retirement or
          disability.  The amounts credited shall qualify in all respects for
          exclusion from the definition of the term "derivative securities"
          pursuant to Rule 16a-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
          ("1934 Act") with the result that the crediting of said amounts shall
          be exempt from the operation of the Section 16(b) short-swing profit
          restrictions under the 1934 Act.  In the case of the death of the
          Participant, the lump-sum cash distribution shall be made in
          accordance with the provisions applicable under Article VII of the
          Savings Plan when death occurs, including any beneficiary designation
          made under the Savings Plan.

     7.   Nonassignability
          ________________

          The benefits of a Participant (or his spouse or beneficiary as the
          case may be) shall not be transferable or assignable except by reason
          of the laws of descent and distribution.

     8.   Taxation
          ________

          If a Participant, his spouse or beneficiary, is determined to be
          subject to Federal income tax on any benefits under the Plan prior to
          the time such benefits are payable, then the entire amount of
          benefits payable to such person under this Plan shall be due and
          payable at once, in a single lump sum cash payment.  A benefit shall
          be determined to be subject to federal income tax upon the earliest
          of (a) a final determination by the United States Internal Revenue
          Service addressed to the Participant, his spouse or his beneficiary,
          as the case may be which is not appealed to the courts, or (b) a
          final determination by the United States Tax Court or any other
          Federal court affirming any such determination by the Internal
          Revenue Service, or (c) an opinion by counsel chosen by the Company
          addressed to the Company that by reason of treasury regulations,
          amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue
          Service Rulings, court decisions or other substantial precedents,
          such benefits are subject to
          
<PAGE>5

          Federal Income Tax prior to payment.  The Company shall undertake to
          defend, and bear the expense of, any tax claims described herein
          which are asserted by the Internal Revenue Service or by the taxing
          authority of any State or locality against any Participant, his
          spouse or beneficiary, including the expense of attorney fees and
          costs of appeal, and shall have the sole authority to determine
          whether or not to appeal any determination made by the State or
          locality, or by any court.  The Company agrees to reimburse any
          Participant, his spouse or beneficiary for any interest or penalties
          in respect of Federal, State or local tax claims hereunder upon
          receipt of documentation of the same.

     9.   Miscellaneous
          _____________

          a)   The Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to
               modify this Plan from time to time, or to terminate the Plan
               entirely.  Benefits accrued under the Plan as of the date of any
               amendment or termination shall not be reduced.  The Plan shall
               automatically terminate simultaneously with the termination of
               the Savings Plan, in which case all benefits shall be paid as of
               the first day of the month coincident with or next following
               such event in a single lump sum cash payment.
  
          b)   Although the Plan is intended to be an unfunded Plan, nothing
               contained herein shall prohibit the Company from establishing a
               "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to pay
               benefits under this Plan for any or all Participants, their
               spouses, or beneficiaries; provided, however, that the assets of
               such Rabbi Trust shall be available to the creditors of the
               Company if the Company is unable to pay its debts as they fall
               due, or bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings have been initiated
               by the Company's creditors or the Company itself, or by any
               third party, under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States or
               the bankruptcy laws of any state, alleging that the Company is
               insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in accordance with the terms of a
               Rabbi Trust, any funds held in such trust revert back to the
               Company, such reversion shall not in any manner reduce or
               diminish the obligation of the Company under this Plan to any
               Participant.
               
          c)   Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to
               benefits payable under the Plan shall be based solely upon such
               contractual obligations, if any, as shall be created by the
               Plan.
  
          d)   If upon the payment of any benefits to any person under the
               Plan, the Company shall be required to withhold any amounts with
               respect to such payment by reason of any Federal, State or local
               tax laws, rules or regulations, then the Company shall be
               entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts from any such
               payments.  In any event, such person
               
<PAGE>6

               shall make available to the Company, promptly when requested by
               the Company, sufficient funds or other property to meet the
               requirements of such withholding, and the Company shall be
               entitled to take and authorize such steps as it may deem
               advisable in order to have the amounts required to be withheld
               made available to the Company out of any funds or property due
               or to become due to such person, whether under this Plan or
               otherwise.

     10.  Claims Procedure
          ________________

          The Committee shall establish a procedure for the resolution of
          disputes and dispositions of claims arising under the Plan.  Until
          modified by the Company, this procedure is as follows:

          Any Participant, former Participant, or any spouse or other
          beneficiary of such Participant or former Participant may, of he so
          desires, file with the Committee a written claim for benefits under
          the Plan.  Within sixty (60) days after the filing of such a claim,
          the Committee shall notify the claimant whether his claim is upheld
          or denied.  The Committee may, under special circumstances, extend
          the period of time for processing a claim by an additional sixty (60)
          days.  If such an extension of time is required, written notice shall
          be furnished to the claimant or his duly authorized representative
          prior to the termination of the initial sixty (60) day period.  Such
          notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring an
          extension.  In the event the claim is denied, the Committee shall
          state in writing:

               a.   the specific reasons for the denial;

               b.   specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which
               the denial is based;

               c.   a description of any additional material or information
               necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an
               explanation of why such material or information is necessary;
               and

               d.   an explanation of the claim review procedure set forth in
               this Section 10.

          Within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice that his claim has
          been denied, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may
          file with the Committee a written request for a review hearing and
          may, in conjunction therewith, submit written issues and comments.
          The Committee shall then schedule, within sixty (60) days after the
          filing of such request, a full and fair hearing of the claim before
          the Committee.  The Committee may,
          
<PAGE>7

          under special circumstances, extend such period of time by an
          additional sixty (60) days.  Prior to said hearing, the claimant or
          his representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to review a
          copy of the Plan and other pertinent documents in the possession of
          the Committee.  The Committee shall communicate their decision in
          writing to the claimant within thirty (30) days after the hearing.
          Any claim for benefits and any request for a review hearing hereunder
          must be filed on forms to be furnished by the Committee upon a
          claimant's request.
     
     11.  Successors
          __________

          This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
          successor to the Company or its business as the result of merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or otherwise and
          any subsequent successor thereto.  In the event of any such similar
          transaction, the successor to the Company or its business or any
          subsequent successor thereto shall promptly notify the Participants
          in writing of its successorship.  In no event shall any such
          transaction described herein suspend or delay the rights of
          Participants, spouses or beneficiaries to receive benefits hereunder.

     12.  Choice of Law
          _____________

          This Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State
          of New York except to the extent such laws are pre-empted by the
          Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

                        EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 1994
                         (AS AMENDED JANUARY 23, 1996)


Unless otherwise required by the context, the terms used herein which are
capitalized are defined in the USLIFE Corporation Retirement Plan (the
"Retirement Plan"), as from time to time amended, and shall have the same
meaning herein as used therein.

     1.   Purpose of the Plan
          ___________________

          This Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Plan") is intended to be a
          non-qualified plan of deferred compensation covering a select group
          of highly compensated or management employees for the purpose of
          providing benefits in excess of the limitations on benefits under the
          Retirement Plan.  This Plan is not intended to comply with the
          requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code.  The Plan shall be
          administered and construed so as to effectuate this intent.

     2.   Eligibility
          ___________

          Eligible employees include (1) each Senior Vice President and above
          of USLIFE Corporation ("Company"), and each Chief Executive Officer
          of any wholly owned subsidiary of USLIFE Corporation, (2) all those
          serving as Vice President and above of USLIFE Corporation and all
          those serving as Senior Vice President and above in the subsidiaries

     3.   Benefits
          ________

          The Plan shall provide a benefit to a Participant (or his spouse or
          beneficiary as the case may be) in an annual amount equal to the
          difference between the annual amount of the Participant's normal,
          early or vested retirement benefit to which he would be entitled
          under Article IV of the Retirement Plan upon his termination of
          employment if Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 were inapplicable, and
          the annual amount of such benefit at such time under Article IV of
          the Retirement Plan recognizing the effect of such Code sections.  If
          the Participant has not yet reached age 55 at such time, such offset
          shall not occur until his 55th birthday and shall at that time be
          based upon his benefit under the Retirement Plan payable at his 55th
          birthday.

          For all Participants providing an Hour of Service after December 31,
          1993, Earnings effective from and after January 1, 1992 means wages,
          as defined in section 3401(a) of the Code, and all other payments of
          compensation to an employee by the Company (in the course of the
          Company's trade or business) for which the Company is required to
          furnish the Employee a written statement under section 6041(d) and
          6051(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, more commonly known as the
          wages, tips and other compensation reported on Form W-2 (hereinafter
          "W-2 earnings") including, among other things, payments to which the
          Employee is entitled under any employment contract, key executive
          employment protection agreement, Restricted Stock Plan, Book Unit
          Plan and Annual Incentive Plan, all as amended from time to time
          before a Change-In-Control excluding therefrom (1) employee moving or
          relocation expenses, (2) any income related to the employee
          participation in USLIFE Stock Option Plans, with the exception of the
          value of any vested shares of restricted stock awarded as a result of
          a stock option exercise, and (3) any severance payments, except as
          hereinafter provided.  Earnings shall be determined before (1) any
          adjustments related to the USLIFE Flexible Advantage Program,
          including any "vacation sell" dollars, any elections of medical or
          dental options or contributions made to the USLIFE Flexible Advantage
          Accounts for health or dependent care, and (2) contributions made
          under the ESP Option of the USLIFE Corporation Employee Savings and
          Investment Plan.  Earnings shall also be increased to include any and
          all deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan for management.
          In the event of a Change In Control, Earnings also includes any
          regular or enhanced severance paid to the Employee to which the
          Employee is entitled as a result of a termination occurring within
          three years after a Change In Control or three years after the
          expiration of any employment contract, whichever is later and which
          severance shall be included as a part of the Employee's Earnings for
          his final full year of employment unless its inclusion in the
          Earnings for the final year of employment or part thereof
          
<PAGE>3

          produces a higher Final Average Earnings.  For Participant's
          providing an Hour of Service after November 1, 1994, in the event of
          a Participant's termination of employment as a result of the bulk
          sale of assets, the merger of companies, discontinuance of a
          company's operations, the sale or divestiture of a company, or the
          relocation, consolidation or elimination of functions or positions,
          Earnings also includes any regular or enhanced severance paid to the
          Employee.  For Participant's providing an Hour of Service after
          November 1, 1994, in the event of a Participant's termination of
          employment as a result of the bulk sale of assets, the merger of
          companies, discontinuance of a company's operations, the sale or
          divestiture of a company, or the relocation, consolidation or
          elimination of functions or positions, Final Average Earnings
          includes any regular or enhanced severance paid to the Employee, and
          the final year of employment is to be included in the three (3) year
          average of Final Average Earnings even if the final year is not a
          complete calendar year, but only if its inclusion produces the
          highest average amount.

          For the purpose of the benefit calculation, Years of Participation
          Service shall also include the Participant's total years of
          employment, counting as a full Year of Participation Service (1) all
          completed Plan Years and (2) any and all partial Plan Years (each and
          every partial Plan Year being treated as a full Year of
          Participation) from the Participant's date of hire through and
          including the date upon which the Participant's employment terminates
          or is projected to terminate under any employment contract, whichever
          is longer.

     4.   Method of Payment
          _________________

          Benefit payments shall be payable monthly (1/12 of the annual amount)
          and shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or
          next following the date of the Participant's 55th birthday or his
          termination of employment or death, if later.  Such monthly benefit
          payments shall continue to the Participant for his life.  In the case
          of those Participants in this Plan as of December 31, 1993, such
          payments shall be made to the Participant, or in the case of the
          Participant's death to his spouse or beneficiary, as the case may be,
          through the month when the Participant would have reached his actual
          80th birthday, or for 180 months (15 years) from the date that the
          benefits commence to the Participant, his spouse or beneficiary,
          whichever is later ("Guaranteed Period").  Those employees who only
          participate in the Plan after December 31, 1993 are to have all of
          the benefit options available under Article V of the Retirement Plan.
          Those employees who participated in the Plan as of December 31, 1993
          and continued to participate thereafter are to have the Guaranteed
          Period
          
<PAGE>4

          option under this section and all of the benefit options under
          Article V of the Retirement Plan.

          5.   Vesting
               _______

          A Participant shall be fully vested upon his being credited with ten
          Years of Service under the Retirement Plan or upon his death after
          attaining age 55 if he is fully vested under the Retirement Plan.
          Except as may be provided in Section 6 below, should a Participant
          terminate employment with the Company prior to being credited with at
          least ten Years of Service under the Retirement Plan, he shall
          forfeit all of his benefits under this Plan and no benefit shall
          thereafter be payable to such Participant, or to his spouse or
          beneficiary.

          6.   Special Rules
               _____________

          In the event of the occurrence of a Change In Control which means (i)
          a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party and for
          which the approval of any shareholders of the Company is required;
          (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)2
          of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the
          beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the
          Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
          Company's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
          substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a liquidation or
          reorganization of the Company; or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over
          Transaction or Event, as defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and
          Restated Rights Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the
          occurrence of any such transaction or event that otherwise would have
          previously been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event, then (A)
          the benefit under this Plan of each Participant who is then employed
          by the Company shall fully (100%) vest immediately, (B) for purposes
          of determining the accrued benefit to which the Participant would be
          hypothetically entitled under the Retirement Plan as per the first
          clause of Section 3 of this Plan, his Final Average Earnings, his
          Years of Participation Service and his age will be redefined to
          include earnings and service (treating any and all partial Plan Years
          as full Years of Participation Service) with USLIFE through the
          projected end of his employment contract and any key executive
          employment protection agreement with the Company then in effect, as
          well as any severance payments (and service reflected by such
          severance payments) to which he may be entitled.  In such case, the
          Participant's benefit under this Plan shall be determined as of the
          date of such event in accordance with Section 3 of the Plan (taking
          into account his additional deemed earnings, service and severance
          pay and service as per the foregoing sentence and his hypothetical
          age in determining any
          
<PAGE>5

          appropriate reduction factors) and shall commence, based upon his
          hypothetical age, to be paid to the Participant as provided in
          Section 4 of the Plan, or, if later, on the first day of the first
          month at least thirty (30) days after the Participant's salary is
          discontinued or reduced (whether or not the Participant has
          terminated employment).

     7.   Death Benefits
          ______________

          Should a Participant die before all benefit payments to him under
          this Plan have been completed, the following shall apply:

          A.   If a vested, married Participant dies before his Normal
               Retirement Date under the Retirement Plan and before his benefit
               payments under this Plan have commenced, his spouse shall be
               entitled to receive a death benefit with respect to the
               Participant's benefits under this Plan determined in the same
               manner, and subject to the same rules, as provided in Article V
               of the Retirement Plan without regard to Code Sections
               401(a)(17) and 415.
          
          B.   If a vested Participant who participated in the Plan as of
               December 31, 1993 dies after benefit payments under this Plan
               have commenced, or after he has reached his Normal or Early
               Retirement Date under the Retirement Plan, the Participant's
               spouse, if at the time of his death the Participant was married,
               or the Participant's beneficiary, if at the time of his death he
               was not married, will be entitled to receive the monthly
               payments for the duration of the Guaranteed Period that were
               being paid to the Participant while he was alive.  If such
               spouse or other beneficiary, as the case may be, dies before
               receiving all of the monthly payments for the duration of the
               Guaranteed Period, then the remaining payments during such
               Guaranteed Period shall be paid to the estate of such person as
               a lump sum (determined using the UP 1984 Mortality Table and the
               Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rates for lump sum
               calculations as in effect on the first day of the calendar year
               in which such person dies), or the installments over the
               remaining Guaranteed Period shall continue, as the Company, in
               its discretion decides.  If any vested Participant who provided
               an Hour of Service after December 31, 1993 dies after benefit
               payments have commenced, or after he has reached his Normal
               Retirement Date under the Retirement Plan, his spouse or
               beneficiary, as the case may be, will also continue to have
               those benefit options provided under Article V of the Retirement
               Plan, with the benefit determined in the same manner, and
               subject to the same rules, as provided in Article V of the
               Retirement Plan without regard to Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of
               the Code.
               
<PAGE>6

               Except as provided in paragraph (A) or (B) above or in Section
               4, no death benefit shall be payable under this Plan.

     8.   Lump Sum
          ________

          If the lump sum value of a benefit payable to a Participant, his
          spouse or beneficiary is less that $25,000 (determined using the UP
          1984 Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
          interest rates for lump sum calculations as in effect on the first
          day of the calendar year in which such benefit is to commence) the
          Company may direct that such benefit be paid as such lump sum.
     
     9.   Nonassignability
          ________________

          The benefits of a Participant (or his spouse or beneficiary as the
          case may be) shall not be transferable or assignable except by reason
          of the laws of descent and distribution.

     10.  Taxation
          ________

          If a Participant, his spouse or beneficiary, is determined to be
          subject to Federal income tax on any benefits under the Plan prior to
          the time such benefits are payable, then the entire amount of
          benefits payable to such person under this Plan shall be due and
          payable at once, in a single lump sum, determined using the UP 1984
          Mortality Table and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest
          rates for lump sum calculations as in effect on the first day of the
          Plan year in which such amount is to be paid.  A benefit shall be
          determined to be subject to federal income tax upon the earliest of
          (a) a final determination by the United States Internal Revenue
          Service addressed to the Participant, his spouse or his beneficiary,
          as the case may be which is not appealed to the courts, or (b) a
          final determination by the United States Tax Court or any other
          Federal court affirming any such determination by the Internal
          Revenue Service, or (c) an opinion  by counsel chosen by the Company
          addressed to the Company that by reason of treasury regulations,
          amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue
          Service Rulings, court decisions or other substantial precedents,
          such benefits are subject to Federal Income Tax prior to payment.
          The Company shall undertake to defend, and bear the expense of, any
          tax claims described herein which are asserted by the Internal
          Revenue Service or by the taxing authority of any State or locality
          against any Participant, his spouse or beneficiary, including the
          expense of attorney fees and costs of appeal, and shall have the sole
          authority to determine whether or not to appeal any determination
          made by the Internal Revenue Service, or by any taxing authorities of
          any State or locality, or by any court.  The Company agrees to
          reimburse any
          
<PAGE>7

          Participant, his spouse or beneficiary for any interest or penalties
          in respect of Federal, State or local tax claims hereunder upon
          receipt of documentation of the same.

     11.  Miscellaneous
          _____________

          (a)  The plan shall be administered by the Administrative Committee
          ("Committee") established under the Retirement Plan and any decision
          of said Committee with respect to questions arising as to the
          interpretation of this Plan, including the severability of any or all
          of the provisions thereof, shall be final, conclusive and binding.
          (b)  The Board of Directors of the Company reserves the right to
          modify this Plan from time to time, or to terminate the Plan
          entirely.  Benefits accrued under the Plan as of the date of any
          amendment or termination shall not be reduced.  The Plan shall
          automatically terminate simultaneously with the termination of the
          Retirement Plan, in which case all benefits shall be paid as of the
          first day of the month coincident with or next following such event
          in a single lump sum (determined using the UP 1984 Mortality Table
          and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rates for lump
          sum calculations as in effect on the first day of the calendar year
          in which such event occurs).

          (c)  Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company from
          establishing a "Rabbi Trust" for the purpose of accumulating funds to
          pay benefits under this Plan for any or all Participants, their
          spouses, or beneficiaries; provided, however, that the assets of such
          Rabbi Trust shall be available to the creditors of the Company if the
          Company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, or bankruptcy or
          insolvency proceedings have been initiated by the Company's creditors
          or the Company itself, or by any third party, under the Bankruptcy
          Act of the United States or the bankruptcy laws of any state,
          alleging that the Company is insolvent or bankrupt.  If, in
          accordance with the terms of a Rabbi Trust, any funds held in such
          trust revert back to the Company, such reversion shall not in any
          manner reduce or diminish the obligation of the Company under this
          Plan to any Participant.

          (d)  Any liability of the Company to any person with respect to
          benefits payable under the Plan shall be based solely upon such
          contractual obligations, if any, as shall be created by the Plan.

          (e)  If upon the payment of any benefits to any person under the
          Plan, the Company shall be required to withhold any amounts with
          respect to such payment by reason of any Federal, State or local tax
          laws, rules or regulations, then the Company shall be entitled to
          deduct and withhold such amounts from any such payments.  In any
          event, such person shall make available to the Company, promptly when
          requested by the
          
<PAGE>8

          Company, sufficient funds or other property to meet the requirements
          of such withholding, and the Company shall be entitled to take and
          authorize such steps as it may deem advisable in order to have the
          amounts required to be withheld made available to the Company out of
          any funds or property due or to become due to such person, whether
          under this Plan or otherwise.

     12.  Claims Procedure
          ________________

          The Committee shall establish a procedure for the resolution of
          disputes and dispositions of claims arising under the Plan.  Until
          modified by the Company, this procedure is as follows:

          Any Participant, former Participant, or any spouse or other
          beneficiary of such Participant or former Participant may, if he so
          desires, file with the Committee a written claim for benefits under
          the Plan.  Within sixty (60) days after the filing of such a claim,
          the Committee shall notify the claimant whether his claim is upheld
          or denied.  The Committee may, under special circumstances, extend
          the period of time for processing a claim by an additional sixty (60)
          days.  If such an extension of time is required, written notice shall
          be furnished to the claimant or his duly authorized representative
          prior to the termination of the initial sixty (60) day period.  Such
          notice will indicate the special circumstance requiring an
          extension.  In the event the claim is denied, the Committee shall
          state in writing:

          a)   the specific reasons for the denial;

          b)   specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which the
          denial is based;

          c)   a description of any additional material or information
          necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of
          why such material or information is necessary; and

          d)   an explanation of the claim review procedure set forth in this
          Section 12.

          Within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice that his claim has
          been denied, the claimant or his duly authorized representative may
          file with the Committee a written request for a review hearing and
          may, in conjunction therewith, submit written issues and comments.
          The Committee shall then schedule, within sixty (60) days after the
          filing of such request, a full and fair hearing of the claim before
          the Committee.  The Committee may, under special circumstances,
          extend such period of time by an additional sixty (60) days.  Prior
          
<PAGE>9

          to said hearing, the claimant or his representative shall have a
          reasonable opportunity to review a copy of the Plan and other
          pertinent documents in the possession of the Committee.  The
          Committee shall communicate their decision in writing to the claimant
          within thirty (30) days after the hearing.  Any claim for benefits
          and any request for a review hearing hereunder must be filed on forms
          to be furnished by the Committee upon a claimant's request.

     13.  Successors
          __________

          This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
          successor to the Company or its business as the result of merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or otherwise and
          any subsequent successor thereto.  In the event of any such merger,
          consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or other similar

          Participants, spouses or beneficiaries to receive benefits hereunder.

          THIS AGREEMENT, made as of the 1st day of March, 1994, among USLIFE

Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), Chemical Bank, a New York

corporation (the "Trustee") and KPMG Peat Marwick ("Independent Contractor").



                             W I T N E S S E T H :
                             _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _



          WHEREAS, the  Company has  entered  into  certain  written  employment

contracts (referred  to collectively  herein as  the "Contracts")  with a select

group of its management employees (referred to herein as "Contract Holders");



          WHEREAS,  the   Company  has   provided  select  executives  with  the

opportunity to become participants (referred to herein as "Participants") in the

USLIFE  Corporation  Deferred  Compensation  Plan  (the  "Deferred  Compensation

Plan");



          WHEREAS, the  Company desires  to provide additional assurance to some

or all  such management  employees that  their unfunded contractual rights under

the Contracts  and the  Deferred Compensation  Plan will in the future be met or

substantially met by application of the procedures set forth herein;



          WHEREAS,  the   Company  wishes   to   establish   separate   accounts

(hereinafter the "Accounts") with respect to some or all of the Contract Holders

and Participants  as determined  by the Company prior to a Change in Control (as

hereinafter defined  in Section  2.3(d)(iv)) in  order to  provide a  source  of

payments as  such may  be required under the terms of the agreements between the

Company and  each of  the Contract  Holders and  under the Deferred Compensation

Plan;



          WHEREAS, except  as may  be  expressly  provided  in  this  Agreement,

amounts allocated  to each  separate Account,  as determined by the Company from

time to  time in  its sole discretion, and the earnings attributed thereto shall

be used  by the Trustee solely in satisfaction of the liabilities of the Company

with respect to the Contract Holder


<PAGE>2


or Participant  for whom  such separate  Account has  been established  and  the

expenses of  administering the  trust, established  herein, and such utilization

shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth herein;

          WHEREAS, the  Company wishes  to establish  a  separate  account  with

respect to  all amounts  that are contributed hereunder by the Company which are

not allocated  by the Company at the time of such contribution to the Account of

an individual Contract Holder or Participant (the "General Account");



          WHEREAS, the Trust is intended to be a "grantor trust" with the corpus

and income  of the Trust treated as assets and income of the Company for federal

income tax purposes pursuant to Sections 671 through 678 of the Internal Revenue

Code of 1986 (the "Code"); as amended;



          WHEREAS, the  Company intends  that the  assets of  the Trust  will be

subject to the claims of creditors of the Company as provided in Article II;



          WHEREAS, the  Trustee is  not a  party to  any of the Contracts or the

Deferred Compensation  Plan and  makes no  representations with respect thereto,

and all  representations and  recitals with  respect to  the  Contracts  or  the

Deferred Compensation Plan shall be deemed to be those of the Company.



          NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration  of  the  premises  and  mutual  and

independent promises herein, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows:



                                   ARTICLE I
                                   _________



          1.1  The  Company   hereby  establishes   with  the  Trustee  a  trust

consisting of  such sums of money and such property acceptable to the Trustee as

shall from time to time be paid or delivered to the Trustee and the earnings and

profits thereon.   All  such money  and property, all investments made therewith

and proceeds thereof, less the


<PAGE>3


payments or other distributions which, at the time of reference, shall have been

made by  the Trustee, as authorized herein, are referred to herein as the "Fund"

and shall be held by the Trustee, IN TRUST, in accordance with the provisions of

this Agreement.



          1.2  The Trustee  shall hold,  manage, invest and otherwise administer

the Fund  pursuant to  the terms  of this  Agreement.    The  Trustee  shall  be

responsible only  for contributions  actually received  by it  hereunder.    The

amount of  each contribution  by the  Company to the Fund shall be determined in

the sole  discretion of  the Company  and the  Trustee shall  have  no  duty  or

responsibility with respect thereto.



          1.3  The  Independent   Contractor  (as  hereinafter  in  Section  3.1

defined) shall  maintain in  an equitable  manner a  separate Account  for  each

Contract Holder  and Participant in which it shall keep a separate record of the

amount of  the fund  allocated to  such Contract  Holder or  Participant.    The

Company shall  certify to the Trustee and the Independent Contractor at the time

of each contribution to the Fund the amount of such contribution to be allocated

to each  Account.   Provided, however,  that following  a Change in Control, the

Company may  only allocate  contributions to  either the  General Account  or to

Accounts which  were established  prior to  the Change  in Control.   Any amount

contributed by  the Company  that is  not so certified shall be allocated to the

General Account.



          1.4  The Company  may contribute  to the Fund an irrevocable letter of

credit (hereinafter  referred to as a "L/C").  The following provisions shall be

applicable to any such L/C:



               (a) the  L/C shall  expire no  sooner than  one (1) year from the

date of issuance,




<PAGE>4


               (b) the  Company shall  continue to  maintain such  L/C in effect

until it  is replaced  by cash  or another  irrevocable L/C  or  this  Agreement

terminates pursuant to Article IX, whichever occurs first,



               (c) the  Company shall  renew or replace such L/C at least thirty

(30) days before its expiration for an additional period of one (1) year,



               (d) if  such L/C,  or any  renewal thereof,  is  not  renewed  or

replaced by  a L/C delivered to the Trustee at least thirty (30) days before the

expiration of  the predecessor L/C, the Trustee may draw down the full amount of

such L/C  and hold  the proceeds  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement;

provided, however,  that in the event the Company is unable to renew such L/C at

least thirty  (30) days prior to the expiration of the predecessor L/C at a cost

equal to or less than twenty-five (25) basis points over the current annual cost

of such  L/C, and  the Trustee with reasonable diligence is unable to identify a

bank (within  the definition  of Section 1.4(h)) that will replace such L/C at a

cost equal to or less than twenty-five (25) basis points over the current annual

cost of such L/C, then the Trustee shall not draw down the amount of such L/C as

provided in this Section 1.4(d),



               (e) the  Trustee may  also draw  down on such L/C at any time the

Trustee determines  the proceeds  of such L/C are necessary to allow the Trustee

to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement,



               (f) the  proceeds of  such L/C  shall be available to the Trustee

upon the Trustee's presentation of its sight draft,



               (g) the  Company may,  at any time, replace such L/C with another

irrevocable L/C  having substantially  similar terms, or with an equal amount of

cash, or any combination thereof,


<PAGE>5


          (h) any  L/C shall  be issued  by a  bank (including the Trustee) with

assets in excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100 million, shall be

reasonably acceptable  to the  Trustee, and  shall be  in a  form  as  shall  be

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.



          1.5  The Trustee,  for investment  purposes only, may commingle all of

the assets  of the  Fund and treat them as a single fund, but the records of the

Independent Contractor  at all  times shall  show the  percentages of  the Trust

allocable to  each Account  and to  the General  Account.   The  Fund  shall  be

revalued by  the Trustee as of the last business day of each calendar quarter at

current market values, as determined by the Trustee.  The Independent Contractor

shall allocate any increase or decrease in the current market value of the Fund,

as determined by the Trustee, pro-rata to all of the Accounts and to the General

Account in  proportion to  the balance of the assets allocated thereto as of the

last business day of the previous calendar quarter.



                                   ARTICLE II
                                   __________



          2.1  Notwithstanding any  provision in this Agreement to the contrary,

if at  any time  while the  Trust is  still in  existence  the  Company  becomes

insolvent (as  defined herein),  the Trustee  shall upon  written notice thereof

from the  Company's Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive

Officer suspend  the payment  of all  amounts from the Fund and shall thereafter

hold the  Fund in suspense for the benefit of the creditors of the Company until

it receives  a court  order directing  the disposition  of the  Fund;  provided,

however, the  Trustee may deduct or continue to deduct its fees and expenses and

other expenses  of the  Trust, including  taxes and the Independent Contractor's

fees and  expenses, pending  the receipt of such court order.  The Company shall

be considered  to be  insolvent if (a) a final judicial determination is entered

that the  Company is  unable to  pay its debts as such debts mature or (b) there

shall have  been filed  by or against the Company in any court or other tribunal

either of  the United  States or  of any  State or of any other authority now or

hereafter       exercising        jurisdiction,       a        petition       in


<PAGE>6


bankruptcy  or   insolvency  proceedings   or  for  reorganization  or  for  the

appointment of  a receiver  or trustee  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the

Company's property  under the  present or  any future Federal bankruptcy code or

any other  present or  future applicable  Federal, State  or other bankruptcy or

insolvency statute or law.  By its approval and execution of this Agreement, the

Company represents  and agrees  that its  Board of Directors and Chairman of the

Board and  Chief Executive  Officer, as from time to time acting, shall have the

fiduciary duty  and responsibility  on behalf of the Company's creditors to give

to the  Trustee prompt  written notice  of any event of the Company's insolvency

and the  Trustee shall  be entitled  to rely  thereon to  the exclusion  of  all

directions or  claims to make payments thereafter made.  Absent such notice, the

Trustee shall  have no responsibility for determining whether or not the Company

has become insolvent.



          2.2  The Company  represents and  agrees that  the  Trust  established

under this  Agreement does  not fund and is not intended to fund its obligations

under the  Contracts, the  Deferred Compensation  Plan  or  any  other  employee

benefit plan  or program  of the Company.  Such Trust is and is intended to be a

depository arrangement  with the Trustee for the setting aside of cash and other

assets of  the Company  as and  when it so determines in its sole discretion for

the meeting  of part or all of its future contractual obligations to some or all

of the  Contract Holders  and Participants.  Contributions by the Company to the

Trust shall  be in  amounts determined  solely by  the Company  and shall  be in

respect of  only those  Contract Holders  and Participants  selected prior  to a

Change in  Control by  the Company  from time  to time  as it  determines.   The

purpose of  this Trust is to provide a fund from which the Company's obligations

under the  Contracts and  Deferred Compensation  Plan may  be payable  and as to

which  Contract  Holders  and  Participants  with  Accounts  hereunder  may,  by

exercising the  procedures set  forth herein,  have access to some or all of the

amounts due  them under the Contracts and the Deferred Compensation Plan as such

become  due   without  having  the  payment  of  such  amounts  subject  to  the

administrative control  of the  Company unless  the Company becomes insolvent as

defined in  Section 2.1.   The  Company  further  represents  that  neither  the

Contracts nor the Deferred Compensation Plan are part of and do not constitute a


<PAGE>7


qualified plan  under Section  401(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code

and therefore  the Contracts  and Deferred  Compensation Plan are not subject to

any of the Code requirements applicable to tax-qualified plans.



          2.3  Amounts paid  or delivered by the Company to the Trustee pursuant

to Section 1.1 shall not revert to the Company except as provided below:



               (a)  Upon the  satisfaction of  all liabilities of the Company to

Contract Holders  and Participants  for whom Accounts have been established, any

assets of  the Fund  then remaining may be distributed to the Company as per its

instructions as provided in Section 3.6 or



               (b)  Upon termination  of the  Trust as  provided in Section 9.1,

the Fund may be distributed to the Company in accordance with Section 9.2.; or



               (c)  Upon the insolvency of the Company (as determined in Section

2.1), the  assets of  the Fund  shall be  distributed  in  accordance  with  the

provisions of Section 2.1; or



               (d)  Within six  (6) months  after the payment or delivery by the

Company of  any amounts  to the Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1, the Company may

request that  any portion  of such  amounts be  returned to the Company (whether

affecting  the   Accounts  of   all  or   any  specified   Contract  Holders  or

Participants).   Such a  request shall  be honored by the Trustee only if at the

date of  such request,  the Board  of Directors  of the  Company is  made up  of

"Continuing Directors" (as defined below).  Further, within the original six (6)

month period  during which  the Continuing Directors may request a return to the

Company of amounts paid or delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1, the

Continuing Directors  may request  a one  time extension  of such  period for an

additional six months.

               (i)       "Acquiring Person"  shall mean  any  person  who  is  a

          Beneficial Owner shall be deemed outstanding.



               (ii)      "Affiliate" and  "Associate" shall  have the respective

          provided, however,  that the  Company  shall,  for  purposes  of  this

          definition, be  deemed to be the "registrant", as such term is used in

          have "Beneficial Ownership", of any securities as to which such person

          or any  of such  person's Affiliates or Associates is or may be deemed

          to be the beneficial owner pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities

          Exchange Act  of 1934,  as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as

          well as any securities as to which such person or any of such person's

          Affiliates or  Associates has  the right  to become  Beneficial  Owner

          (whether such  right is  exercisable immediately  or  only  after  the

          passage  of   time)  pursuant   to  any   agreement,  arrangement   or

          understanding,       or        upon       the        exercise       of

          otherwise; provided,  however, that  a person  shall not be deemed the

          "Beneficial Owner", or to have "Beneficial Ownership", of any security

          (A) solely  because such  security has  been tendered  pursuant  to  a

          tender or  exchange offer  made by such person or any of such person's

          Affiliates or  Associates until such tendered security is accepted for

          purchase or  exchange, (B)  solely because  such person or any of such

          person's Affiliates  or Associates  has or shares the power to vote or

          direct the voting of such security pursuant to a revocable proxy given

          in response  to a  public proxy  or consent solicitation made pursuant

          to, and  in accordance  with, the  applicable rules and regulations of

          the Securities  Exchange Act  of 1934,  except if  such power  (or the

          arrangements relating  thereto) is  then reportable  under Item  6  of

          Schedule 13D  under the  Securities Exchange  Act of  1934  (  or  any

          similar provision of a comparable or successor report) or (C) held for

          or pursuant  to the  terms of  any employee  stock ownership  or other

          employee benefit  plan of  the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary of

          the Company  and either  in effect  on the  date of  this Agreement or

          hereafter approved by the Continuing Directors.



               (iv)      "Change in  Control" means the occurrence of either (1)

          a transaction which has required the affirmative vote of holders of at

          least 80%  of the  outstanding shares  of capital stock of the Company

          regularly entitled  to vote  in the  election of  the directors of the

          Company by  reason of  Article Seven  of the  Company's Certificate of

          Incorporation, or  (2) the  acquisition by  any  person,  partnership,

          corporation or  other organization,  or by  any group  of two  or more

          thereof  who  are  affiliates  (as  defined  by  Rule  405  under  the

          Securities Act  of 1933)  or who  are acting  in concert in respect of

          such acquisition  of more  than 25% of such outstanding shares of such

          capital stock,  if the Company has opposed an acquisition of shares of

          the  Company   by  such  person,  partnership,  corporation  or  other

          
<PAGE>10


          organization or  group before any insurance regulatory authority whose

          approval of such acquisition was required.  Provided, however, that an

          event described  in (1)  or (2) above shall not constitute a Change In

          Control if  within 10  days of  such event  the  Continuing  Directors

          provide the  Trustee with  a resolution  expressly stating  that  such

          event shall  not constitute  a Change  In Control  for the purposes of

          this Agreement.



               (v)       "Continuing Directors" shall mean those individuals who

          constitute the  Board of  Directors of the Company on the date of this

          Agreement and  any individual  becoming a  director subsequent  to the

          date of  this Agreement  whose election  or nomination for election by

          the Company's  shareholders is  approved by  a vote  of at  least  six

          Continuing Directors  who constitute  not less  than three-quarters of

          the directors  comprising the  then Continuing  Directors, either by a

          specific vote  or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in

          which such  individual is  named as  a nominee  for director,  without

          objection to  such nomination, provided that no person shall under any

          circumstances be  considered a Continuing Director from and after such

          time as  such person is an Acquiring Person, an Affiliate or Associate

          of an Acquiring Person, or a nominee or representative of any thereof.

          References to  an approval  or other act of Continuing Directors shall

          mean approvals  given or  actions authorized  and/or taken both (A) by

          the Board of Directors of the Company (or any legal successor thereto)

          of which  at the  time not  less than eight directors constituting not

          less than  two-thirds of  the members are Continuing Directors and (B)

          by not less than six Continuing Directors constituting at least three-

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  ___________



          3.1  By its  acceptance of this Trust the Trustee hereby agrees to the

designation by  the Company  of KPMG  Peat Marwick  as the Company's independent

contractor (the  "Independent Contractor")  under  this  Agreement.    Provided,

however,  that  the  Trustee  conditions  its  acceptance  of  such  Independent

Contractor  upon   the  Independent   Contractor's  execution  of  the  Form  of

Acknowledgment and  Acceptance, or a similar form acceptable to both the Company

and the  Trustee, set  forth in  Exhibit A  of this  Agreement.   It  is  herein

recognized that  said Independent  Contractor is  also acting as the independent

consulting  actuary   of  the  Company  and  that  the  Trustee  shall  have  no

responsibility hereunder for the continued retention of KPMG Peat Marwick and/or

any responsibility  assigned to  said Independent  Contractor or its performance

thereof so  long  as  said  firm  continues  to  be  the  Company's  independent

consulting actuary.   In  the event  the Company replaces or no longer uses said

firm as  its independent  consulting actuary, the Trustee in its sole discretion

may, but  need not,  designate a  new Independent  Contractor from  the list set

forth in Exhibit B of this Agreement or may continue to use the same Independent

Contractor; or  in the  event said  firm does  not  accept  its  designation  as

Independent Contractor or accepts said designation and subsequently resigns, the

Trustee shall  designate another  entity from the list set forth in Exhibit B of

this Agreement  to be  the Independent  Contractor, provided  however, that  any

Independent Contractor  appointed by  the Trustee  shall be  independent of  the

Company.   The Company  shall pay  or reimburse  the Trustee  for all  fees  and

expenses of  any Independent  Contractor appointed  by the Trustee.  The Company

shall indemnify  and hold  the Trustee  harmless for any actions or omissions of

any  Independent  Contractor  and  shall  indemnify  and  hold  the  Independent

Contractor  harmless  for  any  actions  or  omissions  of  the  Trustee.    The

Independent Contractor  shall be  paid for  its services  on an  hourly basis at

rates comparable  to the  rates that  the  Independent  Contractor  charges  for

comparable services to its other clients.


<PAGE>12


          3.2  Except for  the records  dealing solely  with the  Fund  and  its

investment, which shall be maintained by the Trustee, the Independent Contractor

shall maintain all the records of Contract Holders and Participants contemplated

by this  Agreement, including  the maintenance  of the separate Accounts of each

Contract Holder  and Participant under this Agreement and the maintenance of the

General Account.   All  such records shall be made available promptly on request

of the  Trustee of  the Company.   In  the event  of a  Change  in  Control  the

Independent Contractor shall also be responsible for information with respect to

payments, if  any, to  Contract Holders  and Participants and shall perform such

other duties  and responsibilities  as the  Company or the Trustee determines is

necessary or advisable to achieve the objectives of this Agreement.



          3.3  Upon the  establishment of  this Trust  or as  soon thereafter as

practicable, the  Company shall furnish to the Independent Contractor and to the

Trustee all  of the information necessary to determine the amounts payable to or

with respect  to each Contract Holder or Participant (hereinafter referred to as

the "Contract  Holder and Participant Data").  Notwithstanding the occurrence of

a Change  in Control,  the Company  shall regularly,  at least annually, furnish

revised  updated  Contract  Holder  and  Participant  Data  to  the  Independent

Contractor.   In the  event the  Company refuses  or neglects to provide updated

Contract  Holder   or  Participant  information,  as  contemplated  herein,  the

Independent  Contractor   shall  be  entitled  to  rely  upon  the  most  recent

information furnished to it by the Company.



          3.4  Prior to  a Change  in Control, upon the direction of the Company

the  Independent   Contractor  shall   prepare  a   certification  (a   "Payment

Certification") to  the Trustee  that the  Company's obligations  to a  Contract

Holder or Participant have become payable.  Notwithstanding any other provisions

of this  Agreement, after  a Change  in Control upon the proper application of a

Contract Holder  or  Participant,  the  Independent  Contractor  shall,  without

direction from  the Company,  prepare a  Payment Certification  to the  Trustee,

based upon the most recent Contract Holder and Participant Data furnished to the

Independent Contractor  prior to  the Change  in Control  and  any  supplemental


<PAGE>13


information furnished  to the  Independent Contractor  by a  Contract Holder  or

Participant upon  which the Independent Contractor may reasonably rely, that the

Company's obligations to the Contract Holder or Participant have become payable.

In the  event that  the Trustee  (a) suspends payments from the Fund pursuant to

Section 2.1,  and (b)  pursuant to  a court  order as  required by  Section 2.1,

subsequently  resumes   all  of  its  duties  and  responsibilities  under  this

Agreement, the Independent Contractor shall prepare a certification (an "Accrued

Payment Certification") of all amounts that would otherwise have been payable to

each Contract  Holder or Participant from the Fund during such period of time as

the  Trustee   suspended  payments  pursuant  to  Section  2.1.    Each  Payment

Certification and each Accrued Payment Certification shall include the amount of

such payments,  the manner  of payment and the name, address and social security

number of  the recipient.  Each Payment Certification shall be updated annually.

The Trustee  shall be  entitled to  rely on  any Payment  Certification  or  any

Accrued Payment  Certification provided by the Independent Contractor, and shall

have no  duty to  verify the  accuracy thereof.   Upon  the receipt of a Payment

Certification or an Accrued Payment Certification and appropriate federal, state

and  local   tax  withholding  information,  the  Trustee  shall  commence  cash

distributions from  the Trust  Fund in  accordance therewith  to the  person  or

persons so  indicated and  to the  Company with  respect to taxes required to be

withheld and  the Independent  Contractor shall  charge the  Account established

hereunder for  the Contract  Holder or  Participant.  The Independent Contractor

shall furnish  a copy  of each  Payment Certification  and each  Accrued Payment

Certification to  the Contract  Holder, the  Participant  or  the  Participant's

beneficiary for  which such  certification has been prepared.  The Company shall

have full  responsibility for  the payment  of  all  withholding  taxes  to  the

appropriate  taxing   authority  and   shall  furnish   each  Contract   Holder,

Participant, beneficiary  of the Participant and the Independent Contractor with

the appropriate  tax information  form evidencing  such payment  and the  amount

thereof.



          3.5  Notwithstanding any  provision in this Agreement to the contrary,

in the  event the  Trustee in  its sole discretion reasonably disagrees with the

accuracy or  propriety of  any Payment  Certification  or  any  Accrued  Payment

Certification, the


<PAGE>14


Trustee, if unable to resolve such disagreement with the Independent Contractor,

may apply  to a  court of  appropriate jurisdiction  for judicial review of such

Payment Certification  or Accrued Payment Certification.  Pending the resolution

of any  disagreement with the Independent Contractor with regard to the accuracy

or propriety  of any Payment Certification or any Accrued Payment Certification,

the Trustee  shall not  distribute any  amount from  the Fund  pursuant to  such

Payment Certification  or Accrued  Payment Certification.  The Trustee shall use

its reasonable  best efforts  to promptly  resolve any such disagreement that it

may have with the Independent Contractor.



          3.6  All amounts  payable from  the  Fund  to  a  Contract  Holder  or

Participant shall  be paid  solely from  the account  of such Contract Holder or

Participant.   Upon the  satisfaction of  all Company  liabilities to a Contract

Holder or  Participant for  whom an  Account has been established hereunder, the

Independent Contractor  shall prepare  a certification to the Trustee and to the

Company showing  the balance,  if any,  remaining in  such Contract  Holder's or

Participant's Account.   Such  balance from  a Participant's  Account  shall  be

allocated first  among Participant Accounts and, if the liability of the Company

to all  Participants has been satisfied, the balance, if any, shall be allocated

among the  Contract Holders'  Accounts.   Similarly, any Balance from a Contract

Holder's Account shall be allocated first among the Accounts of Contract Holders

and, if the liability of the Company to all Contract Holders has been satisfied,

the balance,  if any, shall be allocated among the Participants' Accounts.  Such

balance, whether  divided among  the Contract Holders or the Participants, shall

be reallocated  ratably by the Independent Contractor (using the information set

forth on  the most  recent estimated  statement of  amounts  payable  under  the

Contracts or  under the  Deferred Compensation  Plan prepared by the Independent

Contractor pursuant  to Section  3.3) to  the Accounts  of Contract  Holders  or

Participants who  at such  time have  Contracts in  effect or  interests in  the

Deferred Compensation  Plan (including  Accounts which  may have previously been

reduced to a zero balance) in the ratio that liabilities in respect of each such

Contract  Holder   under  the   Contracts  or  Participant  under  the  Deferred

Compensation Plan  bear to the total liabilities to all such Contract Holders or

Participants.  Upon the satisfaction of


<PAGE>15


all liabilities of the Company to all Contract Holders and Participants for whom

Accounts have  been established  hereunder,  the  Independent  Contractor  shall

prepare a  certification to the Trustee and to the Company, and the Trustee upon

receipt of  such certification  shall transfer  all of the assets of the Fund to

the trust established between the Company and Trustee, dated September 25, 1990,

with regard  to the  Company's Supplemental  Retirement Plan and as amended with

regard to  its Supplemental  Employee Savings  and Investment  Plan  (the  "SRIP

Trust").   Provided, however,  that if  the SRIP Trust has been terminated, upon

receiving the  certification referred  to in  the previous sentence, the Trustee

shall thereupon  hold or  distribute the  Fund in  accordance with  the  written

instructions of  the Company.   The Trustee and the Independent Contractor shall

have  no   responsibility  for   determining  whether  any  Contract  Holder  or

Participant has died and shall be entitled to rely upon information furnished by

the Company.



          3.7  The Company  reserves the  right to  transfer to the Fund paid-up

life insurance, retirement income or annuity policies or contracts on or for the

life of  any Contract  Holder or  Participant  for  whom  an  Account  has  been

established hereunder or, prior to a Change in Control, to direct the Trustee to

purchase any  such policies or contracts on or for the life of any such Contract

Holder or  Participant out  of the amounts allocated to his or her Account.  Any

such policy  or contract  shall be an asset of the Fund subject to the claims of

the Company's creditors in the event of insolvency, as specified in Section 2.1.

The proceeds  of any  life insurance  policy shall upon the death of the insured

Contract Holder  be credited  to the  General Account.  The proceeds of any life

insurance policy  on a  Participant in  the Deferred  Compensation Plan shall be

distributed to  Participant's beneficiary to the extent of any Company liability

under the Deferred Compensation Plan, and thereafter to the General Account.



          3.8  Nothing provided  in this  Agreement shall relieve the Company of

its liabilities  to pay  the  amounts  due  under  the  Contracts  and  Deferred

Compensation Plan  except to  the extent such liabilities are met by application

of Fund  assets.   It is  the  intent  of  the  Company  to  have  each  Account

established hereunder treated as a separate


<PAGE>16


trust designed  to satisfy  in whole  or in  part the  Company's legal liability

under the  Contracts in respect of the Contract Holder for whom such Account has

been established, or the Company's legal liability to each Participant under the

Deferred Compensation  Plan.   The Company,  therefore, agrees  that all income,

deductions and credits of each such Account belong to it as owner for income tax

purposes and will be included on the Company's income tax returns.



                                   ARTICLE IV
                                   __________



          4.1  The  Company  shall  provide  the  Trustee  and  the  Independent

Contractor with  a certified  copy of  each of  the Contracts  and the  Deferred

Compensation Plan and all amendments thereto and of the resolutions of the Board

of Directors  of the  Company approving  each of  the  Contracts,  the  Deferred

Compensation Plan  and all  amendments thereto,  promptly upon  their  adoption.

After the  execution of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly file with the

Trustee and  the Independent  Contractor a  certified  list  of  the  names  and

specimen signatures of the directors and officers of the Company and any delegee

authorized to act for it.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the

Independent Contractor  of the  addition or  deletion of any person's name to or

from such  list,  respectively.    Until  receipt  by  the  Trustee  and/or  the

Independent Contractor  of notice  that any person is no longer authorized so to

act, the  Trustee or  the Independent  Contractor may  continue to  rely on  the

authority of the person.  All certifications, notices and directions by any such

person or  persons to  the Trustee  or the  Independent Contractor  shall be  in

writing signed  by such  person or  persons.   The Trustee  and the  Independent

Contractor may rely on any such certification, notice or direction purporting to

have been  signed by  or on behalf of such person or persons that the Trustee or

the Independent  Contractor believes  to have  been signed thereby.  The Trustee

and the  Independent Contractor  may also  rely on  any certification, notice or

direction of the Company that the Trustee or the Independent Contractor believes

to have  been signed  by a duly authorized officer or agent of the Company.  The

Company shall be responsible for keeping accurate books and records with respect

to the


<PAGE>17


employees of  the Company,  their compensation  and their  rights and  interests

under the Contracts and the Deferred Compensation Plan.



          4.2  The  Company  shall  make  its  contributions  to  the  Trust  in

accordance with  appropriate corporate  action and  the Trustee  shall  have  no

responsibility with  respect thereto,  except to  add such  contributions to the

Fund.



          4.3  The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee for any

liability or  expenses, including  without limitation  advances  for  or  prompt

reimbursement of  reasonable fees  and expenses  of  counsel  and  other  agents

retained by  it, incurred  by the  Trustee with  respect to  holding,  managing,

investing or  otherwise administering  the Fund, other than by its negligence or

willful misconduct.



          4.4  The Company  shall indemnify  and hold  harmless the  Independent

Contractor for  any liability or expenses, including without limitation advances

for or prompt reimbursement of reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other

agents retained  by it,  incurred by  the Independent Contractor with respect to

keeping the  records for Contract Holders' and Participants' Accounts, reporting

thereon to  Contract Holders and Participants, certifying payment information to

the Trustee,  determining the  status of  Accounts and  payments  hereunder  and

otherwise carrying  out its  obligations under  this Agreement, other than those

resulting from the Independent Contractor's negligence or willful misconduct.

hereunder, including  without limitation  its duty  to invest  and reinvest  the

Fund, if  it acts  in good  faith and  in accordance  with  the  terms  of  this

<PAGE>18


          5.2  Subject to  investment guidelines  agreed to in writing from time

to time  prior to  a Change  in Control,  by the  Company and  the Trustee,  the

Trustee shall  have the  power in investing and reinvesting the Fund in its sole

discretion:



               (a)  To invest  and reinvest  in any  property, real, personal or

mixed, wherever  situated and  whether or not productive of income or consisting

amount of the Fund;



               (b)  To invest  and reinvest  all or  any  portion  of  the  Fund

collectively through  the medium  of any  common, collective or commingled trust

fund that  may be  established and  maintained by  the Trustee,  subject to  the

instrument or  instruments establishing  such trust  fund or  funds and with the

terms of  such instrument  or instruments,  as from  time to time amended, being

incorporated into  this Agreement  to the  extent of  the equitable share of the

Fund in any such common, collective or commingled trust fund;



               (c)  To retain any property at any time received by the Trustee;



               (d)  To sell  or exchange  any property  held by  it at public or

private sale,  for cash  or on  credit, to  grant and  exercise options  for the

purchase or  exchange thereof, to exercise all conversion or subscription rights

pertaining to any such

the future;



               (e)  To participate in any plan of reorganization, consolidation,

merger, combination, liquidation or other similar plan relating to property held

by it  and to consent to or oppose any such plan or any action thereunder or any

contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale or other action by any person;



               (f)  To deposit  any property  held by  it with  any  protective,

reorganization or  similar committee,  to delegate  discretionary power thereto,

and to  pay part  of the  expenses and  compensation thereof and any assessments

levied with respect to any such property so deposited;



               (g)  To extend the time of payment of any obligation held by it;



               (h)  To hold  uninvested  any  moneys  received  by  it,  without

liability for  interest thereon, until such moneys shall be invested, reinvested

               (k)  To manage,  administer, operate,  insure,  repair,  improve,

develop, preserve,  mortgage, lease  or otherwise deal with, for any period, any

any provision  of  any  such  mortgage  or  lease  and  to  make  provision  for

amortization of the investment in or depreciation of the value of such property;



               (l)  To employ suitable agents and counsel, who may be counsel to

the  Company   or  the  Trustee,  and  to  pay  their  reasonable  expenses  and

compensation from the Fund to the extent not paid by the Company;



               (m)  To cause  any property  held by it to be registered and held

in the  name of  one or  more nominees,  with or  without the  addition of words

indicating that  such securities  are held  in a fiduciary capacity, and to hold

securities in bearer form;



               (n)  To settle,  compromise or  submit to arbitration any claims,

debts or damages due or owing to or from the Trust, respectively, to commence or

defend suits  or legal  proceedings to protect any interest of the Trust, and to

represent the Trust in all suits or legal proceedings in any court or before any

other body  or tribunal;  provided, however,  that  the  Trustee  shall  not  be

required to  take any  such action  unless it shall have been indemnified by the

Company to  its reasonable  satisfaction against  liability or expenses it might

incur therefrom;



               (o)  To organize  under the  laws of  any state  a corporation or

trust for the purpose of acquiring and holding title to any property which it is

authorized to  acquire hereunder and to exercise with respect thereto any or all

               (p)  Generally,  to   do  all  acts,  whether  or  not  expressly

authorized, that  the Trustee may deem necessary or desirable for the protection

of the Fund.



               Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall upon the written

direction of the Company prior to a Change in Control, invest all or part of the

amount to


<PAGE>21


the credit  of any  Contract Holder's  or Participant's  Account in a commercial

annuity, retirement  income or life insurance policy or contract selected by the

Company and  the Trustee  shall have  no responsibility  for any such investment

other than as owner and custodian thereof.



               Notwithstanding the  foregoing, after  a Change  in Control,  the

Trustee shall  follow the investment guidelines agreed to by the Company and the

Trustee as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.



          5.3  No person  dealing with the Trustee shall be under any obligation

to see  to the proper application of any money paid or property delivered to the

Trustee or  to inquire  into the Trustee's authority as to any transaction.  The

Independent Contractor's  obligations are limited solely to those explicitly set

forth herein  and the  Independent  Contractor  shall  have  no  responsibility,

authority or  control, direct or indirect, over the maintenance or investment of

the Fund and shall have no obligation in respect of the Trustee or the Trustee's

compliance with the Independent Contractor's certifications to the Trustee.

accordance with Article III hereof.

property, to  the person  to whom such distribution or payment is to be made, at

such address  as may  have been  last furnished  to the  Trustee, or  if no such

address shall  have been so furnished, to such person in care of the Company, or

(if so  directed by  the Company)  by crediting the account of such person or by

transferring funds to such person's account by bank or wire transfer.

          6.1  The Company  shall pay  any Federal,  state or local taxes on the

Fund, or any part thereof, and on the income therefrom.



          6.2  The Company  shall pay to the Trustee its reasonable expenses for

the management  and administration  of the  Fund, including  without  limitation

advances for  or prompt reimbursement of reasonable expenses and compensation of

counsel and  other agents  employed by  the Trustee,  all other  reasonable  and

necessary expenses  of managing and administering the Trust that are not paid by

the Company  including, but not limited to, investment management fees, computer

time charges,  data retrieval  and input costs, and charges for time expended by

personnel of  the Trustee in fulfilling the Trustee's duties.  The Company shall

also pay  to the  Trustee reasonable  compensation for  its services  as Trustee

hereunder, the  amount of  which shall  be agreed  upon from time to time by the

Company and  the Trustee  in writing;  provided, however,  that if  the  Trustee

forwards  an  amended  compensation  schedule  to  the  Company  requesting  its

agreement thereto  and the  Company fails  to object  thereto within thirty (30)

days of  its receipt,  the amended  compensation schedule  shall be deemed to be

agreed upon  by the  Company and  the Trustee.   Such  expenses and compensation

shall be  a charge  on the  Fund and  shall constitute  a lien  in favor  of the

Trustee until  paid by  the Company.  All such expenses and compensation charged

to the  Fund, unless otherwise paid by the Company, shall be applied against the

General Account.   In the event that the assets allocated to the General Account

are entirely  depleted, all  such expenses  and compensation charged to the Fund

shall be  applied pro-rata  against all  Accounts in  proportion to  the  assets

allocated thereto.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.2, to

the extent  that the  Trustee, in  its discretion,  decides that  an expense  is

specifically attributable  to one  or more specified Accounts such expense shall

be charged to such specified Accounts in such proportion as the Trustee decides.

Prior to  allocating any  particular expense  to a specific Account, the Trustee

shall provide  notice of  its intention  to so  allocate  to  the  Company,  the


<PAGE>23


Independent Contractor  and the  Contract Holder  or Participant  for whom  such

Account was established.

          7.1  The Trustee  shall maintain records with respect to the Fund that

show all  its receipts  and disbursements hereunder.  The records of the Trustee

with respect  to the  Fund shall  be open  to inspection  by the Company, or its

representatives, at  all reasonable  times during  normal business  hours of the

Trustee and  may be audited not more frequently than once each fiscal year by an

independent certified  public  accountant  engaged  by  the  Company;  provided,

however, the  Trustee shall  be entitled  to additional  compensation  from  the

Company in  respect of audits or auditors' requests which the Trustee determines

to exceed  the ordinary  course of  the usual  scope of such examinations of its

records.



          7.2  Within a  reasonable time  after the close of each fiscal year of

the Company (or, in the Trustee's discretion, at more frequent intervals), or of

any termination  of the  duties of  the Trustee  hereunder,  the  Trustee  shall

prepare and  deliver to  the Company  a statement of transactions reflecting its

acts and  transactions as  Trustee during  such fiscal  year, portion thereof or

during such  period from  the close  of the  last fiscal  year or last statement

period to  the termination  of the  Trustee's duties,  respectively, including a

statement of  the then  current value  of the  Fund.  The Independent Contractor

shall also  prepare and  furnish to  the Company a statement of the then current

value of  each Account  and of the General Account.  Any such statement shall be

deemed an  account stated  and accepted  and approved  by the  Company, and  the

Trustee shall  be relieved  and discharged,  as if such account had been settled

and allowed by a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, unless

protested by  written notice  to the  Trustee within  sixty (60) days of receipt

thereof by the Company.


<PAGE>24


          The Trustee  shall have  the right  to apply at any time to a court of

competent jurisdiction for judicial settlement of any account of the Trustee not

previously settled  as herein  provided or for the determination of any question

of construction  or for  instructions regarding  this Agreement.   In  any  such

action or  proceeding it  shall be necessary to join as parties only the Trustee

and the Company (although the Trustee may also join such other parties as it may

deem  appropriate),  and  any  judgment  or  decree  entered  therein  shall  be

conclusive.

                                  ____________



          8.1  Prior to  a Change  in Control the Trustee may resign at any time

by delivering  written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however, that no

such resignation shall take effect until the earlier of (i) sixty (60) days from

the date  of delivery of such notice to the Company or (ii) the appointment of a

successor trustee.   Following  a Change in Control, the Trustee may resign only

under one of the following circumstances:



               (a)  The Trustee  is no longer in the business, or is actively in

          the process of removing itself from the business, of acting as trustee

          for employee benefit plans.



               (b)  The Trustee  determines that  a conflict  of interest exists

          which  would  prohibit  it  from  fulfilling  its  duties  under  this

          Agreement in  an ethically proper manner, and a law firm (appointed by

          the President  of the  Association of the Bar of the City of New York,

          or by  the American  Arbitration Association,  if the President of the

          Association of  the Bar  of the  City of  New York fails to so appoint

          within thirty  days of a request for such appointment, or notifies the

          Trustee that  it is  unable to make such appointment) concurs with the

          Trustee.  The Trustee shall use its best efforts to avoid the creation

          of   such    a   conflict.        The    decision    of    such    law

          
<PAGE>25


          firm shall  be binding,  but may  be appealed  in the same manner, and

          under the  same conditions,  as if it were made by an arbitrator.  All

          costs  incurred  by  the  Trustee  in  connection  with  obtaining  or

          appealing such  a decision  shall be reimbursable expenses pursuant to

          Article VI hereof.



               (c)  The  assets   of  the   Fund  have  been  exhausted  or  are

          insufficient to  pay  accrued  and  reasonably  anticipated  fees  and

          expenses of the Trustee hereunder, the Company has refused voluntarily

          to pay the Trustee's accrued fees and expenses as required pursuant to

          Section 6.2 and the Trustee has been unsuccessful in obtaining a court

          order requiring  the Company  to make such payments or has been unable

          to collect on a judgment for such fees and expenses.



          Notwithstanding the  above, the  Trustee may  resign for  reasons  set

forth in  (a) or (b) only if it has obtained the agreement of a bank with assets

in excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100 million to replace it as

trustee under  the terms of this Agreement.  The decision rendered under (b), if

that is  the reason  for the  Trustee's resignation,  may expressly  excuse  the

Trustee from  this requirement.   In any event, the Trustee shall continue to be

custodian of the Trust assets until the new trustee is in place, and the Trustee

shall be  entitled to  expenses and fees through the later of the effective date

of its  resignation as Trustee and the end of its custodianship of the assets of

the Fund.



          8.2  Prior to  a Change  in Control  the Trustee may be removed at any

time by  the Company,  pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the

Company, upon delivery to the Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution and

sixty (60)  days' written  notice of  such removal, unless such notice period is

waived in  whole or  in part  by the Trustee.  Following a Change in Control the

Trustee may  be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the

Contract Holders and Participants voting together on a per capita basis who were

Contract    Holders     or    Participants     on    the     date     of     the


<PAGE>26


occurrence of the Change in Control, and sixty (60) days' written notice of such

removal, unless such notice period is waived in whole or in part by the Trustee.



          8.3  Upon the  resignation or  removal  of  the  Trustee,  U.S.  Trust

Company shall  be appointed  as successor trustee.  In the event that U.S. Trust

Company refuses  to accept its appointment as successor trustee pursuant to this

Section 8.3, Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. shall be appointed as successor trustee.

In the  event that  Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. refuses to accept its appointment

as successor  trustee pursuant to this Section 8.3, a successor trustee shall be

appointed pursuant  to Section  8.4.   The appointment  of a  successor  trustee

pursuant to  this Section 8.3 shall take effect upon the delivery to the Trustee

of a  written acceptance  by such successor trustee, duly executed thereby.  Any

successor trustee  shall have  all the  rights, powers  and duties  granted  the

Trustee hereunder.



          8.4  Subject to  the provisions  of Section  8.3, prior to a Change in

Control, upon  the resignation  or removal  of the  Trustee, a successor trustee

shall be  appointed by  the Company.   Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3,

following a  Change in Control, upon the resignation of the Trustee, a successor

trustee shall be appointed by the Trustee, and upon the removal of the Trustee a

successor trustee  shall be  appointed by  the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

the Contract  Holders and  Participants voting  on a  per capita  basis who held

Contracts or  participated in  the Deferred Compensation Plan on the date of the

occurrence of the Change in Control.  Any successor trustee appointed under this

Section 8.4  shall be  chosen from  the list of potential successor trustees set

forth in  Exhibit C.   In the event that all of the potential successor trustees

set forth  in Exhibit  C refuse  to accept  an appointment as successor trustee,

then the  successor trustee  shall be  appointed as  otherwise provided  in this

Section 8.4,  and shall be a bank or trust company established under the laws of

the United  States or  a State within the United States with assets in excess of

$2 billion  and net  worth in  excess of  $100 million.   The  appointment of  a

successor trustee  pursuant to  this Section  8.4 shall  take  effect  upon  the

delivery to  the Trustee of (a) a written appointment of such successor trustee,

duly executed by the


<PAGE>27


Company, the  Trustee, or two-thirds of the Contract Holders, as provided for in

this Section  8.4, and  (b) a written acceptance by such successor trustee, duly

executed thereby.   Any  successor trustee shall have all the rights, powers and

duties granted the Trustee hereunder.



          8.5  If, within  sixty (60)  days of  the delivery  of  the  Trustee's

written  notice  of  resignation,  a  successor  trustee  shall  not  have  been

appointed, the  Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the

appointment of a successor trustee.



          8.6  Upon  the   resignation  or   removal  of  the  Trustee  and  the

appointment of a successor trustee, and after the acceptance and approval of its

account, the  Trustee shall  transfer and  deliver the  Fund to  such successor.

Under no  circumstances shall  the Trustee  transfer or  deliver the Fund to any

successor which is not a bank or trust company established under the laws of the

United States  or a  State within  the United States with assets in excess of $2

billion and net worth in excess of $100 million.

                                   __________



          9.1  Prior to  a Change  in Control, the Trust established pursuant to

this Agreement  may only  be terminated by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

the Contract Holders and Participants voting on a per capita basis.  Following a

Change in  Control, the  Trust established pursuant to this Agreement may not be

terminated by  the Company  prior to  the satisfaction  of all  liabilities with

respect to  all Contract  Holders and  Participants.    Following  a  Change  in

Control, upon receipt of a written certification from the Independent Contractor

that all  liabilities have  been satisfied  with respect to all Contract Holders

and Participants, the Company pursuant to a resolution of its Board of Directors

may terminate  the Trust upon delivery to the Trustee of (a) a certified copy of

such resolution,  (b) an  original certification  of the  Independent Contractor

that all such


<PAGE>28


liabilities have been satisfied and (c) a written instrument of termination duly

executed and acknowledged in the same form as this Agreement.



          9.2  Prior to  a Change  in Control, upon the termination of the Trust

in accordance  with Section  9.1, the  Trustee shall,  after the  acceptance and

approval of  its account, distribute the Fund to the Company.  After a Change in

Control, upon  the termination  of the Trust in accordance with Section 9.1, the

Trustee shall, after the acceptance and approval of its account, transfer all of

the assets  of the  Fund to  the SRIP Trust.  Provided, however, that if after a

Change in  Control the  SRIP Trust  has been terminated, upon the termination of

the Trust  in accordance  with Section 9.1 the Trustee shall distribute the Fund

to the  Company.   Upon completing  such  distribution,  the  Trustee  shall  be

relieved and  discharged.   The powers  of the Trustee shall continue as long as

any part of the Fund remains in its possession.



                                   ARTICLE X
                                   _________



          10.1 This Agreement  may be  amended, in whole or in part, at any time

and from  time to time, by the Company, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of

Directors thereof  by delivery  to the  Trustee of  a  certified  copy  of  such

resolution and  a written  instrument duly executed and acknowledged in the same

form as  this Agreement,  except that  the duties  and responsibilities  of  the

Trustee shall  not be increased without the Trustee's written consent; provided,

however, any  such  amendment  affecting  any  Account  or  the  procedures  for

distribution thereof  shall not  become effective  until sixty (60) days after a

copy of  such amendment  has been delivered by registered mail by the Company or

the Independent  Contractor to  each Contract  Holder or Participant for whom an

Account is  maintained under  this Agreement.  In the event the Company, Trustee

or Independent  Contractor receives  written objections  to such  amendment from

such person  within  such  sixty  (60)  day  period,  such  amendment  shall  be

ineffective and  void in  respect of  the Contract  Holder so  objecting to  the

amendment.

                                   __________



          11.1 This Agreement  shall be construed and interpreted under, and the

Trust hereby  created shall  be governed  by, the  laws of the State of New York

insofar as  such laws  do not  contravene any  applicable Federal laws, rules or

regulations.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to subject either the

Trust created  hereunder or  the Contracts  to the  Employee  Retirement  Income

Security Act of 1974, as amended.



          11.2 Neither the  gender nor  the number  (singular or  plural) of any

word shall  be construed  to exclude  another gender  or number when a different

gender or number would be appropriate.



          11.3 No right or interest of any Contract Holder or Participant in the

Fund shall  be transferable  or assignable  or shall  be subject  to alienation,

anticipation or  encumbrance, and no right or interest of any Contract Holder in

any Contract  or any Participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan, or in the

Fund  shall   be  subject   to  any   garnishment,  attachment   or   execution.

Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the  Fund shall  at all  times remain subject to

claims of creditors of the Company in the event the Company becomes insolvent as

provided in Section 2.1.



          11.4 The Company  agrees that  by the  establishment of  this Trust it

hereby foregoes  any  judicial  review  of  certifications  by  the  Independent

Contractor as  to the  amounts payable  to any  persons hereunder.  If a dispute

arises as  to the amounts or timing of any such payments or the persons entitled

thereto under  the Contracts,  the Deferred Compensation Plan or this Agreement,

the Company  agrees that  such dispute  shall be resolved by binding arbitration

proceedings initiated  in accordance  with the rules of the American Arbitration

Association and  that the  results of  such proceedings  shall be conclusive and

shall not  be subject  to judicial  review.   It is  expressly  understood  that

pending the  resolution of any such dispute payments shall be made and continued

by  the  Trustee  in  accordance  with  the  certification  of  the  Independent

Contractor and that the


<PAGE>30


Trustee and  the Independent  Contractor shall have no liability with respect to

such payments.   Provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 11.4 are

subject to  the provisions  of Section  3.5.  The Company also agrees to pay the

entire cost of any arbitration or legal proceeding initiated by it including the

legal fees of the Trustee, the Independent Contractor and the Contract Holder or

Participant regardless  of the  outcome of any such proceeding and until so paid

the expenses thereof shall be a charge on and lien against the Fund.



          11.5 This Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

any successor  to  the  Company  or  its  business  as  the  result  of  merger,

consolidation,  reorganization,   transfer  of   assets  or  otherwise  and  any

subsequent successor  thereto.   In the event of any such merger, consolidation,

reorganization, transfer  of assets  or other similar transaction, the successor

to the  Company or  its business  or  any  subsequent  successor  thereto  shall

promptly notify  the Trustee  in writing  of its  successorship and  furnish the

Trustee and the Independent Contractor with the information specified in Section

4.1 of  this Agreement.  In no event shall any such transaction described herein

suspend or delay the rights of Contract Holders or Participants hereunder.



          11.6 This Agreement  may be  executed in  any number  of counterparts,

each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall together

constitute only one Agreement.



          11.7 Communications to  the Trustee  shall be sent to it at its office

at 450  West 33rd  Street, New York, New York 10001, or to such other address as

the Trustee  may specify in writing.  No communication shall be binding upon the

Trustee until  it is  received by  the Trustee.   Communications  to the Company

shall be sent to the Company's principal offices or to such other address as the

Company may specify in writing.


<PAGE>31


          11.8 In the  event any Contract Holder or Participant is determined to

be subject  to Federal  income tax  on any  amount to  the credit of his Account

under this  Agreement prior  to the time of payment hereunder, the entire amount

determined to be so taxable shall be distributed by the Trustee to such Contract

Holder or  Participant.   An amount  to the  credit of  a Contract  Holder's  or

Participant's Account  shall be  determined to  be subject to Federal income tax

upon the  earliest of:  (a) a  final determination by the United States Internal

Revenue Service  addressed to  the Contract  Holder or  Participant which is not

appealed to the courts; (b) a final determination by the United States Tax Court

or any  other Federal  Court affirming  any such  determination by  the Internal

Revenue Service; or (c) an opinion by counsel chosen by the Company addressed to

the Company and the Trustee, that, by reason of Treasury Regulations, amendments

to the  Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue Service rulings, court

decisions or  other substantial precedent, amounts to the credit of the Accounts

of Contract  Holders or Participants hereunder are subject to Federal income tax

prior to  payment.   The Company shall undertake to defend, and bear the expense

of, any  tax claims  described herein which are asserted by the Internal Revenue

Service or  by the  taxing authorities  of any  State or  locality  against  any

Contract Holder,  Participant or  his or  her spouse,  including the  expense of

attorney fees  and costs  of appeal,  and  shall  have  the  sole  authority  to

determine whether  or not  to appeal  any determination  made  by  the  Internal

Revenue Service  or by  any taxing  authority of any State or locality or by any

court.   The Company  agrees to  reimburse any Contract Holder or Participant or

his or  her spouse for any interest or penalties in respect of Federal, state or

local tax  claims  hereunder  upon  receipt  of  documentation  of  same.    Any

distributions from the Trust Fund to a Contract Holder or Participant under this

Section 11.8  shall  be  applied  in  an  equitable  manner  to  reduce  Company

liabilities to  such Contract  Holder or Participant; provided, however, that in

no event  shall any Contract Holder or Participant have any obligation to return

all or any part of such distribution to the Company if such distribution exceeds

the amount  payable under  the applicable  agreement between the Company and the

Contract Holder or under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

     Amendment, effective January 23, 1996, to Trust Agreement dated March 1,
1994, among USLIFE Corporation, Chemical Bank and KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (as
Independent Contractor) establishing a trust to fund certain employment
contracts and the USLIFE Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan.

     In accordance with the provisions contained in Section 10.1 of the
Agreement, the language in Section 2.3(d) (iv) is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following language:

     "Change In Control" means (i) a merger or consolidation to which the
     Company is a party and for which the approval of any shareholders of the
     Company is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
     13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
     becoming the beneficial owner, directly, or indirectly, of securities of
     the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
     Company's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
     substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a liquidation or
     reorganization of the Company; or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over
     Transaction or Event, as defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and
     Restated Rights Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the
     occurrence of any such transaction or event that otherwise would have
     previously been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.  Provided,
     however, that an event described above shall not constitute a Change In
     Control if within 10 days of such event the Continuing Directors provide
     the Trustee with a resolution expressly stating that such event shall not
     constitute a Change In Control for the purpose of the Agreement.

proceeds thereof,  less the  payments or other distributions which, at the time

of reference,  shall have  been made  by the Trustee, as authorized herein, are

referred to herein as the "Fund" and shall be held by the Trustee, IN TRUST, in

accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.


<PAGE>4


     1.2  The Trustee  shall hold,  manage, invest and otherwise administer the

Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall be responsible

only for  contributions actually  received by it hereunder.  The amount of each

contribution by  the Company  to the  Fund shall  be  determined  in  the  sole

discretion of  the Company and the Trustee shall have no duty or responsibility

with respect thereto.



     1.3  The Independent  Contractor (as  hereinafter in  Section 3.1 defined)

shall   maintain in an equitable manner a separate Account or Accounts for each

Participant under  the Plans  in which  it shall  keep a separate record of the

amount of the fund allocated to such Participant.  The Company shall certify to

the Trustee  and the Independent Contractor at the time of each contribution to

the Fund  the amount  of such  contribution to  be allocated  to each  Account.

Provided, however,  that following  a Change  in Control,  the Company may only

allocate contributions  to either the General Account or to Accounts which were

established prior  to the  Change in  Control.   Any amount  contributed by the

Company that is not so certified shall be allocated to the General Account.



     1.4  The Company  may contribute  to the  Fund an  irrevocable  letter  of

credit (hereinafter referred to as a "L/C").  The following provisions shall be

applicable to any such L/C:

          (a)  the L/C  shall expire  no sooner than one (1) year from the date

of issuance,


<PAGE>5


          (b)  the Company  shall continue to maintain such L/C in effect until

it is  replaced by cash or another irrevocable L/C or this Agreement terminates

pursuant to Article IX, whichever occurs first,



          (c)  the Company shall renew or replace such L/C at least thirty (30)

days before its expiration for an additional period of one (1) year,



          (d)  if such  L/C, or any renewal thereof, is not renewed or replaced

by a  L/C delivered  to the  Trustee at  least  thirty  (30)  days  before  the

expiration of the predecessor L/C, the Trustee may draw down the full amount of

such L/C  and hold  the proceeds  pursuant to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement;

provided, however, that in the event the Company is unable to renew such L/C at

least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the predecessor L/C at a cost

equal to  or less  than twenty-five  (25) basis  points over the current annual

cost of  such L/C,  and the  Trustee with  reasonable diligence  is  unable  to

identify a  bank (within  the definition  of Section  1.4(h)) that will replace

such L/C at a cost equal to or less than twenty-five (25) basis points over the

current annual  cost of  such L/C,  then the  Trustee shall  not draw  down the

amount of such L/C as provided in this Section 1.4(d),



          (e)  the Trustee  may also  draw down  on such  L/C at  any time  the

Trustee determines  the proceeds of such L/C are necessary to allow the Trustee

to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement,


<PAGE>6


          (f)  the proceeds  of such L/C shall be available to the Trustee upon

the Trustee's presentation of its sight draft,



          (g)  the Company  may, at  any time,  replace such  L/C with  another

irrevocable L/C  having substantially similar terms, or with an equal amount of

cash, or any combination thereof,



          (h)  any L/C  shall be  issued by a bank (including the Trustee) with

assets in  excess of  $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100 million, shall

be reasonably  acceptable to  the Trustee,  and shall  be in a form as shall be

reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.



     1.5  The Trustee,  for investment  purposes only, may commingle all of the

assets of  the Fund  and treat  them as  a single  fund, but the records of the

Independent Contractor  at all  times shall  show the  percentages of the Trust

allocable to  each Account  and to  the General  Account.   The Fund  shall  be

revalued by the Trustee as of the last business day of each calendar quarter at

current  market  values,  as  determined  by  the  Trustee.    The  Independent

Contractor shall  allocate any increase or decrease in the current market value

of the  Fund, as determined by the Trustee, pro-rata to all of the Accounts and

to the  General Account  in proportion  to the  balance of the assets allocated

thereto as of the last business day of the previous calendar quarter.

                                  ARTICLE II
                                  __________



     2.1  Notwithstanding any  provision in  this Agreement to the contrary, if

at any time while the Trust is still in existence the Company becomes insolvent

(as defined  herein), the  Trustee shall  upon written  notice thereof from the

Company's Board  of Directors, Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer

suspend the payment of all benefits from the Fund and shall thereafter hold the

Fund in  suspense for  the benefit  of the  creditors of  the Company  until it

receives a  court order  directing  the  disposition  of  the  Fund;  provided,

however, the Trustee may deduct or continue to deduct its fees and expenses and

other expenses  of the  Trust, including taxes and the Independent Contractor's

fees and  expenses, pending the receipt of such court order.  The Company shall

be considered  to be insolvent if (a) a final judicial determination is entered

that the  Company is  unable to pay its debts as such debts mature or (b) there

shall have  been filed by or against the Company in any court or other tribunal

either of  the United  States or  of any State or of any other authority now or

hereafter exercising  jurisdiction, a  petition  in  bankruptcy  or  insolvency

proceedings or  for reorganization  or for  the appointment  of a  receiver  or

trustee of all or substantially all of the Company's property under the present

or any future Federal bankruptcy code or any other present or future applicable

Federal, State  or other  bankruptcy or  insolvency statute  or law.    By  its

approval and  execution of  this Agreement,  the Company  represents and agrees

that its  Board of  Directors and  Chairman of  the Board  and Chief  Executive

Officer, as  from time  to time  acting, shall  have  the  fiduciary  duty  and

responsibility on  behalf of  the Company's  creditors to  give to  the Trustee


<PAGE>8


prompt written  notice of any event of the Company's insolvency and the Trustee

shall be  entitled to rely thereon to the exclusion of all directions or claims

to pay benefits thereafter made.  Absent such notice, the Trustee shall have no

responsibility for determining whether or not the Company has become insolvent.



     2.2  The Company  represents and  agrees that  the Trust established under

this Agreement does not fund and is not intended to fund the Plans or any other

employee benefit plan or program of the Company.  Such Trust is and is intended

to be  a depository  arrangement with the Trustee for the setting aside of cash

and other  assets of  the Company  as and  when it  so determines  in its  sole

discretion for  the meeting of part or all of its future benefit obligations to

some or  all of  the Participants  and their  Beneficiaries  under  the  Plans.

Contributions by the Company to the Trust shall be in amounts determined solely

by the Company and shall be in respect of only those Plan Participants selected

prior to a Change in Control by the Company from time to time as it determines.

The purpose  of this  Trust is  to provide  a fund  from which  benefits may be

payable under  the Plans  and as  to which Plan Participants with an Account or

Accounts hereunder  and their  Beneficiaries may,  by exercising the procedures

set forth  herein, have  access to some or all of their benefits as such become

due without  having the  payment of such benefits subject to the administrative

control of  the Company  unless the  Company becomes  insolvent as  defined  in

Section 2.1.   The  Company further  represents that  the  Plans  are  unfunded

deferred compensation  plans  for  a  select  group  of  management  or  highly

compensated employees  and as  such are  exempt from  the  application  of  the

Employee Retirement  Income Security  Act of  1974 ("ERISA") except for parts 1


<PAGE>9


and 5  of Title  I thereof.   The Company further represents that the Plans are

not qualified  under Section  401(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code

and therefore  are not  subject to  any of  the Code requirements applicable to

tax-qualified plans.



     2.3  Amounts paid  or delivered  by the Company to the Trustee pursuant to

Section 1.1. shall not revert to the Company except as provided below:



          (a)       Upon the  satisfaction of  all liabilities  of the  Company

under both  Plans in  respect of  Participants and  Beneficiaries for  whom  an

Account or  Accounts have  been  established,  any  assets  of  the  Fund  then

remaining may be distributed to the Company as per its instructions as provided

in Section 3.6 or



          (b)       Upon termination  of the  Trust as provided in Section 9.1,

the Fund may be distributed to the Company in accordance with Section 9.2; or



          (c)       Upon the  insolvency  of  the  Company  (as  determined  in

Section 2.1),  the assets  of the  Fund shall be distributed in accordance with

the provisions of Section 2.1; or



          (d)       Within six  (6) months after the payment or delivery by the

Company of  any amounts to the Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1, the Company may

request that  any portion  of such  amounts be returned to the Company (whether

affecting the  Accounts of all or any specified Participants or Beneficiaries).

Such a  request shall  be honored  by the  Trustee only  if at the date of such


<PAGE>10


request, the  Board of  Directors of  the Company  is made  up  of  "Continuing

Directors" (as  defined below).   Further,  within the  original six  (6) month

period during  which the  Continuing Directors  may request  a  return  to  the

Company of  amounts paid  or delivered  to the Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1,

the Continuing Directors may request a one time extension of such period for an

additional six months.



For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meaning indicated:



          (i)       "Acquiring  Person"   shall  mean   any  person  who  is  a

     Beneficial Owner  of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock

     or 20%  or more  of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock of the Company;

     provided, however,  that the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include the

     Company or  any wholly-owned  subsidiary of  the Company  or any  employee

     benefit plan  established by  any of them and either in effect on the date

     of this  Agreement or hereafter approved by the Continuing Directors.  For

     purposes of  this subsection  (i) in  determining the  percentage  of  the

     outstanding shares  of Common  Stock or  Voting Stock  of the Company with

     respect to  which a person is the Beneficial Owner, all shares as to which

     such person is deemed the Beneficial Owner shall be deemed outstanding.



          (ii)      "Affiliate"  and  "Associate"  shall  have  the  respective

     meanings ascribed  to such  terms  in  Rule  12b-2  under  the  Securities

     Exchange Act  of 1934,  as in  effect  on  the  date  of  this  Agreement;

     
<PAGE>11


     provided,  however,   that  the   Company  shall,  for  purposes  of  this

     definition, be deemed to be the "registrant", as such term is used in such

     Rule.



          (iii)     A person  shall be  deemed the  "Beneficial Owner",  and to

     have "Beneficial  Ownership", of any securities as to which such person or

     any of  such person's  Affiliates or  Associates is or may be deemed to be

     the beneficial  owner pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange

     Act of  1934, as  in effect  on the date of this Agreement, as well as any

     securities as  to which  such person or any of such person's Affiliates or

     Associates has the right to become Beneficial Owner (whether such right is

     exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any

     agreement,  arrangement   or  understanding,   or  upon  the  exercise  of

     conversion rights,  exchange  rights,  rights,  warrants  or  options,  or

     otherwise; provided,  however, that  a person  shall  not  be  deemed  the

     "Beneficial Owner", or to have "Beneficial Ownership", of any security (A)

     solely because  such security  has been  tendered pursuant  to a tender or

     exchange offer  made by  such person or any of such person's Affiliates or

     Associates until  such tendered  security  is  accepted  for  purchase  or

     exchange,  (B)  solely  because  such  person  or  any  of  such  person's

     Affiliates or  Associates has  or shares  the power  to vote or direct the

     voting of such security pursuant to a revocable proxy given in response to

     a public proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance

     with, the  applicable rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act

     of 1934,  except if  such power  (or the arrangements relating thereto) is

     then reportable under Item 6 of Schedule 13D under the Securities Exchange

     Act of 1934 (or any similar provision of a comparable or successor report)

     
<PAGE>12


     or (C)  held for  or pursuant to the terms of any employee stock ownership

     or other employee benefit plan of the Company or a wholly-owned subsidiary

     of the  Company and  either in  effect on  the date  of this  Agreement or

     hereafter approved by the Continuing Directors.



          (iv)      "Change in  Control" means  the occurrence  of either (1) a

     transaction which has required the affirmative vote of holders of at least

     80% of  the outstanding  shares of  capital stock of the Company regularly

     entitled to vote in the election of the directors of the Company by reason

     of Article Seven of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, or (2) the

     acquisition by any person, partnership, corporation or other organization,

     or by  any group  of two or more thereof who are affiliates (as defined by

     Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933) or who are acting in concert in

     respect of such acquisition of more than 25% of such outstanding shares of

     such capital stock, if the Company has opposed an acquisition of shares of

     the Company by such person, partnership, corporation or other organization

     or group  before any insurance regulatory authority whose approval of such

     acquisition was  required.   Provided, however, that an event described in

     (1) or  (2) above  shall not  constitute a  Change In Control if within 10

     days of  such event  the Continuing  Directors provide  the Trustee with a

     resolution expressly stating that such event shall not constitute a Change

     In Control for the purposes of this Agreement.
<PAGE>13




          (v)       "Continuing Directors"  shall mean  those  individuals  who

     constitute the  Board of  Directors of  the Company  on the  date of  this

     Agreement and any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date of

     this Agreement  whose election or nomination for election by the Company's

     shareholders is  approved by  a vote  of at least six Continuing Directors

     who constitute  not less  than three-quarters  of the directors comprising

     the then Continuing Directors, either by a specific vote or by approval of

     the proxy  statement of the Company in which such individual is named as a

     nominee for  director, without objection to such nomination, provided that

     no person  shall  under  any  circumstances  be  considered  a  Continuing

     Director from  and after  such time as such person is an Acquiring Person,

     an Affiliate  or Associate  of  an  Acquiring  Person,  or  a  nominee  or

     representative of  any thereof.  References to an approval or other act of

     Continuing Directors  shall mean  approvals given  or  actions  authorized

     and/or taken  both (A)  by the  Board of  Directors of the Company (or any

     legal successor  thereto) of  which  at  the  time  not  less  than  eight

     directors constituting  not  less  than  two-thirds  of  the  members  are

     Continuing Directors  and (B)  by not  less than  six Continuing Directors

     constituting at least three-fourths of all then Continuing Directors.



          (vi)      "Voting Stock"  shall mean  shares of  capital stock of the

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  ___________



     3.1  By its  acceptance of  this Trust  the Trustee  hereby agrees  to the

designation by  the Company  of KPMG  Peat Marwick as the Company's independent

contractor (the  "Independent Contractor")  under this  Agreement.    Provided,

however, that  the  Trustee  conditions  its  acceptance  of  such  Independent

Contractor  upon   the  Independent  Contractor's  execution  of  the  Form  of

Acknowledgment and Acceptance, or a similar form acceptable to both the Company

and the  Trustee, set  forth in  Exhibit A  of this  Agreement.   It is  herein

recognized that  said Independent  Contractor is also acting as the independent

consulting  actuary  of  the  Company  and  that  the  Trustee  shall  have  no

responsibility hereunder  for the  continued retention  of  KPMG  Peat  Marwick

and/or any  responsibility assigned  to  said  Independent  Contractor  or  its

performance thereof  so long  as  said  firm  continues  to  be  the  Company's

independent consulting actuary.  In the event the Company replaces or no longer

uses said  firm as  its independent consulting actuary, the Trustee in its sole

discretion may,  but need  not, designate a new Independent Contractor from the

list set  forth in  Exhibit B of this Agreement or may continue to use the same

Independent Contractor;  or  in  the  event  said  firm  does  not  accept  its

designation  as   Independent  Contractor   or  accepts  said  designation  and

subsequently resigns,  the Trustee shall designate another entity from the list

set forth  in Exhibit  B of  this Agreement  to be  the Independent Contractor,

provided however,  that any  Independent Contractor  appointed by  the  Trustee

shall be  independent of  the Company.   The Company shall pay or reimburse the

Trustee for  all fees  and expenses  of any Independent Contractor appointed by

the Trustee.  The Company shall indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless for any


<PAGE>15


actions or omissions of any Independent Contractor and shall indemnify and hold

the Independent  Contractor harmless  for  any  actions  or  omissions  of  the

Trustee.   The Independent  Contractor shall  be paid  for its  services on  an

hourly basis  at rates  comparable to the rates that the Independent Contractor

charges for comparable services to its other clients.



     3.2  Except  for  the  records  dealing  solely  with  the  Fund  and  its

investment,  which   shall  be  maintained  by  the  Trustee,  the  Independent

Contractor shall maintain all the Plan Participant records contemplated by this

Agreement, including  the maintenance  of the  separate Account  or Accounts of

each Participant  under this Agreement, the maintenance of the General Account,

and the  maintenance of  Participants' interest  under each  of the Plans.  All

such records  shall be made available promptly on request of the Trustee or the

Company.  In the event of a Change in Control, the Independent Contractor shall

also prepare  and distribute  Participants' statements and shall be responsible

for information  with respect  to payments,  if any,  to Participants and their

Beneficiaries and  shall perform  such other duties and responsibilities as the

Company or  the Trustee  determines is  necessary or  advisable to  achieve the

objectives of this Agreement.



     3.3  Upon the  establishment of  this  Trust  or  as  soon  thereafter  as

practicable, the Company shall furnish to the Independent Contractor and to the

Trustee all  of the  information necessary to determine the benefits payable to

or with  respect to  each Participant  in both  Plans, including  any  benefits

payable after  the Participant's  death and  the recipient of same (hereinafter

referred to  as the  "Participant Data").   Notwithstanding the occurrence of a


<PAGE>16


Change in  Control, the  Company shall  regularly, at  least annually,  furnish

revised updated  Participant Data  to the Independent Contractor.  Based on the

foregoing information  the  Independent  Contractor  shall  prepare  an  annual

estimate of  the accrued  benefit for  each Participant  and its  present value

under the  Retirement Plan and shall furnish a copy of same to the Company.  In

the event  the Company  refuses or  neglects  to  provide  updated  Participant

information, as  contemplated  herein,  the  Independent  Contractor  shall  be

entitled to  rely upon  the most  recent information  furnished to  it  by  the

Company.



     3.4  Prior to  a Change  in Control, upon the direction of the Company the

Independent   Contractor    shall   prepare   a   certification   (a   "Benefit

Certification") to  the Trustee  that a  Participant's benefits under either of

the Plans  have become  payable.   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this

Agreement, after  a  Change  in  Control  upon  the  proper  application  of  a

Participant or  the Beneficiary  of a  deceased  Participant,  the  Independent

Contractor shall,  without  direction  from  the  Company,  prepare  a  Benefit

Certification to  the Trustee,  based upon  the most  recent  Participant  Data

furnished to  the Independent Contractor prior to the Change in Control and any

supplemental  information   furnished  to   the  Independent  Contractor  by  a

Participant  or  a  Beneficiary  upon  which  the  Independent  Contractor  may

reasonably rely,  that a  Participant's benefits under either of the Plans have

become payable.   In  the event  that the  Trustee (a)  suspends the payment of

benefits from  the Fund  pursuant to  Section 2.1,  and (b) pursuant to a court

order as  required by  Section 2.1,  subsequently resumes all of its duties and

responsibilities under this Agreement, the Independent Contractor shall prepare

a certification  (an "Accrued Benefit Certification") of all amounts that would


<PAGE>17


otherwise have  been payable  to each  Participant or Beneficiary from the Fund

during such  period of  time as  the Trustee  suspended the payment of benefits

pursuant to  Section 2.1.   Each Benefit Certification and each Accrued Benefit

Certification shall  include the amount of such benefits, the manner of payment

and the  name, address  and social  security number  of the  recipient.    Each

Benefit Certification shall be updated annually.  The Trustee shall be entitled

to rely  on any  Benefit Certification  or any  Accrued  Benefit  Certification

provided by  the Independent  Contractor, and  shall have no duty to verify the

accuracy thereof.   Upon  the receipt  of a Benefit Certification or an Accrued

Benefit Certification  and appropriate federal, state and local tax withholding

information, the  Trustee shall commence cash distributions from the Trust Fund

in accordance  therewith to  the person  or persons  so indicated  and  to  the

Company with  respect to  taxes required  to be  withheld and  the  Independent

Contractor shall  charge the  Participant's Account established hereunder.  The

Independent Contractor  shall furnish  a copy of each Benefit Certification and

each Accrued Benefit Certification to the Participant (or to the Beneficiary of

a deceased  Participant) for  which such  certification has been prepared.  The

Company shall have full responsibility for the payment of all withholding taxes

to the  appropriate taxing  authority and  shall furnish  each  Participant  or

Beneficiary and the Independent Contractor with the appropriate tax information

form evidencing such payment and the amount thereof.



     3.5  Notwithstanding any  provision in  this Agreement to the contrary, in

the event  the Trustee  in its  sole discretion  reasonably disagrees  with the

accuracy or  propriety of  any Benefit  Certification or  any  Accrued  Benefit

Certification, the  Trustee, if  unable to  resolve such  disagreement with the


<PAGE>18


Independent Contractor,  may apply  to a  court of appropriate jurisdiction for

judicial review of such Benefit Certification or Accrued Benefit Certification.

Pending the resolution of any disagreement with the Independent Contractor with

regard to the accuracy or propriety of any Benefit Certification or any Accrued

Benefit Certification,  the Trustee  shall not  distribute any  amount from the

Fund pursuant  to such  Benefit Certification or Accrued Benefit Certification.

The Trustee  shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve any such

disagreement that it may have with the Independent Contractor.



     3.6  All  benefits   payable  from  the  Fund  to  a  Participant  or  his

Beneficiary under  the Retirement Plan shall be paid solely from the account of

such Participant  established under  such Retirement  Plan.   Benefits  payable

under the  Savings  Plan  shall  be  paid  solely  from  the  account  of  such

Participant established  under the  Savings Plan.  Upon the satisfaction of all

Company liabilities  under a Plan to a Participant and any Beneficiary for whom

an Account  has been  established hereunder,  the Independent  Contractor shall

prepare a  certification to the Trustee and to the Company showing the balance,

if any,  remaining in  such Participant's Account under the Plan.  Such balance

from an  account under  the Retirement  Plan shall  be  allocated  first  among

Participant Accounts  under the  Retirement Plan  and, if  the liability of the

Company to  all Participants  has been satisfied, the balance, if any, shall be

allocated  among   the  Accounts   of  Participants  under  the  Savings  Plan.

Similarly, any  balance from  an  Account  under  the  Savings  Plan  shall  be

allocated first  among Participant  Accounts under the Savings Plan and, if the

liability of  the Company  to all  Participants under the Savings Plan has been


<PAGE>19


satisfied, the  balance, if  any, shall  be allocated  among  the  Accounts  of

Participants  under  the  Retirement  Plan.    Such  balance,  whether  from  a

Retirement Plan  Account or  Savings Plan Account, shall be reallocated ratably

by the  Independent Contractor  (using the  information set  forth on  the most

recent estimated  benefits statement  prepared by  the  Independent  Contractor

pursuant to  Section 3.3)  to the  Accounts of  Participants and  Beneficiaries

being continued  under the  Plan (including  Accounts which may have previously

been reduced  to a  zero balance)  in the  ratio that liabilities in respect of

each such  Participant and  Beneficiary under  each  Plan  bear  to  the  total

liabilities to  all such  Participants and Beneficiaries under that Plan.  Upon

the satisfaction  of all  liabilities of the Company under both of the Plans to

all Participants  and Beneficiaries  for whom  Accounts have  been  established

hereunder, the  Independent Contractor  shall prepare  a certification  to  the

Trustee and  to the Company, and the Trustee upon receipt of such certification

shall transfer  all of  the assets of the Fund to the trust established between

the Company  and Trustee,  dated September  25, 1990,  with regard  to  certain

employment contracts to which the Company is a party and as amended with regard

to the Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Employment Contract Trust").  Provided,

however, that  if the  Employment Contract  Trust  has  been  terminated,  upon

receiving the  certification referred  to in the previous sentence, the Trustee

shall thereupon  hold or  distribute the  Fund in  accordance with  the written

instructions of  the Company.  The Trustee and the Independent Contractor shall

have no  responsibility for  determining whether any Participant or Beneficiary

has died  and shall  be entitled  to rely  upon information  furnished  by  the

Company.
<PAGE>20




     3.7  The Company  reserves the  right to transfer to the Fund paid-up life

insurance, retirement  income or  annuity policies  or contracts  on or for the

life of  any Participant  for whom  an Account or Accounts has been established

hereunder or,  prior to  a Change in Control, to direct the Trustee to purchase

any such  policies or  contracts on or for the life of any such Participant out

of the  amounts allocated to his Account.  Any such policy or contract shall be

an asset  of the  Fund subject  to the claims of the Company's creditors in the

event of  insolvency, as  specified in  Section 2.1.   The proceeds of any life

insurance policy shall upon the death of the insured Participant be credited to

his Account  or Accounts  under either  of the Plans and shall be an additional

source of benefits, if any, payable to his Beneficiary.



     3.8  Nothing provided  in this  Agreement shall relieve the Company of its

liabilities to  pay benefits provided under the Plans except to the extent such

liabilities are  met by  application of  Fund assets.   It is the intent of the

Company to  have each Account established hereunder treated as a separate trust

designed to  satisfy in  whole or  in part  the Company's legal liability under

either of  the Plans  in respect  of the  Participant for whom such Account has

been established.   The  Company, therefore, agrees that all income, deductions

and credits  of each such Account belong to it as owner for income tax purposes

and will be included on the Company's tax returns.

     4.1  The Company  shall provide the Trustee and the Independent Contractor

with a  certified copy  of the  Plans and  all amendments  thereto and  of  the

resolutions of  the Board  of Directors  of the Company approving the Plans and

all amendments  thereto, promptly  upon their adoption.  After the execution of

this Agreement,  the Company  shall promptly  file with  the  Trustee  and  the

Independent Contractor a certified list of the names and specimen signatures of

it.   The Company  shall  promptly  notify  the  Trustee  and  the  Independent

Contractor of  the addition  or deletion  of any  person's name to or from such

list, respectively.   Until  receipt by  the  Trustee  and/or  the  Independent

Contractor of  notice that  any person  is no  longer authorized so to act, the

Trustee or  the Independent Contractor may continue to rely on the authority of

the person.   All  certifications, notices and directions by any such person or

persons to the Trustee or the Independent Contractor shall be in writing signed

by such person or persons.  The Trustee and the Independent Contractor may rely

on any  such certification,  notice or direction purporting to have been signed

by or  on behalf  of such person or persons that the Trustee or the Independent

Contractor believes  to  have  been  signed  thereby.    The  Trustee  and  the

Independent Contractor  may also rely on any certification, notice or direction

of the  Company that the Trustee or the Independent Contractor believes to have

been signed  by a duly authorized officer or agent of the Company.  The Company

shall be responsible for keeping accurate books and records with respect to the

employees of  the Company,  their compensation  and their  rights and interests

under both of the Plans.

     4.2  The Company  shall make  its contributions to the Trust in accordance

with appropriate  corporate action and the Trustee shall have no responsibility

with respect thereto, except to add such contributions to the Fund.

other agents  retained by  it, incurred  by  the  Independent  Contractor  with

respect to keeping the records for Participants' Accounts, reporting thereon to

Participants, certifying  benefit information  to the  Trustee, determining the

status of  Accounts and  benefits hereunder  and  otherwise  carrying  out  its

obligations  under   this  Agreement,  other  than  those  resulting  from  the

Independent Contractor's negligence or willful misconduct.

debts or  damages due  or owing to or from the Trust, respectively, to commence

or defend  suits or legal proceedings to protect any interest of the Trust, and

to represent the Trust in all suits or legal proceedings in any court or before

any other  body or  tribunal; provided,  however, that the Trustee shall not be

required to  take any  such action unless it shall have been indemnified by the

Company to  its reasonable  satisfaction against liability or expenses it might

incur therefrom;



          (o)       To organize  under the  laws of  any state a corporation or

trust for  the purpose  of acquiring and holding title to any property which it

direction of  the Company  prior to  a Change in Control, invest all or part of

the amount  to the credit of any Participant's Account in a commercial annuity,


<PAGE>27


retirement income  or life insurance policy or contract selected by the Company

and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for any such investment other than

as owner and custodian thereof.



          Notwithstanding the foregoing, after a Change in Control, the Trustee

shall follow the investment guidelines agreed to by the Company and the Trustee

as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.



     5.3  No person  dealing with  the Trustee shall be under any obligation to

see to  the proper  application of  any money paid or property delivered to the

Trustee or  to inquire into the Trustee's authority as to any transaction.  The

Independent Contractor's obligations are limited solely to those explicitly set

forth herein  and the  Independent Contractor  shall  have  no  responsibility,

authority or control, direct or indirect, over the maintenance or investment of

the Fund  and shall  have no  obligation in  respect  of  the  Trustee  or  the

Trustee's compliance  with the  Independent Contractor's  certifications to the

Trustee.



     5.4  The Trustee  shall distribute  cash or  property  from  the  Fund  in

accordance with Article III hereof.



          The Trustee  may make  any distribution required hereunder by mailing

its check  for the  specified amount,  or delivering the specified property, to

the person  to whom such distribution or payment is to be made, at such address

as may  have been  last furnished  to the  Trustee, or if no such address shall

     6.1  The Company  shall pay any Federal, state or local taxes on the Fund,

or any part thereof, and on the income therefrom.



     6.2  The Company  shall pay to the Trustee its reasonable expenses for the

management  and  administration  of  the  Fund,  including  without  limitation

advances for or prompt reimbursement of reasonable expenses and compensation of

counsel and  other agents  employed by  the Trustee,  all other  reasonable and

necessary expenses of managing and administering the Trust that are not paid by

the Company including, but not limited to, investment management fees, computer

time charges,  data retrieval and input costs, and charges for time expended by

personnel of the Trustee in fulfilling the Trustee's duties.  The Company shall

also pay  to the  Trustee reasonable  compensation for  its services as Trustee

hereunder, the  amount of  which shall  be agreed upon from time to time by the

Company and  the Trustee  in writing;  provided, however,  that if  the Trustee

forwards an  amended  compensation  schedule  to  the  Company  requesting  its

agreement thereto  and the  Company fails  to object thereto within thirty (30)

days of  its receipt,  the amended  compensation schedule shall be deemed to be


<PAGE>29


agreed upon  by the  Company and  the Trustee.   Such expenses and compensation

shall be  a charge  on the  Fund and  shall constitute  a lien  in favor of the

Trustee until  paid by the Company.  All such expenses and compensation charged

to the Fund, unless otherwise paid by the Company, shall be applied against the

General Account.  In the event that the assets allocated to the General Account

are entirely  depleted, all  such expenses and compensation charged to the Fund

shall be  applied pro-rata  against all  Accounts in  proportion to  the assets

allocated thereto.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.2, to

the extent  that the  Trustee, in  its discretion,  decides that  an expense is

specifically attributable  to one or more specified Accounts such expense shall

be charged  to such  specified Accounts  in  such  proportion  as  the  Trustee

decides.  Prior to allocating any particular expense to a specific Account, the

Trustee shall  provide notice  of its  intention to so allocate to the Company,

the Independent  Contractor and  the Participant  for  whom  such  Account  was

established.

all its  receipts and disbursements hereunder.  The records of the Trustee with

respect to  the Fund  shall be  open to  inspection  by  the  Company,  or  its

representatives, at  all reasonable  times during  normal business hours of the

Trustee and may be audited not more frequently than once each fiscal year by an

independent certified  public accountant  engaged  by  the  Company;  provided,

however, the  Trustee shall  be entitled  to additional  compensation from  the

Company in respect of audits or auditors' requests which the Trustee determines

to exceed  the ordinary  course of  the usual scope of such examinations of its

records.



     7.2  Within a  reasonable time  after the close of each fiscal year of the

Company (or,  in the  Trustee's discretion,  at more frequent intervals), or of

any termination  of the  duties of  the Trustee  hereunder, the  Trustee  shall

prepare and  deliver to  the Company a statement of transactions reflecting its

acts and  transactions as  Trustee during  such fiscal year, portion thereof or

during such  period from  the close  of the  last fiscal year or last statement

period to  the termination  of the  Trustee's duties, respectively, including a

statement of  the then  current value  of the Fund.  The Independent Contractor

shall also  prepare and  furnish to the Company a statement of the then current

value of  each Account and of the General Account.  Any such statement shall be

deemed an  account stated  and accepted  and approved  by the  Company, and the

Trustee shall  be relieved  and discharged, as if such account had been settled

and allowed  by a  judgment or  decree of  a court  of competent  jurisdiction,

unless protested  by written  notice to  the Trustee  within sixty (60) days of

receipt thereof by the Company.



     The Trustee  shall have  the right  to apply  at any  time to  a court  of

competent jurisdiction  for judicial  settlement of  any account of the Trustee

not previously  settled as  herein provided  or for  the determination  of  any

question of  construction or for instructions regarding this Agreement.  In any

such action  or proceeding  it shall  be necessary  to join as parties only the

Trustee and  the Company (although the Trustee may also join such other parties

as it  may deem  appropriate), and any judgment or decree entered therein shall

be conclusive.

     8.1  Prior to  a Change  in Control  the Trustee may resign at any time by

delivering written  notice thereof  to the  Company; provided, however, that no

such resignation  shall take  effect until  the earlier  of (i) sixty (60) days

from the date of delivery of such notice to the Company or (ii) the appointment

of a  successor trustee.  Following a Change in Control, the Trustee may resign

only under one of the following circumstances:



          (a)       The Trustee is no longer in the business, or is actively in

     the process of removing itself from the business, of acting as trustee for

     employee benefit plans.

          (b)       The Trustee  determines that  a conflict of interest exists

     which would prohibit it from fulfilling its duties under this Agreement in

     an ethically  proper manner, and a law firm (appointed by the President of

     the Association  of the  Bar of  the City  of New York, or by the American

     Arbitration Association, if the President of the Association of the Bar of

     the City  of New  York fails to so appoint within thirty days of a request

     for such  appointment, or  notifies the  Trustee that it is unable to make

     such appointment)  concurs with  the Trustee.   The  Trustee shall use its

     best efforts  to avoid  the creation  of such a conflict.  The decision of

     
<PAGE>32


     such law  firm shall  be binding,  but may be appealed in the same manner,

     and under  the same  conditions, as if it were made by an arbitrator.  All

     costs incurred  by the  Trustee in  connection with obtaining or appealing

     such a  decision shall  be reimbursable  expenses pursuant  to Article  VI

     hereof.

          (c)       The  assets   of  the  Fund  have  been  exhausted  or  are

     insufficient to  pay accrued  and reasonably anticipated fees and expenses

     of the  Trustee hereunder,  the Company has refused voluntarily to pay the

     Trustee's accrued  fees and  expenses as  required pursuant to Section 6.2

     and the Trustee has been unsuccessful in obtaining a court order requiring

     the Company  to make  such payments  or has  been unable  to collect  on a

     judgment for such fees and expenses.

     Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may resign for reasons set forth in

(a) or  (b) only  if it  has obtained  the agreement  of a  bank with assets in

excess of  $2 billion  and net worth in excess of $100 million to replace it as

trustee under  the terms  of this Agreement.  The decisions rendered under (b),

if that  is the  reason for the Trustee's resignation, may expressly excuse the

Trustee from  this requirement.  In any event, the Trustee shall continue to be

custodian of  the Trust  assets until  the new  trustee is  in place,  and  the

Trustee shall  be entitled  to expenses  and fees  through  the  later  of  the

effective date  of its  resignation as Trustee and the end of its custodianship

of the assets of the Fund.



     8.2  Prior to  a Change  in Control the Trustee may be removed at any time

by the  Company, pursuant  to a  resolution of  the Board  of Directors  of the

Company, upon  delivery to  the Trustee  of a certified copy of such resolution

and sixty  (60) days' written notice of such removal, unless such notice period


<PAGE>33


is waived  in whole  or in  part by the Trustee.  Following a Change in Control

the Trustee may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

the Participants  voting on  a per capita basis who were Participants in either

of the  Plans on the date of the occurrence of the Change in Control, and sixty

(60) days'  written notice of such removal, unless such notice period is waived

in whole or in part by the Trustee.



     8.3  Upon the  resignation or  removal of  the Trustee, U.S. Trust Company

shall be  appointed as successor trustee.  In the event that U.S. Trust Company

refuses to accept its appointment as successor trustee pursuant to this Section

8.3, Chase  Manhattan Bank,  N.A. shall  be appointed as successor trustee.  In

the event  that Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. refuses to accept its appointment as

successor trustee  pursuant to  this Section  8.3, a successor trustee shall be

appointed pursuant  to Section  8.4.   The appointment  of a  successor trustee

pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall take effect upon the delivery to the Trustee

of a  written acceptance by such successor trustee, duly executed thereby.  Any

successor trustee  shall have  all the  rights, powers  and duties  granted the

Trustee hereunder.



     8.4  Subject to  the provisions  of Section  8.3, prior  to  a  Change  in

Control, upon  the resignation  or removal  of the Trustee, a successor trustee

shall be  appointed by  the Company.  Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3,

following a Change in Control, upon the resignation of the Trustee, a successor

trustee shall  be appointed by the Trustee, and upon the removal of the Trustee


<PAGE>34


a successor trustee shall be appointed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

the Participants  voting on  a per capita basis who were Participants in either

of the  Plans on  the date  of the  occurrence of  the Change  in Control.  Any

successor trustee  appointed under  this Section  8.4 shall  be chosen from the

list of potential successor trustees set forth in Exhibit C.  In the event that

all of the potential successor trustees set forth in Exhibit C refuse to accept

an appointment  as successor  trustee, then  the  successor  trustee  shall  be

appointed as  otherwise provided  in this  Section 8.4,  and shall be a bank or

trust company established under the laws of the United States or a State within

the United  States with  assets in excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess

of $100  million.   The appointment  of a  successor trustee  pursuant to  this

Section 8.4 shall take effect upon the delivery to the Trustee of (a) a written

appointment of  such successor  trustee, duly  executed  by  the  Company,  the

Trustee, or  two-thirds of  the Participants  in the  Plans, as provided for in

this Section  8.4, and (b) a written acceptance by such successor trustee, duly

executed thereby.   Any successor trustee shall have all the rights, powers and

duties granted the Trustee hereunder.



     8.5  If, within  sixty (60)  days of the delivery of the Trustee's written

notice of  resignation, a  successor trustee shall not have been appointed, the

Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of

a successor trustee.



     8.6  Upon the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the appointment of

a successor  trustee, and after the acceptance and approval of its account, the

Trustee shall  transfer and  deliver the  Fund to  such successor.    Under  no

circumstances shall  the Trustee  transfer or deliver the Fund to any successor

which is  not a  bank or trust company established under the laws of the United

States or  a State within the United States with assets in excess of $2 billion

and net worth in excess of $100 million.

     9.1  Prior to  a Change in Control, the Trust established pursuant to this

Agreement may  only be  terminated by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the

Participants in  either of the Plans voting on a per capita basis.  Following a

Change in  Control, the Trust established pursuant to this Agreement may not be

terminated by  the Company  prior to  the satisfaction  of all liabilities with

respect to  all Participants  in both  of the  Plans and  their  Beneficiaries.

Following a Change in Control, upon receipt of a written certification from the

Independent Contractor that all liabilities have been satisfied with respect to

all Participants  in the Plans and their Beneficiaries, the Company pursuant to

a resolution of its Board of Directors may terminate the Trust upon delivery to

the Trustee  of (a)  a certified  copy of  such  resolution,  (b)  an  original

certification of the Independent Contractor that all such liabilities have been

satisfied and  (c) a  written  instrument  of  termination  duly  executed  and

acknowledged in the same form as this Agreement.



     9.2  Prior to  a Change  in Control,  upon the termination of the Trust in

accordance with  Section 9.1,  the Trustee  shall,  after  the  acceptance  and

approval of its account, distribute the Fund to the Company.  After a Change in

Control, upon  the termination of the Trust in accordance with Section 9.1, the

Trustee shall,  after the  acceptance and approval of its account, transfer all

of the assets of the Fund to the Employment Contract Trust.  Provided, however,

that if  after a  Change in  Control the  Employment Contract  Trust  has  been

terminated, upon  the termination  of the  Trust in accordance with Section 9.1

the Trustee  shall distribute  the Fund  to the  Company.  Upon completing such

distribution, the  Trustee shall be relieved and discharged.  The powers of the

Trustee shall  continue as  long as  any  part  of  the  Fund  remains  in  its

possession.

Directors thereof  by delivery  to the  Trustee of  a certified  copy  of  such

resolution and  a written instrument duly executed and acknowledged in the same

form as  this Agreement,  except that  the duties  and responsibilities  of the

Trustee shall not be increased without the Trustee's written consent; provided,

copy of  such amendment has been delivered by registered mail by the Company or

the Independent  Contractor to  each Participant  (or to the Beneficiary of any

deceased Participant)  for whom  an Account is maintained under this Agreement.

In the  event the  Company, Trustee  or Independent Contractor receives written

Trust hereby  created shall  be governed  by, the laws of the State of New York

insofar as  such laws  do not  contravene any applicable Federal laws, rules or

regulations.   Nothing in  this Agreement  shall be construed to subject either

the Trust  created hereunder  or the  Plans to  the Employee  Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974, as amended.

     11.3 No right  or interest of any Participant under either of the Plans in

the Fund shall be transferable or assignable or shall be subject to alienation,

anticipation or  encumbrance, and  no right  or interest  of any Participant or

Beneficiary in  the Plan  or in  the Fund  shall be subject to any garnishment,

attachment or  execution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund shall at all

times remain  subject to  claims of  creditors of  the Company in the event the

Company becomes insolvent as provided in Section 2.1.



     11.4 The Company  agrees that by the establishment of this Trust it hereby

foregoes any judicial review of certifications by the Independent Contractor as

to the benefit payable to any persons hereunder.  If a dispute arises as to the

amounts or  timing of  any such  benefits or the persons entitled thereto under

the Plans  or this  Agreement, the  Company agrees  that such  dispute shall be

resolved by  binding arbitration  proceedings initiated  in accordance with the

rules of  the American  Arbitration Association  and that  the results  of such

proceedings shall  be conclusive  and shall  not be subject to judicial review.

It is  expressly understood  that pending  the resolution  of any  such dispute

payment of  benefits shall  be made  and continued by the Trustee in accordance

with the  certification of  the Independent Contractor and that the Trustee and

the Independent  Contractor shall  have  no  liability  with  respect  to  such

payments.   Provided, however,  that the  provisions of  this Section  11.4 are

subject to  the provisions  of Section 3.5.  The Company also agrees to pay the

entire cost  of any  arbitration or  legal proceeding initiated by it including

the legal  fees of  the  Trustee,  the  Independent  Contractor  and  the  Plan

Participant or  the Beneficiary  of any deceased Plan Participant regardless of

the outcome of any such proceeding and until so paid the expenses thereof shall

be a charge on and lien against the Fund.



     11.5 This Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any

successor  to   the  Company   or  its   business  as  the  result  of  merger,

consolidation,  reorganization,   transfer  of  assets  or  otherwise  and  any

subsequent successor  thereto.  In the event of any such merger, consolidation,

reorganization, transfer  of assets or other similar transaction, the successor

to the  Company or  its business  or any  subsequent  successor  thereto  shall

promptly notify  the Trustee  in writing  of its  successorship and furnish the

Trustee and  the Independent  Contractor  with  the  information  specified  in

Section 4.1  of this  Agreement.   In  no  event  shall  any  such  transaction

described herein  suspend or  delay the  rights of  Plan  Participants  or  the

Beneficiaries of deceased participants to receive benefits hereunder.
<PAGE>39


     11.6 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of

which shall  be deemed  to be  an original,  but all  of which  shall  together

constitute only one Agreement.



     11.7 Communications to  the Trustee  shall be  sent to it at its office at

450 West 33rd Street, New York, New York 10001, or to such other address as the

Trustee may  specify in  writing.   No communication  shall be binding upon the

Trustee until  it is  received by  the Trustee.   Communications to the Company

shall be  sent to  the Company's  principal offices or to such other address as

the Company may specify in writing.



     11.8 In the  event any  Participant or his Beneficiary is determined to be

subject to  Federal income tax on any amount to the credit of any Account under

this Agreement  prior to  the time  of payment  hereunder,  the  entire  amount

determined to  be so  taxable shall  be distributed  by  the  Trustee  to  such

Participant or Beneficiary.  An amount to the credit of a Participant's Account

or Accounts  shall be  determined to  be subject to Federal income tax upon the

earliest of:  (a) a  final determination  by the United States Internal Revenue

Service addressed  to the  Participant or his Beneficiary which is not appealed

to the  courts; (b) a final determination by the United States Tax Court or any

other Federal  Court affirming  any such  determination by the Internal Revenue

Service; or  (c) an  opinion by  counsel chosen by the Company addressed to the

Company and the Trustee, that, by reason of Treasury Regulations, amendments to

the Internal  Revenue Code,  published Internal  Revenue Service rulings, court


<PAGE>40


decisions  or   other  substantial   precedent,  amounts   to  the   credit  of

Participant's Accounts  hereunder are  subject to  Federal income  tax prior to

payment.   The Company  shall undertake to defend, and bear the expense of, any

tax claims  described herein which are asserted by the Internal Revenue Service

or by  the taxing authorities of any State or locality against any Participant,

his or  her spouse  or Beneficiary,  including the expense of attorney fees and

costs of  appeal, and shall have the sole authority to determine whether or not

to appeal  any determination  made by  the Internal  Revenue Service  or by any

taxing authority  of any State or locality or by any court.  The Company agrees

to reimburse any Participant, his or her spouse or Beneficiary for any interest

or penalties  in respect  of Federal,  state or local tax claims hereunder upon

receipt of  documentation of  same.  Any distributions from the Trust Fund to a

Participant or  Beneficiary under  this Section  11.8 shall  be applied  in  an

equitable manner  to reduce  Company liabilities  to  such  Participant  and/or

Beneficiary under  the Plans;  provided, however,  that in  no event  shall any

Participant, Beneficiary  or estate  of any Participant or Beneficiary have any

obligation to  return all  or any  part of  such distribution to the Company if

such distribution exceeds benefits payable under the Plans.

     Amendment, effective January 23, 1996, to Trust Agreement dated March 1,

Independent Contractor) establishing a trust to fund the USLIFE Corporation

     In accordance with the provisions contained in Section 10.1 of the
Agreement, the language in Section 2.3(d) (iv) is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following language:

     "Change In Control" means (i) a merger or consolidation to which the
     Company is a party and for which the approval of any shareholders of the
     Company is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
     13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
     becoming the beneficial owner, directly, or indirectly, of securities of
     the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
     Company's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
     substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a liquidation or
     reorganization of the Company; or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over
     Transaction or Event, as defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and
     Restated Rights Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the
     occurrence of any such transaction or event that otherwise would have
     previously been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.  Provided,
     however, that an event described above shall not constitute a Change In
     Control if within 10 days of such event the Continuing Directors provide
     the Trustee with a resolution expressly stating that such event shall not
     constitute a Change In Control for the purpose of the Agreement.

     THIS AGREEMENT, made as of the 1st day of March, 1994 among USLIFE

Corporation, a New York corporation (the "Company"), Chemical Bank, a New York

corporation (the "Trustee") and KPMG Peat Marwick ("Independent Contractor").

                             W I T N E S S E T H:
                             _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

     WHEREAS, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur certain

unfunded retirement and deferred income liability to or with respect to the

outside directors of the Company's Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of

the USLIFE Corporation Retirement Plan for Outside Directors ("Retirement

Plan") and the USLIFE Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan ("Compensation

Plan");

     WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide additional assurance to some or

all such outside directors (the "Participants") that their unfunded retirement

and deferred compensation benefits under the Retirement Plan and Compensation

Plan, respectively (hereinafter referred to as the "Plans") will in the future

be met or substantially met by application of the procedures set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, the Company wishes to establish separate accounts (hereinafter

the "Accounts") with respect to some or all of the Participants in the Plans as

determined by the Company prior to a Change In Control (as hereinafter defined

in Section 2.3(d) (iv)) in order to provide a source of payments as such may be

required under the terms of such Plans;

     WHEREAS, except as may be expressly provided in this Agreement, amounts

allocated to each separate Account or Accounts, as determined by the Company

from time to time in its sole discretion, and the earnings attributed thereto


<PAGE>2


shall be used by the Trustee solely in satisfaction of the liabilities of the

Company with respect to the Participant in the Retirement Plan or Compensation

Plan for whom such separate Account or Accounts has been established and the

expenses of administering the trust, established herein, and such utilization

shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, the Company wishes to establish a separate account with respect

to all amounts that are contributed hereunder by the Company which are not

allocated by the Company at the time of such contribution to the Account or

Accounts of an individual Participant in the Plans (the "General Account");

     WHEREAS, the Trust is intended to be a "grantor trust" with the corpus and

income of the Trust treated as assets and income of the Company for federal

income tax purposes pursuant to Sections 671 through 678 of the Internal

Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"); as amended;

     WHEREAS, the Company intends that the assets of the Trust will be subject

to the claims of creditors of the Company as provided in Article II;

     WHEREAS, the Company intends that the existence of the Trust will not

alter the characterization of the Plans as "unfunded" and will not be construed

to provide taxable income to any participant under the Plans prior to actual

payment of benefits thereunder;

     WHEREAS, the Trustee is not a party to the Plans and makes no

representations with respect thereto, and all representations and recitals with

respect to the Plans shall be deemed to be those of the Company.
<PAGE>3


     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual and

independent promises herein, the parties hereto convenant and agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   _________

     1.1  The Company hereby establishes with the Trustee a trust consisting of

          such sums of money and such property acceptable to the Trustee as

          shall from time to time be paid or delivered to the Trustee and the

          earnings and profits thereon.  All such money and property, all

          investments made therewith and proceeds thereof, less the payments or

          other distributions which, at the time of reference, shall have been

          made by the Trustee, as authorized herein, are referred to herein as

          the "Fund" and shall be held by the Trustee, IN TRUST, in accordance

          with the provisions of this Agreement.

     

     1.2  The Trustee shall hold, manage, invest and otherwise administer the

          Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall be

          responsible only for contributions actually received by it hereunder.

          The amount of each contribution by the Company to the Fund shall be

          determined in the sole discretion of the Company and the Trustee

          shall have no duty or responsibility with respect thereto.

     

     1.3  The Independent Contractor (as hereinafter in Section 3.1 defined)

          shall maintain in an equitable manner a separate Account or Accounts

          
<PAGE>4


          for each Participant under the Plans in which it shall keep a

          separate record of the amount of the fund allocated to such

          Participant.  The Company shall certify to the Trustee and the

          Independent Contractor at the time of each contribution to the Fund

          the amount of such contribution to be allocated to each Account.

          Provided, however, that following a Change In Control, the Company

          may only allocate contributions to either the General Account or to

          Accounts which were established prior to the Change In Control.  Any

          amount contributed by the Company that is not so certified shall be

          allocated to the General Account.

     

     1.4  The Company may contribute to the Fund an irrevocable letter of

          credit (hereinafter referred to as a "L/C").  The following

          provisions shall be applicable to any such L/C:

          (a)  the L/C shall expire no sooner than one (1) year from the date

               of issuance,

          (b) the Company shall continue to maintain such L/C in effect until

              it is replaced by cash or another irrevocable L/C or this

              Agreement terminates pursuant to Article IX, whichever occurs

              first,

          (c)  the Company shall renew or replace such L/C at least thirty (30)

               days before its expiration for an additional period of one (1)

               year,

          (d)  if such L/C, or any renewal thereof, is not renewed or replaced

          by a L/C delivered to the Trustee at least thirty (30) days before

          
<PAGE>5


          the expiration of the predecessor L/C, the Trustee may draw down the

          full amount of such L/C and hold the proceeds pursuant to the terms

          of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event the Company

          is unable to renew such L/C at least thirty (30) days prior to the

          expiration of the predecessor L/C at a cost equal to or less than

          twenty-five (25) basis points over the current annual cost of such

          L/C, and the Trustee with reasonable diligence is unable to identify

          a bank (within the definition of Section 1.4(h)) that will replace

          such L/C at a cost equal to or less than twenty-five (25) basis

          points over the current annual cost of such L/C, then the Trustee

          shall not draw down the amount of such L/C as provided in this

          Section 1.4(d),

          (e)  the Trustee may also draw down on such L/C at any time the

               Trustee determines the proceeds of such L/C are necessary to

               allow the Trustee to fulfill its obligations under this

               Agreement,

          (f)  the proceeds of such L/C shall be available to the Trustee upon

               the Trustee's presentation of its sight draft,

          (g)  the Company may, at any time, replace such L/C with another

               irrevocable L/C having substantially similar terms, or with an

               equal amount of cash, or any combination thereof,

          (h)  any L/C shall be issued by a bank (including the Trustee) with

               assets in excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100

               million, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, and

               shall be in a form as shall be reasonably acceptable to the

               Trustee.

          
<PAGE>6


     1.5  The Trustee, for investment purposes only, may commingle all of the

          assets of the Fund and treat them as a single fund, but the records

          of the Independent Contractor at all times shall show the percentages

          of the Trust allocable to each Account and to the General Account.

          The Fund shall be revalued by the Trustee as of the last business day

          of each calendar quarter at current market values, as determined by

          the Trustee.  The Independent Contractor shall allocate any increase

          or decrease in the current market value of the Fund, as determined by

          the Trustee, pro-rata to all of the Accounts and to the General

          Account in proportion to the balance of the assets allocated thereto

          as of the last business day of the previous calendar quarter.

                                  ARTICLE II
                                  __________

     2.1  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if

          at any time while the Trust is still in existence the Company becomes

          insolvent (as defined herein), the Trustee shall upon written notice

          thereof from the Company's Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board

          or Chief Executive Officer suspend the payment of all benefits from

          the Fund and shall thereafter hold the Fund in suspense for the

          benefit of the creditors of the Company until it receives a court

          order directing the disposition of the Fund; provided, however, the

          Trustee may deduct or continue to deduct its fees and expenses and

          other expenses of the Trust, including taxes and the Independent

          
<PAGE>7


          Contractor's fees and expenses, pending the receipt of such court

          order.  The Company shall be considered to be insolvent if (a) a

          final judicial determination is entered that the Company is unable to

          pay its debts as such debts mature or (b) there shall have been filed

          by or against the Company in any court or other tribunal either of

          the United States or of any State or of any other authority now or

          hereafter exercising jurisdiction, a petition in bankruptcy or

          insolvency proceedings or for reorganization or for the appointment

          of a receiver or trustee of all or substantially all of the Company's

          property under the present or any future Federal bankruptcy code or

          any other present or future applicable Federal, State or other

          bankruptcy or insolvency statute or law.  By its approval and

          execution of this Agreement, the Company represents and agrees that

          its Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive

          Officer, as from time to time acting, shall have the fiduciary duty

          and responsibility on behalf of the Company's creditors to give to

          the Trustee prompt written notice of any event of the Company's

          insolvency and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely thereon to the

          exclusion of all directions or claims to pay benefits thereafter

          made.  Absent such notice, the Trustee shall have no responsibility

          for determining whether or not the Company has become insolvent.

     2.2  The Company represents and agrees that the Trust established under

          this Agreement does not fund and is not intended to fund the Plans or

          any other employee benefit plan or program of the Company.  Such

          Trust is and is intended to be a depository arrangement with the

          Trustee for the setting aside of cash and other assets of the Company

          as and when it so determines in its sole discretion for the meeting

          of part or all of its future benefit obligations to some or all of

          the Participants under the Plans.  Contributions by the Company to

          the Trust shall be in amounts determined solely by the Company and

          shall be in respect of only those Plan Participants selected prior to

          a Change In Control by the Company from time to time as it

          determines.  The purpose of this Trust is to provide a fund from

          which benefits may be payable under the Plans and as to which Plan

          Participants with an Account or Accounts hereunder may, by exercising

          the procedures set forth herein, have access to some or all of their

          benefits as such become due without having the payment of such

          benefits subject to the administrative control of the Company unless

          the Company becomes insolvent as defined in Section 2.1.  The Company

          further represents that the Plans are not qualified under Section

          401(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code and therefore are

          not subject to any of the Code requirements applicable to tax-

          qualified plans.

     2.3  Amounts paid or delivered by the Company to the Trustee pursuant to

          Section 1.1 shall not revert to the Company except as provided below:
<PAGE>9


          (a)  Upon the satisfaction of all liabilities of the Company under

               both Plans in respect of Participants for whom an Account or

               Accounts have been established, any assets of the Fund then

               remaining may be distributed to the Company as per its

               instructions as provided in Section 3.6 or

          (b)  Upon termination of the Trust as provided in Section 9.1, the

               Fund may be distributed to the Company in accordance with

               Section 9.2; or

          (c)  Upon the insolvency of the Company (as determined in Section

               2.1), the assets of the Fund shall be distributed in accordance

               with the provisions of Section 2.1; or

          (d)  Within six (6) months after the payment or delivery by the

               Company of any amounts to the Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1,

               the Company may request that any portion of such amounts be

               returned to the Company (whether affecting the Accounts of all

               or any specified Participants).  Such a request shall be honored

               by the Trustee only if at the date of such request, the Board of

               Directors of the Company is made up of "Continuing Directors"

               (as defined below).  Further, within the original six (6) month

               period during which the Continuing Directors may request a

               return to the Company of amounts paid or delivered to the

               
<PAGE>10


               Trustee pursuant to Section 1.1, the Continuing Directors may

               request a one time extension of such period for an additional

               six months.

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meaning indicated:

               (i)       "Acquiring Person" shall mean any person who is a

                         Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the outstanding

                         outstanding shares of Voting Stock of the Company;

                         provided, however, that the term "Acquiring Person"

                         shall not include the Company or any wholly-owned

                         subsidiary of the Company or any employee benefit plan

                         established by any of them and either in effect on the

                         date of this Agreement or hereafter approved by the

                         Continuing Directors.  For purposes of this subsection

                         (i) in determining the percentage of the outstanding

                         shares of Common Stock or Voting Stock of the Company

                         with respect to which a person is the Beneficial

                         Owner, all shares as to which such person is deemed

                         the Beneficial Owner shall be deemed outstanding.

               (ii)      "Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective

                         meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 under

                         the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on

                         the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that

                         
<PAGE>11


                         the Company shall, for purposes of this definition, be

                         deemed to be the "registrant", as such term is used in

                         such Rule.

               (iii)     A person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner", and

                         to have "Beneficial Ownership", of any securities as

                         to which such person or any of such person's

                         Affiliates or Associates is or may be deemed to be the

                         beneficial owner pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the

                         Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the

                         date of this Agreement, as well as any securities as

                         to which such person or any of such person's

                         Affiliates or Associates has the right to become

                         Beneficial Owner (whether such right is exercisable

                         immediately or only after the passage of time)

                         pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or

                         understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion

                         rights, exchange rights, rights, warrants or options,

                         or otherwise; provided, however, that a person shall

                         not be deemed the "Beneficial Owner", or to have

                         "Beneficial Ownership", of any security (A) solely

                         because such security has been tendered pursuant to a

                         tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of

                         such person's Affiliates or Associates until such

                         tendered security is accepted for purchase or

                         exchange, (B) solely because such person or any of

                         such person's Affiliates or Associates has or shares

                         the power to vote or direct the voting of such

                         security pursuant to a revocable proxy given in

                         response to a public proxy or consent solicitation

                         
<PAGE>12


                         made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the

                         applicable rules and regulations of the Securities

                         Exchange Act of 1934, except if such power (or the

                         arrangements relating thereto) is then reportable

                         under Item 6 of Schedule 13D under the Securities

                         Exchange Act of 1934 (or any similar provision of a

                         comparable or successor report) or (C) held for or

                         pursuant to the terms of any employee stock ownership

                         or other employee benefit plan of the Company or a

                         wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and either in

                         effect on the date of this Agreement or hereafter

                         approved by the Continuing Directors.

               (iv)      "Change In Control" means the occurrence of either (1)

                         a transaction which has required the affirmative vote

                         of holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares

                         of capital stock of the Company regularly entitled to

                         vote in the election of the directors of the Company

                         by reason of Article Seven of the Company's

                         Certificate of Incorporation, or (2) the acquisition

                         by any person, partnership, corporation or other

                         organization, or by any group of two or more thereof

                         who are affiliates (as defined by Rule 405 under the

                         in respect of such acquisition of more than 25% of

                         such outstanding shares of such capital stock, if the

                         Company has opposed an acquisition of shares of the

                         Company by such person, partnership, corporation or

                         
<PAGE>13


                         other organization or group before any insurance

                         regulartory authority whose approval of such

                         acquisition was required.  Provided, however, that an

                         event described in (1) or (2) above shall not

                         constitute a Change In Control if within 10 days of

                         such event the Continuing Directors provide the

                         Trustee with a resolution expressly stating that such

                         event shall not constitute a Change In Control for the

                         purposes of this Agreement.

                         who constitute the Board of Directors of the Company

                         on the date of this Agreement and any individual

                         becoming a director subsequent to the date of this

                         Agreement whose election or nomination for election by

                         the Company's shareholders is approved by a vote of at

                         least six Continuing Directors who constitute not less

                         than three-quarters of the directors comprising the

                         then Continuing Directors, either by a specific vote

                         or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company

                         director, without objection to such nomination,

                         provided that no person shall under any circumstances

                         be considered a Continuing Director from and after

                         such time as such person is an Acquiring Person, an

                         to an approval or other act of Continuing Directors

                         shall mean approvals given or actions authorized

                         
<PAGE>14


                         and/or taken both (A) by the Board of Directors of the

                         Company (or any legal successor thereto) of which at

                         the time not less than eight directors constituting

                         not less than two-thirds of the members are Continuing

                         Directors and (B) by not less than six Continuing

                         Directors constituting at least three-fourths of all

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  ___________

     3.1  By its acceptance of this Trust the Trustee hereby agrees to the

          designation by the Company of KPMG Peat Marwick as the Company's

          independent contractor (the "Independent Contractor") under this

          Agreement.  Provided, however, that the Trustee conditions its

          acceptance of such Independent Contractor upon the Independent

          Contractor's execution of the Form of Acknowledgment and Acceptance,

          or a similar form acceptable to both the Company and the Trustee, set

          forth in Exhibit A of this Agreement.  It is herein recognized that

          said Independent Contractor is also acting as the independent

          consulting actuary of the Company and that the Trustee shall have no

          responsibility hereunder for the continued retention of KPMG Peat

          Marwick and/or any responsibility assigned to said Independent

          Contractor or its performance thereof so long as said firm continues

          
<PAGE>15


          to be the Company's independent consulting actuary.  In the event the

          Company replaces or no longer uses said firm as its independent

          consulting actuary, the Trustee in its sole discretion may, but need

          not, designate a new Independent Contractor from the list set forth

          in Exhibit B of this Agreement or may continue to use the same

          Independent Contractor; or in the event said firm does not accept its

          designation as Independent Contractor or accepts said designation and

          subsequently resigns, the Trustee shall designate another entity from

          the list set forth in Exhibit B of this Agreement to be the

          Independent Contractor, provided however, that any Independent

          Contractor appointed by the Trustee shall be independent of the

          Company.  The Company shall pay or reimburse the Trustee for all fees

          and expenses of any Independent Contractor appointed by the Trustee.

          The Company shall indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless for any

          actions or omissions of any Independent Contractor and shall

          indemnify and hold the Independent Contractor harmless for any

          actions or omissions of the Trustee.  The Independent Contractor

          shall be paid for its services on an hourly basis at rates comparable

          to the rates that the Independent Contractor charges for comparable

          services to its other clients.



     3.2  Except for the records dealing solely with the Fund and its

          investment, which shall be maintained by the Trustee, the Independent

          Contractor shall maintain all the Plan Participant records

          
<PAGE>16


          contemplated by this Agreement, including the maintenance of the

          separate Account or Accounts of each Participant under this

          Agreement, the maintenance of the General Account, and the

          maintenance of Participants' interests under each Plan.  All such

          records shall be made available promptly on request of the Trustee or

          the Company.  In the event of a Change In Control, the Independent

          Contractor shall also prepare and distribute Participants' statements

          and shall be responsible for information with respect to payments, if

          any, to Participants and shall perform such other duties and

          responsibilities as the Company or the Trustee determines is

          necessary or advisable to achieve the objectives of this Agreement.



     3.3  Upon the establishment of this Trust or as soon thereafter as

          practicable, the Company shall furnish to the Independent Contractor

          and to the Trustee all of the information necessary to determine the

          benefits payable to or with respect to each Participant in both Plans

          (hereinafter referred to as the "Participant Data").  Notwithstanding

          the occurrence of a Change In Control, the Company shall regularly,

          at least annually, furnish revised updated Participant Data to the

          Independent Contractor.  Based on the foregoing information the

          Independent Contractor shall prepare an annual estimate of the

          accrued benefit for each Participant and its present value under the

          Retirement Plan and shall furnish a copy of same to the Company.  In

          the event the Company refuses or neglects to provide updated

          
<PAGE>17


          Participant information, as contemplated herein, the Independent

          Contractor shall be entitled to rely upon the most recent information

          furnished to it by the Company.



     3.4  Prior to a Change In Control, upon the direction of the Company the

          Independent Contractor shall prepare a certification (a "Benefit

          Certification") to the Trustee that a Participant's benefits under

          either of the Plans have become payable.  Notwithstanding any other

          provisions of this Agreement, after a Change In Control upon the

          proper application of a Participant, the Independent Contractor

          shall, without direction from the Company, prepare a Benefit

          Certification to the Trustee, based upon the most recent Participant

          Data furnished to the Independent Contractor prior to the Change In

          Control and any supplemental information furnished to the Independent

          Contractor by a Participant upon which the Independent Contractor may

          reasonably rely, that a Participant's benefits under either of the

          Plans have become payable.  In the event that the Trustee (a)

          suspends the payment of benefits from the Fund pursuant to Section

          2.1, and (b) pursuant to a court order as required by Section 2.1,

          subsequently resumes all of its duties and responsibilities under

          this Agreement, the Independent Contractor shall prepare a

          certification (an "Accrued Benefit Certification") of all amounts

          that would otherwise have been payable to each Participant from the

          Fund during such period of time as the Trustee suspended the payment

          
<PAGE>18


          of benefits pursuant to Section 2.1.  Each Benefit Certification and

          each Accrued Benefit Certification shall include the amount of such

          benefits, the manner of payment and the name, address and social

          security number of the recipient.  Each Benefit Certification shall

          be updated annually.  The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on any

          Benefit Certification or any Accrued Benefit Certification provided

          by the Independent Contractor, and shall have no duty to verify the

          accuracy thereof.  Upon the receipt of a Benefit Certification or an

          Accrued Benefit Certification and appropriate federal, state and

          local tax withholding information, the Trustee shall commence cash

          distributions from the Trust Fund in accordance therewith to the

          person or persons so indicated and to the Company with respect to

          taxes required to be withheld and the Independent Contractor shall

          charge the Participant's Account established hereunder.  The

          Independent Contractor shall furnish a copy of each Benefit

          Certification and each Accrued Benefit Certification to the

          Participant for which such certification has been prepared.  The

          Company shall have full responsibility for the payment of all

          withholding taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and shall

          furnish each Participant and the Independent Contractor with the

          appropriate tax information form evidencing such payment and the

          amount thereof.

     
<PAGE>19


     3.5  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in

          the event the Trustee in its sole discretion reasonably disagrees

          with the accuracy or propriety of any Benefit Certification or any

          Accrued Benefit Certification, the Trustee, if unable to resolve such

          disagreement with the Independent Contractor, may apply to a court of

          appropriate jurisdiction for judicial review of such Benefit

          Certification or Accrued Benefit Certification.  Pending the

          resolution of any disagreement with the Independent Contractor with

          regard to the accuracy or propriety of any Benefit Certification or

          any Accrued Benefit Certification, the Trustee shall not distribute

          any amount from the Fund pursuant to such Benefit Certification or

          Accrued Benefit Certification.  The Trustee shall use its reasonable

          best efforts to promptly resolve any such disagreement that it may

          have with the Independent Contractor.



     3.6  All benefits payable from the Fund to a Participant under the

          Retirement Plan shall be paid solely from the account of such

          Participant established under such Retirement Plan.  Benefits payable

          under the Compensation Plan shall be paid solely from the account of

          such Participant established under the Compensation Plan.  Upon the

          satisfaction of all Company liabilities under a Plan to a Participant

          for whom an Account has been established hereunder, the Independent

          Contractor shall prepare a certification to the Trustee and to the

          Company showing the balance, if any, remaining in such Participant's

          
<PAGE>20


          Account under the Plan.  Such balance from an Account under the

          Retirement Plan shall be allocated first among Participant accounts

          under the Retirement Plan and, if the liability of the Company to all

          Participants under the Retirement Plan has been satisfied, the

          balance, if any, shall be allocated among the Accounts of

          Participants under the Compensation Plan.  Similarly, any balance

          from an Account under the Compensation Plan shall be allocated first

          among Participant Accounts under the Compensation Plan and, if the

          liability of the Company to all Participants under the Compensation

          Plan has been satisfied, the balance, if any, shall be allocated

          among the Accounts of Participants under the Retirement Plan.  Such

          balance, whether from a Retirement Plan Account or Compensation Plan

          Account, shall be reallocated ratably by the Independent Contractor

          (using the information set forth on the most recent estimated

          benefits statement prepared by the Independent Contractor pursuant to

          Section 3.3) to the Accounts of Participants being continued under

          the Plan (including Accounts which may have previously been reduced

          to a zero balance) in the ratio that liabilities in respect of each

          such Participant under each Plan bear to the total liabilities to all

          such Participants under that Plan.  Upon the satisfaction of all

          liabilities of the Company under both of the Plans to all

          Participants for whom Accounts have been established hereunder, the

          Independent Contractor shall prepare a certification to the Trustee

          and to the Company, and the Trustee upon receipt of such

          
<PAGE>21


          certification shall distribute the Fund in accordance with the

          written instructions of the Company.  The Trustee and the Independent

          Contractor shall have no responsibility for determining whether any

          Participant has died and shall be entitled to rely upon information

          furnished by the Company.

     

     3.7  The Company reserves the right to transfer to the Fund paid-up life

          insurance, retirement income or annuity policies or contracts on or

          for the life of any Participant for whom an Account or Accounts has

          been established hereunder or, prior to a Change In Control, to

          direct the Trustee to purchase any such policies or contracts on or

          for the life of any such Participant out of the amounts allocated to

          his Account.  Any such policy or contract shall be an asset of the

          Fund subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of

          insolvency, as specified in Section 2.1.  The proceeds of any life

          insurance policy shall upon the death of the insured Participant be

          credited to the General Account, except that policies on the life of

          a Participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan shall first be

          applied toward company liabilities to the beneficiary of the

          Participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

     

     3.8  Nothing provided in this Agreement shall relieve the Company of its

          liabilities to pay the benefits provided under the Plans except to

          the extent such liabilities are met by application of Fund assets.

          
<PAGE>22


          It is the intent of the Company to have each Account established

          hereunder treated as a separate trust designed to satisfy in whole or

          in part the Company's legal liability under either of the Plans in

          respect of the Participant for whom such Account has been

          established.  The Company, therefore, agrees that all income,

          deductions and credits of each such Account belong to it as owner for

          income tax purposes and will be included on the Company's income tax

          returns.

     4.1  The Company shall provide the Trustee and the Independent Contractor

          with a certified copy of the Plans and all amendments thereto and of

          the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company approving

          the Plans and all amendments thereto, promptly upon their adoption.

          After the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly

          file with the Trustee and the Independent Contractor a certified list

          of the names and specimen signatures of the directors and officers of

          the Company and any delegee authorized to act for it.  The Company

          shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Independent Contractor of

          the addition or deletion of any person's name to or from such list,

          respectively.  Until receipt by the Trustee and/or the Independent

          Contractor of notice that any person is no longer authorized so to

          act, the Trustee or the Independent Contractor may continue to rely

          on the authority of the person.  All certifications, notices and

          
<PAGE>23


          directions by any such person or persons to the Trustee or the

          Independent Contractor shall be in writing signed by such person or

          such certification, notice or direction purporting to have been

          signed by or on behalf of such person or persons that the Trustee or

          the Independent Contractor believes to have been signed thereby.  The

          Trustee and the Independent Contractor may also rely on any

          certification, notice or direction of the Company that the Trustee or

          the Independent Contractor believes to have been signed by a duly

          authorized officer or agent of the Company.  The Company shall be

          responsible for keeping accurate books and records with respect to

          the outside directors of the Company, their compensation and their

          rights and interests under both of the Plans.

     

     4.2  The Company shall make its contributions to the Trust in accordance

          with appropriate corporate action and the Trustee shall have no

          responsibility with respect thereto, except to add such contributions

          to the Fund.

     

     4.3  The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee for any

          liability or expenses, including without limitation advances for or

          Fund, if it acts in good faith and in accordance with the terms of

          charges, data retrieval and input costs, and charges for time

          compensation for its services as Trustee hereunder, the amount of

          which shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Company and the

          Trustee in writing; provided, however, that if the Trustee forwards

          an amended compensation schedule to the Company requesting its

          agreement thereto and the Company fails to object thereto within

          thirty (30) days of its receipt, the amended compensation schedule

          shall be deemed to be agreed upon by the Company and the Trustee.

          Such expenses and compensation shall be a charge on the Fund and

          shall constitute a lien in favor of the Trustee until paid by the

          Company.  All such expenses and compensation charged to the Fund,

          unless otherwise paid by the Company, shall be applied against the

          General Account.  In the event that the assets allocated to the

          General Account are entirely depleted, all such expenses and

          compensation charged to the Fund shall be applied pro-rata against

          all Accounts in proportion to the assets allocated thereto.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.2, to the

          extent that the Trustee, in its discretion, decides that an expense

          is specifically attributable to one or more specified Accounts such

          expense shall be charged to such specified Accounts in such

          proportion as the Trustee decides.  Prior to allocating any

          particular expense to a specific Account, the Trustee shall provide

          notice of its intention to so allocate to the Company, the

          Independent Contractor and the Participant for whom such Account was

          established.

          Trustee with respect to the Fund shall be open to inspection by the

          Company, or its representatives, at all reasonable times during

          normal business hours of the Trustee and may be audited not more

          frequently than once each fiscal year by an independent certified

          hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and deliver to the Company a

          period from the close of the last fiscal year or last statement

          period to the termination of the Trustee's duties, respectively,

          a statement of the then current value of each Account and of the

          General Account.  Any such statement shall be deemed an account

          shall be relieved and discharged, as if such account had been settled

          and allowed by a judgment or decree of a court of competent

          jurisdiction, unless protested by written notice to the Trustee

          within sixty (60) days of receipt thereof by the Company.

     

     The Trustee shall have the right to apply at any time to a court of

competent jurisdiction for judicial settlement of any account of the Trustee

not previously settled as herein provided or for the determination of any

question of construction or for instructions regarding this Agreement.  In any

such action or proceeding it shall be necessary to join as parties only the

Trustee and the Company (although the Trustee may also join such other parties

be conclusive.

     8.1  Prior to a Change In Control the Trustee may resign at any time by

          delivering written notice thereof to the Company; provided, however,

          that no such resignation shall take effect until the earlier of (i)

          sixty (60) days from the date of delivery of such notice to the

          
<PAGE>34


          Company or (ii) the appointment of a successor trustee.  Following a

          Change In Control, the Trustee may resign only under one of the

          following circumstances:

          (a)  The Trustee is no longer in the business, or is actively in the

               process of removing itself from the business, of acting as

               trustee for employee benefit plans.

          (b) The Trustee determines that a conflict of interest exists which

              would prohibit it from fulfilling its duties under this Agreement

              in an ethically proper manner, and a law firm (appointed by the

              President of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,

              or by the American Arbitration Association, if the President of

              the Association of the Bar of the City of New York fails to so

              appoint within thirty days of a request for such appointment, or

              notifies the Trustee that it is unable to make such appointment)

              concurs with the Trustee.  The Trustee shall use its best efforts

              to avoid the creation of such a conflict.  The decision of such

              law firm shall be binding, but may be appealed in the same

              manner, and under the same conditions, as if it were made by an

              arbitrator.  All costs incurred by the Trustee in connection with

              obtaining or appealing such a decision shall be reimbursable

              expenses pursuant to Article VI hereof.

          (c)  The assets of the Fund have been exhausted or are insufficient

          to pay accrued and reasonably anticipated fees and expenses of the

          
<PAGE>35


          Trustee hereunder, the Company has refused voluntarily to pay the

          Trustee's accrued fees and expenses as required pursuant to Section

          6.2 and the Trustee has been unsuccessful in obtaining a court order

          requiring the Company to make such payments or has been unable to

          collect on a judgment for such fees and expenses.



     Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may resign for reasons set forth in

(a) or (b) only if it has obtained the agreement of a bank with assets in

excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100 million to replace it as

trustee under the terms of this Agreement.  The decision rendered under (b), if

that is the reason for the Trustee's resignation, may expressly excuse the

Trustee from this requirement.  In any event, the Trustee shall continue to be

custodian of the Trust assets until the new trustee is in place, and the

Trustee shall be entitled to expenses and fees through the later of the

effective date of its resignation as Trustee and the end of its custodianship

of the assets of the Fund.



     8.2  Prior to a Change In Control the Trustee may be removed at any time

          by the Company, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of

          the Company, upon delivery to the Trustee of a certified copy of such

          resolution and sixty (60) days' written notice of such removal,

          unless such notice period is waived in whole or in part by the

          Trustee.  Following a Change In Control the Trustee may be removed at

          
<PAGE>36


          any time by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Participants

          voting on a per capita basis who were Participants in either of the

          Plans on the date of the occurrence of the Change In Control, and

          sixty (60) days' written notice of such removal, unless such notice

          period is waived in whole or in part by the Trustee.

     

     8.3  Upon the resignation or removal of the Trustee, U.S. Trust Company

          shall be appointed as successor trustee.  In the event that U.S.

          Trust Company refuses to accept its appointment as successor trustee

          pursuant to this Section 8.3, Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. shall be

          appointed as successor trustee.  In the event that Chase Manhattan

          Bank, N.A. refuses to accept its appointment as successor trustee

          pursuant to this Section 8.3, a successor trustee shall be appointed

          pursuant to Section 8.4.  The appointment of a successor trustee

          pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall take effect upon the delivery to

          the Trustee of a written acceptance by such successor trustee, duly

          executed thereby.  Any successor trustee shall have all the rights,

          powers and duties granted the Trustee hereunder.

     

     8.4  Subject to the provisions of Section 8.3, prior to a Change In

          Control, upon the resignation or removal of the Trustee, a successor

          trustee shall be appointed by the Company.  Subject to the provisions

          
<PAGE>37


          of Section 8.3, following a Change In Control, upon the resignation

          of the Trustee, a successor trustee shall be appointed by the

          Trustee, and upon the removal of the Trustee a successor trustee

          shall be appointed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the

          Participants voting on a per capita basis who were Participants in

          either of the Plans on the date of the occurrence of the Change In

          Control.  Any successor trustee appointed under this Section 8.4

          shall be chosen from the list of potential successor trustees set

          forth in Exhibit C.  In the event that all of the potential successor

          trustees set forth in Exhibit C refuse to accept an appointment as

          successor trustee, then the successor trustee shall be appointed as

          otherwise provided in this Section 8.4, and shall be a bank or trust

          company established under the laws of the United States or a State

          within the United States with assets in excess of $2 billion and net

          worth in excess of $100 million.  The appointment of a successor

          trustee pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall take effect upon the

          delivery to the Trustee of (a) a written appointment of such

          successor trustee, duly executed by the Company, the Trustee, or two-

          thirds of the Participants in the Plans, as provided for in this

          Section 8.4, and (b) a written acceptance by such successor trustee,

          duly executed thereby.  Any successor trustee shall have all the

          rights, powers and duties granted the Trustee hereunder.



     8.5  If, within sixty (60) days of the delivery of the Trustee's written

          notice of resignation, a successor trustee shall not have been

          appointed, the Trustee may apply to any court of competent

          jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

     
<PAGE>38


     8.6  Upon the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the appointment of

     a successor trustee, and after the acceptance and approval of its account,

     the Trustee shall transfer and deliver the Fund to such successor.  Under

     no circumstances shall the Trustee transfer or deliver the Fund to any

     successor which is not a bank or trust company established under the laws

     of the United States or a State within the United States with assets in

     excess of $2 billion and net worth in excess of $100 million.



                                  ARTICLE IX
                                  __________



     9.1  Prior to a Change In Control, the Trust established pursuant to this

          Agreement may only be terminated by the affirmative vote of two-

          thirds of the Participants in either of the Plans voting on a per

          capita basis.  Following a Change In Control, the Trust established

          pursuant to this Agreement may not be terminated by the Company prior

          to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to all

          Participants in both of the Plans.  Following a Change In Control,

          upon receipt of a written certification from the Independent

          Contractor that all liabilities have been satisfied with respect to

          all Participants in both of the Plans, the Company pursuant to a

          
<PAGE>39


          resolution of its Board of Directors may terminate the Trust upon

          delivery to the Trustee of (a) a certified copy of such resolution,

          (b) an original certification of the Independent Contractor that all

          such liabilities have been satisfied and (c) a written instrument of

          termination duly executed and acknowledged in the same form as this

          Agreement.



     9.2  Upon the termination of the Trust in accordance with Section 9.1, the

          Trustee shall, after the acceptance and approval of its account,

          distribute the Fund to the Company.  Upon completing such

          distribution, the Trustee shall be relieved and discharged.  The

          powers of the Trustee shall continue as long as any part of the Fund

          remains in its possession.



                                   ARTICLE X
                                   _________

     10.1 This Agreement may be amended, in whole or in part, at any time and

     from time to time, by the Company, pursuant to a resolution of the Board

     of Directors thereof by delivery to the Trustee of a certified copy of

     such resolution and a written instrument duly executed and acknowledged in

     the same form as this Agreement, except that the duties and

     responsibilities of the Trustee shall not be increased without the

     Trustee's written consent; provided, however, any such amendment affecting

     any Account or the procedures for distribution thereof shall not become

     effective until sixty (60) days after a copy of such amendment has been

     
<PAGE>40


     delivered by registered mail by the Company or the Independent Contractor

     to each Participant for whom an Account is maintained under this

     Agreement.  In the event the Company, Trustee or Independent Contractor

     receives written objections to such amendment from such person within such

     sixty (60) day period, such amendment shall be ineffective and void in

     respect of the Participant so objecting to the amendment.



                                  ARTICLE XI
                                  __________

                                       

     11.1 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted under, and the

     Trust hereby created shall be governed by, the laws of the State of New

     York insofar as such laws do not contravene any applicable Federal laws,

     rules or regulations.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to

     subject either the Trust created hereunder or the Plans to the Employee

     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.



     11.2 Neither the gender nor the number (singular or plural) of any word

     shall be construed to exclude another gender or number when a different

     gender or number would be appropriate.



     11.3 No right or interest of any Participant under either of the Plans in

     the Fund shall be transferable or assignable or shall be subject to

     alienation, anticipation or encumbrance, and no right or interest of any

     
<PAGE>41


     Participant in either of the Plans or in the Fund shall be subject to any

     garnishment, attachment or execution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

     Fund shall at all times remain subject to claims of creditors of the

     Company in the event the Company becomes insolvent as provided in Section

     2.1.



     11.4 The Company agrees that by the establishment of this Trust it hereby

     foregoes any judicial review of certifications by the Independent

     Contractor as to the benefit payable to any persons hereunder.  If a

     dispute arises as to the amounts or timing of any such benefits or the

     persons entitled thereto under the Plans or this Agreement, the Company

     agrees that such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration

     proceedings initiated in accordance with the rules of the American

     Arbitration Association and that the results of such proceedings shall be

     conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial review.  It is expressly

     understood that pending the resolution of any such dispute payment of

     benefits shall be made and continued by the Trustee in accordance with the

     certification of the Independent Contractor and that the Trustee and the

     Independent Contractor shall have no liability with respect to such

     payments.  Provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 11.4 are

     subject to the provisions of Section 3.5.  The Company also agrees to pay

     
<PAGE>42


     the entire cost of any arbitration or legal proceeding initiated by it

     including the legal fees of the Trustee, the Independent Contractor and

     the Plan Participant regardless of the outcome of any such proceeding and

     until so paid the expenses thereof shall be a charge on and lien against

     the Fund.



     11.5 This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any

     successor to the Company or its business as the result of merger,

     consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or otherwise and any

     subsequent successor thereto.  In the event of any such merger,

     consolidation, reorganization, transfer of assets or other similar

     transaction, the successor to the Company or its business or any

     subsequent successor thereto shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing

     of its successorship and furnish the Trustee and the Independent

     Contractor with the information specified in Section 4.1 of this

     Agreement.  In no event shall any such transaction described herein

     suspend or delay the rights of Plan Participants to receive benefits

     hereunder.



     11.6 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of

     which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall together

     constitute only one Agreement.



     11.7 Communications to the Trustee shall be sent to it at its office at

     450 West 33rd Street, New York, New York  10001, or to such other address

     as the Trustee may specify in writing.  No communication shall be binding

     upon the Trustee until it is received by the Trustee.  Communications to

     
<PAGE>43


     the Company shall be sent to the Company's principal offices or to such

     other address as the Company may specify in writing.



     11.8 In the event any Participant is determined to be subject to Federal

     income tax on any amount to the credit of any Account under this Agreement

     prior to the time of payment hereunder, the entire amount determined to be

     so taxable shall be distributed by the Trustee to such Participant.  An

     amount to the credit of a Participant's Account or Accounts shall be

     determined to be subject to Federal income tax upon the earliest of:  (a)

     a final determination by the United States Internal Revenue Service

     addressed to the Participant which is not appealed to the courts; (b) a

     final determination by the United States Tax Court or any other Federal

     Court affirming any such determination by the Internal Revenue Service; or

     (c) an opinion by counsel chosen by the Company addressed to the Company

     and the Trustee, that, by reason of Treasury Regulations, amendments to

     the Internal Revenue Code, published Internal Revenue Service rulings,

     court decisions or other substantial precedent, amounts to the credit of

     Participant's Accounts hereunder are subject to Federal income tax prior

     to payment.  The Company shall undertake to defend, and bear the expense

     of, any tax claims described herein which are asserted by the Internal

     Revenue Service or by any taxing authority of any State or locality or by

     any court.  The Company agrees to reimburse any Participant or his spouse

     for any interest or penalties in respect of Federal, state or local tax

     claims hereunder upon receipt of documentation of same.  Any distributions

     
<PAGE>44


     from the Trust Fund to a Participant under this Section 11.8 shall be

     applied in an equitable manner to reduce Company liabilities to such

     Participant under the Plans; provided, however, that in no event shall any

     Participant or estate of any Participant have any obligation to return all

     or any part of such distribution to the Company if such distribution

     exceeds benefits payable under the Plans.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Trust Agreement to

be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereto affixed this

1st day of March 1994.

                                   _________

     Amendment, effective January 23, 1996, to Trust Agreement dated March 1,
1994, among USLIFE Corporation, Chemical Bank and KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (as
Independent Contractor) establishing a trust to fund the USLIFE Corporation
Retirement Plan for Outside Directors and the USLIFE Corporation Deferred
Compensation Plan for outside directors.

     In accordance with the provisions contained in Section 10.1 of the
Agreement, the language in Section 2.3(d) (iv) is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following language:

     "Change In Control" means (i) a merger or consolidation to which the
     Company is a party and for which the approval of any shareholders of the
     Company is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
     13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
     becoming the beneficial owner, directly, or indirectly, of securities of
     the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
     Company's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
     substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a liquidation or
     reorganization of the Company; or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over
     Transaction or Event, as defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and
     Restated Rights Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the
     occurrence of any such transaction or event that otherwise would have
     previously been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.  Provided,
     however, that an event described above shall not constitute a Change In
     Control if within 10 days of such event the Continuing Directors provide
     the Trustee with a resolution expressly stating that such event shall not
     constitute a Change In Control for the purpose of the Agreement.

                                _______________


     Amendment, effective January 23, 1996, to Trust Agreement dated December
6, 1990, among USLIFE Corporation, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company
(predecessor to Chemical Bank), and KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (as Independent
Contractor) establishing a trust to fund the USLIFE Corporation Retirement
Plan.

     In accordance with the provisions contained in Section 10.1 of the
Agreement, the language in Section 2.3(d) (iv) is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following language:

     "Change In Control" means (i) a merger or consolidation to which the
     Company is a party and for which the approval of any shareholders of the
     Company is required; (ii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections
     13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
     becoming the beneficial owner, directly, or indirectly, of securities of
     the Company representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the
     Company's then outstanding securities; (iii) a sale or transfer of
     substantially all of the assets of the Company; (iv) a liquidation or
     reorganization of the Company; or (v) the occurrence of any Flip Over
     Transaction or Event, as defined in Section 1.1(j) of the Amended and
     Restated Rights Agreement, as amended from time to time prior to the
     occurrence of any such transaction or event that otherwise would have
     previously been considered a Flip Over Transaction or Event.  Provided,
     however, that an event described above shall not constitute a Change In
     Control if within 10 days of such event the Continuing Directors provide
     the Trustee with a resolution expressly stating that such event shall not
     constitute a Change In Control for the purpose of the Agreement.
